00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen on this warm 46 degree
00:39 fahrenheit evening
00:42 tonight we're going to talk about deja
00:43 vu
00:46 and if for you og listeners you know
00:49 we've talked about it several times
00:51 but only just here and there inside
00:53 other episodes and i thought man
00:56 there's something to this now there's
00:59 two other conditions we're going to talk
01:01 about related to deja vu directly which
01:03 is
01:04 presque vu and uh jambevu
01:10 and then we're going to talk about deja
01:12 vu versus premonitions
01:15 i do apologize to the og listeners i'm
01:17 have to tell two of my own personal
01:18 stories twice
01:20 again to integrate it into this when we
01:22 get to the
01:24 premonition side of things deja vu
01:30 well my journey with this
01:33 is definitely having had several deja
01:37 vus
01:37 i still get it to this day apparently
01:40 you're not supposed to get deja vu
01:41 after your 20s
01:44 but i get it my friends get it and so
01:47 it's very interesting
01:49 the matrix is just glitchy man
01:52 so let's just review deja vu
01:56 deja vu is the phenomenon of
01:59 feeling like you've usually
02:02 experienced the experience you're just
02:04 having at that exact moment
02:07 before every single element of an
02:09 experience seems familiar
02:11 and what i i'm sure the scientists
02:15 track this but i don't hear layman
02:17 tracking this so i want to kind of
02:18 upgrade
02:20 what that means if you walk into a room
02:24 because the deja vu has a trigger that's
02:26 an interesting thing
02:28 when we're going to get into the quote
02:30 unquote scientific explanations of deja
02:32 vu
02:33 for me it is seeing something
02:36 it is someone saying something it could
02:38 even be smelling something
02:42 now smelling familiarity is not to be
02:44 confused with deja vu
02:46 familiarity because deja vu is a very
02:50 for me personally i'm sure we have
02:53 similarities in this
02:54 it is when the bubble of existence that
02:57 you are in
02:58 feels like an entire repeat everything
03:01 even though we can't speak quick enough
03:04 to itemize the list of things that feel
03:06 familiar
03:07 there is a ridiculous level of almost
03:09 absolute familiarity with everything
03:12 from you know well i put this way a
03:14 friend of mine
03:16 is truly autistic he has three
03:18 consciousness at one time
03:21 when i was able and he's fully
03:22 functional human being for a bit like
03:24 rain man the real autism
03:25 not the vaccine brain damage autism you
03:28 [ __ ] snowflakes can go
03:30 and turn off the episode he said he had
03:33 two
03:34 processors two consciousness that he
03:37 doesn't really need
03:38 and so what he does is he said i'll
03:41 study your face which can get a little
03:43 personal feeling but he goes i kind of
03:45 figured out how not to make it feel
03:46 personal
03:47 but the rest of me is like counting
03:49 everything in the room sometimes if i
03:51 have an algorithm because he was a
03:53 amazing amazing programmer to this day
03:55 he would be solving some problem in the
03:57 background
03:58 if we had even one processor like that
04:02 that moved perhaps a thousand times
04:05 faster than our consciousness
04:06 and we could even just pause time in the
04:09 matrix for a split second and then
04:10 itemize what feels familiar
04:13 it is overwhelmingly more in my opinion
04:17 than just the visual cortex
04:19 getting a little bit behind in the
04:21 tracking of memory versus recall
04:24 now just very shortly because it's not
04:26 that interesting
04:28 presque vu is the thing that we all
04:32 call the tip of the tongue thing a great
04:35 little video that goes through
04:37 some of the chambers of the brain it's
04:39 not going to be extensively more than
04:40 this
04:41 will be the vsauce episode on deja vu
04:44 which really got me to think about oh my
04:45 gosh you know i've mentioned this
04:46 several times
04:48 it's just this wild anomaly we're
04:49 obviously going to go deep into it
04:51 and not just talk about some of the
04:52 basics but preschool is when you're
04:55 trying to recall that name
04:57 the current definition of press give in
04:59 terms of its cause is that you are going
05:01 for
05:02 a particular word and for whatever
05:04 reason this is a ridiculous definition
05:05 in my opinion
05:06 you have a lot of other words in your
05:08 mind that are blocking the one that you
05:09 want like your brain is trying to push
05:11 every word
05:12 up to the front of your brain that's
05:14 sort of physically
05:16 phonetically similar to the other name
05:18 or word or whatever you're looking for
05:20 and so you get confused i will tell you
05:24 and if i had a gun to my head i will
05:26 stick with my definite
05:27 definition of press give which is fight
05:29 or flight
05:31 you go into a
05:34 situation where you really want to
05:36 recall somebody's name
05:38 for me i have problems with very
05:41 specific people's names
05:42 it is the jamie lee curtis for whatever
05:44 reason i had a hell of a time ever
05:45 remembering her name
05:46 robert duvall i was doing an episode the
05:48 other day i couldn't remember his name
05:49 when i was talking about thx
05:51 so strange these are kind of interesting
05:53 names
05:55 i just had to think for a second marlon
05:56 brando is another one i just
05:58 have a hard time remembering his name
06:00 but what
06:01 in my opinion it is is that you're going
06:03 for a word
06:04 or something subject matter to recall
06:07 and you start to get afraid
06:09 that you're not going to remember it
06:12 because
06:13 we are told so much crap about how our
06:16 brain
06:17 atrophies as we get older it does
06:19 atrophy as we get older but obviously
06:21 it atrophies if you don't use it
06:24 once you have a an older friend over 70
06:27 who uses their brain to solve
06:29 problems like thought problems not just
06:33 art problems
06:34 and that kind of stuff not just picking
06:36 oh gosh what colors am i going to pick
06:38 that's not solving a problem but
06:39 really doing what we do on this show
06:41 challenging your brain
06:44 your press giveaway is going to be very
06:46 limited
06:47 in my opinion i don't know why i have
06:51 blocks with those names i just mentioned
06:55 the other one is jammevu which is that
06:58 you
07:00 sort of think that you're
07:03 experiencing imposters
07:06 it's almost uh and i've actually heard
07:07 it described in a different
07:09 source as you've never experienced what
07:13 you're experiencing before
07:14 in a really weird profound way but the
07:16 more modern definition
07:18 is you could be with your loved one and
07:21 for whatever reason they just feel like
07:23 a
07:23 like a replicant of your loved one
07:27 a more gentle way of talking about
07:29 shammivu
07:30 is that little thing they did in um
07:34 i think it was black sheep with david
07:37 spade and chris farley where they
07:39 started they got really high
07:41 in a car which i think was nitro
07:43 canister in the back of their supercar
07:45 got
07:46 loose a wire got loose and they were
07:48 driving seven down the
07:50 highway and they got pulled over and
07:52 they're high as a kite
07:54 and the guys was talking to him and they
07:55 started repeating the word limit
07:58 i think that was the word but any word
08:00 that you sit there and repeat and repeat
08:02 and repeat
08:03 sometimes they can start to visually
08:05 look like just
08:06 gobbly goop like it doesn't seem strange
08:08 it doesn't seem like
08:09 it fits inside your your mind
08:13 your mind's experience or just
08:16 it doesn't sound like anything just
08:17 sounds like you're making baby noises
08:20 it's a really interesting thing now
08:22 what's really weird about it is
08:24 people will lament about that particular
08:26 definition about saying a word over and
08:28 over again
08:29 there are other regions of the mind that
08:31 behave exactly the same
08:34 drink alcohol every day and it will soon
08:37 stop making you high
08:41 do a drug every day and it will cease to
08:44 have the effect it has on you
08:47 it's and and smell smells the other big
08:49 one that's very much like jean-michel
08:51 which is the old story of
08:55 the bear chasing the rabbit the rabbit
08:58 will run into something like a rose
09:00 garden
09:01 or rose bush or something like that the
09:04 bear all of a sudden can't smell
09:06 the rabbit until about three to five
09:09 minutes passes
09:11 and then this the smell of the rose is
09:12 cancelled in the brain of
09:14 the bear and he all of a sudden can
09:16 smell the rabbit again
09:17 and the chase is on thank god we have
09:21 that ability because
09:22 public bathrooms would be gnarly
09:25 but deja vu now we all
09:28 have seen the most brilliant scene
09:31 regarding deja vu in our world in world
09:33 history in the in the last
09:35 21 years which is the scene where neo
09:38 in the matrix looks down a staircase and
09:43 sees a black cat walk by the door
09:45 and me allen do a specific move and then
09:47 he somehow looks again and it does it
09:49 again and he says oh wow deja vu
09:51 and they said oh you know i forgot his
09:53 girlfriend's name but she's like
09:55 where what'd you see and they're all
09:56 like oh crap glitch in the system
09:59 essentially meaning what is it the mr
10:01 smith agent guy
10:02 is uh on their ass and he's changing
10:05 things and he's trying to find them
10:08 just brilliant i mean it's the cleanest
10:11 fun
10:11 anyone's ever had with the definition of
10:13 deja vu ever
10:16 so there's scientists that study deja vu
10:20 and their experience
10:23 and we have to respect the fact that
10:25 this is what they see
10:27 is that obviously deja vu is extremely
10:29 difficult to induce now they're
10:32 experimenting with hypnosis to try and
10:34 kick-start it
10:36 they say essentially that you gain deja
10:39 vu
10:41 as a child around eight or nine years
10:42 old it thrives in your teens and it
10:45 thrives in your 20s
10:47 and then apparently in the research
10:51 it tends to fade away after you hit 30.
10:55 now again i don't think anyone would
10:57 probably say they have deja vu a lot if
10:59 you do
11:00 and you should enter one of these
11:01 laboratories and let them work on you
11:04 now i in the 90s like i said several
11:07 times
11:08 i i belonged to
11:11 two book clubs back in the day one was
11:13 scientific
11:14 electronics cosmology and the other one
11:16 was psychology
11:17 and the human mind anatomy and i used to
11:20 just devour books i
11:22 and i donated so many of my books like
11:24 probably 90 of my books
11:26 back to libraries and things but i kept
11:27 one book
11:30 and it had a very tiny definition in it
11:32 for deja vu
11:34 and it talks about many seizures
11:37 and the mind tend to precede
11:40 the act of deja vu which again because
11:44 nobody knows when that's going to occur
11:46 i'm not sure how they track those two
11:48 together
11:50 apparently epileptics will have slightly
11:53 more
11:54 experiences of deja vu if they're
11:56 inclined to have deja vu
11:59 that makes sense if the other definition
12:00 is true as well
12:03 now when i read that what i didn't see
12:06 until recently when i
12:07 redid research and vsauce has it in his
12:10 videos too he's a great channel by the
12:11 way
12:13 and again i'll just disclaimer he's very
12:15 official science
12:17 but he's always in some eclectic little
12:19 things so he doesn't really run off
12:21 with things that are aggravating most
12:24 the time
12:26 so i started you know for gosh i guess
12:28 at least 30 years i've been thinking
12:29 about this definition of many seizures
12:33 causing a deja vu but they didn't talk
12:35 about much about the
12:37 path through the brain that your
12:40 consciousness
12:40 uses to give you the sense that you're
12:44 awake and alive now we have
12:48 in various etheral episodes i think it's
12:51 projecting ether i think was one of the
12:52 episodes where i talked about the shape
12:54 of your skull is extremely
12:55 important to gathering frequencies but
12:59 also
13:00 transmitting frequencies out of your
13:01 brain is a very acoustic design
13:05 one we speak in phonetic language and so
13:09 when the homo sapien sapien was
13:11 engineered
13:12 we left the hominid bloodline
13:17 and we gained a super complex brain just
13:20 in one shot there's no evolution between
13:22 a hominid skull
13:24 like a yeti and us there's no evolution
13:28 from a monkey or an ape to us
13:30 there really isn't we got skulls before
13:33 the missing link and after the missing
13:35 link which
13:36 according to official science is 150
13:38 million years approximately
13:40 but suddenly suddenly we show up
13:44 and we are really amazingly engineered
13:49 so you know that we take in data
13:52 from all different senses far more than
13:56 five
13:58 and it has to get you know recorded
14:01 that it occurred such that we can
14:03 experience it in consciousness
14:07 and then we know that there's a memory
14:08 process that happens
14:11 and then when we talk about it
14:13 experience it again there's a there's
14:15 some sort of chemical
14:16 signature in the brain that lets us know
14:18 this is a memory
14:20 one of the greatest things you can do to
14:22 kind of test this in your own mind is to
14:24 think back to something when you were
14:26 younger that made you feel wonderful a
14:29 toy
14:30 a time of year going down to the
14:32 christmas tree when
14:33 everything imaginative was real
14:38 and you'll have that feeling it doesn't
14:40 always have to be nostalgic
14:42 obviously memories can be bad and you'll
14:44 have the same chemical
14:46 reaction but why not think of a good one
14:49 so what the scientists have done for
14:51 deja vu is
14:53 create a fairly and maybe this is just
14:55 for the sake of explanation and not one
14:57 of
14:58 the true definition that they adhere to
15:02 but they really focus on the visual
15:04 cortex
15:07 so they track the path from
15:10 light information hitting your rods and
15:12 cones swinging back to the back of your
15:14 brain
15:15 the occipital lobe where your visual
15:17 cortex is
15:18 everything goes inside your mind and
15:20 then there's other little chambers of
15:22 the brain
15:23 that are responsible for processing
15:26 your reality at a particular level at
15:29 least
15:30 as we think today now on this particular
15:34 show
15:35 with your humble host talking to you
15:36 here i think the brain is merely a proxy
15:40 to what we might call your soul
15:43 again when i say soul the problem is
15:46 you'll think of a religious
15:47 paradigm and maybe reject the whole
15:49 thing because you don't want to be
15:50 lectured about religion
15:52 it has nothing to do with religion at
15:55 all
15:56 if i say spirit well then you might be
15:58 thinking about more paranormal stuff
16:01 or native american things and then you
16:04 may have resistance because of some
16:05 other paradigm
16:06 don't let any paradigm mess with you
16:09 you are something other than this
16:13 this meat bag we call a human body
16:17 what's really interesting about it is
16:19 that we now have
16:22 and i've been going through this san
16:24 francisco show called
16:25 computer chronicles if any of you have
16:28 been in computers for a long time and
16:30 you just want to go back in time and see
16:32 stuff man it's just a treat man they
16:34 they review the atari's 2600 and all
16:36 these video games but one of the
16:38 interesting things that applies to this
16:40 show
16:42 is the development of storage devices
16:45 from giant floppies to little floppies
16:49 to five inch hard well the big drum hard
16:51 drives down to
16:53 five five it was a five and a half inch
16:55 drives to little three and a half inch
16:57 drives
16:58 now we're done ssd sticks and all this
17:00 other kind of stuff
17:02 and so we we have at least an
17:05 approximation in our mind
17:08 regarding the amount of atomic mass
17:12 required to store information
17:17 and one of the things that i think is
17:18 going to develop over the next hundred
17:20 years
17:21 is as they more precisely track
17:24 the movement of the atomic mass that
17:27 makes up your mind your sorry your brain
17:29 i should say
17:30 not your mind your mind is the byproduct
17:33 of these
17:34 things coming together we will be able
17:37 to
17:37 probably prove beyond the shadow of a
17:39 doubt that a soul exists
17:41 simply by deduction to say
17:44 there is no ssd inside the human mind
17:50 it's interesting if you have a bad
17:52 memory you could probably fit your whole
17:53 life on a cell phone
17:55 but the second you have a photographic
17:58 memory the database is so utterly
18:01 gigantic
18:03 that it doesn't make any sense to be
18:05 stored in cellular tissue
18:07 because let's just look at it
18:11 when you are dealing with the storage
18:12 device in our world
18:14 as of the 21st century early 21st
18:16 century
18:18 we have to store binary data bits on a
18:22 drive
18:22 and then we have to have very quick
18:25 precise
18:25 and i mean utterly precise techniques of
18:29 recalling that data touching the data
18:31 with an electromagnetic head
18:33 to figure out whether or not the charge
18:34 is a one or a zero
18:37 okay so where is this access point in
18:39 the cellular cellular tissue of a brain
18:43 it's not enough just to say well we
18:44 haven't discovered it yet well really
18:46 what part of a brain
18:47 have we not scanned at the atomic level
18:51 and where is it in the mitochondria of a
18:54 human cell
18:55 that you would have all this stuff
18:56 stored
18:58 it makes instant sense to say it is in a
19:01 dimension of reality
19:02 that we cannot sense just yet
19:06 perhaps at some point we will find at
19:09 least the
19:10 the artery the ethernet cable
19:13 touch point which is probably your
19:16 pineal gland
19:18 where that data is being accessed and we
19:20 might be able just to see
19:22 some cellular tissue oscillating as data
19:25 is coming in and out but
19:27 this the tissue itself is acting as a
19:29 medium for
19:30 reconstructing this
19:33 this past consciousness
19:36 this the state of the memory right if i
19:39 said hey what was it like when you first
19:41 rode a bike
19:42 well in a very one-dimensional answer
19:44 you might say oh i was seven
19:46 that's it well okay where were you oh i
19:49 don't know anything about yeah i was in
19:50 front of my house i was on the left side
19:52 who was there who was actually helping
19:54 you learn to ride the bike
19:55 and who was watching you at the time and
19:58 how did it make you feel
20:00 that freedom when the bike bounces man
20:02 it's like you
20:03 for the first time as a child you have
20:05 the sense that you could be magellan
20:07 in your neighborhood you can ride around
20:09 the block man there's nothing more
20:10 powerful than that
20:13 and that will repeat over and over in
20:14 your lifetime
20:16 until you sort of reach an area of your
20:19 life where all of the
20:20 freedom zones have been conquered and as
20:22 an example when you drive a car for the
20:24 first time and get your license
20:26 when you leave the home for the first
20:28 time you get your first apartment
20:30 and you buy your first ironing board man
20:33 you know you've made it to the promised
20:34 land
20:35 you share your life with someone else
20:36 you create a child i mean these little
20:38 moments and eventually you've done
20:39 pretty much all the big stuff
20:42 except self enlightenment which is what
20:44 we're trying to do on the show
20:46 until the day we die so again most of
20:49 the explanations have to do with the
20:51 chronology
20:52 of the consciousness experiencing
20:54 something and the subconscious
20:56 which is your little processor in the
20:58 background going to the database in the
21:00 universe to recall
21:02 as many elements of your senses to
21:05 reconstruct
21:07 what it is that a memory is made out of
21:10 the christopher walken natalie wood
21:11 movie brainstorm is a very interesting
21:15 fictional story that also
21:18 should be in your mind when we're
21:20 talking about these kind of things if
21:21 you haven't seen it
21:22 again great movie go see it chris
21:25 watkins amazing natalie wood's last
21:26 movie and it's phenomenal
21:30 ratchet's in there too man she's a good
21:31 lady at this one
21:34 always cranky though but they built a
21:37 machine they could record your five
21:39 senses
21:40 and then i could sit here on this patio
21:42 record myself doing a show
21:44 give you the tape and you would feel
21:46 every single thing that i'm feeling
21:49 the reason why i bring that up is that
21:51 it is a
21:52 philosophical device that does
21:55 essentially what we're talking about
21:57 right now
21:58 but of course i think what would
22:01 probably occur is
22:02 we'd make this and we'd accurately
22:04 record five senses
22:06 and even when we play it back to
22:07 ourselves knowing what it was like to
22:09 experience
22:10 in the first place we would probably
22:13 have a situation where
22:17 something's missing and then we'd be
22:21 off to explore what part of our sense
22:23 table
22:24 we are unaware of that really completes
22:27 the picture
22:28 now what's interesting about deja vu for
22:30 me when it occurs is that you
22:32 tend to feel like something's
22:36 enchanting and interesting and strange
22:39 at the time you recall
22:41 having been there before now some of it
22:44 might be
22:45 one of these experiences where you you
22:47 think well it's just a
22:48 it's just a weird situation to walk in a
22:51 place that you know you've never been
22:52 before but all of a sudden you've been
22:54 there
22:55 and that's only one type of deja vu the
22:58 one that happens to me
23:00 is that i am in a very familiar place
23:01 i've been there many many times
23:03 and all it is is that i start to see the
23:07 future
23:08 in little i'd say quarter second
23:11 intervals before they occur
23:13 now someone could argue that that is
23:15 merely an illusion that i'm feeling that
23:18 but i'm going to get to some premonition
23:20 stuff that i experienced which felt
23:21 exactly
23:22 like deja vu but i was able to beat it
23:24 with my mouth
23:25 and tell people what was going to occur
23:29 and vsauce came up with something that i
23:31 didn't
23:32 know about but i've talked about it on
23:34 the show
23:36 i mentioned many years ago probably i
23:39 guess
23:40 potentially three years ago during my
23:43 led startup
23:46 my partner and investor at the time
23:51 he was very he is just a very
23:53 inquisitive amazing guy
23:56 and he said you know he wanted us to do
23:58 an experiment where we shut our eyes at
23:59 the table within our laboratory
24:02 which was the same warehouse where the
24:03 oculus was invented before i got
24:05 purchased
24:07 it was like this deep military location
24:09 working on drone swarming and all kinds
24:11 of wild stuff
24:13 but during this experiment i mentioned
24:16 it to you guys right after
24:18 it happened we closed our eyes
24:21 and what was interesting is is that
24:23 things were developing in the room
24:24 around us
24:26 while we had our eyes closed and there
24:28 was just an amazing ability to see the
24:30 room with our eyes closed and i mean
24:31 really see it almost as if we didn't
24:33 close our eyes
24:35 but how many times do you close your
24:37 eyes on purpose while you're awake
24:40 to simply do it like a little trick or a
24:42 little experiment where someone tells
24:43 you okay close your eyes man i'm gonna
24:45 do something to you right
24:46 and when you're in a youtube video where
24:49 someone's gonna punch you in the face or
24:50 whatever
24:51 you're not gonna have this experience
24:52 because you're not in some meditative
24:54 state
24:56 but there's something called blind sight
24:57 apparently and blind sight
25:00 is the fact that when you are
25:03 congenitally blind no information
25:07 travels from your eyes to your visual
25:08 cortex at all
25:10 but all the other little parts of your
25:12 mind of your brain
25:14 excuse me i'm going to abuse that and i
25:15 apologize the other
25:17 chambers that go you're like let's just
25:19 say your eyeballs are chamber one
25:21 there's a lot of things going on but
25:22 then the occipital lobe and the visual
25:24 cortex let's just make that two
25:26 there's a three and there's a four and
25:27 there's a five where that information
25:29 travels to become part of your
25:30 consciousness
25:32 well those areas of the brain are
25:34 typically in full function
25:36 and so this facilitates a wild ability
25:40 to take a blind person walk them down a
25:42 corridor to hallway
25:44 there's an object even a small little
25:46 object on the floor
25:49 and they'll walk around it it's as if
25:51 they can see it
25:55 interesting right starts to speak to a
25:57 much more detailed sense table within
25:59 the human body
26:01 it also may suggest
26:04 uh that we are i'm just gonna
26:08 say it you guys are gonna be like oh
26:10 take a drink you we are probably
26:12 ethereal beings that take in data
26:14 from a bunch of different tangent points
26:18 on this this whirling
26:22 force that is our body that gives us the
26:24 sense that this is tangible
26:27 right fast-moving energies usually call
26:30 electricity
26:30 or plasma and slow-moving energy is
26:33 called mass
26:35 but we know it's all made of the same
26:36 stuff we just do
26:38 well if you have something that's so
26:39 small it penetrates all cavities of all
26:42 things
26:43 and there's a little protocol traveling
26:45 on that
26:46 vibration knowing where something is in
26:50 the room is a deprivation
26:53 and you know that when someone walks
26:55 behind you in a room and there's just
26:57 even the slightest bit of white noise
26:59 going on
27:00 or brown noise as my friend likes to say
27:03 you'll sense that little deprivation and
27:05 sound and your body
27:06 your mind starts triangulating and
27:08 that's not a big deal because there are
27:10 animals out there like bats that
27:11 triangulate all day long
27:13 there are sharks that triangulate the
27:15 scent of their nostrils
27:17 so we have this ability it's just built
27:19 into life
27:20 algorithms on this planet the other one
27:23 was that they were mystified that blind
27:25 people
27:26 having this other capability like once
27:28 you learn this one it should
27:29 extend automatically to other things but
27:31 they said that
27:33 blind people and if you know anyone
27:34 who's blind it'd be interesting for you
27:36 to ask them these questions and see if
27:37 they have any blind sight maybe get
27:39 a little more detail because i don't
27:41 know anyone who's blind
27:44 but they said that when someone walks up
27:46 to them and just makes faces even on a
27:48 television
27:49 they know whether or not the person is
27:51 making a happy face a sad face
27:53 that sort of thing well
27:56 in person it makes complete sense to me
27:58 because i completely accept the fact
28:00 that we communicate without
28:04 talking and whether or not there's ever
28:06 been an experiment
28:08 i i needed to say and when i last
28:10 mentioned the ten monkey experiment
28:13 one of the listeners came in and said
28:14 you know this is completely fraudulent
28:16 this it gets mentioned a lot but there's
28:18 no experiment that ever occurred
28:22 um i'm willing to believe that but i did
28:24 see a documentary where they were doing
28:27 it with these monkeys and they actually
28:28 show the little machine and everything
28:30 and one of my totally non-conspiratorial
28:33 genius mentors of mine
28:36 mentioned it to me and corrected me on
28:38 the story and said it was actually a
28:39 hundred monkeys but they call it the ten
28:41 monkey to make it easier for your brain
28:43 so i don't know i mean if you truly have
28:46 an article that says where this
28:48 myth occurred that this happened and it
28:50 never happened
28:52 feel free to share the link because i'm
28:53 all ears
28:56 but if you're with someone personally i
28:58 think that you can sense a tone
29:00 that's on all kinds of different levels
29:02 of projection remember
29:04 people know that they are being stared
29:05 at and my projecting ether episode talks
29:08 about the fact that the cavities of the
29:10 eye
29:11 are just like a radar dish and so
29:14 it transmitters and receivers all
29:16 typically have a concave dish
29:18 that aids in the projection or reception
29:21 of data
29:22 when you take the little key fob that's
29:24 got low power and you put it against
29:25 your skull and it's using the
29:27 harmonics of your skull to push the
29:28 frequency further
29:30 it's amazing i had to do it today on my
29:32 car sport of god
29:35 but how does it work on a television
29:36 with a blind person
29:39 well 20 years ago this may not have been
29:42 in my mind but because we have so much
29:44 face recognition
29:45 software out there when you look at it
29:48 as a programmer
29:49 i mean obviously the little the the high
29:52 def
29:53 lasers that are hitting our face to
29:55 figure out where our eye sockets are i
29:57 was trying to do this
29:58 no actually i did it i was looking at an
30:00 app on my
30:01 ipad the other day they said hey you can
30:03 try on glasses
30:06 with your ipad and so i download this
30:08 little app and sure enough man this
30:09 thing hit my face
30:10 and being a 3d modeler i mean it was
30:13 beautiful
30:14 the uh surveillance that was occurring
30:17 on my face i was looking at my face the
30:18 eye sockets were all perfect i mean it
30:20 was like
30:21 instantaneous i mean hats off to those
30:24 folks that
30:24 labored through that code to get that
30:26 done
30:28 so there's a pattern of light obviously
30:30 that we recognize when we're looking at
30:32 each other
30:34 the there was an experiment we did with
30:36 my led company where you can watch a
30:38 video on like an ipad
30:40 and if you put the ipad really close to
30:42 your face
30:43 the people if you have little people
30:45 walking by in a scene or something
30:47 and you relax your mind it's usually
30:49 really
30:51 most accepted when you are about to go
30:54 to bed so you're a little more relaxed
30:55 you're a little more open-minded you're
30:56 not grabbing on to reality or anywhere
30:58 else
30:59 the screen because the leds are warming
31:02 your face
31:03 while these people walk by and because
31:05 we know when human beings
31:07 get close to us we feel warm
31:10 there was a weird sensation we were
31:12 having
31:13 that we're looking through a window of
31:15 like miniature people
31:17 it's a really fascinating thing just try
31:18 a bunch of videos just put it really
31:20 close to your face
31:20 now you don't want a video where the
31:22 camera is really close to something
31:23 because then your brain won't
31:25 know what to do the little puppy dogs
31:28 are looking up at you and maybe they
31:29 come onto the screen and look at you
31:31 they'll the the leds fire and you're
31:33 getting
31:34 photonic vibrations in your face and
31:37 it'll feel real
31:40 so now let's go to that other side
31:43 let's go to the other side where we seem
31:46 to have premonitions
31:48 now one of the big ones that occurred
31:50 back in the day which is odd that i
31:52 don't have it
31:53 today at all is that when we had old
31:56 conventional telephones with actual
31:58 physical
31:58 bells inside them
32:02 this would happen
32:05 multiple times and i was probably about
32:08 you know according to these scientists i
32:11 was right in the pocket i was probably
32:12 about 12 through 14 this happened the
32:14 most
32:15 and i remember the last time i was doing
32:17 i was reading a book on a sofa in
32:18 massachusetts
32:21 i don't think my dad was there and i
32:24 just
32:25 looked up at the telephone and i said
32:26 the phone's gonna ring and then bang it
32:28 rings
32:30 what i think that is quite frankly is me
32:33 hearing the first ring
32:34 subconsciously but i'm reading a book
32:37 and so my
32:38 consciousness won't allow me to
32:39 interrupt the
32:41 virtual reality i've created by reading
32:43 a book and so
32:45 my brain then bubbles up out of history
32:49 histrionics i should say my
32:52 knowledge that the phone is actually
32:53 ringing and so i look up at it and of
32:54 course predicting it is nothing more
32:57 than just
32:58 acknowledging what's going on in the
32:59 room but
33:01 chronologically it can feel magical now
33:03 i will tell you this
33:06 the patented sensation of deja vu was
33:09 not occurring in my mind when i had this
33:11 it was just almost like a like a
33:14 gimmicky feeling
33:15 it was not that amazing wrapping deja vu
33:18 feeling
33:20 but prior to that little sofa situation
33:24 here's where i go into the the story the
33:27 most profound
33:30 experience and there's two
33:33 is i'm 11. i just moved to massachusetts
33:35 i don't know what this massachusetts
33:37 thing
33:37 one's going to happen in the bay area
33:38 here just got to massachusetts
33:41 just unloading all my stuff in these
33:43 boxes that were on the floor
33:45 put my clothes in there so i stand up
33:47 and the only people
33:48 at this location at this time my dad's
33:50 at work the gentleman owned the houses
33:53 at work his wife is downstairs
33:55 kids outside playing five-year-old kid
33:59 and i walk down the stairs turn the
34:02 corner
34:03 and i go towards the kitchen and this is
34:05 like an amityville horror looking house
34:07 but really nice and the kitchen's like
34:09 this big barney kitchen
34:11 huge ceilings the mother is at the other
34:14 end of the kitchen in the corner on the
34:15 left and she's
34:17 mixing macaroni and cheese
34:21 and i'm walking in the room and she's
34:22 like you want some macaroni and cheese
34:25 and as i always say who doesn't want
34:27 macaroni and cheese
34:29 but as soon as i eclipse the door jam
34:33 on a probably a 15 foot long kitchen
34:35 probably at least 15 feet wide
34:38 my vision starts to go purple
34:42 and it's it's as if i stood up too fast
34:44 but i can tell you in all my stand up
34:46 too fast moments
34:47 there's no you know 30 second pause
34:50 between standing up and getting the
34:52 purple oh
34:52 gosh am i you know i'm losing my blood
34:54 in my brain or whatever
34:56 it's always very immediate when that
34:57 occurs to me
34:59 now i'm 11. and even though i might have
35:02 been
35:03 pretty scientific little kid what i'm
35:05 about to say is something
35:07 and do in this event was not anything
35:09 that i was normally doing with strangers
35:11 you know
35:13 but she asked me that and i start
35:15 getting lightheaded and i put my hand my
35:17 left hand on my head
35:20 and she can see me looking at the ground
35:22 and she goes are you okay
35:24 and all of a sudden in this fluent
35:27 motion
35:28 of realizing this this premonition
35:32 i am speaking the words just as quickly
35:34 as they're going through me
35:37 and there's a barn oh sorry there's a
35:38 door to this barney kitchen to my right
35:41 uh 10 feet and i point my hand straight
35:44 out
35:45 and with my i got my hand down my head
35:47 on my head i'm looking down
35:48 and i said someone's gonna be at that
35:51 door
35:51 and they're gonna be hurt now i'm 11.
35:55 never said anything like this in my
35:56 entire life never had a premonition like
35:58 this in my entire life
35:59 she's looking at me like what you're a
36:02 kid what the hell are you talking about
36:04 and then the door starts banging to her
36:06 left
36:08 and she's stunned there's a couple
36:11 beats in the script where she's just
36:13 looking right at me and she's got the
36:14 spoon
36:15 kind of in mid-stir and then finally she
36:18 just throws down the pan and runs
36:20 outside because she realized she knows
36:21 it's her child
36:22 i don't know her kids outside playing i
36:24 i
36:25 i met the kid a couple times at this
36:27 point
36:30 sure enough the kid screams on the other
36:32 side of the door
36:34 what had happened was he they had this
36:37 beagle dog
36:38 which apparently was just abused
36:40 unfortunately and so
36:42 he was messing with the dog who knows
36:43 what he was doing and it bit him on the
36:44 stomach
36:45 on the outside of his flesh you know and
36:47 it bit him hard enough that she had to
36:49 take him to the hospital immediately and
36:50 get stitches
36:51 so i was just i was at this house by
36:53 myself
36:54 what's weird about the moment to me when
36:56 i look back and this woman
36:58 sadly is in super advanced alzheimer's
37:01 right now in her life otherwise i'd ask
37:03 her
37:05 she now sometimes recognizes her husband
37:07 i mean it's a really sad situation she's
37:09 physically looks fine
37:11 but she never said anything to me after
37:13 that i mean here's this amazing moment
37:15 in in
37:16 all of our lives and she didn't come
37:17 back to me what just happened there
37:20 i mean if you did that to me as a kid
37:22 and i'm an adult i'd be like
37:24 let me take care of my kid first getting
37:25 stitched up but i'm going to sit you
37:27 down later
37:28 or at least going to tell an adult you
37:30 know this kid you know who the hell is
37:32 this kid he just shows up and he tells
37:33 me my kids hurt you know and
37:36 okay so in that one moment of my life it
37:38 changes
37:39 everything it changes this simplistic
37:42 knee-jerking oh
37:43 man is so unbelievable our hubris solves
37:47 all
37:47 problems i can't just swallow everything
37:50 that they say
37:52 the second one that happened much easier
37:55 much quicker
37:56 it's the day before 9 11. it's probably
38:00 technically would be 911
38:01 actually really early like midnight
38:05 and i'm just looking up at the ceiling
38:06 got my girlfriend on my right lights
38:08 around in the bedroom
38:09 looking at this white ceiling and i just
38:10 said man i feel like something bad's
38:11 gonna happen
38:12 and then two planes pass each other
38:15 in front of me in my mind's eye and i
38:18 said i think they just have to do with
38:19 planes
38:22 and sure enough the next morning the
38:23 thing is me spending that at her place
38:25 was
38:25 fairly rare because i live a country
38:28 block in the other direction so she just
38:30 came to my place
38:32 and the next morning the phone's ringing
38:33 off the hook at her house and i don't
38:35 answer her phone
38:36 even though we're dating and but i
38:38 finally did because it just wouldn't
38:39 stop ringing it's her on the phone going
38:40 hey something going on in new york
38:42 and i had completely forgotten having
38:43 said this until
38:45 some time later and i was like oh my god
38:47 now wait a minute because i can still
38:49 see the moment in massachusetts like it
38:51 was yesterday
38:52 and i can still see the moment in that
38:54 bedroom like it happened two minutes ago
38:58 i could probably render it in 3d i mean
38:59 what i exactly saw the transparent
39:01 planes
39:03 maybe i'll try to find some free models
39:04 online and do it
39:06 crazy crazy
39:09 so what would explain premonitions
39:14 and does it have anything to do with
39:16 deja vu
39:18 the before i go into that complete
39:21 answer
39:21 let me share with you a moment that one
39:24 of my artists from my video game company
39:27 experienced i believe i'm saying this
39:29 correctly
39:32 when i got her portfolio it was just a
39:34 funny story i'm at a wedding of my
39:36 cousin i meet her mother her mother's
39:38 like hey my kid's about to graduate from
39:39 the fine arts school and
39:41 the academy of arts in san francisco
39:43 she's going to move back down
39:44 to san diego could you look at her
39:46 portfolio and see if you know you can
39:48 hire
39:48 i said all right so look at this
39:50 portfolio it's all fine arts it's like
39:51 paintings and just amazing stuff but
39:54 then all of a sudden i
39:55 flipped the cover uh flip the pages in
39:58 this one sketchbook and i'm looking at
39:59 disney level artwork
40:01 and when i say that i mean that at the
40:03 highest level of disney artwork
40:06 and she had this really amazing like
40:09 victorian home that might be found in
40:11 like um
40:13 old san francisco or or some of the more
40:16 enchanting cities in chicago suburban
40:18 areas
40:19 and it had this beautiful tree out front
40:21 and just the tree was all just drawn i
40:23 wish i had the picture
40:24 to show you and maybe i can contact her
40:27 and she'd give it to me
40:29 but i was like what's this and it's all
40:30 these colonial people
40:32 and she goes well this was sort of stems
40:35 from an experience i had when i was
40:37 going
40:38 in to find places to rent in san
40:39 francisco and she said i walked into
40:41 this place and i had a complete
40:44 deja vu moment that went on for a while
40:47 not just one of these little oh you know
40:49 she
40:51 saw people in this place and felt life
40:54 force
40:54 in this place and found out that this
40:57 place had history of those exact people
40:59 that she had seen
41:01 this is not a girl that's you know
41:03 paranormal
41:04 kind of person or anything no crystals
41:06 on her body or anything
41:08 and so she started developing a story
41:11 around it and then she embellished it a
41:14 little bit
41:15 to create like an interesting fictional
41:16 story it had to do with
41:18 people passing away too early in life
41:20 and then staying behind
41:22 and you know so i think it was one of
41:24 those kind of classic tales where i
41:25 think the mother had passed away early
41:26 and the kids were getting
41:28 communication with their mother i think
41:31 i need to touch base with her on that
41:33 but we're gonna go after two different
41:34 things before we finish up the episode
41:37 which is an explanation for premonitions
41:39 that i've done before
41:40 we're all in the same spot and i may be
41:42 drawing a new audience member in
41:43 who hasn't heard this kind of stuff now
41:46 this is a little tough to
41:47 describe but i think i can put it into
41:50 words now a lot easier than i
41:51 had in the past imagine that
41:54 you have a line and that line is your
41:57 line of reality
41:58 it is you going through a particular
42:01 dimension of
42:02 existence as you progress down the line
42:04 you are
42:05 incurring new moments in time
42:08 technically indivisible but who cares
42:10 your pocket you're packaging them up in
42:12 packets
42:13 this second this second this minute to
42:14 spend at this day this day
42:16 but let's say that something traumatic
42:18 is going to happen in the future
42:20 near future so it's up there on your
42:23 line
42:24 this moment of impact and
42:27 what happens when we see impacts
42:30 in any other physical model of reality
42:35 we see a rippling effect away from the
42:37 impact
42:40 now in our world it's chronologically
42:42 restricted
42:43 the funny thing about mentioning the
42:44 matrix is there's that famous scene
42:46 where the helicopter slams into the side
42:47 of the building
42:48 and all the windows bubble out and then
42:51 blow up i mean it's one of the best
42:52 scenes in the whole
42:53 freaking movie let alone any movie
42:57 when you throw a rock into a pond as i
42:59 always say ripples go away from that
43:01 center point
43:02 again in our time frame you must throw
43:05 the rock first the helicopter has to
43:06 crash first then you see the ripples
43:08 but in time there might be a
43:11 pre-calculated
43:12 eventuality of all things that could
43:14 possibly happen
43:16 it's happening in your timeline and
43:18 those ripples are coming back towards
43:20 you
43:21 it's also going out in all three
43:22 dimensions of other people's realities
43:24 so
43:25 potentially there's a 911 out there
43:27 where everything went wrong
43:29 everything went wrong that could go
43:30 wrong they got caught they got busted
43:33 everything went wrong but in our
43:36 timetable
43:39 depending on your colliding reality it
43:42 happened
43:43 now what happens with that moment
43:46 i think i just recently said an episode
43:49 in the colliding reality one without
43:53 exaggeration
43:54 i think i can say several billion souls
43:58 screamed inside of the horror of the
44:00 moment
44:02 they don't have to know anything about
44:04 us as united states citizens they don't
44:06 have to care about us or anything hell
44:08 even if they're super happy that this
44:09 happened to us
44:10 because they don't like us well that's
44:11 still a ripple an emotion it's an
44:13 explosion of positivity instead of
44:15 negativity
44:17 so i'm sitting in bed and i'm really
44:18 relaxed and it's within
44:21 let's say it was midnight i'm willing to
44:24 bet it was a little bit past midnight
44:25 but let's just say it was midnight
44:26 and i'm in california time and the first
44:28 impact i think was something around
44:30 7 30 8 o'clock somewhere in there 7 30 8
44:33 30 in the morning
44:34 well i'm three hours behind that time
44:36 frame so i'm only five hours away
44:38 from this moment occurring all right
44:42 and yeah trust me i i don't think there
44:44 was any planes there that day
44:45 uh participating in that particular
44:47 thing that's a whole other story
44:50 you'll see my episode called that day if
44:52 you want to hear all my opinions on that
44:55 the severity of the moment and the delta
44:58 of
44:58 change as a result of that particular
45:00 date was
45:02 let's just say catastrophic significant
45:05 massive
45:06 huge you would have
45:09 ripples of
45:12 what does the building wobble before it
45:16 explodes
45:17 because it's coming and these ripples
45:19 are going backwards
45:20 in our reality as well probably not
45:23 because why the building is in the
45:26 matter world of energy electrons slash
45:30 ethereal wins
45:33 but consciousness and your brain is on a
45:36 completely different
45:38 layer of existence that we don't have
45:40 access to
45:41 and it may or may not have
45:44 any relegation of a concept of human
45:46 made time
45:49 time is an illusion lunchtime doubly so
45:52 say sit in hitchhiker's guide of the
45:53 galaxy but as these souls are screaming
45:58 there's this diminishing ripple away
46:00 from it there's a point where you can't
46:02 hear it anymore
46:03 but if someone was like right here
46:04 across the street and there's
46:06 a scream for some reason happy or sad or
46:08 whatever
46:10 that sounds gonna get to me not as loud
46:12 as their scream right in my ear but i'm
46:14 still gonna hear it
46:15 but three miles down that way they're
46:17 never gonna hear it
46:18 i think that's how i got not only
46:23 this message that this was going to
46:24 occur but why did i see planes
46:27 when i'm almost a thousand percent
46:29 convinced they weren't there
46:31 if you've never gone down that rabbit
46:33 hole i understand if i sound crazy
46:36 trust me as soon as you get down the
46:37 rabbit hole you need a pillow for your
46:40 jaw
46:41 it's because they were told that that's
46:43 what happened
46:45 the narrative came back
46:48 and so i saw things that were embedded
46:51 in the consciousness of this frequency
46:53 in mankind
46:54 and it rippled all the way back and for
46:57 whatever reason
46:58 i have an open mind i don't know i'm
46:59 enlightened a blabla
47:01 i saw it and i was able to decipher at
47:04 least one word
47:06 planes plural something bad happens
47:10 first message
47:11 and i was not unhappy when this occurred
47:13 i was having i mean i was at the
47:15 i was making ridiculous amounts of money
47:17 i was in charge i was lead architect of
47:20 a 310 million dollar project
47:22 and i was not unhappy i had 55 employees
47:25 that were all
47:26 amazing people plus tons of friends and
47:28 it was just a great time
47:29 so i didn't have any pessimistic
47:33 law of attraction going on now was there
47:36 drama going on the company
47:37 absolutely but i just don't think it was
47:39 affecting me as much as
47:40 perhaps other people
47:44 so that ripple effect
47:47 might be in your ability to see it and
47:50 sense it and feel it might be why
47:52 perhaps you have avoided avoided avoided
47:56 it's a new electronic version avoided
48:00 bad choices you know you meet someone
48:04 that you might end up dating
48:06 and there's just that weird frequency
48:08 and then you don't date them and you
48:09 find out they killed their
48:10 next boyfriend or girlfriend
48:13 the guy robbed people or whatever it is
48:17 you didn't go on a trip during a
48:19 snowstorm and
48:20 someone else did and they you know get
48:22 hit by a semi because of black ice or
48:24 something
48:26 and this loops all the way back around
48:29 to what the vsauce dude said in his
48:31 video which is based on research which
48:33 is that about eight or nine years old
48:35 this supposedly starts
48:36 and then you have a a fairly high
48:39 frequency through your teens and then
48:41 through your 20s it diminishes
48:43 and apparently by the time you're 30
48:46 it's extremely rare
48:47 no one ever said it didn't happen after
48:49 30 but that's sort of
48:51 what the data suggests
48:56 what are we always saying on the show
48:57 about your belief systems
49:00 and your ability to become enlightened
49:02 in this world
49:05 we talk about paradigm deadening
49:08 of the mind schools a long time ago
49:12 were especially like in say the greek
49:15 universities
49:17 the goal was to put a crowbar inside
49:20 your brain
49:20 and yank it open and put as much stuff
49:24 in there as possible
49:25 to conceive of the unconceivable because
49:27 they didn't have definitions for
49:29 everything so everything was a mystery
49:32 today it's to put blinders on your eyes
49:36 to put wax in your ears and to feed you
49:40 crap
49:40 the entire time to feed you agendas
49:43 because someone wants to convince the
49:45 world of something that doesn't
49:47 threaten us so that you will buy the
49:50 elite of the world
49:51 everything that they want and that will
49:54 always lead
49:55 to control or consumption of humans
50:00 obviously what we're trying to do on
50:01 this show is
50:04 provide an artery where you will always
50:07 be encouraged to open your mind
50:11 keep it open and then i'm going to give
50:13 you
50:14 tonics that you can try
50:17 and you drink them yeah it tastes pretty
50:19 good i mean maybe i'll go figure out how
50:21 to make this tonic myself
50:23 and i'll make a new one it's in the
50:24 genre of this one
50:26 it's a beer let's just say it's a soda
50:28 it's a something healthy for you
50:30 a fruit drink combination metaphors for
50:34 knowledge
50:37 if you don't like it then you're like
50:39 wow that's just that's like turpentine
50:41 no thanks man if you were to not hear
50:45 this episode and i were to bring that up
50:47 to the paradigm
50:48 deafening and muting of your system
50:52 and say what do you what do you think
50:53 the curve is like you know you're born
50:55 you live and you die and if we just
50:57 separate your life into decades
51:00 and i asked you to draw me a logarithmic
51:02 graph of
51:04 when you think you're the most
51:05 open-minded and when you think you're
51:06 the least open-minded
51:08 and then tell me what you think the
51:09 causes are
51:11 i'm going to assume that this
51:14 information
51:16 about us getting these deja vus around 8
51:19 and losing them around 30.
51:22 i think there's going to be a spike of
51:25 our
51:25 open-mindedness the second we hit like i
51:28 said
51:29 i don't remember fluent time until i was
51:33 seven
51:33 then i remember whole years of
51:36 experiences i do have you know memories
51:39 for almost every year of my life
51:40 the one year of my life that's odd that
51:42 i don't have a lot of
51:44 knowledge of remembering is the age of
51:46 six for some reason
51:48 my dad took a photo shoot of me on a
51:50 step
51:51 in kansas and then i went to washington
51:53 dc for the first time at
51:55 six those the only two memories i
51:57 remember the pictures being taken but
51:58 everything else i don't know if i
52:00 remember
52:01 the seven it just turned on i'm going to
52:04 bet you're pretty similar
52:07 if not better than that so here you have
52:09 this spike of
52:10 cognitive feedback that you can process
52:14 intelligently and start making little
52:15 tiny decisions for yourself
52:17 do i do this do i do that do i like this
52:20 do i not like this
52:22 grade school is so well when i was a kid
52:25 now it's all screwed up right
52:27 the grade school when i was a kid was
52:29 about the basics reading writing and
52:31 arithmetic
52:32 lots of fictional mechanisms to help me
52:34 learn those things when i learned the
52:36 alphabet it was this enchanting
52:38 teaching course that my teacher used
52:40 where all the letters were little beings
52:42 and they
52:42 were living in this little forest and i
52:44 can still remember this day just
52:45 thinking
52:47 i'm sitting on a little carpet you know
52:48 and i'm looking at this and it's just
52:50 was like i want to live in that world
52:52 because it's cool i want to hang out
52:53 with mister
52:54 x or whatever right are we getting to
52:57 junior high
52:58 again i wasn't full of full of
53:01 too much crap i mean we had sex at i
53:03 think which was
53:05 interesting i guess but everything else
53:06 was pretty much stuff i needed to know
53:08 in life
53:11 but then you pop out at 18.
53:14 if you go to college it depends on what
53:16 college you go to depends on what your
53:18 degree is going to be
53:19 again today it's just swill you get
53:21 these degrees and
53:22 things that could never be unemployed
53:24 unless you go back in to become a
53:26 teacher
53:28 so as you enter your 20s
53:32 now you're ingesting what in this day
53:34 and age
53:35 well if you're not you know i guess
53:38 guided by a parent that's open-minded
53:41 which very few of us have you're going
53:43 to be starting to ingest
53:44 mass media products everything on tv
53:48 both television and you know streaming
53:50 services
53:51 and inside those services are tons of
53:53 agendas everything's an agenda now i
53:55 mean it's like
53:56 i had a joke the other day with a friend
53:58 of mine i said you know i think i got
53:59 infected on my phone
54:00 the other day with a virus and i'm
54:03 playing it really dry so they're like oh
54:05 really what happened i said yeah i was
54:07 gonna call
54:08 you know my uh my cell phone provider
54:10 and say how do i get this virus off my
54:12 phone and they were like well what virus
54:13 do you have i was like
54:14 i got a piece of truth on my phone i
54:16 don't know how to get it off
54:18 you know i'm a pretty regimented mass
54:20 media product so i don't want
54:21 this on my phone you know
54:24 i can say that for me just
54:27 watching kids by the age of 30 they're
54:30 pretty locked into
54:32 whatever they believe and it's really
54:35 really tough after 30
54:37 to red pill yourself without having some
54:40 thing that's ticking you off that makes
54:42 you go something doesn't smell right
54:45 you know it's just like i always say
54:47 when truth moves through the soul
54:49 the body there's a frequency of cool
54:52 satisfying feeling because it's an
54:55 algorithm that's aligned with the
54:56 universe the universe is a perfect thing
54:58 whether you like it or not
54:59 it doesn't change into an orange and
55:01 then back to the universe whoever
55:02 programmed this place
55:04 was the best programmer that ever
55:06 existed
55:08 and so that'll usually catalyze some
55:09 moment for you
55:11 whether it's some sort of
55:15 situation where you're picking your
55:16 leader and something goes really wrong
55:19 something like a 911 that makes you go
55:21 hmm you know i took physics in high
55:23 school and something's not working right
55:27 but for the average person i think by 30
55:30 you're pretty close-minded
55:32 and how does that relate to deja vu well
55:34 if you had many seizures
55:36 and that's the reason for deja vu and
55:39 you're not epileptic
55:42 okay well then uh why does it correct
55:45 itself
55:46 maybe the brain just figures out how to
55:47 stop that from occurring
55:49 but don't we deteriorate over time
55:52 and if we deteriorate over time this
55:55 theory
55:56 that you know parts of your brain are
55:58 not communicating in chronological order
56:00 as we
56:00 are designed to do you would think the
56:03 deja vu would be almost non-existent
56:05 when you're young and healthy
56:07 and as you get older it would start
56:08 happening so badly
56:10 that you might go insane before you die
56:13 but they're telling us that after 30 you
56:16 probably won't have it anymore
56:17 i mean thank god it just happens to
56:21 overlay and correlate with what i would
56:23 assume
56:24 would be your level of open-mindedness
56:26 in this day and age
56:28 and we have to take into account too
56:30 that
56:31 this data probably came from you know my
56:35 era more than it came from the current
56:36 era
56:37 and we're just reading about it today
56:41 now some of you just as a digression to
56:43 kind of
56:44 button up a hole in the dam
56:47 you might be saying well dude you're
56:49 completely wrong about this soul thing
56:52 because they can open up a skull and
56:54 start poking around and people have
56:55 memories
56:57 so obviously the memories are inside the
56:59 brain because we poke it and it has this
57:01 effect
57:04 all right well um that's probably
57:07 because you don't remember tvs with
57:09 antennas
57:10 it's probably because you don't listen
57:11 to a radio with a bad antenna
57:15 but if you remember tvs with an antenna
57:17 and the old days were
57:19 some very important programs on it for
57:21 whatever freaking reason it's not coming
57:23 in clearly
57:25 and the sync line is off and so the
57:26 screen's going boom the black line you
57:28 know
57:29 and you grab that thing with your hand
57:30 and put your arm out and then all of a
57:32 sudden the show comes in great and the
57:33 whole family goes don't move
57:35 and you stabilize the image
57:39 well guess what if i let go of that
57:41 thing it starts screwing up
57:43 back when we used to have to degauss our
57:45 tube monitors
57:47 we could mess up all the colors in the
57:48 monitor if it was not
57:52 degaussed you could get back with those
57:55 long
57:56 screwdrivers the plastic ones so you
57:58 wouldn't get shocked and you could sit
57:59 there and adjust the alignment of the
58:00 little gun in the back of the
58:02 of the tv and eventually by the 80s you
58:06 started getting these crazy videos
58:08 on mtv where they were deliberately
58:10 playing with the signal
58:11 and sometimes you thought it was
58:13 digitized most of those things were
58:14 analog
58:15 but they would show you how they mess
58:17 with things how do you think the
58:18 weatherman stands in front of a blue
58:21 screen or
58:22 green screen and you see the thing
58:23 behind them
58:26 is the projection inside the screen no
58:29 it's a composite of a bunch of different
58:31 technologies
58:33 so in my mind to simply destroy the
58:36 trumpet
58:39 doesn't mean the song is in the trumpet
58:41 wrong
58:42 the song comes from your lips goes
58:44 through the harmonics of this horn
58:46 and blows out the end and sometimes you
58:48 get a miles davis
58:51 the other interesting thing when you
58:53 look at the anatomy of a brain
58:55 i've been thinking about this a lot
58:56 lately and again i've been involved with
58:58 numerous writing projects that are
59:01 involved with digitizing the brain
59:04 in terms of fictional writing screenplay
59:07 projects right
59:08 and so we've sat around for i don't even
59:12 know
59:12 hundreds of hours at a minimum talking
59:15 about this
59:16 getting to this because i have a
59:17 subatomic background
59:20 i was i was really tapped for like
59:21 making
59:23 some some dialogue that would make sense
59:26 in this realm right
59:28 the brain is a bunch of tubes it doesn't
59:31 that look
59:32 strange what else do we have on our body
59:35 besides our intestines i would say that
59:37 are you you can actually say okay we
59:39 zoom up the arteries and the veins and
59:40 their tubes too but look at that thing
59:42 that thing's all
59:43 you know big big old tubes moving around
59:45 when you
59:46 dissect a giant squid a 50-foot squid
59:51 let's just say you had a 50-foot squid
59:53 the brain would be about the size of my
59:55 pinky
59:56 and it's a hollow tube now they've
59:59 theorized that the
60:00 tentacles on all eight legs have all the
60:02 neurons in them because they can't
60:04 reconcile the problem that the brain
60:06 inside of a squid
60:08 which is extremely brilliant i mean the
60:10 little guys are super brilliant
60:11 and so their little brains are about the
60:13 size of an artery in a human being's leg
60:16 or in a heart how are they so brilliant
60:21 well maybe there's neurons in the legs
60:24 what i don't understand about that is
60:25 that
60:26 we're thinking maybe there's neurons in
60:27 the well you know what a neuron looks
60:29 like so slice it up on a leg put on an
60:31 electron microscope and answer the
60:32 question don't throw it to me as a
60:33 theory
60:34 because i'm done with people saying they
60:37 know how the brain works and then you go
60:38 okay really
60:40 and then when you look at the fine print
60:41 it's like well we guessed
60:45 imagine this whatever it is
60:49 not ether it's something else man
60:52 is moving in that tubular way and the
60:55 cells are just simply
60:56 wrapping around whatever this thing is
61:00 it could be something like a crazy straw
61:03 remember those things man you get a
61:05 clear crazy straw and you have some like
61:07 slushy stuff in there and it's awesome
61:08 to watch it
61:09 crazy clear ones are the only ones to
61:11 get right you see the red go
61:13 and it goes in your mouth right okay
61:14 great
61:17 same thing with the brain but it's
61:19 cycling through
61:20 whatever the hell we are with the
61:22 essential glands that are starting to
61:24 process the data
61:25 to make it your consciousness
61:29 now i talked about colliding realities
61:31 very recently here
61:33 let me throw you one last little theory
61:35 before we shut this episode down
61:38 imagine the deja vu
61:41 is one of those organic collisions that
61:44 i told you about
61:46 and it's one of these things where i was
61:49 just trying to think of
61:50 it be almost like a cheat sheet
61:52 situation
61:53 what if like those remember the
61:55 preachers that they caught with the
61:56 little ear buds in you know joe biden
61:58 had one in his ear and then he said he
62:00 didn't exist was he
62:01 tucked a little wire underneath his suit
62:04 there
62:06 these preachers will have someone read
62:07 off who walked into the chapel
62:09 and they said they had a messed up leg
62:11 and so they're like i see someone named
62:13 rebecca and you've got a messed up leg
62:15 and of course rebecca's like it's me
62:17 and then he does a faux healing
62:19 hopefully placebo work fixes her leg but
62:21 otherwise she's going to fall straight
62:23 on her face when she leaves the church
62:26 a colliding reality could be a cheat
62:27 sheet to your future
62:29 it doesn't have to be like my 9 11 thing
62:33 where it is
62:33 hours before the event occurs remember
62:36 the kitchen situation
62:37 that still had some seconds i predicted
62:40 this thing
62:41 no one was at the door no one was
62:42 touching the door she just asked me a
62:44 question
62:45 and i predicted it and i guess
62:46 technically speaking it might have been
62:49 two to three seconds after i finished
62:51 the sentence about someone being at that
62:53 door and being hurt
62:54 before it went bam bam bam and the
62:56 scream happened outside
62:59 the interesting thing about that for me
63:00 is the kid could have gone in the house
63:01 in different ways
63:02 he could have not come to the house at
63:03 all he could have sat out there
63:06 fighting the dog but so a reality
63:09 that's that's where you're about to go
63:12 there's another you in the infinitely
63:15 small slice whatever the smallest
63:17 deviation in this linear path of time
63:21 that can occur is occurring and it bumps
63:23 into your reality or
63:25 your mind is open enough because these
63:27 other paradigms haven't taught you to
63:29 shut everything
63:30 down because once you learn how to shut
63:32 things down guess what you do
63:34 you shut it all down constantly got a
63:36 new one no one's even there and you're
63:38 shutting it down
63:39 well that just can't be i i haven't
63:41 developed a mind that's open so anything
63:43 that i can't conceive
63:44 i just automatically shut it down it's
63:46 like my buddy who called me
63:48 uh you know a week ago or two weeks ago
63:50 and he's like oh man there's
63:52 stuff online about people hurting kids
63:54 and that's just so crazy
63:56 i'm like you idiot there's 800 000 kids
64:00 disappearing united states of america
64:02 every year and over half of them are
64:04 below
64:05 12 so they're not running away anywhere
64:08 they're disappearing into these crazy
64:11 meat farms somewhere you know so he shut
64:14 it down by himself
64:16 but if you have a colliding reality that
64:18 says this room has this this this this
64:21 in that reality your life is almost
64:23 completely identical except you went
64:25 into the room
64:26 a second or two before the one that
64:28 you're in right now
64:29 and you got the cheat sheet and all of a
64:31 sudden you're like
64:33 and that weird feeling that you have
64:35 when deja vu happens
64:37 where you feel like you almost have like
64:38 a glass ball of reality around you
64:40 that's sort of like a projection
64:42 and it feels strange all the way down to
64:44 your core
64:46 maybe that's just the feeling of the
64:49 collision
64:50 that's just what it feels like because
64:52 maybe you're feeling your other self too
64:54 and they're feeling you as well
64:56 because things may have vibrated in a
64:58 way that you got a copy of it
65:00 mandela effect when you have one
65:04 you get a weird feeling i don't know i
65:07 mean i haven't had a mandela effect in
65:09 quite some time
65:10 because we did this big inventory on
65:12 what we've what people have reported
65:13 versus what we
65:15 feel like we experienced in this world
65:17 but when you have one
65:19 it is sort of a matrix moment man you're
65:21 like what
65:24 and so
65:27 we may be on to something is all i'm
65:28 saying and i think that
65:31 this definitely deserves some of your
65:33 comments for sure
65:36 and it was funny because one of the
65:37 commenters on the channel
65:39 i can't remember which one of you said
65:40 it but someone said hey guys uh
65:42 we're not doing a very good job
65:44 commenting on these episodes
65:46 and so uh all i'll say is you know
65:49 there's no
65:50 pass or fail in that situation but just
65:52 remember you
65:54 are extremely valuable to everyone else
65:58 in this world and if you can make it to
66:00 the end of one of these episodes
66:02 then you got the right brain to be
66:03 commenting you have the right brain
66:05 the correct brain i should say to
66:09 enlighten everybody else as well
66:13 so comment if you can
66:16 and on that note i always like to direct
66:18 you guys to deepthoughtsradio.com
66:20 to bookmark it because we're in a
66:22 tumultuous situation now where
66:24 you know propagandists are called fact
66:27 checkers
66:29 i will tell you that fact checkers
66:32 have converted more of my liberal
66:34 friends into red pilling
66:35 than any other act by the deep state
66:38 slash big tech
66:39 so you fact checkers you keep going
66:41 you're making a ton of people that are
66:43 going to come and eat your lunch one day
66:45 so more power to you because eventually
66:47 your platforms are going to get turned
66:48 off we're all going to be on a different
66:50 platform
66:51 you'll have no power and you walk around
66:53 with a scarlet letter on your face when
66:54 you try to pass in your resume it'll be
66:56 a big dark spot in your resume where
66:57 you're like
66:58 what happened here you're gonna make up
67:00 some fake story because you were a fact
67:01 checker
67:03 you won't let anyone know that that's
67:04 what you were
67:06 because you were the utter instrument of
67:09 the demise of humanity
67:13 luckily there's enough of us that'll
67:15 fight back
67:18 but i just did the deep thoughts radio
67:21 it's actually just going to be deep
67:22 thoughts university alumni shirt for
67:25 2015.
67:26 and that's really aimed at all of you
67:28 and that's just when it started
67:30 you know you'll have like uh brands that
67:33 started in a particular year and they'll
67:34 put their brand name on there in the
67:35 year on there so i just thought you know
67:36 2015 is good enough
67:38 it's when we started it there's all
67:40 kinds of hoodies and all kinds of cool
67:42 stuff so
67:43 i just put that up a few hours ago
67:47 so get on over and get you some i also
67:49 brought down the price
67:50 over six bucks from what they
67:52 recommended so that wouldn't gouge you
67:54 guys too bad
67:56 they take quite a bit as well but i also
67:58 try to elect
67:59 the very best uh cotton
68:02 and you know the quality of the of the
68:05 garments themselves
68:06 so we're using we're using a service for
68:09 sid mead
68:10 as well so we've got some pretty good
68:11 feedback
68:13 apparently one of the guys washed a
68:14 colored shirt in hot water and was angry
68:16 that it changed colors i was like
68:18 because you're an idiot
68:19 but anyway that was a friend of mine but
68:22 on there we have two video two audio
68:24 social media we have all new remastered
68:27 season one
68:29 the store and a couple ways to donate to
68:31 the site
68:32 so we have for the cause i should say we
68:34 have patreon
68:35 which has been pretty stable in terms of
68:38 the amount of you
68:39 know new folks for a long time and then
68:41 some of you will
68:42 about every quarter put in a beautiful
68:44 donation through paypal so i really
68:46 appreciate it again
68:47 it does help in 2020. anyway
