00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen on this rather crisp evening
00:35 here in December of 2019 I got to start
00:40 saying that now so that if I ever
00:43 released this video like a million years
00:44 from now which this one won't
00:46 I will not seem like I'm way out of date
00:51 so I released the video called choosing
00:54 for choosing to forgive which was filmed
00:56 way back in 2017 hosted 19 not funny and
01:00 then I released old America which was
01:04 filmed in June 24th of 2018 it's like I
01:09 eat over a little over two years on one
01:11 episode and year and a half on the other
01:13 I was it was cool that I ended up really
01:17 liking me forgiveness woman I thought it
01:18 would be pretty you know one of those
01:21 videos but today we're gonna talk about
01:23 spontaneous combustion and I know that
01:26 you know we've got one of those shows
01:28 we're like a sort of a coast-to-coast am
01:30 kind of show right however I have to say
01:33 that spontaneous combustion has been one
01:35 of those things and when I first heard
01:37 about it as a kid it just was sort of
01:42 eerie it was sort of stunning you know
01:46 of like what people burn up yeah man
01:48 people burn up but what's interesting
01:51 about it is that I got when I don't go
01:54 into the subject formerly in the last
01:56 three days here I was shocked that my my
02:00 initial thoughts of what I was seeing
02:02 when I was a kid was totally incorrect
02:06 cuz I've never never ever researched it
02:11 as an adult like ever okay just had the
02:14 memories of seeing this stuff as a kid
02:15 you've heard me say it several times on
02:17 the show I think I've quoted like years
02:21 way back in the 30s and what-have-you
02:23 and there are cases that go back
02:25 according to the official lore of the
02:28 condition back to the 1400s which i
02:31 think is interesting some night had an
02:35 issue which we're going to go through
02:37 but I was shocked to find that episodes
02:42 of this were occurring while I was alive
02:44 in the 70s in the 80s and there
02:49 apparently are just a ton of cases out
02:52 there regarding this that you know just
02:58 people burn up and they don't know what
03:00 to say and the way it works before we
03:04 get into the absolute details here is
03:08 that someone somewhere burns up very
03:10 mysteriously now we're going to get into
03:12 like the kooky facts about this whole
03:14 thing because it is nothing shy of
03:19 phenomenal I do not believe as much as I
03:23 sympathize with the skeptics their
03:27 assertions but I know that you know
03:29 skeptics herb you know there's two types
03:32 of skeptics really and there might be
03:33 hybrids of course one is a person that
03:37 has so much knowledge about things that
03:39 they see the magic trick being played in
03:41 front of people in South America you
03:43 know doing surgery on people's guts and
03:45 it's just all sleight of hand thing and
03:47 they're angry that people are taking
03:49 money for this and so they won't expose
03:51 it and I sympathize with that but what
03:54 they don't understand is the power of
03:55 the mind if the mind does believe that
03:58 the procedure is healing them then you
04:02 might be stealing a whole ability for
04:06 them to psychosomatically heal you know
04:09 even major conditions again look at the
04:12 book the holographic universe and the
04:16 first half there's a kid who rebuilt his
04:18 pelvis by simply thinking that being in
04:20 hot springs was going to do it and it
04:22 happened and either the hot springs did
04:25 it or he did it a chance it might have
04:29 been both but some of the skeptics I
04:31 think are and I'm gonna use a harsh word
04:35 I think they're cowards they have to
04:39 have everything explained because there
04:40 can't be anything in their life that
04:41 isn't explained 100% otherwise they
04:43 don't sleep at night you know if you say
04:46 oh man the UFO landed in my backyard and
04:48 gave me this tattoo right here and you
04:50 were
04:50 there and it happened a skeptic like
04:52 that's gonna come come into the room and
04:54 yeah okay mm-hmm and then walk off to
04:58 your neighbors and go the guy is a crazy
05:00 guy he did it to himself he probably had
05:02 this a man just mix up some [ __ ]
05:04 story at a thin air right now the other
05:07 thing is that for the life of me I
05:10 couldn't figure out how a body that's
05:12 made of mostly water could possibly
05:15 catch on fire the way that these bodies
05:16 catch on fire regardless of anyone's
05:18 explanation and after listening to
05:21 various testimonies there's a really
05:23 good documentary on YouTube I think it's
05:27 like 45 minutes to 50 minutes or
05:29 something like that but they really
05:31 talked to police chiefs or fire chief's
05:33 excuse me and these you know got the
05:36 skeptic over here making up some story
05:38 and then you have the fire chief's that
05:41 are like look I've been on the scene of
05:45 like thousands of fires I've seen
05:47 hundreds of burned up bodies and these
05:49 individuals though well usually only one
05:53 police chief throughout an entire 35 to
05:56 45 year career will see one of these
05:58 maybe maybe and you know these guys are
06:04 like hey it's not something simple okay
06:07 it's not just a cigarette that dropped
06:09 in their lap and caught them on fire and
06:11 there's extreme technical reasons why
06:14 this is the case people who I witness
06:20 incredible things occurring like people
06:23 in the midst of this event you have two
06:26 people at one case we're gonna have a
06:29 case here had a situation where she
06:32 breathes fire and the whole inside of
06:35 her mouth was all burned up but the
06:37 doctor in the corner when she eventually
06:39 passed away said that her mouth wasn't
06:42 burned up and these guys are like we
06:43 looked inside of her mouth we took care
06:46 of her we're trying to figure out what
06:47 the hell was going on there denied
06:50 because the corner slash the medical
06:53 professionals are really pressured to
06:56 come up with a very plausible solution
07:01 if you will
07:02 so there's also some cases in the past
07:06 which they use to sort of extinguish
07:10 anything that could be happening in the
07:11 present meaning when you had people way
07:13 back you know in the 1400s it would have
07:15 have you not understanding the basics of
07:18 science which isn't really the case but
07:20 you know your average person they will
07:23 come up with some tale some story that
07:26 could be 100% true could be something
07:28 that's just a story and so when it's
07:33 registered back in those days they they
07:35 basically say you'll see back in those
07:37 days they didn't understand anything
07:39 about anything and so because this was
07:42 reported so long ago all that's
07:44 happening is that that's being cut and
07:45 pasted into our present ok
07:49 could be we're not really concerned with
07:52 the ones that happened a long time ago
07:54 but the first one I'm gonna probably use
07:56 the name Butz Polonius vorse Deus from
08:01 the 1400s he was a knight supposedly and
08:05 he was known for drinking and they said
08:09 that he was drinking a lot of wine and
08:11 drinking happens to be one of the common
08:12 denominators of some of this stuff but
08:16 that he started breathing fire and then
08:19 eventually caught completely on fire and
08:23 burned up in front of a bunch of people
08:25 at some tavern ok 1400s right well
08:31 that's a telltale era isn't it I guess
08:33 we can completely get rid of that one
08:37 there was a countess cornelia de banty
08:41 so in the 1700s she was found between
08:46 her bed and her window completely
08:49 consumed except for her lower legs and
08:53 she too burned completely away so I'm
09:00 skipping some of the details because I'm
09:01 gonna wait for one of the first cases
09:03 here in order to really get to this and
09:09 I'm gonna start start with one that
09:10 isn't chronologically our first one in
09:13 terms of
09:14 moving up through the dates but this one
09:18 is extremely fascinating and it's gonna
09:22 it's gonna lack a couple things that
09:24 happen to other people but this will
09:26 give us sort of a case to study where we
09:31 have some commonalities between the
09:33 people now alcohol consumption and
09:36 smoking is definitely something that is
09:39 pretty common with individuals except
09:41 for this score this guy named George
09:44 Mott now being sort of middle-aged a
09:48 little overweight being depressed and
09:53 either drinking or smoking is usually
09:57 associated sometimes both and in 1979 a
10:04 woman by Beatrice oski was home alone
10:11 her son went off to some ski trip left
10:17 her alone at home and of course she was
10:20 worried about his health and and the
10:22 issue the irony was that it was her
10:24 sitting at home and in the comfort of
10:26 her own house where she perished I
10:30 believe it was a woman came to her house
10:33 and realized that the door was warm and
10:35 this is typical this is typically the
10:37 case for almost every one of these
10:38 someone goes to the doorknob and it's
10:41 either burning hot or it's hot hot
10:44 you know scorch your hand pull back a
10:47 little bit thing but Beatrice was home
10:51 alone and she was again sort of in her I
10:55 think late 40s early 50s little
10:58 overweight and you know generally
11:01 speaking you know she was by herself I
11:04 think her husband had passed already or
11:05 she was divorced what-have-you it's
11:07 really in the era of being a widow but
11:12 when they find her she's on she has sort
11:15 of in transit in her living room but her
11:19 body's on the ground now in almost every
11:22 single case there's a part of the body
11:25 that doesn't burn and it's almost
11:27 unanimously
11:28 the lower legs either one leg or both
11:33 legs below the knee don't burn and this
11:37 is really really strange the fingertips
11:41 typically burn completely away meaning
11:45 they might be able to track part of an
11:46 arm or something but most of them don't
11:48 have anything and this is the other
11:49 mysterious thing about this and this is
11:51 this is very very mysterious and very
11:54 very strange and probably the linchpin
11:56 of oh my god really you know but now
12:01 when you take a body let's just think
12:03 about this when they found this woman
12:04 Beatrice she was so burned to ash that
12:09 they couldn't really recognize other
12:11 than her legs that this was a woman by
12:14 looking at her shoes sometimes they when
12:17 a body completely burns up like this
12:19 Kendall mock I were gonna get to he was
12:22 so burned up I think a part of one of
12:23 his legs you know you could tell and
12:26 there are there are others and I'm not
12:27 going to cover here simply for the sake
12:30 of repetition and time but the bones are
12:34 gone in a lot of cases totally gone but
12:40 when you cremate a body it takes about
12:42 three and a half hours and a modern
12:44 Crematory and then what you have left
12:48 this is exposing the body to thousands
12:51 of degrees for 3 and 1/2 hours some of
12:56 these people's bodies burn up in 20
12:58 minutes which we're gonna get to this
12:59 other woman who burned up in 20 minutes
13:01 no one knows quite how long it took for
13:03 Beatrice to burn first and foremost
13:06 there is a spot that's burned where the
13:08 body was but the overall collateral
13:11 damage of fire is not really happening
13:14 in the room meaning think about it if
13:16 you were to spill something extremely
13:19 flammable on your carpet in your front
13:22 room when she expected to grow on the
13:24 carpet when she expect it to catch the
13:28 sofa on fire the chair on fire the
13:30 coffee table on fire I mean if this is
13:32 hot enough to get rid of human bones
13:35 which is the case which a Crematory
13:38 can't in most cases a Crematory burns a
13:41 body
13:42 away but what you have left is a ton of
13:44 bone matter like a ton of bone matter
13:46 and they have to put it through this
13:48 pulverizer to crunch it further down so
13:52 that you can start passing out urns but
13:55 as my buddy who spread his mother's
13:58 ashes I think in the the gorge in
14:01 Colorado on that big bridge you said
14:06 there's all kinds of bone and all kinds
14:07 of stuff
14:08 he also said when he did that he swore
14:12 that the this is a guy believed nothing
14:14 phenomenal right he believed that the
14:17 ashes basically looked like an angel a
14:20 second that it bursts into the air and
14:22 he turned to his wife and said you saw
14:24 that right and his wife's like yeah
14:26 totally so some something to that as
14:29 well but the bone is gone and that
14:33 doesn't make any sense
14:34 because in a Crematory you have to well
14:38 they put a constant fuel source on the
14:40 body to get the flesh to burn away from
14:44 the bone and yes a margin of bone does
14:47 burn away but you get a bunch of it and
14:48 there's some other phenomenons that do
14:50 not occur inside combs that are
14:52 happening inside spontaneous combustion
14:55 cases which we're going to get to the
14:58 other thing is that you'll have
14:59 extremely flammable items extremely
15:03 close to this fire now the fire is
15:06 obviously heated up the house when
15:07 people come into the house they say a
15:10 couple things one the air is very warm
15:13 just like a normal fire but nothing's on
15:15 fire on average what Evers happens
15:18 already happened and it's burned out the
15:20 doorknob is warm sometimes so warm that
15:23 you have to use a towel or a shirt to
15:25 open the door that's pretty hot right
15:28 that's why about a hundred fifty plus
15:31 okay so in some weird mechanism the body
15:38 is sort of just disintegrating burning
15:42 away something that a Crematory can't
15:46 accomplish because if they could they
15:48 would right I mean if they could take a
15:50 three and a half hour process and bring
15:51 it down to 20 minutes you don't think
15:53 they'd do that to make more money
15:54 especially to get rid of the
15:56 buon pulverizer so if it's just again
16:00 it's almost like you know certain days
16:03 in September and 2001 where all these
16:06 events occur that you know all you'd
16:08 have to do to demolish a building is
16:10 light some furniture on fire and the
16:11 whole thing will just come down within
16:12 an hour that's what they told you is
16:14 possible in fact they said that's just
16:16 the way it works okay so I got to do is
16:18 take a dead body according to these
16:20 skeptics and just drop a cigarette butt
16:23 on them just go away for 20 minutes and
16:26 eventually that'll turn it maybe we've
16:27 got to cook the legs at the end but you
16:29 know the rest of it 90% of the jobs done
16:31 for you that's where a skeptic starts to
16:33 fall you know on his face men there's a
16:37 woman named Helen Conway that died in
16:39 1964 this was very interesting because
16:42 she was babysitting her two grandkids
16:44 and because of the grandkids they they
16:50 know when she used to she was an invalid
16:53 so she couldn't walk around so she'd
16:54 ring a bell and one of little kids ran
16:56 up and gave her something I had like a
16:59 twenty-something in the evening and one
17:03 of the neighbors was walking by and
17:04 noticed some light flashing in the room
17:06 up on the second floor comes in knocks
17:09 on the door kid answers the door kid has
17:10 no idea there's been a fire upstairs no
17:15 smoke no heat no nothing they go up and
17:19 they find Helen has completely burned up
17:23 except for her legs she was sitting in a
17:27 chair in a corner but some of the
17:29 firefighters say the corner would really
17:30 augment the fire but when they really
17:34 look at it they're like this woman's
17:35 body is gone like completely gone and
17:39 the back of the chair had actually
17:40 burned this is when the rare cases where
17:41 the the furniture that these people
17:43 wanted burn out Maat also has a bed that
17:46 burned for him but they could tell very
17:48 easily that this woman had been in this
17:51 chair and when it burned she fell
17:54 backwards into the corner so this is the
17:59 case where they know for a fact that
18:01 this woman was only exposed to the fire
18:04 for 20 minutes tops
18:07 and our whole bodies gone where they
18:10 started looking around at the items in
18:12 the room and you will have certain
18:14 things happening where you have like a
18:16 television and they actually explain
18:18 this one fairly decently I think a
18:19 television that was kind of across from
18:22 her the top part of the plastic had
18:24 started melting down the TV but there
18:26 was a doll literally on a little stand
18:30 right next to the TV and it was fine the
18:34 doll is made out of a bunch of super
18:36 flammable plastics when the firefighters
18:39 looked out they said man this thing
18:40 didn't even ignite and if this TV right
18:43 here even through the exposure of the
18:45 flame going up front to the ceiling and
18:47 then crawling down which is what it does
18:50 that you know fire crawls down heat wise
18:52 it's invisible but it's crawling down it
18:55 starts mounting the TV I believe the
18:57 phone to her left next to the Bell had
19:00 also started to melt a little bit like a
19:02 Dali painting you know but one of the
19:05 fire chiefs was interviewed and this is
19:08 one of the guys that said look man I
19:09 have seen this I've seen fires my whole
19:12 life I've seen bodies burned and they
19:15 said that her legs you could tell in the
19:17 black-and-white photographs which I
19:19 think they're only black and whites for
19:21 her that her skin had sort of blistered
19:25 and he said I went up and I popped one
19:30 of the blisters because this is part of
19:32 the forensics to find out whether or not
19:34 the body was alive when this happened or
19:36 dead when this has happened and then
19:38 this happened and she said look the
19:40 blister had moisture in it he said that
19:43 doesn't happen with a person's dead so
19:48 very on the next one we're gonna crawl
19:51 back to 1951 July 2nd a 64 year old
19:55 woman named Mary Reiser
19:56 Arisa burns up all they found was her I
20:02 think her left leg well he can't tell so
20:06 I shouldn't say but again the rest of
20:09 her is vaporized but this is where they
20:12 found a very interesting phenomenon
20:15 which might get to the cause
20:18 was that they said that her skull had
20:21 shrunk to nearly 1/4 of its size hmm
20:27 they said that her skull shrunk so much
20:30 during this combustion situation that
20:34 her facial features were no longer
20:36 discernible because they had all jumbled
20:38 up the skull shrunk hmmm let's put that
20:43 in our back pocket for for now
20:46 fast-forward to 1986 again in Kendall
20:51 Mott mo TT former fireman okay he had
20:58 been suffering some ailments he used to
21:01 be a chronic smoker and he had stopped
21:05 smoking because he was on an oxygen tank
21:08 and of course as soon as you got an
21:09 oxygen tank someone will tell you you
21:11 know do not whatever you do let fire sit
21:15 around you because you know pure oxygen
21:17 is extremely flammable you could cause
21:18 all kinds of fires and explosions with
21:20 your tank etc etc so he was and he ended
21:23 up making his son who still smoked smoke
21:27 outside but now alcohol we don't know
21:31 but this guy lies down in his bed and
21:34 the way they portrayed it in the
21:36 documentary I saw was that he had his
21:38 whole suit on so he had a full
21:40 three-piece suit Hobson been ok he too
21:45 has a shrinking skull issue I believe
21:47 the only thing they found was his right
21:49 calf I think I have that right but he
21:52 was they kind of portrayed him as
21:53 getting into like a like a cite position
21:56 in the bed but when I saw the
21:58 photographs of this thing all you saw
22:02 was just black mass you know and - and
22:05 again in every case the body is gone
22:08 this is a definitive fact about this
22:10 down there are minor cases of tiny bone
22:16 fragments that are left but in terms of
22:19 the crematories of today and what they
22:21 see as a result of the spontaneous
22:22 combustion x' it's day and night in
22:26 terms of the efficiency
22:28 of these fires which starts to aid the
22:32 theory but these fires are occurring
22:35 from the inside of the body out because
22:38 if you could start burning from the
22:39 inside out well I mean just think about
22:42 it you have a moist super moist body
22:44 that somehow is hit a point of burning
22:48 if you burn from the outside in and
22:50 believe me yours truly has probably seen
22:52 I don't even know a few hundred
22:54 photographs of burned bodies I've got
22:57 friends who were you know working for
22:59 paddy wagons for years get telling me
23:01 all these stories about burn victims and
23:05 they're always picking up a body even if
23:08 they crash a cart you know 150 miles an
23:11 hour and the car burst into flames and
23:13 they're not even able to get to the
23:14 flame until it goes out because it's
23:16 down to Malibu Ridge or off the highway
23:19 one somewhere they're picking up bodies
23:22 big pieces big parts and it's always
23:25 there and you've seen the highway of
23:26 death that the a-10s created and you
23:30 know the way back to bag die from
23:31 Kuwait's
23:32 there's always a body there it's always
23:34 something there I don't wanna get into
23:36 the gruesome details but there's always
23:38 a body there and this is this is within
23:41 sinner airy or Cindy airy you know
23:45 ordinance coming in that have gotten
23:47 sulfur flaming on them I mean it's these
23:50 people are being burned up by weapons
23:52 and their bodies are still fully intact
23:53 the poor victims of the Paradise fires
23:56 fully intact well car engine blocks are
24:00 melting out on the ground but we still
24:02 have a body that's fully fully limbed
24:05 and everything no issue but these
24:08 spontaneous combustion folks there's
24:12 only handful of them in history but
24:14 they're gone now I should say that the
24:17 other women that I mentioned had been
24:20 noted as being very careless with their
24:22 cigarettes and that the the helen conway
24:28 woman who was found in the corner when
24:30 they studied her house with the two
24:31 little kids downstairs that the
24:33 furniture had you know burn marks all
24:36 over it so these people have in the past
24:39 dropped a cigarette on themselves one of
24:41 them said
24:42 my mother had at one point dropped the
24:45 cigarette on herself fall had fallen
24:48 asleep and it burned a little round spot
24:50 in her dress and definitely injured her
24:52 stomach region but it didn't you know
24:57 burn a hole inside of her body it just
24:59 had a basically a surface burn of
25:01 third-degree burns right now one of the
25:05 attempts to debunk this is believe it or
25:08 not a sighting of a Charles Dickens book
25:11 where I forgot the name of the story but
25:15 there's a story where they have a bad
25:16 guy you know he's great at writing a
25:18 Scrooge type character right well in the
25:23 at the end of Charles Dickens story he
25:26 talks about he kills the guy off with
25:28 spontaneous combustion as a result I
25:30 believe of liquor consumption because
25:34 this was a sort of a theory the more
25:36 that you drink the more that you put
25:40 some sort of flammable material inside
25:42 your body and at some point you light
25:45 the fuse and all that alcohol that
25:47 flammable alcohol in your body takes
25:50 over ignites and burns you up extremely
25:53 fast such that you you know you burn
25:56 from the inside out you know the only
25:59 story that really differs from this is
26:01 one of Ginny Safin she is in that
26:05 believe the UK and she was sitting at
26:12 the table there were two gentlemen
26:13 watching her one was her in-law and
26:16 which I believe is her it was her it was
26:19 his wife's aunt I think it's the way it
26:22 goes and they were taking care of her
26:24 you know she's just a staple of the
26:26 house she's been there for a long time
26:28 and she she was 61 years old sorry she
26:32 wasn't it was in 1982 she was 61 and
26:34 there was an older man who lived there
26:37 as well who was a pipe smoker and they
26:41 were sitting at the table with her and
26:43 her routine was to look at newspapers
26:45 even though she couldn't read she liked
26:48 to look at the newspapers and she was
26:50 drinking some tea or something like that
26:53 sir she is moistening her mouth
26:56 and they step out because the old man's
26:58 gonna go smoke his pipe in the front
26:59 room
27:00 he had just packed it it goes in the
27:02 front room and then no sooner do they
27:05 the the younger because one of the guys
27:08 is much older I think it was like his
27:10 father or the the wife's father what
27:12 have you he turns around and she is
27:17 breathing fire out of her mouth and so
27:22 he's trying to stop it he's got water
27:23 there he's trying to splash her with
27:25 water but no matter what he does he
27:27 can't put this fire up now if you've
27:29 ever seen people breathe fire which I
27:31 have at various parties where they were
27:33 hired to do so you can blow that flame
27:36 with the oils and stuff to protect your
27:38 body and then if you really did you
27:43 accidentally get too much you know stuff
27:45 gene Simmons fuel in your mouth you
27:47 can't just blow it close your mouth now
27:49 she wasn't mentally straight so she's
27:51 probably not you know aware of just
27:53 suffocating the fire with her mouth but
27:56 this guy's like throwing water at her
27:58 can't get you to stop the old man runs
28:00 back in there trying to get it all
28:01 together she ends up burning quite a bit
28:03 of her face and she ends up dying a
28:08 little later in the hospital now the
28:10 skeptic who steps in to explain this
28:13 completely negates all of the physical
28:16 evidence and completely concoct this
28:18 story based on his own made-up facts
28:23 okay his own made-up story that the old
28:26 man who had just packed the pipe had
28:31 actually I mean get-get how crazy the
28:33 Senate the why do I say cynics but the
28:36 skeptics are this guy says well maybe
28:38 the old man actually dumped out his
28:40 ashes on the windowsill okay and the
28:45 girl is sitting at the table and that
28:46 these ashes flew over and landed like
28:51 the cherry flew over and landed on her
28:53 dress she was unaware of that and it
28:55 burns up the dress and then of course
28:57 the illusion is that as she breached she
28:59 projects the fire Ford and that's all
29:02 you saw pretty sure a dress on fire
29:07 looks a lot different than breathing
29:10 fire and if you look at the picture of
29:12 her in the hospital they have her laying
29:15 down on the bed in her neck up to her
29:17 mouth is completely fine perfect skin
29:20 but the top half of her head is brown
29:23 from the fire damage from the
29:25 third-degree burns so his story doesn't
29:29 make a lot of sense plus the evidence
29:31 the cops were there the fire
29:33 department's there the paramedics are
29:35 there they're gonna look at her dress
29:37 and see you know fire leaves a mark
29:40 because it is burning something with a
29:43 chronological order so if her lap had
29:45 burned first one her legs her thighs and
29:47 her stomach would have definitely burned
29:50 more than her face right because it's
29:54 gonna come up and do this thing so
29:56 complete bullcrap they said that before
30:00 the police came in you know they looked
30:01 inside of her mouth and it was all
30:03 charred inside of her mouth then the
30:05 coroner writes that her mouth was
30:06 totally fine
30:07 so the skeptic jumped on that and moved
30:09 with it but the guy who's there he's
30:11 like look I watched a wonderful human
30:14 being
30:15 die and you know last thing I'm gonna do
30:18 is make up some fact about her you know
30:20 so the big question would be is it
30:24 something that we consume that starts to
30:27 take our blood supply and make it super
30:29 flammable alcohol being one we were
30:34 thinking in my lounge
30:36 we just had some pretty smart people in
30:37 the room and one guy was talking about
30:40 magnesium being very flammable and
30:43 perhaps the diet gets really overwhelmed
30:45 with magnesium then you put the alcohol
30:47 on there someone else was talking about
30:49 fillings being some igniter and of
30:52 course you're smoking cigarettes but
30:53 this woman didn't smoke and this woman
30:56 didn't drink who had this other thing
30:58 happened to her now and she just got
31:01 burned she wasn't killed by the fire she
31:05 said she was killed by the fire but it
31:07 wasn't in the vein of these other
31:09 stories but because Charles Dixon
31:13 Dickens jumped on this story this theory
31:17 to end one of his novels they say look
31:20 there's fiction right there
31:22 Sall this must be fiction hmm but the
31:28 skull shrunk didn't it so let's think
31:31 about this what if it's real because we
31:37 can't prove any of these cases any other
31:40 way because the experts who can prove it
31:44 the forensic scientists the the
31:47 firefighters I mean you know I don't
31:49 know my entire life I don't know about
31:50 you but the forensic science of fire
31:54 cause and effect and detection all this
31:57 other stuff these guys are brilliant
31:59 searching for flammables in fact in all
32:04 these cases the firefighters said look
32:06 they said there's a battery of tests
32:09 that we do every single time a fire
32:10 happens that is sort of unexplained but
32:13 even the ones that are explained we have
32:14 to search for things that people
32:19 theorize and one of the theories with I
32:23 believe the woman with the flame out of
32:27 her mouth you know the one with the
32:30 Kendall Mott the fireman that died on
32:32 his bed I believe that was the case if I
32:36 had that wrong it's just one of the
32:37 other cases it doesn't matter but
32:38 someone said that one of the power
32:40 outlets probably shorted out because as
32:43 fire burns it burns on a v-shaped cone
32:46 towards the ceiling and that makes sense
32:48 something on the grounds burning and as
32:50 fire expands in sort of a liquid
32:52 diffusion environment it's going to
32:55 create this cone that goes up and so
32:57 there's all these photographs of you
32:59 know cones coming up from fires and a
33:02 lot of these homes have those situations
33:05 the woman that died in the corner of her
33:07 house sitting in the chair definitely
33:08 created some sort of you know cone
33:10 against the wall from our own flames but
33:14 in one case someone was like I don't
33:15 know it's that short right there because
33:17 look at the flame against the the wall
33:19 it makes the wall black must have come
33:22 from that power outlet so they pull the
33:24 wall apart check the the actual plug and
33:28 when something shorts it burns black
33:30 inside for sure and so on the other side
33:34 of the wall it's completely fine wood
33:36 the power outlet didn't have any shorts
33:38 in it there's no fire inside the wall at
33:40 all
33:41 so someone speculated incorrectly but if
33:44 you want to just run away from what you
33:46 don't understand whether they be a
33:48 police chief or corner somebody else
33:50 you're gonna just throw anything out
33:52 nobody wants to have anything be
33:54 unexplained so everybody latches on done
33:57 good hey man it's not gonna happen to me
33:58 right nope nope no if this was just an
34:00 iron that was left on it was just a
34:02 power outlet that's shorted shorted out
34:03 and you know obviously the numbers don't
34:07 support this being a huge epidemic issue
34:10 another one they speculated was it was
34:13 the fat and the body of a human body and
34:17 again what doesn't make any sense about
34:19 this is because they conducted this
34:21 experiment where they wrapped some bone
34:23 and a bunch of pork fat and then let it
34:26 burn one it took an extremely long time
34:29 to happen - it doesn't get rid of the
34:32 bone again there's fat people that died
34:36 or overweight people who died and they
34:39 put them in the Crematory and it
34:40 actually increases the time it could be
34:43 up to four and a half hours instead of
34:45 three and a half hours because they have
34:46 so much body fat to get rid of but this
34:49 one woman burns up in 20 minutes
34:52 Helen okay so what on earth could cause
34:58 this so they they exhaust all of the
35:03 conventional sciences around this thing
35:05 because they just can't come up with
35:06 anything and they start kind of reaching
35:09 out to other cultures to find out as
35:11 this happened in China as this happened
35:13 in India you know it happened any other
35:14 place in the world where someone has an
35:16 enlightened brain they can explain this
35:20 and so there's a few different theories
35:22 but I tell you what one of them click
35:24 with my brain really really well and it
35:27 was the in the eastern hemisphere of
35:32 Eurasia sort of your Indian verse all
35:35 the way to China where they have beliefs
35:38 in either the chakras or the Chi the Chi
35:42 is really just nothing more than an
35:44 acknowledgment of the human biology
35:46 processing ether winds that's what it is
35:49 and it's
35:50 it's brilliant that they have the
35:51 wherewithal to give it a name and use it
35:56 in their theories the chakras are a much
36:01 more elaborate version of the chesse
36:02 chakras aligned to all of your glands
36:05 and you know it's really one of these I
36:09 think processing points of how the human
36:12 body manifests ether winds into various
36:15 functions and perhaps even the lucidity
36:18 of your mind
36:19 by your pineal gland in your brain okay
36:25 but now what am I always telling you
36:27 guys about you and ether I will go
36:32 through the hughes explanation but you
36:33 are being renewed every quantum moment
36:36 of time by ether you know one of the
36:41 ways you could potentially view it as
36:44 the ether is obviously everywhere in the
36:47 universe hitting you from all angles
36:49 maybe you're getting renewed from all
36:51 angles a bit of nothing else your spinal
36:55 cord might be actually able to maintain
36:58 some sort of Fibonacci alignment of
37:01 ether going through your third eye maybe
37:05 through our forehead maybe through our
37:06 skull maybe through all of our inputs
37:10 processing and then going down through
37:12 all of our glands because the Chinese
37:14 believe that the chakra are that well
37:16 excuse me the Chi is really in the base
37:18 of your spine but they also believe that
37:21 the bottom of your feet are where most
37:24 of the toxins come out of your body
37:25 which is why there's such an alignment
37:27 between the foot and all the different
37:29 regions of your foot and the health of
37:31 your overall body which is interesting
37:34 if one of your organs isn't functioning
37:37 properly
37:37 then that part of your foot isn't
37:40 healthy and so when they're feeling your
37:42 feet they're like oh wow this is not
37:43 right this means your spleen is having
37:45 an issue and they'll glow up and give
37:47 you some sort of abdominal massage so
37:49 that you can kind of get that worked out
37:52 again the Russians believe in meridian
37:55 line massage which is not a massage to
37:58 get into deep muscle tissue but to
38:00 simply have someone who's very aligned
38:03 themselves
38:03 they are very peaceful they play really
38:05 peaceful music I've seen these centers
38:07 that do it where they just really are
38:10 moving their hands from your origin
38:13 points down to your exit points all over
38:15 your limbs you're fully dressed and
38:17 they're fully dressed and they just work
38:19 on you and that for a certain period of
38:21 time I do not know how long they
38:23 actually do that but that makes complete
38:25 sense if nothing else your circulatory
38:28 system which provides your immune system
38:30 to every region of your body needs that
38:32 sort of you know free-flowing immune
38:38 system slash blood supply to fix
38:40 everything in your body but also
38:42 remember you're a very electrical being
38:43 and so someone else's hand pulling down
38:47 your body well it's like taking static
38:48 cling out of something so I started
38:52 thinking about the ether winds now when
38:56 we covered antimatter and then took all
39:00 the you know official definitions of
39:03 antimatter and then we applied the ether
39:06 model to it we talked about the
39:09 unraveling of eath of antimatter in this
39:11 universe expelling a tremendous amount
39:14 of energy right one gram of antimatter
39:16 being turned into a bomb turns into a 43
39:19 Megaton bomb at a minimum alright that's
39:23 a huge release of energy from one gram
39:25 of any substance on planet Earth
39:28 that's cool to know but now imagine you
39:32 have these little power supplies inside
39:35 your body now believe it's that was the
39:39 hypothalamus and your mind and your
39:41 brain area which regulates a lot of
39:45 energy production is also regulated by
39:47 your emotional state so some folks say
39:50 well look it's just the human being
39:52 getting so utterly depressed that they
39:55 have created a thought process which is
39:58 then metabolized in the electricity in
40:00 their body in such a way that there's a
40:03 feedback loop that ignites the fire
40:05 inside you ignites an unraveling of who
40:10 you are as a human being the skull
40:13 shrinking thing which wasn't mentioned
40:16 until the very end of this
40:17 mentoree started to connect the dots in
40:20 my mind because I'm as soon as I heard
40:22 about unexplained internal fires and
40:24 something that is art extremely wet the
40:27 inside of your body is perfectly
40:28 suitable to put out fires let alone
40:30 start one so whatever is happening if it
40:34 is truly a spontaneous combustion
40:37 meaning a fire from the inside out
40:40 whether it be catalyzed by smoking
40:43 providing a flame or alcohol providing a
40:47 blood thinner plus an accelerant that
40:51 might you know flame out depending on
40:54 what you're drinking right then you have
40:57 already a condition with perhaps even
41:01 body fat might play a role but I think
41:04 body fat doesn't account for the
41:06 Expediency of the destruction of the
41:08 human body with the Helen Conway who
41:12 dies in a corner in 20 minutes and her
41:14 body is completely vaporized and gone
41:15 and the fire is always out every single
41:18 time they find these individuals except
41:20 for the girl that breathed the fire now
41:23 there been a lot of witnesses saying
41:25 that people breathes fire here and there
41:29 he you know you seen enough kids at bars
41:32 who don't understand that those flaming
41:34 shots you know what you're supposed to
41:36 do is blow it out before you drink it
41:38 but these kids don't understand so
41:40 they're drinking a flaming shot and of
41:42 course it's burning them up at the same
41:43 time it's going right their nasal canal
41:45 which is probably the most painful
41:47 places to be on fire and then of course
41:49 they start spilling on themselves and
41:51 it's just it's silly I mean when first
41:54 time I ever saw that dump properly it
41:57 was like oh yeah just you know you flame
41:59 it out which makes it really hot which
42:00 you know can ferment two sugars in a
42:03 really weird way to burn the sugars and
42:05 so when you're drinking has a weird
42:06 flavor but you're not supposed to drink
42:08 it while it's on fire okay newsflash man
42:12 now in some cases they do have spinal
42:16 cords that seem to survive but what
42:20 would make a a skull shrink I mean we
42:24 see burned-out skulls all the time in
42:26 war again some big bomb hits somewhere
42:30 in the world during war a bunch of
42:33 bodies are utterly consumed
42:35 instantaneously blown to pieces burn
42:37 burn burn burn burn before anything
42:39 happens you don't find a bunch of
42:41 shrunken bodies if shrunken bodies were
42:44 the result of fire then this would be a
42:48 known fact and wouldn't baffle anyone
42:50 and there wouldn't be any spontaneous
42:51 combustion footnotes about and the skull
42:54 was like really teeny oh really it was
42:56 his beetlejuice or something you know I
42:59 haven't studied head-shrinking in Africa
43:03 and South America but there is some way
43:05 you can dehydrate the hell out of a
43:06 skull supposedly make it shrink never
43:09 hurt anyone really explained that but
43:10 perhaps it has to do with some
43:12 smoldering fire but I never would
43:15 imagine they would be like okay in 20
43:16 minutes your skull is gonna be 1/4 of
43:18 its size so really cut my head off great
43:20 um but we're always saying that you know
43:25 there's more space between the particles
43:28 of ether that spin into atoms then the
43:35 amount of you know space that we
43:36 actually occupy so there's more space in
43:38 my body than there is any substance
43:42 claiming to be hard mess so if you could
43:48 just shrink the orbits of all of these
43:51 particles that make up the human body
43:53 then you could technically do the
43:55 shrinking ray on someone even want them
43:57 with them alive and they would have
43:59 everything that they typically use it
44:01 would just be I can shrink you because
44:03 you don't need all that space okay but
44:08 what about spontaneous combustion I mean
44:10 it's not a shrink ray the both the MOT
44:13 gentlemen and the the other woman which
44:19 I can't reach what it is but they have
44:21 these shrunken skulls well one of the
44:25 things that my physics teacher taught me
44:26 in high school was that when they got
44:29 done doing nuclear tests a nuclear test
44:32 they would go down to Ground Zero and
44:35 grab I beams and a bunch of materials
44:38 that were there they got exposed to the
44:39 actual explosion and then they would
44:42 check them for density
44:44 and find out that evenly throughout not
44:47 just thermal conversion meaning
44:49 something melted away right but all
44:52 throughout the being when they do cross
44:53 sections of the beam but a bunch of the
44:55 atomic matter that was there has
44:57 thermalized and gone away but completely
45:00 through the object now I never heard
45:03 that it actually shrunk but think about
45:07 it you have this heartbeat that is
45:10 created by your heart which is obviously
45:12 moving blood around your body so that we
45:14 can remain alive we have our brain
45:16 taking a little CPU clock so we can have
45:20 some consciousness as our soul you know
45:23 symbiotically attaches to the body so
45:26 that we can have a state of
45:27 consciousness aka the mind as though
45:31 there's a lot going on here and you know
45:34 you can't lean on medical science to
45:36 research anything that is real because
45:39 again medical science and science
45:41 science if they don't have a machine
45:44 that tracks it because no one's
45:45 conceived of the thing to track and even
45:50 if they could conceive of it but can't
45:51 create the machine these individuals
45:55 have such egos and such little fragile
45:59 hearts that they cannot acknowledge that
46:02 there's any mystery in the universe
46:03 unless it's some giant macro thing like
46:06 the universe but still they throw out
46:08 the Big Bang dark matter black holes bla
46:10 bla bla they always try to compensate
46:12 for everything all right but if we could
46:17 through thought process and maybe body
46:19 toxification interrupt this natural
46:23 renewing ecosystem that we have with the
46:26 universe right I'm willing to bet that
46:30 we could create a spin pattern that is
46:35 or a pattern that is going to counteract
46:39 the natural flow of energy in the human
46:42 body and cause some sort of argument
46:46 between the two flows and then you get
46:50 chaos chaos
46:54 would start to free ether of particles
46:57 from its it's slow moving or at least
47:00 its confined force model meaning it
47:05 normally a particle of ether goes by
47:08 your face at 50 50 times the speed of
47:10 light and you never see it and it's just
47:11 gone before you know it's even there
47:13 okay
47:14 you are made out of things that are in
47:16 loops and so it's there and you have a
47:20 little bit of stability because you have
47:24 trapped this stuff that is now creating
47:28 this illusion of force it actually is
47:32 force but it's sort of like a crowd
47:34 again you can walk down the street in
47:36 New Orleans on Bourbon Street and say
47:39 you know April no problem
47:42 you go there at Mardi Gras and you can't
47:44 why can't you because there's a bunch of
47:45 people in the way and if you're in the
47:47 crowd and they decide to move it's so
47:50 densely packed that I've had friends of
47:52 mine get their shoulders pushed so hard
47:54 grown men who weigh 180 to 220 pounds
47:58 lift it off the ground their feet are in
48:00 the granny more and they're just moving
48:01 down the street because the compression
48:03 on the bodies is so intense
48:05 what's the same exact thing with all
48:07 mass and energy in the universe well we
48:11 know that fire occurs right we know that
48:16 you know heat is an agitated verb of a
48:23 solid quote-unquote turning into a
48:26 thermal discharge right the candle wick
48:29 is completely fine into you light it and
48:32 then if you put your finger by it you
48:34 start to crackle and crack because
48:36 you're burning a third-degree burn you
48:39 turn back into what you're made out of
48:41 which is black carbon but most of us
48:45 know that if you were to take a sheet of
48:48 paper it's very flammable and burn it
48:51 and just keep it in the ashtray keep it
48:54 in some fireplace or something where you
48:56 get the whole sheet of paper there and
48:58 then you reach up to touch it after it's
49:00 sort of cooled off you know what that's
49:02 like it turns into ash
49:04 it's all over your fingers like soot
49:07 what happened to it it was all solid at
49:10 one point and now it's all carbon well
49:14 obviously things are flammable because
49:16 of this verb called fire which is
49:18 created by friction which is a process
49:21 of what freeing the energy that's inside
49:25 this stuff well really you're just
49:26 freeing the ether and as it speeds up to
49:28 escape its previous confines of what we
49:32 call matter it's like having a hate it's
49:35 like what B and it's turning into fire
49:37 and fires just the the transition
49:40 between that orbital loop that may
49:43 actually slow it down not sure and then
49:46 speeding way back up again piercing all
49:49 of the thresholds of speed and by the
49:52 time it's at the tip of the fire of tip
49:54 of the flame is moving so quick that you
49:58 no longer have a heat signature you no
50:00 longer have the ability to grab it in
50:03 any way shape or form it's gone now of
50:07 course because heat rises due to the way
50:10 that the atmosphere is designed you will
50:12 get a funnel of some of the carbon
50:14 that's literally so light that this
50:18 siphoning sucking thermal discharge
50:20 starts to create pressure zones and you
50:23 know heat attracts to cold well of
50:27 course he'd attracts the cold he'd
50:28 attracting to cold could be easily
50:30 explained by the front door Black Friday
50:32 all those people are outside the store
50:36 is stationary inside the products don't
50:39 move around like human beings so there's
50:40 plenty of room to run around
50:41 well since the door opens all these
50:43 people come running in where else are
50:45 they gonna run they're gonna run back
50:46 towards the crowd hell no crowds like
50:48 this crazy agitated thing well that's
50:51 basically what is it the third law of
50:53 thermodynamics but now why haven't they
50:57 been able to go any further than oh she
51:01 dropped a cigarette on herself you know
51:04 was that the cherry from a pipe flew off
51:07 a windowsill into a dress why aren't
51:09 they able to go any further than that in
51:11 the first world modern know everything
51:15 culture
51:17 I think it's because they can't conceive
51:19 of it if it is a deed something
51:21 different than those sort of ignore all
51:24 the facts stories that the skeptics come
51:26 up with but now what if we were able to
51:30 in the deep thoughts University what if
51:34 we were able to acknowledge that as a
51:36 group we look at every single case on
51:38 earth we look at toxicology reports we
51:44 look at we interview all the family
51:46 members we look at the grocery lists we
51:48 look at every single thing and find out
51:50 what these individuals most likely had
51:53 in their body as every form of liquid or
51:55 solid that they might have consumed for
51:57 the last 12 months before their death
52:00 may be an extreme case the family is so
52:03 interested in finding out what happened
52:04 they allow us to exhume the leg tissue
52:08 that is still there and do another
52:11 biopsy on it and figure it out run it
52:13 through other tests right so we have a
52:16 hypothesis perhaps of this ether all
52:20 sort of argument in the body well we
52:24 certainly can't test it on living beings
52:26 and you certainly can't get a positive
52:28 out of someone who's dead so we would
52:31 have to create some sort of experiment
52:33 well some of the room might say well you
52:36 know what because I can light a fire we
52:41 actually do have pure evidence that this
52:44 is how it works but we don't have is the
52:47 spark moment of this argument within the
52:51 human body between the largely depressed
52:55 individual who feels like they're at the
52:57 end of their life because some of these
53:00 people felt like that was the case some
53:02 of them did not now the woman that is 60
53:07 was 61 in 1982 they said that her sister
53:11 had just passed away in a couple weeks
53:13 earlier and that maybe she had lost her
53:15 will to live but simply couldn't express
53:17 it because of her her mental handicap
53:21 mm-hmm that's interesting
53:23 everyone seems to have some sort of
53:26 story now the Helen Conway who dies in a
53:28 chair upstairs with two granddaughters
53:30 two
53:30 stairs not sure it's an interesting sort
53:34 of psychological profile that you know I
53:37 don't have any grandkids yet but I
53:39 guarantee you when I do I'm gonna be one
53:41 happy dude playing with these kids and
53:43 having a great time I can't imagine
53:44 getting just some cynical point where I
53:48 can't use them as a buffer for any bad
53:51 day that I might have me but my wife
53:53 just recently died I'm depressed maybe
53:56 my wife left me or whatever it is and
53:59 I'm in some you know some bad state but
54:01 kids are a perfect way to just offset
54:03 that but not everyone has that opinion
54:05 this woman could have been up there she
54:08 obviously was not with her grandchildren
54:11 she was upstairs smoking in her room I
54:14 assume watching television because
54:16 otherwise she would have been staring at
54:18 the wall but now let's let's take into
54:24 account because one of the Pirkle facts
54:26 on the table other than the girl that
54:29 breathes fire in the kitchen who already
54:31 has a mental alignment issue internally
54:34 okay god bless her when you're
54:38 intoxicated what actually occurs when
54:40 you're consuming alcohol now people have
54:42 different you know results as a result
54:44 of consuming alcohol and all cases of
54:46 course the reason why you feel
54:49 intoxicated when you drink alcohol is
54:51 that the nice thick red blood that you
54:55 need to have great sentient thought has
54:58 been diluted by a foreign substance that
55:01 is able to enter your bloodstream
55:03 alcohol you know again even though
55:07 alcohol is in a lot of remedies from the
55:09 babylonian times up I have been told
55:11 categorically that when alcohol touches
55:14 the human liver it will destroy cells
55:16 and there's no other eventualities at
55:20 all you will destroy your liver the more
55:22 that you drink okay so it's kind of
55:24 destructive but now we also track the
55:28 human mind and its frequencies right
55:30 they do is for dream testing EKGs all
55:33 kinds of things trying to find out how
55:35 sentence you are with your brain when
55:37 someone comes in with a severe injury to
55:39 the Unova head or the spine they're
55:42 always checking the brain waves to make
55:43 sure the
55:44 and hasn't you know achieved brain death
55:47 but now imagine we and the deep thought
55:51 Institute start to just have people
55:54 drink and or we just look at previous
55:56 studies and make sure the granularity is
55:59 there that we are interested in and we
56:01 start to look at the Delta between zero
56:04 and toxicated brain waves and
56:06 intoxicated brain waves and start to try
56:09 to find the delta what is the difference
56:12 is there any difference whatsoever I
56:14 mean you would think there would
56:15 definitely be a difference right
56:17 well that Delta if it is at all a
56:21 culprit would have some physical effect
56:24 on most likely the nervous system of the
56:27 body they could start triggering some
56:32 sort of thermal discharge internally it
56:34 starts arguing with the body's natural
56:36 composition its natural frequency you
56:40 know again all these people who get sick
56:44 and die who are abusing drugs again
56:48 cocaine heroin rush or weeds in that
56:50 category but you know all these things
56:53 methamphetamines etc down the line they
56:56 always look did you really think you're
56:59 going to be able to put all this
57:00 chemistry in your body altering the way
57:02 your body normally behaves and there
57:04 wouldn't be any repercussions whatsoever
57:06 did you really think that that was
57:07 possible because it's not possible you
57:10 may not do enough to create permanent
57:12 damage to your body or the permanent
57:15 damage that you do is so ancillary to
57:18 your overall function you don't really
57:20 notice it
57:21 perhaps your relatives do grandpa used
57:24 to be really sharp until you really
57:25 drink himself away I've got some friends
57:27 I know that we're pretty sharp dudes
57:30 spoke clearly enunciated
57:33 their syllables went off and in their
57:37 20s managed to do so much drugs that
57:44 they now seem like they are permanent
57:47 stoners you know that whole Spicoli
57:51 character in Fast Times at Ridgemont
57:53 High you know the whole thing
57:56 everybody knows someone like
57:57 this who is utterly damaged their mind
58:01 permanently I got a buddy of mine I mean
58:03 you know he's a buddy mind from high
58:05 school and everybody knows him everyone
58:08 loves the guy to death but they're
58:10 always looking at each other like me and
58:11 the guy fried his brain didn't he which
58:14 is strange because I've got friends who
58:15 are you know rockers and they I've done
58:21 mountains of cocaine you know they've
58:23 done you know what is it Keith Richards
58:26 I don't know how much he's consumed of
58:28 his own bodyweight and heroin he
58:30 definitely has a dose to him by a doctor
58:32 so he keeps himself out of the fatality
58:35 issue but he's always on heroin I mean
58:38 he says it he seems to be a pretty
58:41 amazing rocker I watched him play live
58:42 about 20 years ago and my god
58:47 you know you wouldn't know these dudes
58:48 were approaching their 70s at the time
58:52 so whatever the situation is if it is
58:55 anything truly supernatural then it is
58:58 extremely difficult to create this sort
59:03 of one-in-a-million configuration where
59:06 the body does end up burning itself down
59:10 nothing explains the flames because I've
59:15 just drawing the bones because I think
59:17 the Crematory goes up to about 1600
59:21 degrees Fahrenheit and holds maintains
59:25 fuel for three and a half hours on
59:28 average you put two bodies in there and
59:30 I read about that a long time we're
59:31 going to do some other research on
59:35 claims of that sort of thing happening
59:37 in history and they said you don't know
59:39 if you put two bodies in there it goes
59:41 up by several hours so it's not quite
59:43 twice but it's definitely slows it down
59:47 so it really feels like something legit
59:51 is up and I think if you watch the the
59:54 face-to-face interviews with the police
59:56 chiefs who were on the scene who
60:00 investigated it for months who never
60:03 came up with any conclusion that made
60:04 any sense watch the corners and the
60:08 pathologist's and the
60:10 cause of death as dictated by the
60:13 hospitals ignoring empirical facts about
60:16 these bodies so that they could close
60:19 the case and move on I mean the person
60:21 is dead what are you gonna do but having
60:23 no scientific community
60:25 you know swoop in black suits swoop in
60:27 and go okay okay you know obviously your
60:30 loved one has passed on but we have been
60:32 trying to figure out why this occurs I
60:35 mean could you imagine making some it's
60:39 probably in the in fact there was a
60:40 fringe episode about spontaneous
60:42 combustion in fringe everything is
60:46 derived well not everything but a bunch
60:48 of things are derived from military
60:51 weapons that someone created usually dr.
60:53 bishop and it comes back to haunt them
60:56 20 years later or something like that
60:59 but it's interesting these cases come
61:01 and go and doesn't seem to be any
61:02 outside agency the slightest bit
61:04 interested in it and that that sort of
61:07 fascinates me I mean if you had if you
61:10 had a UFO sighting with as much you know
61:15 eyes on the ground witnesses as you have
61:20 with spontaneous combustion I can
61:22 guarantee you if if I'm filming this
61:25 show and the UFO shows up and hid behind
61:27 me and lands and we both look at it
61:30 because I got it on the tape and then I
61:33 air it on YouTube oh my god guys look
61:36 what just happened ten minutes ago I
61:38 would have black suits at my door within
61:41 seconds that video would be erased I
61:44 would be interrogated maybe I'd have to
61:46 join the queue clearance folks or
61:49 whatever because something would have
61:52 happened you know it here's the other
61:55 thing if it's just a cigarette that
61:59 drops on your body then we would be
62:04 having spontaneous combustion in every
62:07 city around the world at least once a
62:10 year right someone is going to smoke in
62:13 their house drop the cigarette on
62:14 themselves smoke in their car all it's
62:17 parked they're drunk and they're gonna
62:19 have the same sort of flame out as well
62:22 one could take
62:24 I mean maybe you have to be alive to
62:25 make it how much system a kitty since if
62:27 it's not supernatural /e throw based
62:29 rate you can take a corpse and dress
62:32 them up a fresh one you know put a
62:36 cigarette on them poof they go up there
62:38 it is right there
62:39 it's all video you want to see it it's
62:40 pretty gross but you can see it and then
62:43 you know what you can shut down all the
62:44 crematories in the world or you could
62:46 redo them because all you need is a pack
62:47 of cigarettes and some good loincloth
62:50 and poof there just burned all the way
62:52 up no problem the difference in the
62:56 theory to remember is the difference
62:59 between external fire and internal fire
63:02 that's the huge difference between these
63:05 two theories of just someone who's in a
63:07 fire who perishes you know a lot of
63:11 people perish simply due to the smoke
63:14 inhalation and then their bodies lit
63:16 burn later on which is why that guy
63:17 popped the blisters on the leg because
63:19 if it's someone who was dead beforehand
63:23 the body stops moving and usually the
63:26 whole body goes up on the outside and
63:28 there's plenty left over that's not the
63:32 case it's not the case but imagine you
63:37 could burn the skull from the inside out
63:41 and so this shrinking skull thing is so
63:47 efficient I'll go research how they
63:50 actually claim to do that in the in the
63:53 jungles but if you could burn it from
63:56 the inside out you would think that as
63:58 well as you know let's say fire does
64:02 shrink skulls I've never seen it ever in
64:05 my life with all these other things I've
64:07 ever seen but if you were to burn say
64:10 the front of the skull first but leave
64:13 the back isn't burning yet then you
64:14 would have the front shrink before the
64:16 back and then you'd have a rupture you'd
64:18 have pieces of a skull because it'd be
64:20 cracking and popping at different rates
64:21 right but to have the whole thing go
64:24 down at one level one dimension the back
64:27 is also small as the front inside out
64:32 burning would be the most efficient way
64:34 to pull that off and I think about it
64:38 you can put a match out on your tongue
64:40 people eat cigarettes as a part of a
64:42 novelty back in the 50s to get rid of
64:45 them you know and something else about
64:48 the cherry in the pipe yes when you
64:53 smoke you pack a pipe in fact it's funny
64:58 go watch if you're curious if this is
65:00 true videos on how to smoke a pipe find
65:04 yourself a little 10 minute five minute
65:05 video and watch it I guarantee you but a
65:09 big portion of how to smoke a pipe is
65:12 how to keep the damn thing lit I'm
65:15 smoking this cigar on this show and I've
65:17 smoked hundreds of them run on the show
65:19 one of the biggest reasons why you
65:21 constantly hear the lighter is that if I
65:24 talk too long which isn't that long at
65:26 all the cherry inside here which is a
65:29 little kernel of fire will go out and I
65:33 got to relight it again well pipes are
65:35 about ten times more sensitive to that
65:37 whole thing because it's simply the wood
65:40 around the pipe and so if you were to
65:43 let a pipe sit for my god you know again
65:46 the guy wasn't smoking ahead of time
65:48 that was the big thing because he would
65:49 have been in the front room he would
65:51 have come in to repack but nobody does
65:53 that nobody keeps her tobacco in the
65:55 kitchen I mean maybe if you forgot but
65:57 you always had that little nook in your
65:59 front room where you smoke and you've
66:00 got your your what is it your flavored
66:05 tobacco out front and then you've got
66:08 your pipe now I would say that because I
66:11 go to a smoke lounge nearly every single
66:12 day of my life at this point of my life
66:16 we have you know two guys will share an
66:20 ashtray almost all the time what we're
66:23 dumping alright you know ashes in there
66:24 putting put Bing but at the very end of
66:28 the night we're typically all timing our
66:30 cigars typically around the same exact
66:33 time and you know it's funny no one ever
66:36 talks about this you look at another
66:38 guy's cigar and you'll see his is long
66:40 or here's a short sometimes you if
66:43 there's if your cigars are so different
66:45 you won't do anything to speed yours up
66:47 because you're paying ten bucks for it
66:49 or whatever more
66:50 but a lot of times we light up at the
66:52 same time we end around the same time
66:53 this is like you know within 10 minutes
66:55 both of us are done smoking our cigars
66:57 and we'll put them out in the esterday
67:00 we don't even we don't push them like a
67:02 cigarette you just toss them in and
67:04 sometimes it'll continue smoking a
67:07 little bit out of the ashtray but then
67:10 as a courtesy to the process we someone
67:18 will pick up the ashtray and go dump it
67:19 in the trash
67:20 well the trash is full of everything
67:22 it's full of everyone's lunch it's full
67:25 of paper napkins that have already dried
67:27 out and at no point man has the trash
67:31 just burst into flames it's never
67:33 happened the guys running my smoke
67:37 lounge has been doing it for nearly 20
67:39 years at least 15 solid hookah pipes
67:43 with all kinds of those little kernels I
67:45 mean the you know the bricks that burn
67:48 the coals that burn never had trash fire
67:51 ever I asked him once ok so you know
67:56 again some of these theories are really
67:58 flimsy so I just wanted to tell you that
67:59 so if you hear that theory you're gonna
68:00 be like yeah that doesn't really happen
68:02 everything I watched probably by 5 to 10
68:07 videos once to learn how to smoke pipes
68:09 I've never smoked a pipe in my life but
68:11 I was really curious and when I found
68:13 out how unbelievably difficult it is to
68:16 keep a pipe going I did want to get into
68:18 it
68:18 I literally just was like me no thanks I
68:21 don't need that hassle hard you got a
68:23 house while trying to keep my cigar lit
68:24 and it's way easier to keep lit than a
68:26 pipe so I'd be interested in your
68:28 theories it's a really strange thing you
68:35 know I think the the part of it that's
68:38 really weird but it's sort of morbid and
68:41 comforting at the same time is that we
68:44 don't hear other than the woman that was
68:46 breathing the fire and the guy and this
68:48 was at the 1400s who said he was
68:50 breathing fire that you know the
68:51 witnesses whatever that's a long time
68:54 ago but other than that these people
68:58 they don't seem to have a moment when
69:01 they're screaming for help
69:03 the okay so Beatrice who burns up by
69:06 herself kill no mont burns up by himself
69:09 tragic situations right but if you have
69:12 someone who is struggling there's
69:14 typically a sign of struggling because
69:17 they could bought it richard pryor
69:18 ooh some of you don't know in the late
69:23 70s early 80s he was freebasing cocaine
69:26 and which means cooking it on a spoon
69:29 and then I think injecting in himself I
69:31 think that was the method he was using
69:32 but whatever he was doing he caught
69:35 himself on fire and must have spilled it
69:39 I don't know how he did it but I guess
69:41 freebasing leads to a fair amount of
69:44 people burning themselves up miss miss
69:46 possum goes by here okay he ends up he
69:51 said he goes look I wanted to die of a
69:53 heart attack and so he got up and he ran
69:57 and he said you know he's just running
69:59 past people one of the fire chief's who
70:02 talked about the fact that this these
70:04 bodies are way different than any other
70:06 bodies he's ever seen he goes look we've
70:08 been called well this guy had been
70:09 called on a self-immolation case where
70:14 someone poured gasoline on themselves or
70:16 someone to pour gasoline on someone else
70:19 in some murder thing and lit them on
70:21 fire like themselves so far okay there's
70:24 no situation where these individuals
70:27 just burn to ash it never happens I've
70:30 seen unfortunately dozens of videos of
70:33 these people who like themselves on fire
70:35 which I can never ever understand I mean
70:39 your body's your temple and man I don't
70:42 know if there's any cause on planet
70:43 earth worth destroying the vessel you
70:46 live in you know it just as a bit of
70:49 fire safety while we're on it I
70:50 mentioned this maybe once before but
70:52 since we're on the subject I went to a
70:55 funny ass thing I just arrived in Kansas
70:58 on some trip and my uncle and aunt it
71:02 was 4th of July and I arrived a few days
71:04 early and my uncle and aunt said well
71:07 you know what we're going to this fire
71:09 prevention thing today downtown
71:12 Mainstreet my little tiny hometown and
71:15 they're gonna have food they
71:16 and so we're going which is just a funny
71:18 how that's a luring and the kids pizzas
71:21 or something like that it was cool and
71:23 the dude was selling these really nice
71:26 fire detectors for your house and they
71:29 were super cool and they were actually
71:31 way more advanced than the ones that we
71:33 you know typically buy at Walmart or
71:34 whatever because it sends co2 and which
71:37 a lot of them do this today right carbon
71:38 monoxide poisoning and stuff but he said
71:42 he taught us some things that I think
71:44 were fascinating and you know when
71:47 you're a kid if you have any fire
71:49 training in school they always tell you
71:50 okay get down on the ground
71:52 ASAP if you go into a house that's on
71:55 fire you cannot walk in upright now if
72:00 you have a firefighter in your family
72:01 you will have heard this probably quite
72:04 a bit but the main cause of death is the
72:08 cooking of the sacs in your lungs you
72:12 all know these little cauliflower things
72:13 that are in the center of our lungs and
72:17 if they get damaged then you die because
72:23 no matter how much oxygen you physically
72:25 breathe in none of it's turning into
72:28 oxygen anymore in your body it's not
72:30 getting into your bloodstream and so
72:32 you're suffocating completely alive and
72:36 to a degree that sounds bad and pay
72:39 attention boys and girls if you wake up
72:43 and your house has got a lot of smoke
72:45 and of course there's all the the
72:48 telltale signs one you need an escape
72:49 route from every single room in your
72:51 house so if you have that room that is
72:54 doesn't have any windows you need to
72:57 really think about how much time you
72:58 spend in that room for any prolonged
73:00 period of time and if you do have to get
73:03 out you're gonna have to know exactly
73:04 what right left straight turned you're
73:06 gonna go to get out of that house but of
73:09 course you're feeling doors to feel if
73:10 they're hot see if it's right on the
73:12 other side of the door no matter what
73:14 you have to follow these rules okay
73:15 touch doorknobs see if they're really
73:18 hot because it could be right outside
73:20 your your house there I mean I swear to
73:24 God if I had a with what I know now if I
73:26 had a room that was literally
73:29 you know no windows I get an axe and put
73:33 it in the room
73:33 find out which which wall is possible
73:38 and I'd start just cutting a [ __ ]
73:39 hole in the window and it's cutting the
73:40 hole in the wall and get the hell out of
73:42 there
73:42 if you're in a basement kind think about
73:44 it you're really a bad situation but you
73:48 want to literally put your belly on the
73:49 ground ground as much as you possibly
73:51 can if you know you've seen all those
73:55 old you know the toy soldiers and the
73:57 soldiers will go through basic training
73:58 they teach you how to crawl on your hand
74:00 you know and your elbows and your knees
74:02 that's kind of how you have to do it get
74:05 down as low as possible if you have to
74:07 take a breath literally put your face on
74:08 the freaking carpet and just take a nice
74:10 deep breath hold it haul ass of course
74:13 we have kids and stuff it's another
74:15 nightmare of logistical stuff but you
74:18 got teach your kids how to get out of a
74:19 window too
74:20 but as long as you can get outside you
74:22 can go through their window and ink them
74:24 out right but yeah the big thing is
74:27 never stand up in a fire I never try to
74:30 go into a burning building standing up
74:32 if you really feel like you got to do it
74:34 and it's funny thing is if you watch
74:35 footage of buildings that are on fire
74:38 you'll notice that even if black plumes
74:40 are coming out of a front door there's
74:42 usually like about you know ten inches
74:44 or so or more at the bottom that is
74:48 completely clear but again if you have
74:51 huge bellowing smoke there's a poor
74:52 article out where a little boy went in
74:54 to save his puppy recently and he got
74:57 nailed by the heat and it killed him you
74:58 know yeah so he's to the ground have
75:02 your escape plan figured out if your
75:04 kids are up on the second floor get one
75:06 of those cool little ladders and of
75:08 course teach them to look outside and
75:10 the flames are coming about you can
75:12 actually do something else but I mean
75:14 even just jumping out of a window and
75:15 breaking your legs it you'll be alive
75:18 you'll heal up you'll be just fine
75:20 it's better than burning up trust me
75:23 anyway but I wanted to do this episode
75:24 for quite a while
75:26 every time I think about it I forgot to
75:27 put it in my my phone list of episodes
75:30 to do but once we went through this at
75:33 the smoke lounge and I came home did
75:34 more research I was fascinated to find
75:36 out it went back as far as it did and of
75:39 course the Charles Dickens way of
75:41 dismissing it
75:42 I mean there's literally an article
75:44 online I found where this is FBI debunks
75:46 a spontaneous combustion and you go into
75:49 the article and it talks about all
75:50 because Charles Dickens wrote that book
75:53 a long time ago see it's all fake it's
75:56 like dude no one's trying to I mean you
75:58 know this is really happening
76:00 sorry FBI if that's truly endorsed by
76:02 them which I'm not convinced it is we're
76:04 just trying to avoid burning up a tie
76:07 chair you know it's like but okay so
76:12 what has it occurred is kids young
76:14 people anyone that is described as being
76:18 super happy with their life so there's
76:20 always a form of isolation so you know a
76:24 lot of us know that when you're
76:25 depressed it creates sickness in your
76:28 body so try to be happy use the show to
76:32 be happy if you haven't been to deep
76:35 thoughts radio Calm please go there are
76:37 two video feeds please get over to [ __ ]
76:40 chute dot-com the links on the front
76:42 page under videos get yourself an
76:44 account if you can't please subscribe to
76:47 the page a lot of youtubers are actually
76:49 now recording that their numbers on
76:52 bedsheet are going up and I would
76:53 definitely say I've had a small uptick
76:56 it took me forever to get to about a
76:57 hundred but now it's starting to tick up
76:59 it's pretty cool but we want to support
77:02 them because they're a first-amendment
77:04 respectful video platform so they're
77:07 probably need some money to expand at
77:08 some point so your subscription means a
77:10 lot to them it's the 11th we didn't get
77:13 clipped by any means our videos are
77:15 still working and that's kind of what I
77:16 thought and a bunch of these super duper
77:19 dark conspiracy channels are still just
77:21 fine so a lot of the hype around YouTube
77:26 destroying channels I haven't heard a
77:29 single channel get turned off as of the
77:31 10th so if you've heard anything
77:32 definitely let me know because I haven't
77:33 heard anything at all there's plenty of
77:37 links for podcasting so get your device
77:38 you will listen to it on go there click
77:40 the link you'll be set up just remember
77:41 the front page actually has category
77:43 lists of all the videos so if you just
77:46 want a lien stuff you can click on that
77:47 space stuff moon stuff it's all up there
77:50 and judging from the traffic on the site
77:52 that's exactly what you folks are doing
77:54 so
77:55 I'm glad it's something you guys are
77:57 finding useful there are three social
78:00 media is a locked Facebook group with a
78:01 bunch of incredible people there's
78:03 Twitter and there's minds calm Minds
78:06 calm is a competitor to Facebook much
78:08 prettier than Facebook at this point no
78:11 one's on it
78:12 I don't think Facebook is into a lot of
78:14 the censorship to the degree that
78:17 YouTube is into so they you know they
78:20 take down images and articles and
78:22 they'll tell you that something's not
78:23 true minds doesn't do any of that stuff
78:25 so another place you could probably
78:27 create an account will be minds comm I
78:30 would love to move the whole ship over
78:33 there but right now
78:34 can't do it there's a few ways to donate
78:36 to the show the theory is you know
78:40 paying for Hardware paying for sticks
78:42 and obviously in some dream world
78:45 generating enough revenue to be able to
78:47 do this once a day you'll be fantastic I
78:50 am exploring just so that you know being
78:52 able to chat with you guys live I found
78:56 a couple plugins that will help me
78:57 maintain the overall black-and-white
78:59 image of the show so I need to run some
79:02 tests on that and then we'll be able to
79:04 do some live sessions I'm a little bit
79:06 leery of the trolling and a live session
79:08 so we'll see sort of how that works
79:12 but there is patreon in PayPal folks
79:16 have been donating on PayPal so I really
79:18 appreciate that
79:19 the patreon you know the beautiful thing
79:21 about is that you get the episodes
79:23 before everyone else in most cases or
79:26 you get them literally the second I hit
79:27 upload on my computer so in some cases
79:30 you know if I'm trying to control the
79:34 flow of the show I might throw one out
79:36 at the same exact time you see it but
79:38 overall you'll get two or three shows
79:43 before everybody else does and you get a
79:44 chance to ingest them and comment on
79:46 them before anyone else there's a couple
79:48 of products up there that I promote just
79:51 because you need to have a brave browser
79:52 pokes the deep state eye out doesn't
79:55 track anything and you change the search
79:59 engine from google deduct go again
80:02 they're not selling your information
80:03 anyone and everything is up there it's
80:06 actually a great place to find deep
80:07 thoughts radio episodes if you don't
80:08 want to use the
80:09 search field on the website and then
80:11 Backblaze which is great which again is
80:14 I have to read we describe this it's
80:18 seven dollars a year per computer for
80:21 one year backup infinite space so I
80:24 didn't realize I had two subscriptions
80:26 for $14.99 or whatever it was and so I
80:29 was misquoting that as two computers
80:31 it's only one computer for seven bucks
80:33 but still phenomenal infinite space man
80:36 I think Dropbox is like a terabyte or a
80:41 couple terabytes for $11.99 so I've got
80:44 17 terabytes up there in back place for
80:48 seven bucks or eight bucks whatever is
80:50 the store has been updated and so I've
80:54 created a couple shirt designs I will
80:56 continue creating shirt designs they're
80:58 gonna be very different as things move
80:59 on so I'm having some fun with that so
81:02 if you also get on patreon there's a
81:04 there's a discount code on there to save
81:08 20% off the store so that's cool and you
81:13 will not find any season 1 episodes on
81:15 this particular channel there's a whole
81:16 other channel on YouTube the reason why
81:19 I did that is I want to confuse all the
81:20 numbering you know going up to you know
81:22 at 400 and then all the sudden there's a
81:24 hundred episodes scattered around took
81:25 me a long time better remastered them
81:28 all so get on the website that's where
81:31 everything is people are doing it like
81:32 crazy so even for a really late
81:35 johnny-come-lately channel most videos
81:38 will have anywhere from about 10 to 50
81:42 views someone who have almost 100 so
81:46 it's it's it's gaining popularity so I
81:49 appreciate you guys going over there and
81:50 watching and that's all I've got
81:52 so until the next episode take care of
81:54 yourself and someone else and I'll see
81:56 you in the next deep thoughts over now
