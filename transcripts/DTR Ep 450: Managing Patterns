00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen you know the more I put time
00:37 and you know thought into this idea of
00:40 patterns and the fact that I've you know
00:43 I think that we forget everything that's
00:48 boring
00:49 and then I so I've had that you know
00:53 idea in my mind for I don't know five
00:55 six months whenever the hell I made that
00:56 episode on it and then I listened to
01:01 people and I listened to people talk and
01:03 complain about their lives or just
01:06 observe and not everyone's complaining
01:07 when they say oh my god times flying you
01:09 know they're not complaining every
01:10 single time they say it but they do
01:13 regret it they do regret that it seems
01:16 as if things you know rapidly go by and
01:21 so each time I hear it I make a little
01:24 funny comment well you know how that
01:26 while that's happening right and know
01:27 who you know and then I tell them your
01:30 life is boring because it's boring
01:33 you're forgetting it but not boring is
01:38 probably more subjective than it needs
01:40 to be because if it's just simply
01:42 visually repetitive you're gonna have
01:45 the same thing happen to you I think
01:48 it's very interesting that we sense at
01:50 all that we want to be doing something
01:53 different that we want to be doing
01:55 something productive right because we do
01:59 want to do something interesting doesn't
02:04 always happen does it right so we try to
02:07 change our lives move someplace
02:09 different and work someplace different
02:12 date someone different or something like
02:15 that hopefully you're not one of those
02:16 people or maybe you have the same job
02:20 every single day you love where you live
02:22 you love your car all that good stuff
02:24 but your work is being a doctor and so
02:28 even though you are doing the same sort
02:30 of sneezy cold winters and whatever
02:33 skinned knee summers it's different
02:37 people it's different
02:38 is and so you you get into it because
02:42 it's the human interaction plus you're
02:45 making a difference you're healing
02:46 people right so that could be super cool
02:51 but what I want to get you to do and the
02:55 younger you are listening to this the
02:56 better the younger you are the better
03:00 you'll you'll be able to build your life
03:03 to manage this such that you're aware of
03:05 what's going on and part of it can be
03:07 don't worry about it what anyone else
03:09 says or what I say especially about what
03:11 is boring what is not forget that that's
03:13 all up to you right anything I say like
03:16 that's it's just my opinion and are
03:18 making an example that's probably bad
03:20 you're the judge of your life you
03:22 determine what is success for you not me
03:24 right if you're happy and you know it
03:29 clap your hands man now the other thing
03:33 is that you can get yourself trained to
03:35 be very pattern esque you know where you
03:38 do like the reliability of patterns it
03:41 will not change the fact that life will
03:43 tend to speed up unless there's some
03:46 finer level of granularity that you are
03:48 actually monitoring that makes it
03:50 anything but repetitive right you know
03:55 they always say it's it's always good to
03:56 you know stop and smell the flowers
03:59 totally true if you're that type of
04:03 person then one day it's the flowers and
04:06 the next day it's something else and
04:08 something else you appreciate the sky in
04:11 the clouds or whatever it is you like
04:14 the seasons and how it changes the
04:16 vegetation you savor it or every day you
04:20 go to the coffee shop you savor the
04:24 people watching and the people that you
04:25 meet these are very important things to
04:28 know about yourself you will be
04:31 designing your own life
04:32 when you get done with this one this
04:34 episode because it's it's going to be
04:37 about you know managing patterns right
04:40 now there again
04:42 you can learn ways of making your life
04:46 more fresh and more interesting you
04:50 could be in a chaotic
04:53 torrent of absolute variation and what
04:57 you're seeking is completely the
04:58 opposite and so maybe if you are in a
05:04 chaotic world
05:05 maybe our flight attendant and you're
05:07 flying all over the world and you never
05:09 get to stop maybe you're a business
05:10 person and you're flying all over the
05:11 world you never get to stay anywhere and
05:15 really you know you'd be like hey how
05:17 many ever been to LA and they'd be like
05:18 yeah but I never got off the plane I
05:20 never got out of the terminal never got
05:22 out of the hotel I never saw anything
05:24 that Ellie is known for I don't really
05:26 know the people you know that's what
05:28 Americans do when we travel abroad we go
05:32 just for a finite amount of time don't
05:36 really see anything don't really meet
05:37 anyone and then they come back but then
05:40 we say we went to Italy we say we went
05:42 to France and what we know about those
05:44 cultures is you know zippity-doo-dah
05:47 right now there are wonderful things
05:52 about both sides of the fence about
05:54 having a completely chaotic life that is
05:58 always interesting because some people
06:00 thrive on it
06:01 so people love traveling I used to have
06:04 a an acquaintance of mine who was in the
06:07 film business the dude was it wasn't a
06:13 very ethical guy but he he loved the
06:15 hunt of being the top guy and you know a
06:19 particular airline like TWA or American
06:23 Airlines or whatever he had to be the
06:24 guy with the most frequent flyer miles
06:27 for that particular year he wanted the
06:30 award from the airline's for being at
06:35 least in the top three but he was
06:36 usually number one and so he arranged
06:39 his entire life to fly around the world
06:43 you know once a month used to be in Wall
06:47 Street with very unethical guy but that
06:51 was his obsession so he couldn't get out
06:54 enough where some of us are like oh my
06:57 god airports scanners TSA hmm
07:03 even with all that priority check-in
07:05 stuff yeah it's not worth it to me the
07:10 doodle pie died cancer and one oh why
07:12 why am I already dead well the other
07:16 problem is is that if you get addicted
07:17 to patterns real life starts to get a
07:20 little strange because in real life we
07:23 have to commit to things right if you
07:27 get married you have to commit to that
07:29 person if you have a child you have to
07:33 commit to that child if you get a job
07:36 you got to commit to the job and some
07:39 people can't and they need to learn
07:42 about whatever their limitations are I
07:45 can only work at a place for let's say
07:48 two years or something like that I have
07:50 a friend of mine he can't work anywhere
07:51 more than two years at least he couldn't
07:55 in the past and he would what he would
07:57 do those he'd worked the third year but
07:59 he'd start screwing the company over
08:01 left and right but if he knew that about
08:04 himself then he could simply look for
08:06 another job about a year and a half into
08:08 it and then jump ship but he'd be
08:09 totally fine and I think that's just
08:12 fine
08:13 just as long as you know your limits he
08:16 couldn't know he's married but he
08:17 couldn't keep a girlfriend for any
08:20 length of time he just got tired of him
08:23 and that's not the way the world works
08:25 unless you're gonna be that kind of guy
08:27 you know I've you know somehow I would
08:30 say this sometimes episodes happen
08:32 because I will digress in a previous
08:34 video and that digression lingers in my
08:38 head as a good episode idea and so I'm
08:42 always kind of cautious about putting
08:43 these episodes too close together but
08:46 one of the things I do to make sure that
08:50 my brain doesn't lose the capability to
08:54 commit is that I will do like I eat at
08:58 the same place every day I'll even eat
09:01 the same meal every single day and what
09:03 that does for me is it allows me to
09:07 commit and have no variations whatsoever
09:13 because human beings can be that way
09:16 every once in a while now maybe you have
09:18 a spouse that changes works out whatever
09:22 they're just interesting people you know
09:25 and so you have your luck of the draw
09:28 but a lot of times eventually when we
09:31 get a little older you don't know how
09:32 you know you're gonna you have to manage
09:34 how you're gonna get older if you're
09:36 unhealthy or someone gets injured well
09:38 some people may not be able to move
09:40 around that much and so they don't have
09:41 any they don't have a choice right now
09:46 the couples that I grew up with as a kid
09:49 they were they lived together forever
09:52 and you were just expected to be that
09:54 way tunnels in that cigar unbelievable
09:59 but they had to enjoy the nuances
10:02 perhaps the repetition you know if you
10:05 sat down and watched the same television
10:07 show every day like my grandfather
10:09 always watched Johnny Carson well
10:11 Johnny's the one that's keeping it spicy
10:13 the guests are keeping it spicy right
10:15 comedians right new jokes and come out
10:17 on stage new types of comedy happened
10:20 there's new television shows new movies
10:23 and so these movie stars and all these
10:25 participants come on and they entertain
10:27 you and that's cool so even within
10:31 certain repetitive patterns there are
10:33 sub patterns that will keep you okay I'm
10:35 taking you through these scenarios so
10:37 that it becomes meticulous in your mind
10:40 such that when you want to identify your
10:42 patterns and manage them you'll know
10:44 it's not some obtuse macro level pattern
10:47 management it's it's a fractal I mean it
10:50 literally goes down to maybe how you cut
10:53 your nails when you cut your nails how
10:55 you make your bed when you make your bed
10:57 you know all those things and so you
11:02 know this is sort of a tour of how it
11:05 how it works out you know there's
11:08 something called the Hawthorne effect I
11:10 mentioned it a couple of times in
11:11 episodes but it really has to do with an
11:16 employer they found this out when they
11:18 started sticking people inside you know
11:21 big buildings to be sardines to work for
11:25 some corporation
11:27 it used to be they just had a bunch of
11:29 desks in a room like a classroom and
11:31 there was no privacy
11:32 then they erected gigantic cubicle walls
11:37 they were five to six feet tall give a
11:39 hundred percent privacy and they
11:41 realized well maybe people want a little
11:43 bit of interaction so they start putting
11:45 windows you know inside the cube walls
11:48 and then they brought the cubes down to
11:51 like three and a half feet four feet but
11:53 they I think it was a complete mistake
11:56 as I read it as a kid but they ended up
11:59 moving an office once for an on it was
12:04 like a logistical reason of maybe doing
12:05 some maintenance or something but they
12:07 moved at all maybe they changed cubicle
12:09 sizes or whatever and they noticed that
12:12 the happiness in at the ft establishment
12:16 and the productivity of the employees
12:18 went up just slightly and about six
12:21 months later year later goes back down
12:22 to where it was so they moved the desks
12:26 again and the productivity went back up
12:29 and the happiness went back up meaning
12:31 happiness being less complaints less
12:33 conflicts in the office and they call
12:35 this the Hawthorne effect when they
12:38 asked the employees why do you feel
12:41 better the employee said well my
12:44 employer cares about me I said oh yeah
12:47 we'll explain that to me I said well
12:49 they're there care about us
12:51 you know not getting tired of our office
12:53 and they move it around a little bit now
12:56 I do that in my office at my house all
13:00 the time and you know there's not a lot
13:02 of options cuz I don't want to be facing
13:04 the wall you know I don't want to be
13:05 facing away from the door opening but
13:08 I'll move it left to right and then I
13:10 kind of jostle the furniture changed
13:12 some of the art on the wall depending on
13:15 how much time I have
13:16 I used to swap my office for my bedroom
13:21 back and forth but finally realized the
13:23 side bathrooms in that one master
13:25 bedroom and I don't like getting up out
13:28 of bed going through my office to take a
13:30 shower because this is the house they
13:32 started my game company and eventually I
13:34 had a good friend of mine who's a female
13:36 it's my first employee and they just
13:38 kind of got awkward you know
13:40 keep threw in a robe but she was a big
13:45 girl so anyway I went ahead and made
13:50 that my bedroom full time but those
13:52 little changes you know when I get a new
13:55 project I will change my house a little
13:59 bit so that it feels different when I
14:01 wrote that movie my desk was like this
14:03 when I wrote that movie the sofa was
14:05 over here you know it used to be that in
14:09 the software business one would dye
14:12 their hair I used to do black hair and
14:14 keep it black until the project was done
14:17 because I like my blonde hair but I'm
14:19 like my black hair either it's not
14:20 really black but you know it's like a
14:21 purple brown black thing some dudes will
14:25 grow beards before this whole hipster
14:27 thing happened they grow a huge beard
14:29 they hate their beards and so the whole
14:30 thing is you don't get to shave until
14:32 you finish the project and so it
14:36 motivates them to code around the clock
14:38 it's really funny so you know how
14:41 granular is this pattern recognition
14:45 well I'll tell you one I tell you one
14:48 that's interesting that goes way deeper
14:51 than just physical items in the room
14:53 your path to work every day some people
14:55 change the the roads they use just to
14:58 kind of spice it up I used to do it all
14:59 the time when my office was the city
15:01 over what if you were in a pattern of
15:07 suffering and let's make it not someone
15:12 else's fault specifically you're in a
15:16 pattern where hey the economy sucks
15:19 maybe it's a little tiny recession of
15:21 some sort and so you are trying to you
15:26 know figure out where you're gonna earn
15:27 money and that just goes on and on for
15:30 months again when I came out of the the
15:32 dot-com industry in 2002
15:34 you know they created the recession to
15:37 force all the ghetto kids into the army
15:39 and a lot of other people too but that's
15:42 what they do they crash the economy when
15:44 they need soldiers and the kids you know
15:46 have no option but to go into the
15:47 military
15:49 well sometimes you know well you know
15:52 put this way if you were looking for a
15:54 new
15:55 you would need your energy you need your
15:58 positivity right and if you know
16:02 sometimes you have a lot of leads you
16:03 can work with and you know depends if
16:05 you're the on season or off season but
16:07 sometimes you have to look for you know
16:10 stuff that you have no idea where you're
16:11 gonna go
16:12 so you just put your resumes out there
16:13 and see what happens right but sometimes
16:17 those patterns can get so repetitive and
16:22 they're not positive that you start to
16:24 lose the steam that you need to you know
16:29 get a new job you're trying to take an
16:31 interview but you're just worn out and
16:33 they can sense it sometimes right and so
16:36 you have to work really really
16:37 diligently for four years to figure out
16:44 how you're gonna get back into the work
16:45 force maybe take a few jobs just on the
16:47 side and so sometimes you know you're
16:52 you're financially constrained and so
16:56 you're like well I should move to
16:56 another town but how am I going to do
16:58 that so you'd have to literally apply
17:00 for a job get the job with some sort of
17:02 you know moving package involved with it
17:06 but how many of you have been in your
17:08 life and you just simply go man
17:10 you know this pattern has got to stop
17:14 it just has to stop by I shouldn't be
17:16 here any more at this stage of my life
17:18 and that's a big deal and so what can
17:22 start happening is you know let's say
17:25 you want to change a your job but you
17:29 know you're also bored of BCDE F you
17:32 know the way you dress the car you drive
17:35 where you live maybe like some of that
17:38 stuff but not all the stuff maybe it's
17:40 just like I said maybe you just need to
17:42 rearrange your house maybe if you're not
17:46 a really you know I don't want to say
17:50 hygienic person but what if there's a
17:53 couple rooms where you let it go for a
17:55 little while and you keep living and
17:57 sort of like not the best cleanliness
18:00 that you could do and so you know what
18:02 why don't you just get the soap out and
18:04 just clean everything off and just
18:06 having litter
18:07 this metaphorical moment of cleaning
18:09 everything off and rearranging
18:11 everything makes it such that you feel
18:15 brand-new you've been reborn because you
18:18 put rebirth the bathroom you rebirth
18:20 birth the kitchen or the front room or
18:22 whatever the back patio and that's just
18:25 a symbol that things are changing and
18:27 that can be very powerful for your brain
18:30 because your brain is also trying to
18:32 make sense of all this stuff
18:34 remember the brain is always trying to
18:36 figure out what you need and it's trying
18:40 to provide it so again you know the one
18:44 thing I kind of missed in my cancer
18:47 episode was the the damage and the
18:49 potential you know well it's just
18:54 damaged that could happen because of
18:56 stress and so it's an oxymoron to ignore
19:03 stress when you're in a mother of
19:05 invention situation right you really
19:09 need to fix the problem you need to fix
19:13 an income issue or what have you the
19:15 bills are piling up
19:16 well you got a million reasons to be
19:18 stressed in a rational world but in the
19:22 end the wise old man or the wise old
19:25 woman making cookies in the kitchen
19:27 the Oracle she's gonna look at you and
19:31 she's going to tell you if you allow
19:34 stress to build up because I can see it
19:37 in your face I can see it in your body
19:38 language then what you need to
19:42 accomplish will suddenly become
19:43 insurmountable or impossible - a miracle
19:47 and nobody wants to live in miracle land
19:49 you know again I have you know a few
19:53 friends of mine that are so positive
19:55 that whatever they touch turns to gold
19:57 you know and it's you know they have
20:00 limitations of course but they always
20:02 can feed themselves and have shelter and
20:05 all this other kind of stuff
20:07 they're always they always have what
20:09 they need they can pay their bills and
20:12 they're reasonable with their bills are
20:13 not crazy
20:14 but they do go on vacations so I got
20:16 some money left over it's usually teamed
20:19 up with someone else as well
20:22 pattern management starts to get to the
20:25 point where it does control how you
20:28 expose yourself to potentially stress
20:31 and then how you can rehabilitate
20:33 yourself out of stress how many times
20:38 have you you know this is gonna be a
20:41 little bit on point physically but
20:43 you're really stressed out and someone
20:45 talks you into going to get like a full
20:47 body massage someplace and you do it or
20:50 someone gives you that massage it's even
20:52 better right you know someone close to
20:53 you that you trust and you are all of a
20:57 sudden you know like let's just say that
20:59 let's just say you're like one day from
21:01 going bankrupt you're one day from
21:03 getting kicked out of your house getting
21:04 your car repo'd or whatever and they
21:06 just take you in and it used to be
21:09 called the attitude adjustment which is
21:11 a little bit different it's more like
21:12 the vacation you know still targeting a
21:14 groove on sort of thing but you're
21:16 stressed out and your friend pays the
21:18 bill and you're gonna get a 90 minute
21:21 thing right
21:23 you're sitting there and you know it's
21:26 it's actually very weird you know an
21:27 interesting when a random stranger who
21:31 is trained to do this sort of thing
21:33 really gives you a great massage and
21:35 they they really care they really care
21:37 about the tents and the knots in your
21:40 back and the knots in your shoulder and
21:42 just you just feel stressed and then
21:44 they want to just yank it out of you
21:46 that's why I always say go to really old
21:47 Asian women because they don't they
21:50 don't play games man
21:51 you do what they say they know what's
21:53 wrong with you before you know what's
21:55 wrong with you and they just break into
21:57 a million pieces right but when you
21:59 leave you were you were in another
22:02 dimension for the 90 minutes another
22:05 dimension of reality where someone was
22:07 taking care of you it can be it could be
22:11 an amazing experience I I once took my
22:15 girlfriend to Sonoma Mission way up in
22:19 Sonoma County which is Northern
22:21 California wine country I think I almost
22:24 dropped four thousand dollars but one of
22:28 the last things that happened was this
22:30 water issues it shoots shusui
22:33 something like that and it was this
22:38 German lady in this pool and she was
22:42 like a big you know not not necessary
22:45 heavy but just a large women woman
22:47 probably five nine five ten and just
22:50 older she's probably in her late 40s at
22:52 the time and I was in my early thirties
22:55 probably thirty thirty-one and the water
22:59 the pool was full of all that salt that
23:02 makes it really makes you really buoyant
23:04 but she what you do is you get in her
23:07 arms you have to be big to do this
23:09 because you know I'm not a six foot four
23:12 guy but she does men that large of
23:14 course they're floating in her arms
23:16 right and she would she just barely
23:21 explained it but she would just hold you
23:24 and massage you at the same time and it
23:29 was the most bizarre experience it was
23:31 like being in a dream and being in this
23:34 world at the exact same time it was so
23:36 you know the water was perfectly the
23:39 temperature that my body was at I was
23:42 floating naturally so there's never any
23:44 sense of drowning or anything like that
23:46 plus you just need to trust the people
23:48 but she told me because I you know I'm
23:50 I'm really you know cognitive and in
23:53 this world and so I was just kind of
23:55 whispering to her man this is amazing
23:56 this is why I love that I don't know
23:58 there's broad daylight you know but she
24:00 said she said you know some people start
24:05 to cry while I'm doing this to them I
24:07 said well yeah I could see that if
24:10 someone really had some pent up emotions
24:12 and I thought you know that never left
24:15 my mind her telling me that and I tried
24:20 to go to a second day I don't think I
24:22 was able to do it but you know that was
24:26 definitely not a pattern that I'd ever
24:28 experienced before and sadly never have
24:30 experienced since but it was someone
24:33 caring about me and she really was you
24:36 know this is an art for her and
24:38 obviously incredibly unique experience I
24:42 tell you what had I been on some you
24:46 know verge of a
24:47 a nervous breakdown or some midlife
24:49 crisis yeah I could see people getting
24:52 really emotional or just getting
24:54 positive just getting the opposite
24:56 direction of life this is the greatest
24:58 thing ever I feel amazing and so you
25:04 know you need to keep these little
25:06 maneuvers in your back pocket and as I'm
25:09 saying these things hopefully you're
25:10 thinking of things in your life that
25:12 I've had these sorts of impacts on you
25:14 such that you know where to go get them
25:16 you know where to what to do in your
25:20 house you know what to do in the past
25:21 and I will tell you one of the things
25:24 that is heavily related to this and I
25:27 can't remember what the hell I used to
25:30 call it there's two versions of this one
25:34 has to do with your employment if you're
25:38 working for someone else and one of them
25:40 has to do with where you live because I
25:45 remember when I was doing really really
25:48 well in the Bay Area
25:49 you know I'm young as hell when I got
25:52 you know skills that will you know at
25:55 the time we're never gonna go out of
25:56 style he's for the next ten years of my
25:58 life and I remember getting comfortable
26:03 at a company and you know it was I was
26:07 really fortunate with this particular
26:08 company the first boss I had was one of
26:10 those awesome bosses his dude Frank he
26:13 was just amazing and then I had the boss
26:16 Wendy Wendy it was this total white girl
26:21 she was I don't know probably early 50s
26:24 or whatever she just came in a thinner
26:26 was bizarre and she didn't appear to
26:29 have any background on what we did and
26:32 didn't appear to have any talent and
26:34 managing human beings how she got the
26:35 job was just blew me away but she ended
26:39 up being racist and she thought that she
26:44 was only really dumb racist where she
26:47 would confide in you her racism assuming
26:51 that you were racist which was really
26:54 strange how do you live in the Bay Area
26:55 and be racist that's just that's to go
26:57 back to Kentucky or whatever the [ __ ]
26:59 you
26:59 live but don't don't come to a melting
27:01 pot of melting pots right it's just dumb
27:03 but then she started accusing our CEO of
27:09 being a racist as well and just saying
27:14 that he was about to make moves on
27:15 people that were not white and I know
27:17 that I know this I knew the CEO
27:19 extremely well because I worked for the
27:21 guy on the side within the company and I
27:24 he and I had the same love for soul
27:29 music I mean we sat and just talked
27:32 about James Brown for an hour at one of
27:34 these parties and I'm like this dude is
27:36 so not rate because she was very
27:37 specific about black people
27:39 that was her problem and she was saying
27:41 everyone else was the same way and I'm
27:43 looking at B I'm just looking around
27:44 going men you know you're gonna fall
27:46 hard in this company and I almost don't
27:49 want to be here for it and I wasn't but
27:53 there was a point where I left because
27:55 of her I was like just you know I got to
27:57 move on anyway and I got a really cool
27:59 consulting gig ok great so but I had
28:03 this feeling before I decided to leave
28:05 that I was sort of on one side I was
28:09 really accustomed to where I worked and
28:11 thought this is just where I'm gonna die
28:13 you know it's just a weird feeling and
28:15 then the other one was I felt trapped
28:16 like no one else will ever want to hire
28:19 me and that didn't happen to me very
28:21 often but I get the peeing every once in
28:23 a while and I definitely would see it
28:24 another folks and I would think that
28:27 about the places that I've lived you
28:30 know if I lived a couple years at a
28:31 place I thought this is my house you
28:33 know it's like my dreams have come true
28:35 in this place I've had very special
28:37 moments with people in this place my kid
28:39 grew up here and so you tend to get
28:42 protective about a place as if you
28:44 couldn't live in any other location and
28:46 enjoy it it's a weird thing you know
28:50 January 1st 2020 I will have been in
28:53 this particular house for 17 years I
28:56 have never lived anywhere in my life
28:57 more than I've lived in this house but
29:00 it feels like yesterday when I moved in
29:02 here absolutely crazy
29:04 I thank God houses can't tell stories
29:07 right but the truth of the matter is we
29:10 can
29:11 and so we build up these these faux sort
29:16 of circumstances in our mind that we're
29:18 so committed to our patterns that we
29:21 just can't change and you can how many
29:25 people get out of addictions food
29:28 addictions drug addictions bad habit
29:31 addictions of whatever flavor and you
29:34 know when you're in it you can't see
29:37 yourself ever getting out of it but you
29:39 can and you know you can well you
29:42 eventually find out you can of course
29:44 everyone around you who might be
29:46 conducting an intervention of sorts they
29:49 know you can because they live without
29:52 it or maybe they were in it and they get
29:54 out of it you know it's again I've said
29:56 this a couple times but the folks that
29:58 conquer their demons with alcoholism and
30:02 drug use and they go and become
30:07 counselors they get trained and then
30:08 become counselors and they they spend a
30:10 tremendous amount of their personal time
30:12 for very little if no pay talking to
30:16 folks and you know rehabilitating them
30:20 through these situations and when you
30:23 pop out and you get a great job at a new
30:25 place you get a new place at a different
30:27 town different street or whatever you
30:30 know it's a little disorienting at first
30:32 you feel like the outsider in your own
30:34 house but eventually it starts to become
30:37 your place the more you come home to it
30:39 drop your keys there today put your feet
30:42 up there watch television here be with
30:45 your spouse your partner there it feels
30:48 fine then it starts feeling like you
30:51 can't leave that place because it's it's
30:53 where you live you know how many times
30:57 again it I've said there's several times
30:58 but how many times you worry about a
30:59 bill worry about a circumstance but you
31:02 know God provides something happens the
31:04 phone rings money shows up something
31:06 happens and you survive you have to
31:10 remember those things be when you hit it
31:12 the second third and fourth time so when
31:15 changes occurring around you that you
31:17 don't personally feel like you have
31:20 control over here comes a big pattern
31:23 shift
31:24 and in general there's a there's
31:27 entertainment in pattern shifting in a
31:29 lot of situations again all the matters
31:33 is that you're alive and that you're
31:36 healthy and that hopefully your loved
31:38 ones are experiencing the same benefits
31:41 and the safety okay so what do you need
31:47 in that scenario you know what do you
31:49 need to really worry about you're safe
31:53 you're okay now there also is the
31:56 situation where like I said with my
31:59 friend who has a problem had a problem I
32:01 guess working for a place more in a
32:03 couple years and when I say that I
32:05 watched him go through three different
32:07 companies in the third company which is
32:10 really the last time I ever really saw
32:11 him face to face he was destroying my
32:13 friends company I believe that dudes
32:17 actually been at a company for quite a
32:18 while now sometimes you'll feel like
32:22 okay maybe it's time for change you're
32:26 fine
32:27 your place is fine your job is fine but
32:29 maybe it's time to find something new
32:31 now my advice is always invest in
32:36 yourself when everything is great but
32:39 sadly what ends up happening is you
32:41 ignore what you're doing while
32:46 everything's safe one of the classic
32:51 things that happened that I got to see
32:53 several times was that when I was
32:55 helping celebrities do their online
32:58 properties you know like websites or
33:00 their promo materials they would be
33:02 handing out the funny thing was that
33:05 they would this is before social media
33:07 really became the way to to put your
33:10 name out there you know sometimes I
33:12 think we're actually leaning back
33:13 towards websites here I think in the
33:14 next five years the social media becomes
33:16 so censored and so acidic you're going
33:19 to want to create your own world in some
33:21 WordPress site or something else more
33:22 fancy so that you preserve your brand
33:25 and the whole experience when someone
33:27 comes to look at your face but my
33:30 clients would invariably ignore their
33:34 web property which at the time was the
33:36 mean you know
33:37 business card and when times were great
33:40 and then when times were bad they had
33:43 very little money that they wanted to
33:45 spend but they had a tremendous amount
33:48 of change they want another on their
33:49 properties and so you know this was
33:51 always a side business for me
33:53 but I'd be sitting there on okay here we
33:56 are I've been begging you for a year to
33:57 give me some photographs and you know
34:00 give me some bio updates and all this
34:02 other kind of stuff but Jade Nord it
34:04 because everything was great
34:05 dogged this would never end and you know
34:08 of course it totally turned into that
34:10 situation where they needed it badly so
34:14 keep that in mind as well the name of
34:19 the game is obviously control you want
34:22 to control your life as much as you
34:25 possibly can so if you are behind the
34:29 8-ball that means you're going to be
34:32 controlled by it you don't want to be in
34:35 a situation where your patterns control
34:37 you you want to control your patterns
34:39 you want to control how complicated your
34:43 patterns are how simple your patterns
34:44 are when they change what category of
34:47 life they change in and again you could
34:49 be in a holding pattern and just love it
34:51 you could hit that that age it doesn't
34:55 matter what age it is where you feel
34:56 like this is it and you look around you
34:59 know and I see if you actually have what
35:02 you think your life is all about in the
35:04 back pocket okay be happy but then work
35:07 to reinforce it because things corrode
35:12 things change you know if you and I
35:15 built a castle well it depends on what
35:17 we built it out of how many years it's
35:19 gonna last but even you know the
35:22 greatest castle can start falling apart
35:24 too much rain too much temperature
35:27 change the material we used you know the
35:30 mortar is going to burn out a lot faster
35:33 than the brick within the stone or
35:35 whatever we built the thing out of and
35:36 so you have to factor all that in you
35:39 know the the very very tough thing to do
35:43 these days is to put aside money because
35:49 you know this
35:50 quite all this report all these reports
35:52 that everything's going great in America
35:53 you know we're still suffering from 2008
35:56 that was the most devastating recession
36:00 that I've seen since I've been around
36:03 and the one in 2002 was bad that one in
36:05 93 was bad but this one in 2008 really
36:10 hurt the banks and hurt the
36:12 corporation's which you know were sort
36:15 of on one level happy about that but
36:17 there is definitely trickle-down layoffs
36:19 and trickle-down stuff drying up but
36:22 other industries surged at the same time
36:24 but it depends on what your skill set is
36:26 in the middle of all that right one of
36:29 the patterns that's very interesting in
36:31 the modern age that I think it has to do
36:36 with honestly escaping this reality for
36:40 something else so for instance you know
36:44 back in the day they would read a book
36:46 and you would escape maybe go to play
36:48 and you would escape books are way more
36:52 accessible she read a lot more books and
36:54 probably went to place then the movie
36:56 came out movies he had silent movies and
36:59 then talkies and they got really awesome
37:03 then television shows up yeah you got a
37:06 little tiny movies inside your house
37:08 then computers came around we had
37:12 arcades you had arcades in your house
37:15 with Atari 2600 and even though it was
37:17 way less than the arcade it was still
37:18 your little arcade inside your home you
37:21 know where I'm going with this video
37:23 games social media all this stuff just
37:25 keeps developing and developing this is
37:27 why Marshall McLuhan clone the phrase
37:29 media and the freight or the word media
37:32 and the phrase medium is the message
37:35 media is the message and he said it's
37:39 it's more important that you pay
37:42 attention to the way that information is
37:44 coming to you the way it's coming to you
37:46 then the information itself and so one
37:51 of the patterns we have now that's
37:55 potentially devastating kids lifes is
37:58 this and all of you know it it's the
38:01 pattern of instant gratification and as
38:05 much as we as adults look at the kids
38:08 and go you know those of us excuse me
38:10 that lived before the internet and had
38:11 our formative years before the internet
38:14 was there we still had our own you know
38:17 we had our own vices back in the day but
38:22 we also had parents that said you can't
38:24 play that game more than this you got to
38:26 be in bed by this time you can't watch
38:28 r-rated movies you can't go to that
38:30 thing and you know all these different
38:32 little constraints that helped us live
38:33 more life real life than the fictitious
38:36 life but today if you were to say wow
38:40 your kid is pissed at you because you're
38:43 not really a parent you're just sort of
38:45 a feeding Guardian you know you're
38:48 sacrificing your cash for the clothing
38:50 on their back and the shelter over the
38:52 head the food in their belly
38:53 however the duty of being a parent
38:56 because we have bought off on this break
38:59 apart the family as fast as possible and
39:01 everyone has to work because working for
39:03 the man is where you prove yourself
39:04 right you're not a woman unless you work
39:07 for the man you're not a full man that
39:08 should work for them it's nuts right it
39:12 seems as though we've lost almost our
39:14 entire goal of being human but our kids
39:17 if if you take all those parents and you
39:20 give them a cell phone or an iPad and
39:22 they shut up it's considered a good day
39:26 it's a success oh man you know I just
39:29 put my kid in front of the TV and boom
39:31 he or she is quiet no more crying I need
39:35 to go do stuff I'm stressed I'm
39:38 overworked right so imagine you have a
39:41 new family some of you do and you're
39:44 forming your patterns in the house well
39:48 you want to you know what do you want to
39:51 do the thing is is like it's you have
39:54 the option of doing two things and one
39:56 of them is extremely difficult but it
39:58 sounds easy and the other one is super
40:01 easy and it sounds difficult if you
40:05 raise your kid in the modern age with
40:08 all the modern amenities which basically
40:09 means you're letting a marketing company
40:11 tell your kid what's important in life
40:15 then you will raise a kid that is
40:20 nothing like you imagine that you have
40:26 nothing compatible to speak of with your
40:29 child because you raised them with all
40:32 kinds of weird short attention span
40:33 stuff maybe you vaccinated your kids you
40:37 turn them into a GMO human so they just
40:39 don't even think like you do and you
40:42 don't know why you know I made a joke as
40:45 I mentioned in a previous episode here
40:47 which probably air before this one about
40:50 raising a kid in the 70s I guess you
40:54 could crank out some sort of 80s to it
40:56 as well but raise your kid in a media
41:00 deprived world such that they have to
41:04 read books if they want to have an
41:06 escape we get very little television and
41:09 it's only the television that you
41:10 approve maybe they only get to see
41:13 classic movies or classic television
41:14 shows that you approve where there's our
41:16 moral uptick all the time but they're
41:19 trying to build better humans through
41:20 narratives through movies and television
41:23 as opposed to trying to do the exact
41:24 opposite you might study your patterns
41:28 when you were a child and try to find
41:31 out what patterns made you good what
41:34 kind of patterns made you bad or injured
41:37 then you obviously get what are the ones
41:40 that are bad unless you think the ones
41:41 that caused you pain which is really the
41:45 other category regardless of how you
41:47 position the description but what if
41:51 being broke as a child taught you how to
41:54 conserve money and spend money wisely
41:57 you know Donald Trump he's very famous
42:00 for giving his kids a credit card with a
42:02 $500 a month limit guys a billionaire
42:06 Ivanka Trump grew up with 500 bucks a
42:09 month and he said look nice you want any
42:10 more money than that go get a job and
42:12 they did all of his kids
42:16 I'm sure Barron will have the same
42:17 restrictions what's interesting about it
42:21 is once you start understanding the
42:22 human mind and start understanding
42:25 society and how it affects you how you
42:28 fact it it becomes actually measurably
42:34 easier to control your life and design
42:36 who you are as a human being if you're
42:38 raising children to protect their brains
42:41 from all the craziness there's that
42:44 movie explorers which was it goes as a
42:49 mecca's movie the guy did back to the
42:53 future but it was also produced by
42:55 Steven Spielberg course they put his
42:56 name up they're really big it was a
42:59 great movie for kids and it's you know
43:02 it's got joaquin phoenix in it or it was
43:05 a river phoenix it i sorry but it's
43:08 these little kids you know that her the
43:10 ethan hawke is the little kid is in
43:12 there i want to know it's a corey
43:15 feldman I don't know if he's in there or
43:16 not but you go over to River Phoenix's
43:20 house and his father is
43:21 Zefram Cochrane and I believe oh no he's
43:24 the other guy no I maybe Zefram Cochrane
43:27 you can't remember whatever that actor's
43:29 name is from Elliott law and you know
43:33 his father is this crazy inventor
43:35 scientist and you know the kids living
43:37 in a world where he is surrounded by his
43:40 father who is an inventor and it's just
43:43 you know chemistry sets and physics
43:45 there and you know electronics there the
43:47 kid is inundated with you can do
43:49 anything that you want world you know
43:53 and when I was a kid in the Midwest you
43:56 know my aunts would make their own
43:58 clothing and it was this whole ritual
44:01 they dragged me along cuz I'm a little
44:03 kid you know we go down to fabric store
44:06 I'm just chilling out I don't even know
44:08 what the hell's going on it's a little
44:10 boring for me but when I started making
44:12 their clothes I was like wow this is
44:14 wild they go down to buy a pattern some
44:16 bell-bottom thing right and it's just a
44:19 bunch of real thin like tissue paper
44:22 with the patterns on it and then they
44:26 buy all this fabric they want to make it
44:27 out of and it teaches you exactly how to
44:30 do it if you have a belt that goes
44:31 around the middle you can change that
44:32 color and get this get a complementary
44:34 color and they take it on to my
44:35 grandmother's where they lived and
44:37 they'd cut they type in the patterns
44:40 down with a little
44:41 ends in every like three or four inches
44:43 or whatever and then they would cut they
44:46 know the cloth according to the pattern
44:48 and the pattern is always a little bit
44:50 over so you have some nice lip to stitch
44:52 things on when you run it through the
44:54 sewing machine it sit there and make
44:56 their own clothing and what's funny
44:59 about it is if you made your own
45:01 clothing today depending on what you're
45:03 doing you know people might frown on you
45:07 as being poor but back in those days it
45:10 was hot it was like you did want to go
45:13 to school with your own creation that
45:15 you've modified the original patterns to
45:17 put some stuff on there that wasn't
45:18 there polka dots or stripes or whatever
45:20 you get some really cool fabric with
45:22 stars on it or whatever use the
45:24 bedazzler
45:26 but little sequences on it or whatever
45:28 and you know my aunts would go to school
45:30 just look at amazing
45:33 well that was an incredible pattern that
45:36 I saw if you want to make something you
45:39 can make it yourself you don't have to
45:41 pay everybody to do everything for you
45:42 and guess what you're like no one else
45:46 in the whole world you know you're not
45:48 you just used to bedazzle you know
45:50 randomly you guarantee that that pattern
45:52 is not in anyone else's clothing it's
45:54 cool right it's putting it by uncle he
45:59 watched this process so much he was
46:01 older than all of them
46:02 but he watched the process enough that
46:05 when he got into college
46:07 he would buy suits and sometimes they
46:12 would be too big for him because he was
46:14 kind of a slender athletic body and he
46:16 would take the suits and completely
46:19 tailored them himself he just figured
46:22 out how to do it remember once he
46:24 totally tailored this leather jacket to
46:26 fit him really nice you know and I
46:29 remember I like just seeing that as a
46:31 kid and going wow you know Jesus you can
46:34 do that I mean leather jackets has some
46:36 tough stuff I mean it's not like you
46:38 know running the sewing machine with
46:40 some soft fabric
46:42 my father was heavy into Heath kids and
46:45 these were just awesome you learned
46:48 about electronics if you wanted a radio
46:50 you bought the Heathkit radio kit and
46:53 all you had to have at your
46:55 was a soldering iron pretty much because
46:57 everything else came all the little
46:58 parts the schematics and it was sort of
47:01 like a color by number thing they would
47:02 say you know here's your PC board you
47:04 had to put your row of capacitors their
47:07 resistors all over the place but your
47:09 microchip there or whatever everything
47:12 was put together for you use your
47:13 voltage meter maybe to make sure
47:15 everything's you know connected properly
47:16 boom my dad made a TV he made the
47:22 amplifiers for stereos super cool so by
47:27 the time I was a teenager my dad and I
47:32 fixed VCRs for a living it was awesome
47:34 you know you would make a pretty good
47:37 amount of money just saying look I'm
47:39 gonna have to charge you minimum seventy
47:42 five bucks your option drive the whole
47:45 thing to the next city over which is a
47:47 hundred and five miles away which is
47:49 gonna cost you the gas there and back
47:50 they're gonna charge you a hundred bucks
47:53 to open the box and that's before they
47:55 repair now they'll credit 200 bucks like
47:57 we did towards the repair but we were
48:00 saving people 50 to 100 bucks
48:03 you know I fixed a VCR once with a drop
48:06 of nail polish because this little
48:09 washer kept coming off and letting the
48:11 belt fly off and so we just realized the
48:13 K just put the washer on put a drop of
48:15 nail polish on it held it on there cool
48:18 little pattern right you can do things
48:21 yourself
48:21 so patterns are at all these different
48:24 levels and I want to heighten your
48:26 awareness to this because the name of
48:29 the game is control and control you know
48:33 you can control everything and mess up
48:34 and then you'll be damned you know I
48:37 blew it but you can laugh at your own
48:41 mistake sometimes and sometimes you'll
48:46 miss calculate what will make you happy
48:48 you get everything that you wanted and
48:50 you're like e that wasn't enough but the
48:54 nice thing is if you're in control what
48:55 do you do what do you do when you're in
48:58 a parking lot you think you got a good
49:00 parking space you put the car in there
49:02 perfectly and you and your girlfriend or
49:04 boyfriend or whatever look at the space
49:07 between the doors and you
49:08 can't open the doors because it's just
49:10 too tight so what do you do it is back
49:12 back out find a better space that's like
49:15 life you can back out of a bad situation
49:18 when you know how to control it
49:21 you know it's what's interesting too is
49:23 I'll give you a real literal pattern
49:25 that every single one of you is over 40
49:28 is definitely run into when you're young
49:31 what do they say you can eat anything
49:32 that you want and you're still skinny as
49:34 a rail although today it's not quite
49:37 that case thing everybody's everyone's
49:43 obese these days but there's a point
49:46 when your metabolism slows down and it
49:49 really has to do with just simply not
49:51 being physically active I think that's
49:52 all it is so if you can remain
49:54 physically active you can still pretty
49:56 much abuse yourself a little bit but it
49:59 does slow down you know a little clock
50:01 inside your computer just you know the
50:03 megahertz calm down after after a while
50:06 I'm at a point in my life which is funny
50:09 because I can see it in the videos it's
50:12 really interesting life gets comfortable
50:15 I'll eat out a little bit more or I'll
50:18 allow myself to eat candy or something
50:20 like that which I'm not a big sweet guy
50:21 anymore I have my weaknesses you know
50:24 like bread it's really nice I don't like
50:26 you know really exotic ice-cream I think
50:28 that's really amazing but boy I tell you
50:30 what if I eat that stuff I will see it
50:33 in my face in the video and then all it
50:35 takes is about the same amount of time I
50:39 put the stuff in my mouth and then got
50:42 fat you know in these areas that I don't
50:44 like to gain weight and then I just back
50:47 it off and go back to my pattern of not
50:50 eating that stuff because I don't eat
50:51 that stuff as a pattern and boom it just
50:54 drops right off but it's like I had a
50:58 friend of mine or I get some more of an
51:00 acquaintance I can't remember the hell I
51:02 was he was target he did this physical
51:06 gesture which was really funny was
51:08 talking about beer because we're talking
51:10 about you know these these new exotic
51:12 beers out there you know these designer
51:14 beers they're absolutely delicious tasty
51:19 now I don't like getting high personally
51:22 and I certainly don't like pinion in 15
51:23 bucks for a beer but man there once in a
51:26 while life gets good you're just summers
51:28 out there you're you're not overweight
51:30 or anything and you drink this stuff but
51:31 the guy said he goes man I can't drink
51:33 beer anymore he says I love it but I
51:36 can't drink it anymore and I said why
51:37 and he puts his thumb on his mouth and
51:41 he blows and he makes his face blow up
51:43 because because it makes me fat
51:45 instantaneously
51:46 I said yeah isn't that the [ __ ] right
51:49 which is why a lot of people go to hard
51:51 liquor because it's a lot less fatty but
51:54 it's a lot and you know it hits you
51:55 harder and it's got less sugar in it
51:57 right
51:58 the neighbors using some bizarre tools
52:02 so if you hear little noises it ain't me
52:05 what's really funny about the pattern
52:07 conversation are interesting I should
52:09 say for me is that I have never heard
52:12 another human being talk about the
52:14 patterns and maybe someone does if you
52:15 know anyone who lectures on it please
52:18 point me towards that because I'd love
52:19 to enlighten myself with someone else's
52:21 take on it but I've gone through Tony
52:25 Robbins course twice once back in 93 I
52:28 got all the cassettes
52:30 and I mean I ingested those things I
52:32 don't know how many times and then later
52:36 in about 2000 or so about all the CDs of
52:42 them so I could just kind of update
52:44 myself on what his latest game was had a
52:47 hard time getting through that one I
52:49 think I got through it maybe once and he
52:52 had a lot of new stuff to the problem
52:55 you know part of it has to do with if
52:57 you have a problem those things are very
52:59 interesting and if you don't a you know
53:03 when I was 18 and came to California by
53:07 myself my mom sent me this cassette
53:11 thing from this guy write to this day I
53:15 have no idea who the dude was just some
53:18 dude that made this was really cool was
53:20 like you was a big plastic you know
53:23 injection molded thing you pull it apart
53:24 kind of snapped together right it's like
53:27 a book was big I think it had like six
53:30 cassettes on both sides of this thing
53:32 and you just you know pop out one and
53:34 play it and
53:35 about the other one I used to paint to
53:37 it all the time and this dude was so
53:41 brilliant I mean talk about a mentor
53:45 that I needed at that exact time and
53:47 he's the dude that I've mentioned I
53:49 think once or twice but you know he's
53:51 the one that was talking about how to
53:53 get along with people in in social
53:56 circles how to be positive he had a
53:58 whole tape on getting himself a parking
54:00 space by being positive about it
54:03 to the extent he said I can get because
54:06 I get a free lunch everywhere I go
54:08 because the bet I tell everyone in the
54:11 car is not only we're gonna go the
54:15 busiest place that you can pick but I'm
54:18 gonna find not only one parking space in
54:20 a really nice area I'm gonna find two
54:23 parking spaces and if I can find two I
54:27 mean just imagine this like Los Angeles
54:29 for God's sakes can't even imagine
54:30 pulling this off but he goes it's pure
54:33 positive mind over matter Law of
54:37 Attraction that gets me in these two
54:39 spaces every time now who knows if he's
54:42 telling the truth on his score sheet but
54:44 according to him he can pull it off and
54:47 because I have friends that are very
54:49 similar to that in different ways
54:51 I absolutely believe the guy you know I
54:55 would probably buy him one so you could
54:56 find one good parking space in some of
54:58 the areas I have to go to in LA but the
55:01 reason why I make these episodes these
55:02 self-improvement episodes is I got great
55:06 mentorship in weird places at weird
55:08 times when I least expected it it was
55:11 exactly what I needed to hear and it
55:14 changed my life it made my life
55:15 extremely positive because these
55:18 cassettes which came before Tony Robbins
55:20 by at least five years most of the
55:24 things that he was cautioning me about
55:27 were things that I hadn't experienced
55:30 quite yet but if I hadn't heard his tape
55:33 I would have done exactly what he said
55:36 who would have been the wrong thing and
55:38 one of the things that stuck out that
55:40 I've mentioned me once before is he
55:42 talked about when you go to parties and
55:45 you're schmoozing right you're running
55:48 around talking
55:49 everybody who's there and you're the
55:50 newbie you know you don't know a lot of
55:51 people see you're really having to win
55:53 people over and you know you're trying
55:56 to develop your persona on the outside
55:59 because you might run your mouth
56:01 intensely if you were just who you were
56:02 in these parties you know and it's just
56:06 a process you want to be careful because
56:07 when you're with other people you have
56:09 to be considerate but he said the one
56:11 thing that people do in parties that's a
56:13 bad pattern is that someone will say
56:18 something
56:19 I'm imagine in today's world right this
56:21 is definitely Twitter to the nine
56:23 sweaters like the most acidic evil place
56:26 on planet Earth and you want to get
56:28 cancer go to Twitter every day seriously
56:31 you're just upping your chance of dying
56:33 an early death for no reason but if
56:37 you're at a party and there's a group of
56:38 people standing together with their
56:40 drinks and there's having a conversation
56:41 and they touch on something imagine me
56:44 walking in today and someone's talking
56:47 about how SpaceX is this that and the
56:49 other thing and how NASA's going back to
56:51 the moon can you imagine what would be
56:53 going on in my mind well even though I
56:56 can talk everybody's ear off for hours
56:58 and hours and hours about why these
57:01 organizations aren't exactly what they
57:03 think they are I wouldn't do it because
57:06 of this dude because he said look you
57:09 don't want to be the guy that goes up
57:10 and just tells everyone basically
57:13 passively that they're wrong why do that
57:16 nobody wants to ever hear that they're
57:19 wrong you know unless they're about to
57:22 disassemble a bomb and they're wondering
57:25 what wire to cut you know and so you
57:28 know Los Angeles is a totally social
57:31 place it's a networking place and that's
57:34 the way you work it and what you'll end
57:36 up finding out is when you're young the
57:38 pattern is to impress everyone with who
57:41 you are it's usually what it is right
57:43 your first class reunion in ten years
57:44 boy it's a big brag fest about you know
57:47 what you do and how much money you make
57:49 and all these accomplishments and then
57:53 you're 20 and 30 year you're like oh
57:54 you're still alive that's awesome but
57:57 what you find out when you get older is
57:59 you want to keep everything about
58:01 yourself private
58:02 it's just your life and if you have your
58:05 close friends that like what you do in
58:07 this particular area then you bring them
58:09 in like I smoked cigars with certain
58:10 people and other people if I lit one of
58:14 these things and they're even near than
58:15 they would you know they would think I
58:18 was the Antichrist right so for those of
58:21 you that are you know you're looking
58:25 back at your past and you're like damn
58:27 it was good you know it was so simple
58:30 well that's why I create these episodes
58:33 because I'm trying to pass down miracles
58:37 that I got from other people that just
58:39 utterly improved my life so hopefully
58:42 this was valuable to you in that
58:44 particular way now if you haven't gone
58:47 to deep thoughts radio.com there are two
58:50 video make sure to get yourself a bit
58:52 shoot account but [ __ ] shoots the other
58:54 account and [ __ ] shoot is just where
58:56 you have to go to get freedom of speech
58:58 and if you care about this information
59:00 you go create yourself an account but
59:03 there's obviously everything you need
59:05 for the podcast there is three social
59:08 media Facebook which you know which is a
59:10 lock Facebook group make sure and say
59:11 something human when you apply for the
59:13 page Twitter it's just the feed and
59:15 mine's calm in my NDS calm it's a
59:19 competitive Facebook you know I don't
59:22 I'm not holding my breath to see if that
59:25 survives but it is way prettier than
59:26 Facebook and it is freedom of speech
59:29 area so it's cool now there's a couple
59:32 ways to support the page patreon people
59:36 and there's a couple of products that I
59:38 like to use that I put links up there
59:40 for I've made no money whatsoever on
59:43 brave browser or back place but I still
59:45 want you guys to at least get brave
59:48 browser and change your search engine to
59:49 two DuckDuckGo once you get it you'll
59:52 poke the deep state I completely out in
59:54 your house you could put it on your
59:56 telephone - it's a great browser there's
59:59 an all new Reese's in a remastered
60:01 season one excuse me and it's a lot
60:04 shorter and tighter and the volumes are
60:06 balanced it's all good I have put out
60:09 two designs for t-shirts as of this day
60:12 so I'm playing with the us
60:15 artwork because I think a lot of you
60:18 like UFOs in general because I do but
60:20 I've never seen someone create a really
60:22 cool t-shirt with that so I'm going to
60:24 continue to build more and more t-shirts
60:27 because I just love doing it in the
60:28 first place and so we'll make some that
60:30 stink and some that are okay I don't
60:33 like the way the store looks because
60:35 it's sort of a big kitchen sink design
60:37 and the oldest shirt is at the front
60:39 which is really really weird so I'm
60:41 gonna continue toying with that so keep
60:44 your eyes open if you want to get some
60:45 apparel there should be pretty cool I
60:48 need to order some myself as a matter of
60:49 fact I think that's about it so until
60:53 the next episode take care of yourself
60:55 and someone else adjust your patterns
60:56 that I will see you in the next deep
60:58 thoughts over now
