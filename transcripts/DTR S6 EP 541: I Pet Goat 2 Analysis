00:11 [Music]
00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen
00:37 now what season would be complete
00:39 without a nice lounge visit
00:42 so i thought we'd change it up because
00:43 it's going to be a really
00:45 interesting episode now this episode is
00:48 about
00:49 one of the most bizarrely brilliant
00:52 beautiful
00:52 crazy masterpieces on the internet
00:57 it's a video called ipet goat two
01:00 which i personally interpret as the
01:02 letter as the word t-o-o
01:04 and not number two even though two's on
01:06 there
01:07 could be wrong but that's how i
01:08 interpret it
01:10 this is such a bizarre video it's been
01:13 covered
01:14 since 2012 when it released it is
01:18 it has been created by a company called
01:20 heliofont
01:22 but the story behind the video
01:25 and its creator which we're going to get
01:27 into here
01:29 is beyond bizarre i think there's a lot
01:32 of disinformation
01:33 from the source
01:36 but they sort of gave us a gift at the
01:37 same time
01:39 it's like general flynn given us some
01:42 truth gifts but he also disenfolded in
01:43 the same video
01:45 same sort of thing i have
01:49 viewed several reviews since 2012
01:53 on youtube about 80 percent of them are
01:56 gone
01:57 they're really good ones and so i leaned
02:00 over to more of the blog sites that
02:03 review this so what i'm going to do in
02:06 this video
02:07 is sort of go through the video and i'll
02:09 be showing you clips of it as we go
02:10 along
02:11 it's going to be a doozy to edit but
02:14 then i'm going to give you my
02:15 interpretation
02:16 because some of the blog sites seem to
02:18 be 100 on the side of this
02:21 official story out of this company and
02:23 other blog sites are
02:25 they have no access to the author or the
02:27 company
02:29 even though the company's put together a
02:31 pretty cool website
02:33 that will try to explain a lot of this
02:36 stuff
02:37 but there's just there's too much
02:41 sort of uh symbolism that has
02:45 that that um i should say competes with
02:48 each other
02:50 for me to buy a lot of the official
02:52 story
02:53 and it is such a convoluted masterpiece
02:57 and i mean that is a 100
02:58 compliment it's esoteric i don't know
03:02 what drug you'd have to drop
03:03 to sit down and write this out
03:07 if one had a 100 year plan of the ruling
03:10 class
03:11 and you consolidated it down into like
03:13 seven and a half minutes
03:15 that's where this video makes 100 sense
03:18 because imagine consolidating the 20th
03:20 century
03:21 into seven minutes well a lot of stuff
03:23 happens in
03:24 the hundred years right the author
03:28 you know he pretends that this just came
03:32 to him over the course of
03:33 uh the four years it took him to really
03:36 create it
03:38 he says that uh 2007 he started getting
03:40 inklings of this video 2008 he took it
03:43 on
03:44 full time but this dude is a very famous
03:49 effects guy i'm not exactly sure how to
03:51 say his last name but his name is
03:53 louis lebrev or lefebrev
03:56 something like that he's in montreal
03:59 canada
04:00 this dude has worked on lord of the
04:02 rings uh the two towers
04:05 he's worked on a ton of stuff so this
04:07 guy there there's
04:09 there's no mystery as to how he got so
04:11 much quality into this thing
04:13 but the money to create this video
04:17 is astronomical the amount of
04:21 modeling texturing animation just paying
04:24 for the animation to occur in terms of
04:26 someone modeling and moving things
04:28 around then sending off to a render farm
04:31 to render it up gorgeous nothing is
04:34 trivial
04:35 in in a single second of this video
04:39 every single second has been smithed
04:41 with
04:42 more metric tons of symbolism than you
04:44 will find
04:45 i think in any masonic temple any
04:48 catholic
04:49 cathedral it's amazing
04:54 pound for pound this is a
04:57 cinematic accomplishment he's won
04:59 several awards although very esoteric
05:02 and their source and rightfully so
05:07 we can contest whether or not he's in
05:09 the know i am i will tell you that
05:11 before we even march
05:12 down this path this video was released
05:14 in 2012
05:16 the the notre dame church
05:21 you know burned up in real life
05:24 michelle obama was on a river sipping a
05:26 wine
05:27 with the with the fire and the brimstone
05:30 in the glass as she sipped it
05:32 so she was there to watch it happen so
05:35 it wasn't some random thing if you watch
05:37 the
05:38 the surveillance videos you got guys
05:40 running all around that roof setting
05:42 that fire
05:43 it was a very orchestrated event and
05:45 it's in this video
05:46 in 2012. actually i think i misquoted a
05:50 year was 2005. he said he started having
05:52 inklings of this
05:54 of this creation some people have
05:57 uh said that the helia font company name
06:01 uh also matches a tarot card called the
06:04 hero font i'm not sure how to say it
06:06 right
06:08 but i want to be honest it took me a
06:10 while
06:11 one to figure out where i was going to
06:12 get my sources from because they keep
06:13 getting deleted
06:15 but two what did i think of this thing
06:19 there's going to be an opening scene
06:22 that's very satanic
06:24 i think there's a tremendous amount of
06:26 new world order stuff in here
06:29 it's calling out horrific false flags
06:31 like 911 and even the author said that
06:34 he now knows that 911 was an inside job
06:37 which i guess is to get us on his side i
06:39 don't know
06:40 i don't mean to cast aspersions on this
06:42 guy aspersions on this guy
06:44 if uh if he's legit it just seems like
06:49 notre dame burning come on how'd you
06:51 know
06:52 how did you know that was going to take
06:53 place of all the places you would have
06:55 picked
06:57 it's being played off as a symbol of the
06:59 death of religion
07:00 so that we could be reborn but one of
07:04 the summations i read before we get
07:05 started because i want to give you sort
07:07 of a bedrock as you listen to this thing
07:09 and we're going to be showing the slides
07:11 and stuff it's going to take take
07:12 forever again
07:14 is that the video is presenting to you
07:17 either you're going to be a goat in a
07:19 fema camp
07:21 with a barcode that reads 666 on your
07:23 forehead because you're asleep
07:25 or you're going to turn into an
07:28 enlightened person because you've read
07:29 pills yourself
07:30 is sort of one of the ways that one of
07:33 the summations
07:35 conclusions was written about this video
07:39 i would say that it's more of a
07:44 prediction and it just i can't shake it
07:49 so let's hop right in so the place where
07:53 the video gets its initial
07:54 satanic connection is the opening scene
07:59 and boy have i heard some bizarre ass
08:02 stuff
08:03 but you have like a dog house and this
08:06 goat
08:06 which is the symbol for baphomet the
08:09 devil
08:10 sticking his head out through a hole
08:13 he's got this barcode on his forehead
08:17 you got barbed wire and uh you know the
08:20 shot towers in the background full on
08:21 fema cam
08:23 which you know if you think about the
08:24 fema camp thing it is definitely a
08:27 symbol of being
08:28 held captive from your mind from your
08:30 future from your freedom
08:33 now the goat for me doesn't make any
08:37 sense for symbolism symbolizing you're
08:39 either going to be a goat or you're
08:40 going to be free
08:41 the goat is not the the go-to
08:45 symbol it's the sheep remember
08:49 the elite call us sheep when we follow
08:51 them
08:52 they call us cattle when they send our
08:54 best and brightest off to war
08:56 and get them killed it's to kill off
08:59 your alpha males and your strong omega
09:02 females
09:03 so that you don't have any base you
09:04 can't fight back because we're always
09:06 preoccupying
09:08 the strong with war and we just kill
09:10 them off as fast as they create
09:12 as they create themselves from our
09:13 families
09:15 who cares what the sheep do at home they
09:17 put masks on do anything that you tell
09:18 them to do
09:20 so i don't buy that link for me
09:23 it's straight up satanism and as this
09:26 goat starts off he starts shaking his
09:29 head
09:30 in this circle and he is hypnotizing you
09:34 as it begins to say you're looking into
09:38 the face of satan
09:40 let me tell you a little bedtime story
09:41 kitties that's how i interpret it
09:44 there's also a weird illustration stick
09:46 figure of a guy walking a dog
09:49 written on the
09:52 goat's dog house or whatever it is
09:55 some genius
09:58 took every dimension of this stick
10:00 figure and said see it spells donald
10:02 trump
10:03 i mean the level of [ __ ] idiocy you
10:05 need to believe that's crazy pardon my
10:07 french
10:09 now very soon after that that fades to
10:11 black as you're going into this
10:13 this tale the next thing you see is a
10:16 reptile
10:17 set of hands holding a marionette thing
10:20 and for those who don't know what that
10:21 means that's the
10:22 a marionette is a doll with strings on
10:24 it right like the old days
10:26 like howdy doody days but it's a cross
10:28 t-bar of a marionette
10:30 and you have these skinned hands
10:33 i mean david ike must have felt amazing
10:35 to see the vindication that
10:37 the reptiles are in his world are ruling
10:40 mankind from above and we would refer to
10:44 them as satan
10:45 because of what they do is never for the
10:47 benefit of man
10:48 but he is controlling the scene down
10:50 below which we'll get to in a second
10:52 but on his left finger left ring finger
10:54 i believe is the
10:55 letter s ring standing for satan on the
11:00 right fingers
11:01 you've got two bleeding index uh
11:04 and forefinger that blood is you know
11:08 dripping down the
11:09 the wire down below and what's
11:11 interesting about this is you have that
11:13 marina bronovich chick who has all these
11:16 rituals about cutting your fingers
11:18 and eating the pain while you're
11:19 molesting a child
11:21 if you remember her 1997 art
11:24 installation was having a little statue
11:26 of a child and she's splattering blood
11:28 on it in the corner
11:29 saying it's pig's blood but i guarantee
11:31 you if we did a biopsy on that blood it
11:33 was children's human blood
11:35 that's just my opinion not a fact and
11:38 then we have
11:39 john podesta and barack obama showing up
11:42 uh brock with this little girl twice
11:44 and this little exactly what her little
11:48 ritual in 97 said you needed to do
11:51 now the next scene we see i want you to
11:53 pay attention because i didn't hear
11:54 anyone mention this
11:56 when we see these hands controlling this
11:58 marionette
12:00 the blood is going down the first two
12:02 fingers on the right hand
12:04 now down below you have george bush
12:07 who's going to be in a classroom
12:10 but there's no unless i'm missing
12:12 something there's no blood coming down
12:14 to his body which would be interesting
12:17 what would that symbolize in the first
12:18 place but blood is typically with this
12:21 thing being so
12:22 symbolic the blood coming down from
12:24 these two fingers on the right hand
12:27 would be some sacrificial ceremony
12:30 maybe imbuing those below with the blood
12:33 of the
12:34 beast above maybe a bloodline
12:38 literally blood on a line all the way
12:40 down to
12:41 george bush now in this georgia bush
12:45 scene
12:46 it's linked supposedly to the
12:50 911 classroom of which george bush jr
12:52 was sitting in
12:53 when 9 11 is occurring right now my
12:56 personal opinion is
12:59 i i i would believe 50 50 that george
13:02 bush junior knew
13:03 9 11 was going to occur i know his
13:05 brother
13:06 martin bush was ahead of security while
13:08 the explosives are being put in the
13:09 towers
13:11 but the little kids are reading this the
13:14 pet goats
13:14 story and so there's a loose connection
13:17 there
13:18 i mean they could have really put it on
13:19 point but they didn't
13:21 now this room is crazy and the video i
13:25 watched
13:26 gosh five six seven years ago
13:29 this woman had about an hour and 40
13:31 minute video if any of you find this
13:33 please let me know
13:34 she has done the most exhaustive
13:36 symbolic breakdown
13:38 of this room than any other videos i've
13:41 ever seen
13:42 there's a ton of writing on the
13:44 chalkboard there's a writing on the wall
13:48 there's this checkered floor print
13:52 it's black of my checker which
13:54 apparently is a very common
13:56 floor tile plan of a masonic lodge lodge
14:00 he is moving around really bizarre
14:05 acting stupid he's got a duns hat on
14:09 now a lot of us believe that george bush
14:13 is
14:13 not a [ __ ] like he behaved several
14:16 times on camera
14:18 that his whole innocent weird southern
14:21 draw
14:21 thing considering he was raised in
14:23 connecticut and he's scared of horses
14:25 he plays his cowboy on tv now he did
14:27 spend a tremendous amount of time in
14:29 texas eventually in his lifetime so you
14:31 can pick up a draw here and there
14:33 a lot of folks say he's playing in fact
14:36 i had a buddy of mine that
14:38 i shouldn't say buddy had an
14:39 acquaintance in mind for a while that
14:41 had been in the bush circles and he told
14:43 me flat out i think it was in this room
14:44 like right over there and he goes
14:46 he goes i know the guy he goes he's not
14:48 an idiot and he doesn't talk like that
14:49 in real life
14:50 same sort of thing you hear about donald
14:52 trump he has this persona on tv
14:55 where he calls everybody names behind
14:56 the scenes he's totally professional and
14:59 doesn't act like that at all because you
15:01 couldn't become a billionaire
15:02 acting like that dude why they do that i
15:05 don't know man
15:07 but george bush jr in this animation
15:10 is he's sort of dancing around he starts
15:12 doing like tap dancing and stuff
15:14 and the insinuation there which i think
15:17 is fairly correct is that he's trying to
15:18 distract the people
15:21 like that's his job you're the president
15:23 you're here to distract from the people
15:25 which beckons back to uh what is it
15:27 zepha beebo brock's from
15:29 hitchhiker's guide they noted in there
15:32 the only person sufficient to be
15:35 the president of the galaxy is someone
15:37 so stupid
15:38 that they don't actually realize they're
15:40 not the president of the galaxy
15:43 just all this stuff echoes together in
15:44 my brain
15:46 now he's got the duns cap on and then
15:48 there's this wild transformation
15:51 he transforms by twisting his head and
15:53 he turns into a barack obama
15:56 but instead having a dunce cap on he has
15:59 a
16:00 graduation cap on to represent
16:03 his intellect it represents the persona
16:07 of which you were sold
16:09 george bush jr is an idiot barack obama
16:12 is completely
16:12 brilliant it technically i'm just going
16:16 to throw this out there uh you know who
16:18 knows
16:18 technically it could be they played
16:21 george bush off as an idiot
16:23 so that when they threw in a lesser
16:25 candidate
16:26 now he didn't end up being necessarily
16:28 lesser than any way shape or form
16:30 but they could have picked someone other
16:31 than barack obama without a
16:33 harvard degree supposedly and you would
16:36 have picked him because george was so
16:37 bad
16:38 but george did get reelected don't
16:40 forget that
16:42 now during barack's appearance
16:46 they switch over to a girl that looks
16:48 like alice from allers in wonderland
16:51 and she is sitting down with her knees
16:53 folded back behind her her legs folded
16:55 back on her at the knees
16:57 and she's surrounded by this crazy
17:00 what looks like a vatican sculpture in
17:02 the basement of all these kind of
17:03 screaming souls
17:04 it's a very impressionistic statue
17:06 around her these kids aren't moving or
17:08 anything
17:09 and she's holding this red apple
17:12 apple and eventually it falls out of her
17:14 hand or she kind of lets it go
17:16 it rolls across this checkered floor
17:20 hits obama's foot breaks in half
17:23 and these two stems come out and turn
17:25 into this lotus flower
17:28 now the official explanation is that the
17:31 girl realized the
17:32 apple wasn't hers the hell that means
17:37 and from this flower comes the lotus
17:39 which is supposed to be
17:41 the flower of unity
17:44 it also has been related to the mary
17:47 from the bible
17:49 and at that point sweat starts to come
17:52 down obama's face
17:53 he looks down at it going oh my god this
17:55 is supposed to symbolize and i certainly
17:57 hope this is true because this would
17:59 yield to a much better meaning and
18:01 purpose of this video
18:03 that this was the the great awakening
18:06 that was going to be occurring that
18:07 we're in today
18:08 and that obama's worried about this
18:09 great awakening
18:11 now again when you get to the rest of
18:14 this video
18:16 it's a little hard to believe that
18:17 anyone thinks this is a super exciting
18:19 thing
18:20 and i want to say that um i showed this
18:23 video to a friend i might have mentioned
18:24 this before
18:26 and we watched all the way through and
18:28 he just looked at me and he said man
18:30 don't ever show him anything like this
18:31 again grown man 57 years old
18:34 it was that disturbing to him doesn't
18:37 have blood or guts
18:38 i mean we'll actually get some blood but
18:41 you know there's much worse stuff on the
18:43 internet
18:44 than this beautiful animated video
18:45 that's just really [ __ ] weird man
18:49 now at this point the camera starts to
18:53 pull out of the classroom
18:56 and i should say that just before we
18:57 leave the classroom there's a bunch of
19:00 stuff all over the walls and the floors
19:02 and people done amazing
19:04 analyses on these the one that's really
19:06 easy to
19:07 grip is above both these presidents that
19:11 transformed is an evolution picture
19:13 right
19:14 so it says fish to man fish monkey man
19:17 then man carrying weapons and then on
19:20 the
19:21 far side it has a man standing straight
19:24 facing the illustration and he's got a
19:26 halo around his head of sun
19:28 meaning he's been enlightened so we get
19:30 all the way through all these phases and
19:32 then we're suddenly enlightened
19:34 okay and again the weird thing about
19:37 this
19:38 is is uh if we had like these
19:41 incredible controllers
19:44 then why would they allow us to be ever
19:46 unenlightened that's the weird thing
19:49 what was the trigger for them to care
19:50 all of a sudden
19:52 i don't buy it you pull out of this
19:54 window and on the wall
19:56 is a psalm psalm 5 3.
20:00 in short this psalm is in the morning
20:03 lord you hear my voice in the morning i
20:05 lay my
20:06 requests before you and wait expectingly
20:10 now as we pull away from the psalm on
20:13 the wall which is a really cool piece of
20:14 graffiti
20:15 they passed a tattered american flag
20:18 which
20:19 we're assuming represents the end of
20:21 america
20:22 because everything in that is in this
20:24 world is dying in this video
20:26 that's what you have to realize there's
20:28 no stone
20:30 that's not messed with very shortly
20:33 after seeing the flag
20:35 often the distance is two symbolic
20:37 representations
20:39 of the world trade centers from 2001.
20:44 they crumble in a very very
20:47 similar fashion that the real trade
20:49 centers did in real life
20:51 so exploding all the way down basically
20:55 there's a mask dancer dancing on one of
20:58 the uh
20:59 i guess it's kind of like everything's
21:00 icy and sort of an icebergy thing
21:03 even though it could be symbolic of
21:04 something else
21:06 but he falls into the sea which
21:10 may or may not be something related to
21:13 the man behind the curtain
21:14 is also dying with the towers that the
21:17 game is up the jig is up
21:19 no longer will be will they be capable
21:22 of doing this again because that guy
21:24 dies
21:25 and believe me if you know more about
21:27 this video and you're like god you
21:29 screwed this good thing completely up
21:31 i totally welcome criticism and other
21:34 links and
21:35 other concepts should be uh one for the
21:38 for the ages
21:40 then a boat comes by with anubis at the
21:42 helm and for those of you
21:44 unfamiliar with anubis after
21:47 the fabled menace united north and south
21:50 egypt being the opposite north and south
21:52 to us and modern day
21:55 anubis who was a god of his entire
21:57 vulcanized area
21:59 because back in the day before this
22:02 uniting
22:03 of egypt it was cut up like states
22:07 and so imagine imagine america's got 50
22:10 states and they had 50 gods
22:12 and if you were in texas the texas god
22:14 handled everything from fertility to
22:16 making your crops grow and good luck and
22:18 all that kind of stuff and the next door
22:20 could be raw
22:20 next door could be anubis when they
22:22 combine them all together
22:24 then your guy would only have one job
22:27 not the whole job
22:28 and so anubis was relegated to taking
22:30 you over the river sticks after you die
22:33 to usher you into the afterlife
22:36 now i read this note tonight and put it
22:38 in my notes
22:40 but i i didn't have time to watch it one
22:42 more time
22:43 they claim that there's an iceberg
22:45 shaped like a ship
22:47 that comes into view so i didn't see
22:50 that
22:50 but i'll have to go watch that again
22:51 i'll put that definitely in the video
22:53 obviously as i go along but then we get
22:57 a close-up on osama bin laden
23:01 and he is littered with crazy symbolism
23:03 all over him
23:05 he looks like he's conducting an
23:06 orchestra he's got a cia badge on him
23:10 he is doing his thing under a red
23:12 crescent moon
23:14 and the red crescent moon which is not
23:17 to be confused with yellow moons
23:19 on red flags but the red crescent moon
23:21 supposedly is a
23:23 symbol for the end of times he has a
23:27 an upside down flame i believe it's in
23:30 his beard yeah
23:32 and that's supposed to symbolize that
23:34 his soul is still burning in the
23:36 afterlife
23:38 man like where people come up with this
23:39 stuff i have no freaking idea
23:42 the other thing i didn't notice until i
23:44 did this analysis was that
23:46 he has black wings off his back
23:50 and it was described as sort of an
23:52 oxymoron
23:54 he has black angel wings making him an
23:56 angel of death
23:58 okay so i guess that makes sense i just
24:01 never really think of angels being dark
24:03 if you go to satan's side we call you
24:04 demons and that's it
24:07 now behind bin laden are what they call
24:10 missile soldiers
24:12 now of course bin laden is a symbol of
24:13 the middle east
24:15 and so right away you will see a trail
24:18 of
24:18 oil dripping into the ocean
24:23 which symbolizes sort of the whole
24:25 priority of being over there
24:27 you know i think most people know that
24:29 bin laden was a cia asset in the 70s
24:32 and there's a lot of i don't know if you
24:36 could call them even rumors i think it's
24:37 pretty confirmed that he was in jordan
24:40 in july getting dialysis for his kidneys
24:43 and american base the dude's six foot
24:45 five
24:46 doesn't wear any jewelry i believe he's
24:48 left handed as well
24:50 so when they show you that video of him
24:51 supposedly going and admitting to
24:53 toppling the towers with all of his
24:55 buddies that dude's wearing jewelry
24:57 and is right-handed and is in six foot
24:59 five
25:01 so it looks like they used a little body
25:03 double for those of us who think all of
25:04 arabs supposedly look alike which they
25:06 don't
25:08 so they pan over to the statue of
25:10 liberty
25:11 who the helia font people call
25:16 lady heliotree
25:19 something like that and i mean like why
25:22 why even stretch your story like that
25:24 it's the statue of liberty it's the
25:25 world trade centers don't give them fake
25:27 names just to you know absolve yourself
25:29 from
25:30 doing this stuff but what's really funny
25:31 is
25:33 it's kind of shot from above and you can
25:35 see the statue of liberty standing on
25:36 the star david
25:38 but statue of liberty drops her torch
25:42 obviously symbolizing the end of liberty
25:45 oh because that's a really that's a
25:47 really good thing we're going to be
25:48 totally reborn in this video
25:49 it's going to be all positive at the end
25:51 and
25:53 we've so far lost america we've lost the
25:56 statue of liberty
25:58 and bin laden seems to be conducting an
26:00 orchestra
26:02 interesting right the orchestra
26:04 symbolizing he participated i
26:06 i think by really loaning his face
26:10 to the movement of 911 and
26:13 again i was up late one night in
26:15 december of 2001
26:18 and the pentagon went to a podium and
26:20 said he died
26:21 of dialysis because he was already dying
26:25 and so he just he just in a dying effort
26:28 to help the cia he uh donates his name
26:31 yeah using me up i'm gonna be dead
26:34 i remember how they said that he was uh
26:35 recording a lot of cassette tapes
26:37 i mean what a freaking joke right but
26:40 when they used to say he was being
26:42 filmed you know confessing throughout
26:44 the next couple years
26:46 people who spoke arabic read his lips
26:48 and say this is not he's not saying
26:50 anything that you
26:51 are insinuating he's saying it dawned on
26:54 me later on could you imagine him
26:56 being in a conference call which we had
26:58 that technology back then at least in
26:59 the computer realm not in the mobile
27:01 realm
27:02 but imagine he's giving his you know
27:05 he's talking to the cia the whole time
27:07 and he's like
27:07 yeah i got another idea and they cut it
27:09 all together and pitch it to us like
27:10 he's admitting something
27:12 i just think that would be sort of
27:13 hysterical
27:15 so now we get to the point where it goes
27:18 cray-cray
27:20 we pan back and you get to see a an egg
27:24 which obviously represents a fetus
27:26 wrapped up in a snake
27:29 now they try to the company tries to
27:32 play this off as the most angelic thing
27:34 in the world
27:35 that uh you know classically in history
27:37 the egg surrounded by the snake meant
27:39 that
27:40 whatever was in there just had infinite
27:43 capability
27:44 those of you who might know something
27:46 about satanism might have a completely
27:48 different view on what i'm just saying
27:51 they call it the orphic egg which stands
27:54 for the soul of the philosopher
27:57 now remember we said about the hands on
28:00 the marionette
28:02 there's a reptile eye now staring
28:05 at the egg kind of making sure it grows
28:07 up properly
28:09 q david ike reptiles around the world
28:12 this video is basically saying
28:13 this infinite soul philosopher
28:17 is being managed by some reptiles
28:21 who have bleeding hands and what satan
28:23 rings on
28:25 they'll be cut back to anubis who before
28:29 was kind of shrouded but now he pops out
28:31 and it's this crazy version of jesus
28:35 i for those of you who love jesus and
28:38 he's a part of your life
28:39 believe me i'm not saying this is jesus
28:42 the guys that we know
28:44 it's some crazy
28:47 satanic jesus okay this thing has
28:51 an all-seeing eye through the middle
28:53 which of course from heliophon's
28:54 standpoint is boy he's so enlightened
28:56 has the pyramid on the forehead
29:00 uh in the previous scene we're watching
29:03 this kid there's a pyramid on a guy's
29:04 goatee thing on this metal brace that's
29:06 going the upside down way
29:08 and they tried to play it off like
29:10 that's the that's the evil one
29:12 pointing down and jesus got the good one
29:13 pointing up
29:15 what's on the dollar it's the one that
29:17 goes up right so give me a break
29:20 but jesus until the very end of this
29:22 episode
29:23 this this video is going to have his
29:26 eyes shut the entire time
29:29 and he's drunk kind of he's sort of just
29:31 oh god he's all drugged out man
29:33 he's got all this crap all over his body
29:36 it would be the
29:38 you know picking christ to be this focal
29:41 point
29:42 symbolism of supposedly the hero to save
29:45 the day
29:46 but lighting him up with all this stuff
29:48 that's so pagan and so
29:50 illuminati is an oxymoron
29:54 if you buy this alex jones technique
29:56 where this guy's an angel made this
29:58 video
29:58 this is all good for us and he doesn't
30:00 have anything with satan or anything
30:01 like that
30:02 then you're buying an antichrist as your
30:04 christ
30:05 in this video because i've never seen a
30:07 more
30:09 accurate brilliant representation of an
30:12 antichrist than this character
30:13 so i guess i shouldn't have said jesus
30:15 but
30:17 i think it's an attempt to portray an
30:19 antichrist i think they did a brilliant
30:20 job
30:22 he's got a burning heart as well which
30:26 you know there's a lot of pictures of
30:28 christ with his heart revealed you know
30:30 in pictures he's also wearing a crown of
30:33 thorns which will eventually disappear
30:35 at the very end when he opens his eyes
30:37 so they're calling this a weird
30:39 character that's monitoring this kid
30:41 draco the boy's name according to the
30:45 company is
30:46 ludovic l-u-d-o-v-i-c
30:51 and it's the draco guy that has the
30:53 little brace thing on his uh
30:55 chin there ludovic
30:59 i guess in german uh
31:02 can mean the illustrious in combat
31:06 so the kid's there to fight a war you
31:08 know so
31:10 the striko guy is controlling the kid as
31:13 he grows up
31:15 and you see the stock market scroll
31:16 through his eyes
31:18 which is is a really strange thing
31:22 it's almost like you're being
31:23 indoctrinated to believe the economic
31:25 system that's out there which is
31:26 designed to steal money from the poor
31:28 and give it all to the rich then you see
31:31 an a bunch of
31:33 air strikes on a mosque
31:36 and after this thing gets bombed you see
31:39 some birds fly out of the mosque
31:43 really symbolizing supposedly the soul
31:45 release from that location that you're
31:47 even though you've lost your religious
31:50 center your soul is going to be okay
31:53 and the birds turn into butterflies
31:58 and they fly over to jesus then by
32:01 touching them
32:02 burns them so let's just take that
32:04 antichrist
32:06 symbolism and say souls
32:09 manage to escape a bomb mosque fly over
32:12 to the antichrist he touches
32:14 their souls and they burst into flames
32:16 that
32:17 doesn't sound like the guy we know from
32:20 the bible right
32:22 and what they say is like it's like some
32:25 symbol of what's going on with us on
32:26 earth
32:28 this is from the company men then we
32:31 start seeing
32:32 dancers they're going to be a few
32:33 dancers throughout the video
32:36 the guy who uh you know put this thing
32:39 together
32:40 wants you to believe that they're
32:42 symbolic of native american dancers
32:44 uh the only catch is he could have taken
32:48 a little time out of his schedule and
32:50 made them look a little bit more like
32:52 native americans so anytime
32:54 observable reality conflicts with the bs
32:56 that you've been told
32:58 i'm gonna sign on the air of [ __ ]
33:02 then we sort of have a probably one of
33:05 the only routine
33:07 or i should say less
33:10 interpretive moments which is an arab
33:12 woman in black
33:14 and a burka crying over her son who's in
33:17 a bunch of bandages which is definitely
33:20 the name of the game for the last
33:22 pre-trump years
33:24 and you see a halo around her head and
33:26 you see a mushroom cloud go up in the
33:28 background
33:30 and they're trying to say that this is a
33:32 an homage to
33:34 when mary holds dead jesus
33:38 you know before he rises again and the
33:41 boy
33:42 is his name is that's two a's
33:45 l i ali a scarab
33:49 beetle crawls across his face which
33:52 i guess represents regeneration
33:55 then you see a young african girl with
33:57 red glowing robot eyes
33:59 she's holding a gun as a faceless
34:01 stranger and pulls a ribbon off her
34:04 and the lights go flicker out and
34:07 supposedly
34:08 okay what's really interesting about
34:10 this we're talking about having made
34:11 this video for 2008-2012
34:14 supposedly this is his spot-on
34:16 interpretation of
34:18 human trafficking that was going on in
34:20 the background
34:21 of course until trump started trying to
34:23 fight it
34:25 yeah i mean you know kofi nan's son
34:28 did the food for sex run down there so
34:31 that's
34:33 very believable then you see another
34:35 lotus flower
34:36 floating down a green stream and they
34:40 have this
34:41 character juan pepito
34:46 which i don't have any familiar with
34:48 this guy but they portrayed him as a
34:49 like a
34:50 environmental activist in south america
34:52 that is
34:53 being swallowed up in a green goo and of
34:56 course he's being consumed by what he's
34:58 trying to stop
34:59 from happening and he has a sickle and
35:02 hammer with him
35:03 so the funny thing was the company was
35:05 trying to say this is where communism
35:07 and socialism
35:08 is dying as well okay well it's not
35:12 dying at all
35:13 it's in full effect all around the
35:14 planet that's the destination form of
35:16 government
35:17 so this is where again the lies about
35:20 the video
35:21 are fully exposed in my opinion you're
35:23 being bullshitted about what this video
35:25 is about by its creators because it is
35:27 not
35:28 what they say it is then you see a
35:31 little girl recreating the scene from
35:32 tiananmen square in 89 where the guy
35:35 stood in front of the tank and they
35:37 didn't run over him it's a little girl
35:39 she's got a tattoo of a heart on one
35:41 side of her face
35:42 and the other side of her face she has a
35:45 you know an anti-toxicity symbol
35:48 and i think what looks like a tattoo of
35:51 japan on her forehead
35:53 then they introduce the character they
35:55 call skulduggery because as she's doing
35:57 this this
35:58 skeleton hand touches on her shoulder
36:00 she turns around at school duggary
36:02 looking at her
36:03 that's when she turns back around and
36:06 second guesses their actions is what
36:08 they're saying
36:09 then we go back to this antichrist still
36:11 has his eyes closed
36:12 still drugged out moving to this music
36:14 the music's great too by the way
36:16 and he's still got the heart in his
36:17 chest burning
36:20 so draco is still on top of this ludovic
36:22 kid
36:23 and the boys tries to fight off the
36:24 sorcery
36:26 but he's still influenced by draco who's
36:28 traumatizing the hell out of him
36:31 and this kid has got like a really
36:32 screwed up head like he's got this
36:34 sort of egghead and he's being
36:36 brainwashed by tv
36:38 and it's
36:42 it's really what's going on right now
36:44 and i want to break for one little
36:45 digression
36:47 because i'm talking to a friend of mine
36:48 tonight for those of us who grew up
36:50 without the internet as children
36:52 right you made it to 20 years old
36:53 without any internet
36:55 we just for those of you who grew up in
36:57 it i'm very sorry you grew up in the
36:59 internet
37:01 the difference between say my life and
37:04 someone who grew up with the internet
37:06 because this is really related to this
37:08 video and how this kid's being
37:09 brainwashed in this movie
37:12 i got to live my life with my family and
37:15 friends and my own personal time
37:17 for 20 plus years right
37:20 kids today are robbed of that
37:24 almost entirely unless they grow up with
37:26 really strict parents or for whatever
37:28 reason
37:28 social media and the internet is general
37:31 in general
37:32 meaning text messages and everything
37:34 snapchat everything
37:35 unless those things never appealed to
37:37 you and you lived your own life which is
37:39 hard now because
37:40 you're gonna live it with when everyone
37:41 else is jacked into the tv
37:43 jacked into the internet you missed your
37:45 entire life
37:47 so it's still time to get it back just
37:49 realize disassociating with a lot of
37:51 social media and
37:53 other people's opinions is a very
37:55 empowering thing because you start
37:57 living your life instead
37:59 don't worry about impressing anybody
38:00 nobody cares anyway they only hate you
38:02 if you prove to them you're living a
38:04 better life
38:05 now the founders of this video say that
38:08 the next time you see the antichrist
38:10 i'm just going to keep calling them
38:12 antichrist they're going to say he's a
38:14 super jesus
38:16 they said he's breaking through the
38:18 seventh spiritual dimension of our world
38:22 what the hell that means i have no
38:23 freaking idea
38:25 so then we track back to jesus and now
38:28 we see his back and the boats going
38:30 through this cave and it's clearly a
38:33 mouth
38:34 when you look at this thing with the
38:36 little thing hanging in the back
38:37 he's going towards that thing but
38:39 they'll say that it's uh
38:41 it's a heart i don't get that at all
38:46 there's a yin yang in the scene for a
38:47 little bit which is supposedly this
38:50 this union between good and bad to
38:52 achieve a new you know a neutral state
38:55 i don't remember that at all so i'll put
38:56 it in the video
38:58 so we go back to the antichrist and
39:00 you've got fish jumping in the boat with
39:01 them
39:02 they want you to believe those are saved
39:04 souls
39:06 and i would say those are desperate
39:07 souls clinging to
39:10 this new world order that the antichrist
39:12 will usher in
39:14 and so think of the whole video getting
39:16 man to a desperate state
39:19 and jumping in the boat with the
39:20 antichrist to be saved
39:23 it ain't jesus so then you have this
39:26 lone tower
39:27 and this is probably the part one it
39:30 gets censored a lot from
39:31 analysis videos there's an old lady in
39:34 this tower
39:35 they call her madame q and
39:38 let me just describe this to you before
39:40 you hear any interpretation
39:42 of this which i think is most likely
39:43 misdirection
39:45 she's this old woman she's terrified at
39:48 one point she jumps up on this sort of
39:51 lift and she spreads her legs and you
39:53 see her panties
39:55 and then she menstruates through her
39:57 pennies
39:58 no ladies don't menstruate so what's
40:01 going on here
40:03 now the interpretation from their side
40:07 is really weird and i just can't believe
40:10 that this is what they're talking about
40:13 when you show it to someone and this
40:14 scene comes up this is when you'll have
40:16 people in the room go shut that [ __ ] off
40:17 i don't see that
40:18 even grown men and i don't blame them
40:23 but they were trying to say that this
40:25 represented the blood in her paintings
40:27 represents
40:29 all of the sins of women and sex
40:32 okay men i guess were completely
40:35 absolved from this whole thing
40:37 and then either that or how christianity
40:39 has made
40:41 the sexual activity of women sinful
40:45 again new world order once a brave new
40:47 world where little kids are having sex
40:49 with each other all drugged up
40:51 go read the book basically
40:54 a moralist society that they can control
40:57 because we're so screwed up we have no
40:59 direction
41:00 or identity now they said that the
41:04 administration disappears i don't
41:07 remember that at all
41:09 and that this is when the antichrist
41:11 comes through her area
41:13 he is pulling that out of her absolving
41:16 her
41:16 of all this negativity now the
41:20 real chronological events of probably
41:22 the super history real history not the
41:24 stuff we have
41:25 would be there is no sin there uh you
41:29 could feel like there was
41:31 but that there doesn't need to be any
41:33 additional sacrifices or
41:35 what have you because jesus came and
41:37 went and already absolved every one of
41:39 that plus he went straight to the
41:40 brothels and watched the prostitutes
41:42 feet and
41:43 you know this echoing that this has to
41:46 occur again by an antichrist
41:48 i don't buy it so at this point they go
41:51 back to draco and the kid
41:53 there's going to be another kid involved
41:55 this ali ali kid
41:57 but draco finally slithers away from
41:59 this ludovic kid who is
42:01 just done he is whatever draco wanted
42:05 him to be a brainwashed child
42:07 oh geez how's the world working right
42:08 now
42:10 they want you to believe okay after this
42:13 kid was
42:15 tortured by this draco character that he
42:18 walks off completely clear
42:20 of his consciousness like he's been
42:23 freed
42:24 the truth of the matter is
42:27 the kid's screwed he's been
42:29 indoctrinated
42:31 it's almost like the school systems in
42:32 the world where they
42:34 they get the moms working to the point
42:36 that kids have to go directly into a
42:38 system which will start showing al gore
42:40 videos and terrifying them with all
42:41 kinds of other things
42:43 and as soon as the kid gets over a
42:45 certain precipice of being a [ __ ]
42:48 without being actually clinically
42:49 [ __ ] you can let them go because
42:51 they're destroyed for life
42:53 that's what that means to me the next
42:55 one i can get into which is the skull
42:57 duggary character which stopped the
42:58 little girl with the tank
43:00 is now seen conducting an orchestra
43:04 essentially symbolizing that death
43:07 is the ultimate master of this world
43:11 and i would say not the biological death
43:14 clock but more of the
43:15 hey let's fight a war every time we uh
43:17 we need to distract the people away from
43:19 the fact that we're all criminals at the
43:20 top
43:21 so this is where you get this ollie kid
43:25 it's sort of like a
43:27 little black kid he's in this white
43:30 sort of middle eastern claw thing and he
43:32 starts spinning around
43:34 going into the air now this is where i
43:37 found
43:37 one of the funniest conspiracy theories
43:41 out there
43:41 which is that barack obama is a clone of
43:45 akhenaten
43:47 i think akhenaten is a fake insert into
43:49 the
43:50 the dynasties of egypt personally that's
43:52 why all the statues looked
43:54 absolutely unlike any of the artists
43:56 before or after that statue
43:58 or any of his statues were made what are
44:00 the odds what are the odds that that's
44:02 the case
44:03 and there's a video they always play
44:05 where barack obama
44:07 actually visited egypt and looked at the
44:11 statue of akhenaten and said that looks
44:12 like me
44:14 conspiracy confirmed
44:17 they also said that michael i mean
44:21 michelle was uh the clone of his
44:24 wife and the funny thing was it's like
44:27 they didn't have their own kids right
44:28 the obama kids are their buddies kids go
44:30 look up
44:31 real parents of barack obama's kids and
44:34 you'll find the real parents it's like
44:35 plain as day you only think they look
44:38 like the other two
44:39 once you see the real parents like oh my
44:40 god but what if you were clones and the
44:43 one thing you can't do is procreate
44:44 because the little giblets don't work
44:46 right
44:47 that'd be one of the side effects the
44:50 parent cloning
44:51 cloning started 1951 of human beings
44:54 they just kept it on the down low so you
44:56 wouldn't freak out
44:58 and this little kid is wearing this
44:59 sophie
45:01 s-u-f-i clothing which you've seen
45:04 several times with the guys that wear
45:05 the fez
45:06 hats you know the kids uh
45:09 twirling over a mosque which they say is
45:11 in jerusalem
45:13 whatever then there's a bit of a
45:17 this dancer thing which is supposedly
45:19 again
45:20 an homage to native americans okay
45:24 again could have made it look more like
45:26 native americans in my opinion
45:28 a bunch of characters dancing around
45:29 this fire they're the keepers of the
45:32 fire
45:33 and they start transforming a little bit
45:35 one turns into a bear
45:37 it gets super esoteric at that point and
45:40 i won't try to put any extra
45:42 stuff on this the antichrist comes back
45:45 as this cave again starts to collapse
45:48 as soon as he comes out of the cave you
45:49 see this gargoyle
45:51 that is sort of lacing the outer border
45:53 of the entrance
45:55 as he leaves this cave there's a lotus
45:57 again which represents enlightenment
46:00 he rides off into the sunset finally as
46:02 he opens his eyes
46:05 now again as soon as he comes out of
46:06 this cave
46:08 over his right shoulder notre dame
46:11 falls in the background they're
46:14 obviously the
46:15 new world order once all religions gone
46:18 and
46:19 they're going to give you them as gods
46:23 that's what they want absolutely
46:26 defective
46:28 genes i don't know if they're human or
46:29 reptile or whatever the hell they are
46:31 defective genes want to be gods
46:35 i want to be worshipped as gods they
46:37 know they're not
46:38 but they are so mentally disturbed why
46:41 do you think we have a bunch of mental
46:43 illnesses being turned into genders
46:46 and of course they're not calling it
46:47 notre dame they're calling it a chapel
46:50 just so happens to look exactly like
46:51 notre dame
46:53 again his eyes are totally open the
46:55 crown of thorns comes off his head
46:58 then this meteorite hits because they
47:01 flash they turn the camera back around
47:02 now we're looking in the eyes
47:04 in the same path as the antichrist you
47:06 see these three pyramids
47:08 of giza a meteor comes out of the
47:11 sun hits one of the pyramids and then
47:14 this tsunami sort of thing takes out the
47:16 other two pyramids which i guess is
47:18 hitting the great pyramid and it wipes
47:19 out the other ones
47:20 again destroying all of our history
47:24 destroying proof that these lunatics are
47:26 just lunatics
47:28 they need to destroy it all why do you
47:30 think they're taking ange myma off the
47:31 sauce and
47:33 uncle ben who isn't really that guy but
47:35 he is a famous dude who provided most of
47:37 rice to uncle ben company
47:38 the native american girls take it off
47:40 the butter
47:42 these psychopaths won't stop until they
47:44 erase
47:45 every accomplishment of every race other
47:48 than the white race
47:50 and then they're going to exterminate
47:51 the rest of the races and say
47:53 what do you mean what are you talking
47:54 about what's a native american what's a
47:56 black person
47:57 what are you talking about or maybe it
47:59 comes down to a couple races
48:02 but i'm telling you if you're not white
48:04 you should be worried but it's only
48:07 this crazy ruling class that's doing
48:10 this stuff
48:11 and these sjws who are so profoundly
48:13 stupid they don't know they're
48:15 stabbing themselves in the face you know
48:17 it's just unbelievable
48:19 now the major benefit about this
48:22 which i alluded to at the beginning
48:25 is if this is a predictive programming
48:27 thing
48:28 it's sort of nice to know isn't it even
48:31 if you're looking in the playbook
48:32 of what they consider themselves to be
48:35 doing
48:37 the thing that doesn't make any sense is
48:39 is one
48:40 a lot of their narrative for what's
48:42 going on doesn't really pan out in my
48:44 opinion
48:45 okay now let's let's just take the
48:47 economics of the official story
48:50 i've run my own game company before been
48:53 involved with all these big you know
48:55 projects
48:55 electronic arts and other major
48:57 corporations okay
48:59 let's say i was working for electronic
49:01 arts in the heyday mid 90s man
49:04 we're making handover fist money i was
49:06 there in 99 we broke a billion dollars
49:09 okay a billion dollars that's a lot of
49:11 money right
49:13 and let's say i've also made some great
49:15 games
49:16 for the company and i come to the
49:19 company
49:20 some vp i'm working for something
49:24 and i say hey i got this great idea what
49:27 i want to make this crazy game it's
49:30 gonna take
49:31 what is it uh four years to make i've
49:34 been thinking about it for three years
49:35 it's gonna take four years to make
49:37 it's only going to play for 10 minutes
49:39 it's going to be the craziest 10 minutes
49:41 of your life
49:43 it's going to cost millions of dollars
49:45 to make
49:47 and it's going to cost millions of
49:48 dollars in two different ways
49:50 one the price tag for getting it created
49:52 because it might be our internal
49:53 resources
49:55 may not be millions of dollars but what
49:56 we could have done with our
49:58 time instead of making this weird thing
50:01 would have been millions of dollars so
50:03 anytime you take your employees out of
50:05 rotation of creating real money for a
50:06 company you're eating it either way
50:08 right
50:11 how many vps do you think would have
50:13 proved such a thing and it's going to go
50:14 all the way to the ceo
50:16 what are you doing i'm going to take
50:18 about 20 30 guys some of our best town
50:21 in the entire world
50:22 and we're going to create this video
50:24 we're gonna
50:25 it's really bizarre and really strange
50:27 so by the way there's no reference art
50:29 in the entire world that we can use
50:32 everything's gonna be created from
50:33 scratch
50:35 fully animated symbolic every single
50:37 frame of this film is gonna cost us
50:40 50 to 100 thousand dollars to make i
50:42 mean in terms of each
50:44 setup and every scene it might film for
50:45 several seconds
50:47 but each scene is worth a ton of money
50:50 what do you say what do you say about
50:51 this i got this idea no way in
50:54 hell one does this guy have that much
50:56 money from working for two
50:58 lord of the rings uh movies what's the
51:01 guy make uh
51:02 she made a couple hundred grand and he
51:05 might worked on it for
51:06 because the thing is special effects
51:07 guys come in and out he worked on those
51:09 really famous movies but he's one of 300
51:13 people working on that famous movie
51:14 so his cut say he's a special flex
51:16 supervisor or something
51:19 the same makes half a million dollars
51:21 per
51:22 movie so he comes out with a million
51:24 dollars before tax he lives in canada
51:26 highest tax bracket in north america
51:29 what's he got left quarter of a million
51:30 dollars maybe
51:32 he's gonna what not put that in his bank
51:34 so that he can
51:36 live a decent life and retire which
51:37 isn't [ __ ] you know as far as your money
51:40 he'd have to spend in my opinion four or
51:42 five times that amount of money
51:44 just to get this thing to exist
51:47 even if he sends it off to india they'd
51:49 be rendered by some render farm
51:51 ask pixar what seven and a half minutes
51:54 of
51:54 one of their movies cost what every
51:57 asset has to be created from scratch
52:00 plus you have a whole amazing music
52:02 score
52:04 this whole thing stinks like the georgia
52:05 guidestones
52:08 somewhere in the 80s this dude puts
52:10 together these stones it's got this
52:12 ten commandments the first commandment
52:13 is 90
52:15 96.5 percent of the world's wiped off
52:18 the map that's the first commandment
52:21 this county not only built it put it
52:24 there but whoever
52:24 set it up put a trust fund together
52:27 that's got so much money in it
52:29 that 40 years later roughly 35 years
52:32 later
52:34 it's been blown up a couple times they
52:37 graffitied the place nothing ever
52:38 affects it right they blow it up some
52:40 guy tried to pull one down
52:41 pull his axe off his truck the place has
52:44 been vandalized and abused and the
52:46 county shows up
52:47 and rebuilds it all back into place plus
52:49 someone's paying the property tax for
52:51 that whole thing
52:52 every single year the fact that that
52:55 county in georgia can't figure out who
52:56 built that thing is
52:57 ridiculous for me the dude was hired
53:01 to put together a predictive programming
53:03 thing
53:04 it's so beautifully done i mean
53:07 it's a it's a triple a production
53:11 for seven and a half minutes it really
53:12 is i mean hats off to every human being
53:14 to touch this thing
53:16 even though i might criticize the the
53:19 plan that seems to be involved in this
53:20 thing
53:21 i don't get this thing alex jones got
53:23 where this alex jones is ready to make
53:25 babies with this guy i mean he was so
53:28 overwhelmed by this oh god i got to talk
53:31 from
53:31 hollywood for me
53:35 we have an and for those og listeners
53:38 bear with me here
53:39 for people that came in fresh there are
53:41 two movies out there
53:43 that suggest the path that we are going
53:45 on
53:46 and they're both brilliant movies one's
53:49 a lot more exciting than the other one
53:51 but the other one at the end was made
53:54 before this
53:55 second one that was made
53:58 it's the first one to give the example
53:59 for which is
54:01 the corporate big tech takeover of how
54:04 we communicate with each other
54:06 this canceled culture where they try to
54:08 get this girl kicked out of lucasfilms
54:11 for making a very decent association
54:14 with
54:14 tattletailing on your neighbors is
54:16 something that a totalitarian
54:18 dictatorship does that's all she was
54:20 trying to say
54:21 they try to get her kicked off the show
54:24 but the movie is
54:25 a 1975 rollerball with james khan
54:28 that was a world where corporations had
54:30 replaced all nations
54:33 inside the script uh they claimed that
54:35 there's no more starvation everything's
54:38 balanced it's all good good good
54:40 except the problem that the main
54:41 character has james khan
54:43 being the number one roller baller which
54:45 is this crazy sport they created
54:48 and they want him to quit because he is
54:50 so good he's breaking
54:52 their mind control formula that
54:55 rollerball was supposed to prove
54:56 the futility of the individual
55:00 to work with the team and
55:04 what's crazy about that little
55:05 insinuation is that he does work with
55:07 the team
55:07 without the team jonathan e the
55:10 fictional character
55:11 is no is nothing and he would he's
55:13 demonstrated that in the movie and he
55:15 he argues with the old man he's trying
55:16 to make him quit
55:19 then in the end jonathan e wins so you
55:22 got to see how that works out
55:24 the second film which is george lucas's
55:26 first major film with robert duvall
55:29 is thx 1138
55:32 if you if you saw this movie without
55:35 maybe someone preferencing it or without
55:37 being extremely red-pilled
55:38 you might be bored out of your mind you
55:40 may not even get past the first 30
55:42 minutes
55:43 but if you're red pilled and you
55:44 understand stuff like ipad go 2
55:47 and this sort of weird dystopian world
55:50 we're headed to right this 1984
55:53 nightmare that we're headed to
55:55 thx 1138
55:58 is the most picture perfect
56:01 representation
56:02 of this future robert duvall plays his
56:05 character
56:05 stuck in this loop i think he like makes
56:08 plutonium all day through one of those
56:09 windows with the big lung lovers because
56:11 that's just
56:12 scientific looking back in the early 70s
56:16 the police are these robots that look
56:18 like california
56:19 bike cops except they have silver faces
56:22 because they're robots
56:24 see boston dynamics and where they're
56:25 going with the whole thing they have cat
56:27 cattle prods it's non-lethal
56:29 abuse but you're getting zapped all the
56:31 time
56:32 when the robert duvall would go home
56:34 with his wife
56:35 the entertainment that they would see
56:37 would be a whole wall projected with
56:39 them beating
56:40 somebody in the world beating them with
56:43 the
56:44 prod sticks not shocking them beating
56:47 them and you just hear this guy getting
56:48 beat
56:49 and screaming and beat he's just talking
56:51 to his wife like it's no big deal
56:53 and it's sort of the finale of thx 113
56:55 it's very much like a pre-logan's run
56:58 where he just stops taking his pill
57:00 every day and he
57:01 gains his mind back and then he
57:03 eventually finds the way out
57:05 these are profound predictive
57:07 programming
57:09 films and you know honestly i just
57:11 occurred to me that
57:12 potentially tsx113 it's based on someone
57:15 else's book
57:16 which is why it was so sophisticated for
57:18 a very young george lucas
57:21 who apparently didn't want to have
57:23 anything to do with the new world order
57:25 didn't want to have anything to do with
57:27 hollywood which is why he lived in san
57:29 rafael to this day
57:31 now he's got his company in the presidio
57:32 in san francisco
57:34 now is the ipec go to movie important
57:38 really for us i would say
57:43 yes and no the yes
57:46 is that you see the one thematic symbol
57:50 of what's going through this entire film
57:52 and again
57:54 i'm gonna repeat this it's a brilliant
57:56 production
57:58 hats off to everybody who participated i
58:00 don't think anyone that necessarily was
58:02 a workaround has anything to do with
58:04 this stuff
58:05 and even if the guy that made it was
58:08 hired by some crazy
58:09 person to do this i would much rather
58:12 have this thing be made by somebody
58:14 so we can see it than never made so
58:17 don't really have any hard feelings
58:19 towards the dude who made it
58:20 now them lying about potentially lying
58:23 about what scenes they're about
58:24 yeah whatever you can use your own brain
58:27 you're not you're not an idiot
58:29 sometimes when they give you really
58:31 bogus answers for things that are
58:33 apparently not the way they say
58:35 at least we think we're smart enough to
58:36 feel that way
58:38 then it's almost like a big wink-wink
58:40 nudge-nudge
58:42 you see what i'm saying right you see
58:43 what i'm not saying you see between my
58:45 fingers that's what it really means
58:47 but the big theme from this thing which
58:49 is the yes why it's important to you is
58:51 they're trying to destroy all nations
58:54 all religions
58:55 all culture of mankind and more
58:58 terrifying than anything
59:00 trying to destroy the history of man by
59:03 literally destroying
59:05 destroying objects like the great
59:08 pyramids
59:10 the seven wonders of the world will be
59:12 wiped away
59:14 according to this video in my opinion
59:17 can you imagine losing all that
59:20 imagine for any reason someone tries to
59:22 blow up the pyramids
59:24 would be the most catastrophic loss of
59:26 human history
59:27 you know the bummer is it's in the
59:29 middle east and someone could always
59:30 accuse egypt
59:31 doing something and some jerk i don't
59:34 know
59:34 does something crazy dearly hope that
59:37 was more symbolism than anything that's
59:39 going to actually physically take place
59:40 in this world
59:42 that's really all i think that you need
59:44 to take away the rest
59:46 you can appreciate it for its artistic
59:48 creativity
59:49 it's incredible talent but it's not
59:52 important on the other side of that
59:53 thing
59:54 what i like about it is that it's so on
59:57 point
59:58 with so many things and what's
59:59 interesting for sort of me
60:01 looking back on this thing is that and
60:04 this is very
60:05 very indicative of creative projects
60:08 where
60:09 if you've ever written a story or you're
60:11 even writing a a book
60:13 or like you're writing like maybe
60:14 technical manuals on something or
60:17 something like that you'll be really
60:19 detailed at the beginning
60:20 of your story and then you start to
60:22 float away at the end
60:24 because you're tired you're tired of
60:26 typing you're tired of the same
60:27 project i honestly believe that
60:32 the further you go into this video the
60:34 more
60:35 it almost becomes sort of nonsensical
60:39 what's fascinating to me is that out of
60:42 all the chatter that's going on about
60:44 this
60:45 situation that we've been in now for a
60:46 year and about a year now
60:49 start to finish not a year in china but
60:51 a few more months
60:53 about six more months in china is the
60:56 agenda 21 stuff
60:58 and you have to go and look up a woman
61:00 named rosa corey
61:02 k-o-i-r-e
61:04 she's the world expert on agenda 21
61:07 she's an attorney
61:08 she's a libertarian and for those people
61:12 that want to hate on her who are sjws
61:14 she's gay so there you go you got every
61:16 reason why you can't hate her
61:17 but she's a brilliant person she has
61:21 just
61:22 i don't even know how many days of
61:24 videos
61:25 you could watch back-to-back her
61:26 presenting this thing over and over and
61:28 over again
61:30 but a lot of what we are seeing is you
61:32 know when we
61:33 when i started reporting on this long
61:35 time ago
61:36 like two or three years ago even just
61:39 two years ago
61:40 i couldn't see how they were going to
61:41 accomplish the depopulation
61:44 you know a goal of 2030 having about 90
61:47 percent of the world gone
61:50 and now they are trying to create this
61:52 environment where you have to get this
61:54 shot in your arm or even the test kit
61:57 which has got all kinds of morgellon
61:58 strips in it and chips in it and all
62:00 kinds of crazy stuff
62:02 yeah i think the test kits just like
62:04 you're dead in five years
62:06 thank you very much for playing and this
62:07 will speed it up a little bit more too
62:10 they're trying to make you make it so
62:11 you can't even cross state lines
62:13 in your own neighborhood unless you've
62:16 got this death serum in you
62:18 well there you go imagine the only thing
62:21 they have to do
62:22 is create this scare create this
62:25 horrible death serum
62:27 and unfortunately good people have said
62:29 it's good to take
62:31 and you take this thing and in five
62:33 years everybody starts dying off whoever
62:35 took it
62:35 everybody had a swab shoved up to the
62:38 little canals right up here between your
62:39 brain and your nasal canal
62:41 very special place to get through the
62:42 blood-brain barrier little microchips
62:44 going up in there
62:45 more gallons spreading all throughout
62:47 your body piezo effects controlling your
62:49 mind
62:50 but also genetically replacing your
62:52 genome with the patented code so you'll
62:54 be owned
62:55 so five years from now just imagine
62:59 everybody who takes this vaccine is dead
63:02 one way or another and then it turns
63:04 into this world conspiracy of
63:07 or this world oopsie that these
63:10 companies accidentally got something
63:12 wrong because they
63:12 rushed this thing through experimental
63:15 thingymajiggy
63:17 and then you're dead
63:21 just in time for the agenda just in time
63:25 for the agenda
63:26 and if you think about it you're gonna
63:28 have to take a lot of egg on your face
63:31 socially if you choose not to follow the
63:35 herd right the herd of sheep
63:38 however if they all start kicking the
63:40 bucket and maybe they don't but
63:42 if they do start kicking the bucket or
63:44 have nerve damage like the one in
63:46 2009 you're going to be glad you
63:49 resisted you're going to be glad you
63:52 resisted
63:53 and then what could they possibly force
63:55 on you the last one they forced on
63:56 everybody
63:57 caused everybody to die so now they
64:00 can't force anything on you
64:01 because you got a case study going hey
64:03 last uh little
64:05 miracle you created is killed away the
64:07 rest of the world it's the biggest story
64:08 in the world
64:09 with almost no one to read the story
64:11 because most people are dead
64:13 the only problem is now they know that
64:14 the rest of us that are alive can think
64:16 for ourselves
64:17 so we're now public enemy number one
64:21 interesting right so when we sit around
64:23 wondering if there's going to be a plan
64:26 to fix things this is sort of a make or
64:28 break moment for humanity in my opinion
64:31 you know do i think that people are
64:32 going to die in five years from this
64:34 thing
64:35 all i could say is 50 50 and it should
64:37 not be 50 50 it should be
64:40 a fraction of a single percent yes 99
64:43 point whatever
64:44 no but i literally could not say
64:47 on a lie detector test today that i have
64:49 anything more than a 50 50 belief
64:52 that people are participating in this
64:54 extermination
64:55 are not going to be exterminated so
64:58 again
64:59 anybody who makes anything that helps us
65:01 out
65:02 well they're sort of doing us a favor
65:04 regardless if we like the message we
65:06 can't kill the messenger
65:08 as a matter of fact i wish this guy
65:09 would make ipad go 3
65:11 give us a a whole new update on what's
65:14 going on
65:16 so hopefully that was informative i know
65:18 it's a really strange video
65:20 got some other stuff coming out it's
65:21 already been recorded
65:23 this is going to go on a double feature
65:25 patreon people are going to get the
65:26 other one first
65:28 540 this will be 541.
65:31 and on that note you need to go to
65:34 deepthoughtsradio.com and bookmark that
65:36 just in case to see this video and
65:37 they're all upset about it
65:39 again you only get shadow band if you're
65:41 reporting the truth
65:43 uh if you post onto our facebook page
65:45 which is a nice lock facebook page
65:47 and your stuff gets kicked off i give
65:50 you two thumbs up
65:51 because it's most likely something true
65:53 censorship
65:54 is only to protect the evil period
65:58 never forget that if you get censored go
66:01 like this pat yourself on the back
66:03 because you've done humanity go up
66:06 a solid and everyone who saw it got
66:08 informed
66:09 and you know how it works it's over on
66:11 rumble it's over on bid shoot it's over
66:13 on a million other platforms
66:15 i did just make a rumble account i'm
66:17 going to try to upload a few videos and
66:19 see what happens
66:21 the idea of uploading like 570 videos is
66:24 not
66:24 uh high on my list of things to do right
66:28 now
66:28 but we're totally on bit shoot we're on
66:30 a bunch of stuff
66:32 the the youtube videos are posted into
66:35 minds gap
66:36 gab excuse me the other one that has
66:38 copies of our channel is lbry
66:42 107 his uh 107 107daily.com has again
66:47 the
66:47 youtube links but the site's running
66:49 super duper slow
66:51 a lot of the sites you guys are
66:52 recommending for videos do not accept
66:55 anything over a gig without even pro
66:58 memberships they
66:59 will only get to a gig but they also
67:01 have run time limitations of like one
67:03 hour
67:04 so we just can't be on those platforms
67:06 aside from me posting the link
67:08 to some other source the benefits of
67:11 youtube at this point is they're 4k so
67:14 that's nice plus it's on your tv it's on
67:16 your telephone
67:17 a bit shoots app is atrocious on your
67:20 telephone but you can kind of get it to
67:21 work
67:22 it's all right i love those guys because
67:24 they don't put any limitations on you
67:26 every single video is up there so
67:28 definitely go up and create a
67:29 bitshoot.com account
67:31 if you want the audio of this there's a
67:32 podcast three or four different
67:35 podcast feeds you can get off that we do
67:37 have our social media
67:38 we have an all renewed remastered season
67:40 one on a different channel
67:41 just go over there subscribe we have a
67:45 store and we have a couple ways to
67:48 donate to the
67:49 movement normally wouldn't be a big deal
67:51 but since
67:53 2020 is kicking all my employers and the
67:55 balls
67:56 it's been very handy so
68:00 anyhow get up there and do whatever you
68:02 want to do
68:03 take care of yourself and someone else
68:05 and i'll see you in the next deep
68:06 thoughts
