00:11 [Music]
00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen
00:39 so i'm kind of feeling like doing a show
00:43 it's uh part of my regimen to get up
00:45 early and
00:46 kind of gauge the brain early so that
00:48 the rest of the day is a piece of cake
00:50 so not quite 100 there but i did a good
00:54 six hours last night and i'm
00:55 feeling pretty good it's about 8 30 in
00:57 the morning
00:59 put up for about three and a half hours
01:01 yeah but i'm bringing this stuff
01:02 outside and i am thinking
01:06 as usual and this epiphany came to me
01:09 as i was kind of thinking about us kind
01:11 of a separate track
01:13 has to do with our mortality i'm not
01:16 sure what i'm going to call this
01:17 uh let me throw this at you real quick
01:21 let's say that you believe one of two
01:23 things
01:25 if you're an atheist then you're
01:27 probably just going to be
01:30 gracing us with your presence but you're
01:33 you know your
01:34 views are just as valuable as anyone's
01:38 let's say you believe in essential
01:39 consciousness of this universe
01:43 uh as i always say you know apply your
01:46 organized religion to your heart's
01:48 content but you just believe in
01:50 what man typically calls a god
01:53 or you believe that this is a matrix and
01:57 it is programmed by
02:00 potentially many life forces
02:05 who may indeed have a god over them thus
02:07 you have a god
02:08 in your life but your life is being
02:11 potential potentially controlled by
02:12 coders scenario writers westworld kind
02:15 of stuff you know
02:16 and even you you could have set your own
02:18 program up and
02:20 you could be in some little five by five
02:23 little room somewhere and you
02:24 you you were the one that put it all
02:26 together and put all the parameters in
02:27 you put the goggles on or you turn this
02:29 thing on
02:31 and your little black mirror puck on the
02:33 side of your head starts telling your
02:35 body what's going on but let's uh let's
02:38 constrict this particular show down to
02:40 the first two
02:42 there's a god and or
02:45 there are matrix coders that are more
02:48 directly between you and god
02:53 and for whatever reason and an
02:55 inconceivable
02:58 twist of actual reality
03:01 neither god this is not a problem for
03:04 god
03:04 for us to to conceive of god this way
03:07 but neither god nor the matrix coders
03:09 slash your original form
03:12 can die you just can't
03:15 you can't hide energy anywhere in the
03:16 universe
03:18 i mean technically you could hide it but
03:20 you really can't hide it to the point if
03:21 you scoured the universe in every corner
03:23 and every
03:24 three-dimensional point in the universe
03:25 you would definitely eventually find
03:27 the energy unless you kept moving it
03:29 away from the person looking for it
03:30 right
03:32 it could be the mortality paradox i
03:34 guess not trying to be
03:36 fancy with words but here's the
03:40 here's the pitch of this episode we know
03:43 that
03:44 or sorry i should say no is a strong
03:46 word we suspect that the reason why
03:50 uh things that are perceived as evil
03:52 exist is so that you can appreciate
03:53 things that are good
03:55 i think it's pretty safe to say it'd be
03:57 pretty tough to to believe in anything
03:59 being good if you didn't have
04:01 something you perceived as bad right the
04:04 same goes for life and death
04:06 how do we appreciate people who are
04:09 alive
04:11 it doesn't always have to go through
04:12 death
04:14 when you're young and you find your high
04:15 school sweetheart and you're just google
04:17 eyes over each other you're not thinking
04:18 about uh oh
04:19 i love you so much because i've sat down
04:22 and contemplated and meditated
04:24 you in a in a in a casket you know being
04:27 at your funeral
04:28 you don't love your your high school
04:30 sweetheart like that
04:31 as you get older or um
04:35 the second that your relatives start to
04:37 pass your friends start to pass
04:39 whether it be chaotically early or
04:44 metabolically on target you then start
04:47 to really realize that that's the truth
04:49 that it really does augment
04:51 your perception of all things and
04:54 there's so many paradoxes in this
04:56 those sort of avenues right you don't
04:59 appreciate being young until you get
05:00 older
05:02 but then again you also appreciate being
05:04 older and not younger
05:06 so you gain your maturity and your
05:07 mobility and your strategicness mr tj
05:11 and then when you're younger you're just
05:12 kind of like bopping around but you're
05:13 having such a good time
05:14 when you're you don't care there's a
05:17 great
05:18 little scene that i'm glad i got when i
05:20 was
05:21 i guess 16 17 years old i think i was
05:24 16. yeah
05:26 it's in the movie under the cherry moon
05:28 by prince at the very very beginning of
05:29 the film there's a
05:31 party going on in the french riviera
05:35 and there's a black couple dressed in
05:37 just this amazing clothing
05:39 and they're young and both of them are
05:41 very sexy
05:42 and the woman turns to the guy and she
05:45 says
05:46 i need an old man with money
05:49 and he says why do you need money when
05:52 you have youth
05:54 and then they switch over to an old
05:55 white couple i believe this is how it
05:57 goes
05:58 and uh like really older and she says uh
06:02 i need a young man or something like
06:04 that and he the husband or whatever
06:06 says why do you need youth when you've
06:08 got money
06:10 it's very interesting so this episode is
06:13 going to be about the following
06:16 if those who manipulate the universe
06:21 either haven't experienced any sentiment
06:24 of mortality
06:25 in a very very long time or never
06:28 ever truly experience mortality thus
06:31 they have an anecdotal
06:34 theoretical understanding an assumption
06:37 of what it's like to be mortal imagine
06:40 that they have lost
06:43 any algorithm of
06:46 outcome for mankind because
06:49 they have dumbfoundingly kept their
06:52 first
06:53 impressions of how long man should live
06:58 of how much man should suffer while
07:00 man's alive to keep the
07:02 keep the stress on man what if they're
07:05 outdated
07:06 and that now with the increased
07:08 intellect of man
07:11 if there is such a thing you know i just
07:14 think pre-dynastic uh
07:16 egypt being way beyond us right but
07:21 what if at this level of intellectual
07:24 capacity for at least
07:26 those of us you and i who can have
07:30 extremely deep thoughts
07:31 according to the bar that's set for the
07:34 early 21st century i mean i'm hoping
07:36 that five-year-olds talk like us
07:39 in 20 years but it's simply out of date
07:42 we don't live long enough we don't
07:43 participate enough we don't get a chance
07:45 to
07:46 do enough tesla dies too young
07:50 this automated system that ensures that
07:52 you suffer
07:54 and i'm not talking about it woe is me
07:56 we're all suffering
07:58 no but there is suffering in life there
08:00 just is
08:01 you get old you lose your faculties
08:05 you learn what the sciatic nerve is
08:08 losing eyesight
08:09 early losing mobility early it's it's
08:12 probably cultural and
08:13 a lack of exercise and eating right that
08:15 sort of thing but at the same time
08:17 we have this euphoric stage from our
08:19 teenage years to our 20s
08:21 where it seems like we never gain a
08:24 pound and we can just
08:26 do everything constant tons of energy
08:29 but very quick
08:30 into that process it would seem man
08:32 loses this
08:34 sort of inexhaustible energy and the sad
08:37 thing about it
08:39 is that what is what is the total loss
08:44 of the experiment of man
08:49 by this extremely abbreviated existence
08:52 and i know if you're young you might
08:54 think oh but man you're talking about
08:55 living a long time let's just say
08:56 everyone lives to be 100 years old
09:00 almost as if a god-given shield is over
09:03 your system
09:05 protecting you from walking in front of
09:07 a bus from getting hit by a hurricane
09:08 everyone gets 100 years
09:10 but you're still aging the way that we
09:12 age today naturally when you
09:14 just get out all of the uh the bad foods
09:17 and bad medicines and you're really just
09:19 doing a normal human thing
09:21 you will learn very very quickly
09:25 that life is extremely short now there's
09:28 no doubt in my mind that our
09:29 bodies deteriorate at accelerated paces
09:32 due to
09:33 toxins and poisons but let's just say
09:36 we also in this experiment extend
09:39 everything
09:40 20 years so whatever eyesight problems
09:43 you have at 40 we're going to move that
09:44 out to 60.
09:46 whatever cognitive issues health issues
09:49 we move it all out 20
09:50 years so you're 60 but you're going to
09:52 be 100
09:54 that means that you have 60 good years
09:57 and then you're going to have 40
09:58 deteriorating years
10:00 and the exponential curve of losing your
10:03 physical faculties is going to
10:04 accelerate it just will
10:07 there's always exceptions to the rule
10:10 the interesting thing about the story of
10:11 christ which we seldom mention and
10:13 seldom talk about
10:15 because we're all focused on the
10:17 original sin being abolished which is
10:19 again man digs god as long as man gets
10:22 something out of it right
10:24 but one of the sort of subtext of the
10:27 notion of god coming down is man
10:30 and this is where it all gets blurry you
10:32 know some people go it's the son of god
10:34 and other people go no he was god and
10:37 okay well he was a god you know whatever
10:41 the idea that there is no death that he
10:42 was resurrected also impacts greatly the
10:45 notion of being
10:48 sacrificed or crucified at that point it
10:52 is minimized to the
10:54 the sin of man killing i mean
10:58 with the irony you kill the
11:01 son of god so that he can forgive the
11:04 sin of you killing him you know it's
11:05 just a very interesting thing
11:08 but god coming down as anything a
11:11 homeless person
11:12 you never know just literally
11:16 creates himself as a homeless person you
11:18 know what if god was one of us that
11:20 prince song
11:22 but just to sense mortality
11:25 to sense the limitations to think things
11:28 through
11:30 it is interesting that if you're ever
11:31 going to well let's put this way
11:34 we know that there are tracks of human
11:37 development that are seem to be fairly
11:40 mutually exclusive and i'll give you one
11:43 you are typically either
11:46 godless at the end of your life
11:49 or you are god fearing at the end of
11:51 your life and fearing is probably an
11:53 extreme but you know some people get to
11:54 that level
11:56 and so either you like steve jobs what i
11:58 understand was
11:59 pretty godless not in any sinful way but
12:02 then he got to
12:04 a god-fearing stage at the end and told
12:06 the press and told his family you know
12:08 i'm i'm starting to contemplate things
12:11 but i'd never contemplated before
12:15 and then his last words were i think oh
12:18 my
12:18 oh my oh my or wow or something like
12:22 that i mean he definitely saw something
12:24 at the end it was not going to be
12:27 some trivial vision
12:31 for him but god coming down and being
12:34 human for a little while
12:38 it's heartwarming notion that god would
12:40 come down and put himself or herself
12:42 into the limitation of human
12:44 instrumentalities and figure it all out
12:47 you know i would i would love honestly
12:50 not for any sort of
12:54 passive-aggressive moment towards god in
12:57 any way shape or form but
13:00 you know the illnesses that people have
13:02 in this world
13:03 to get god to come down in a human body
13:05 and go okay god
13:07 we as humanity have picked out
13:10 50 conditions that we experience on a
13:12 routine basis
13:14 and you're going to sit in that chair
13:16 over there and we're going to
13:18 name it and you're going to experience
13:20 it at full core full bore
13:22 full core full bore pain
13:26 and then when you leave here i want you
13:28 to think about
13:29 how fun that was and then you can
13:32 recalculate whether or not you think
13:34 that eight-year-olds should feel this
13:36 or even a 65-year-old grandmother
13:39 or 95-year-old grandmother should feel
13:41 this stuff
13:43 and so you put him in a painless human
13:45 form initially
13:47 and you do stuff to him you're like okay
13:48 now you have bone cancer stage
13:50 4.9 you're going to spend one hour in
13:54 in that feeling with no medicine that
13:56 feels pretty crappy doesn't it god
13:58 okay how's your vision all your vision
13:59 is perfect right because you brought
14:00 yourself down in a great body
14:02 all right now you have cataracts and
14:03 glaucoma and you're going to now spend
14:06 an hour
14:07 and you've got to move around you've got
14:08 to move around and i want you to sense
14:10 how much of this life you
14:11 just cut off by that little problem
14:14 we're going to make your gallbladder
14:16 pop we're gonna make your appendix pop
14:17 we're gonna do on and on you're gonna
14:19 have a sciatic nerve
14:21 fire and then we want you to to
14:24 simulate for yourself uh having a three
14:27 year recovery from a sciatic nerve thing
14:30 yeah i mean just on and on and on
14:31 everything that could possibly happen
14:35 have a headache have a migraine have a
14:38 menstrual cycle
14:39 have a cramp go through it all
14:43 and you know let us know how you feel
14:46 about that
14:47 and then explain to us why this is so
14:50 prevalent today
14:52 and whether or not you want to keep it
14:54 going
14:56 it would be interesting if if the
14:58 creator let's say that person exists
15:01 especially the uh if you had a matrix
15:04 band of matrix coders it would be almost
15:06 like a
15:08 a youtube video where they eat like a
15:09 hot spice you know you get like six of
15:11 the matrix coders and
15:13 and they've rigged up a system where
15:14 they can give themselves a brainstorm
15:17 machine where they can feel everything
15:19 that you were talking about and we sit
15:20 there and film them and you know some
15:21 guys do really good
15:23 some guys do really horrible and scream
15:25 like little girls as this pain starts to
15:27 hit him
15:28 and then we turn it all off and then we
15:30 have a nice half hour one hour interview
15:32 after that and
15:33 so you think you guys are gonna um you
15:35 know how do you guys feel about
15:36 all these things that we're experiencing
15:38 down here and then they're just like man
15:39 i never knew
15:40 this really sucks we're gonna go up and
15:43 immediately disable those routines or or
15:45 we're gonna go up and really reduce
15:47 their frequency
15:50 i think as i get older my
15:53 um i don't want to use words that are
15:55 going to sound like uh
15:56 they're going in different directions
15:59 and i'll just be straight with you if i
16:01 say i am disappointed
16:03 okay with certain design aspects of this
16:06 universe
16:07 it is because i probably
16:11 arrogantly feel like there are slight
16:14 modifications that would yield so much
16:16 more fruit from mankind
16:19 and i think that the
16:22 and my fear is that if i say things like
16:24 that it's it sort of can be construed as
16:27 like suicidal thoughts or something like
16:28 that it's like don't get that
16:29 mixed up with that because this is
16:31 full-on
16:33 behavioral analysis and
16:36 sort of fabric of the universe on the
16:39 emotional
16:39 level slash intelligent design level
16:44 because everything that you put effort
16:46 into is a purpose
16:48 you know it has to have a purpose you
16:49 don't do anything without a purpose
16:51 you don't even if you hate it you know i
16:54 gotta go to work
16:55 but i gotta go to work well because i
16:56 need money why do you need money because
16:59 i got things i would need to pay for and
17:01 things i want in my life
17:03 but i just feel like we are in
17:07 we're sort of in a petri dish and what i
17:10 mean by that is we are
17:12 being cultivated in this container
17:15 but we are being ignored until something
17:18 else occurs you know that's how you
17:21 culture bacteria so you can figure out
17:23 what's inside of patients
17:25 body uh you know you scrape a little bit
17:27 out let it grow
17:29 but there's no interaction because
17:31 there's nothing you can do with bacteria
17:33 it has to grow to a magnitude where you
17:34 can identify it and run it through
17:36 experiments and compare it to
17:38 previous samples and break down its
17:39 molecular structure et cetera et cetera
17:42 in this world it's been set up
17:46 beautifully the code is running great
17:48 we have free will we could uh
17:52 potentially
17:53 and this is the theory theoretically you
17:56 could say oh well you know you just
17:57 gotta take care of yourself always eat
17:59 right always exercise do everything that
18:01 we know has been successful for others
18:05 in the past to stay young and what have
18:07 you
18:08 can't really disagree except
18:11 that we know that the genetic pool of
18:13 man varies
18:14 widely and some people are built
18:17 differently
18:19 and so they may have never had the
18:22 chance to experience things plus based
18:24 on how your parents raise you
18:26 you may not take care of yourself
18:29 with a correct regiment whatever that
18:31 might be
18:32 to stay healthy and so you have some
18:35 other amazing skill you could be a
18:37 genius right
18:39 and but you're you're immobile for some
18:41 reason whatever
18:43 but let's rewind that algorithm just a
18:45 bit
18:47 if you when you were born you had the
18:49 mental apparatus to understand
18:51 instructions meaning you're born with
18:54 say like a
18:56 healthy mid-40s brain between you have
18:59 some seniority
19:00 of experience you know how to pause
19:02 before you speak
19:05 and you're an infant but you're coming
19:07 in with a fairly sophisticated soul
19:08 which is kind of what i believe occurs
19:10 like a lot of the crying when your
19:12 little kid is like oh my god i just
19:14 i just [ __ ] myself and i gotta wait for
19:16 my parents to figure this out so i don't
19:18 waddle in my own excrement
19:22 but there is that reintroduction into
19:25 the world where i feel like you
19:27 over time very quickly as a child you
19:29 lose your previous identity
19:31 your gag from speaking as you
19:34 rotate your soul into your body and then
19:37 make connections
19:39 you know when you have a baby for the
19:41 very first time
19:44 unless you raise your relatives
19:47 you don't know a lot of things that
19:49 babies can't do
19:52 my kid you know for the first couple
19:54 weeks couldn't hold up her head
19:57 she didn't have any muscles to do such a
19:58 thing and the nerve endings hadn't grown
20:00 together
20:02 eventually a pediatrician like my kid
20:05 didn't have any
20:06 um prolonged bedwetting
20:10 but boys have a longer bedwetting
20:13 sequence
20:14 than girls i can't remember last time i
20:16 went to bed i think i had like
20:18 i was doing really well and then there
20:19 was like a two year
20:22 uh stint between five and seven or
20:25 something and i had one little event at
20:26 seven
20:28 and uh then i met a pediatrician and i
20:32 don't know if this is true but i've
20:33 heard this mentioned twice in my
20:34 lifetime
20:36 they said that punishing a child for
20:38 wetting the bed
20:39 is understandable when we didn't
20:42 understand the biology of the human body
20:44 but now
20:45 parents are told hey you're not supposed
20:47 to do anything because this is all
20:48 involuntary
20:50 the autonomic system is waiting for a
20:52 bundle of nerves
20:53 that grows down the back of the spine
20:57 and it connects with the nerve endings
20:59 in your
21:00 urethra bladder sphincters and then you
21:03 have this automated ability to pinch it
21:05 off at night
21:06 but it takes different kids different
21:08 timetables
21:09 to grow those two nerves together i
21:11 don't know if you have like a really
21:12 giant kid
21:13 physically tall child if that extends
21:16 but they said that that nerve ending has
21:18 been known
21:19 in extreme cases to take 11 years to
21:21 connect and so you have a child that's
21:23 wetting the bed
21:25 until they're 11. it's just a biological
21:27 limitation of the nerve endings
21:30 you know we know that as adults we don't
21:32 consciously
21:33 pinch it off while we're asleep it's
21:35 just happening so it's part of the
21:36 autonomic family
21:38 and therefore yelling at your child for
21:39 it
21:41 defies logic but it is understandable
21:43 when you're young parent you don't know
21:44 anything about this kind of stuff
21:45 my parents were pretty cool about it if
21:47 i remember right i mean nobody wants to
21:49 wake up in their pee
21:51 so even as a child you understand but
21:54 the reason why i'm bringing up this
21:55 notion of when you're born
21:57 it'd be nice to be able to make
22:00 strategic decisions about who you are as
22:02 a human being
22:03 which is obviously an impossibility due
22:05 to a lack of
22:07 cognitive awareness as a child at least
22:09 we think right
22:11 you do have instincts i'll tell you that
22:12 much but we then meander through life
22:17 serendipitously as i always say you're
22:18 the ball in the pinball machine being
22:20 kicked around
22:21 and then at some point in your life the
22:24 earlier the better
22:26 you're like dude i'm going to be the
22:27 pinball machine
22:29 in addition to being the ball i mean i'm
22:31 going to flip myself when i want to be
22:33 flipped i'm going to kick myself and
22:34 i'll be kicked and bumper when i want to
22:35 be bumpered
22:37 no one's going to touch me unless i want
22:38 to be touched
22:40 and then your life becomes a video game
22:41 that you start playing it's a script
22:43 that you start
22:44 writing now
22:47 i'm going to repeat a few things i've
22:49 said in past episodes here
22:51 because to me it's um i want to frame
22:55 this
22:55 correctly from me to you i'm always
22:58 trying to pretend like you're in this
22:59 patio with me you know i could sense
23:03 as a child that
23:06 i i had this weird thing i had this
23:09 almost
23:11 behavior of like a naivete but
23:14 that naivete was also sort of like
23:18 a dream occurring where i felt like well
23:22 as long as i'm not in any
23:23 imminent threat of my life i'll just let
23:26 things happen to experience them
23:29 and i'll give you a couple i'll give you
23:32 two
23:32 two moments of my life as a young person
23:36 where i was totally aware of what was
23:37 going on
23:39 one was wow look at these little kids
23:42 and i'm viewing them as an adult almost
23:46 it's hard to say that when i there's all
23:48 kinds of elements of which qualify
23:50 adult thinking which obviously weren't
23:51 occurring at this moment but there was a
23:53 good slab of it that was occurring
23:55 so i'm probably four years old
23:59 meaning i'm not in school yet and
24:03 there's a couple classmates of mine in
24:05 the neighborhood with me they're exactly
24:07 the same age but i don't know
24:08 that we're going to be classmates
24:09 because when you're young you don't have
24:10 any conception of school
24:12 grades age you know what class you're in
24:15 that kind of thing
24:16 but these two guys one of which became
24:18 one of my best friends in
24:20 in the entire world before school was
24:21 out
24:23 they came across and i was watering this
24:26 garden my my mom and me we lived in town
24:28 at the time
24:30 and the two kids came over and i'm
24:33 it was almost like being an alien in a
24:35 human body
24:36 in an excited sort of observatory way
24:40 and i'm looking at them and they're like
24:42 what are you doing
24:44 i'm like water in the garden
24:47 i got this hose right now it was a hot
24:49 summer day
24:50 the water was a very comfortable room
24:52 temperature temperature
24:55 and they one of the kids ended up being
24:58 like 6'5 and a huge athlete
25:00 and he's the one that became a very very
25:02 close friend of mine
25:03 and i remember him walking up to me and
25:05 the other one was also a very tall guy
25:07 but very skinny
25:08 and he's more reserved uh cowboy kind of
25:12 kid
25:13 where's my other athlete buddy was just
25:15 nutty and just
25:16 wild man turned out to be a huge dude
25:19 but they came over and they took the
25:20 hose out of my hand
25:23 and they're looking at me and they're
25:25 smiling like the funny thing was there
25:27 were devious little
25:28 bastards at four years old or whatever
25:29 age we were and they took the hose and
25:32 they
25:32 said oh yeah and they're talking to me
25:34 well one kid's doing it you know he's
25:35 this guy brian and he's putting it down
25:38 my pants
25:39 it's like i got you know t-shirt on and
25:41 some shorts
25:42 and i could care less because i'm like
25:44 well i play in water all day long anyway
25:46 so like
25:47 i'm already wet like it's not like
25:49 you're changing the state of my body
25:52 oh yeah i got a little bit more going
25:53 down my pants but i remember just
25:54 looking at him
25:55 i could still see it to this day and i'm
25:58 looking at both of them
25:59 kind of like this is wild these two kids
26:02 think
26:03 they're really getting away with
26:04 something that they think they're
26:05 surprising me with something
26:08 and it was very friendly i mean i never
26:11 had any like
26:12 anger at all i was just observing them
26:14 almost like an alien
26:16 just looking at him going okay this is
26:18 what
26:19 young earthling children do it's a weird
26:22 thing so fast forward uh maybe a few
26:26 months i don't know
26:27 and i'm definitely four years old i'm at
26:30 this daycare place
26:31 just two three houses up the block
26:35 and uh i remember i was dressed in all
26:37 red this is the repeat
26:40 and it was like red corduroy pants and
26:42 some red shirts just red had red shoes
26:45 which was pretty pretty amazing for my
26:47 parents to buy anything coordinated
26:49 i remember getting up for my little nap
26:51 and i was just at the precipice of
26:53 leaving this
26:55 daycare and then going to school
26:58 kindergarten i remember getting up
27:00 thinking i am four years old
27:02 and having this sense of now that i'm
27:05 older
27:06 the sense of being really old like much
27:09 older
27:10 and like i've told you guys many times
27:11 you know i cringed as a child when
27:14 anyone wanted to sing stupid songs
27:17 like red rover or mary out is it um
27:22 london bridges falling it's just all the
27:23 childish crap i remember just feeling
27:27 just really alienated by the immaturity
27:31 of children and having to do it
27:33 and which was interesting because i
27:34 didn't have any
27:36 sort of alien observation opinions where
27:39 it'd be like oh this is what little kids
27:40 do and then going along with it and
27:42 enjoying it
27:43 to experience it i was out of body
27:46 when it came to being a child and so
27:50 the reason why i'm mentioning this is
27:51 that i think we all obviously
27:54 have different perceptions of our
27:55 childhoods
27:57 and and the various stages of our lives
27:59 which is typically divvied up in human
28:01 nomenclature into like decades you
28:03 remember being
28:04 10 and under 19 and under you know
28:07 20 to 30 and etc or 2029
28:12 these are arbitrary moments in time
28:16 interesting about this notion of time
28:19 is that i mean obviously we've said on
28:20 the show several times
28:23 time is just an illusion created by the
28:24 passage of history
28:26 it's the ability to remember a previous
28:28 state
28:30 without that very simple simple human
28:33 capability slash soul capability of
28:37 looking up a previous state inside your
28:39 mind
28:40 there would be no perception of time
28:44 if you're the what is it the ellen
28:45 degeneres fish and in emo
28:47 finding emo then you would have no
28:49 perception of time
28:51 everything would be the now and even
28:54 though that might scientifically sink in
28:56 with your brain right now as you listen
28:57 to me speak
28:59 truly meditating to a point where you
29:01 could perceive for even a
29:03 nanosecond what that state of being
29:06 might be
29:09 it's almost i think once you become
29:11 comfortable with the passage of time
29:14 it's either a euphoric
29:18 flash of consciousness to realize
29:21 what it would be like to be in the now
29:23 24 7.
29:25 using a now using time analogies to
29:27 prove a non-time analogy
29:30 or it might be horrific
29:33 for your mind to contemplate no
29:36 access to previous states why do we have
29:40 access to previous states to establish
29:43 this notion of time
29:46 you ever think about that let me give
29:48 you a really
29:49 really good reason why this is necessary
29:52 if
29:52 finding emo wasn't pretty evident what
29:55 would happen
29:57 if you were married
30:01 how would you even get married let's
30:04 just say we
30:05 write ourselves a blank check and we're
30:06 going to start this effect you're in my
30:08 patio and like yeah i'm going to
30:10 turn on this little tesla invention
30:12 which is going to render us both for
30:14 five minutes to have absolutely no
30:16 memory of anything
30:17 and then as soon as a little timer is
30:19 out and you hear the ding
30:21 it'll all come back to you you in for
30:22 this oh yeah i think so okay
30:25 hold on it could be even that we
30:28 uh strap ourselves into a chair with a
30:31 five-point seat belt
30:33 with an inability to free ourselves
30:36 from the chair although we're sitting
30:38 across from each other
30:39 with this memory deprivation thing going
30:42 on for five minutes or so
30:45 so instantaneously when the machine
30:47 turns on
30:49 you and i no longer know who each other
30:51 are
30:52 but to make matters even more
30:54 interesting we don't know who we are
30:57 to make matters more terrifying
31:00 you no longer know what anything is
31:03 what are you what is this place
31:08 is that a tree what are you gonna call
31:10 that
31:11 it's just like the scene out of the
31:12 hitchhiker's guide of the galaxy when
31:14 engaging the when they engage the
31:17 improbability drive
31:19 arthur dent turns on the improbability
31:21 drive which makes the ship ubiquitous
31:23 with all points in space and time
31:26 they as a repercussion of turning that
31:29 engine on
31:32 it created a
31:35 bowl of petunias and a sperm whale
31:40 over the atmosphere of the planet of
31:44 nagarthia
31:46 and douglas adams does this brilliant
31:47 job of having the
31:50 whale contemplate who the whale is
31:54 in a split second before it splatters
31:56 into the ground
31:57 it is some of the most brilliant
31:59 dialogue of comedic
32:01 form that's ever been written down where
32:03 this whale is trying to make sense of
32:05 things and he's looking at his
32:07 tail and he's like wow what is this
32:11 if you listen to the bbc broadcast of it
32:13 from the 1978 which is the only way to
32:15 ingest those books
32:17 and then dirk mags in the second two
32:20 books
32:21 so first two in the old days but anyway
32:24 because i guess i guess it's
32:25 i guess i'll call it a tail and what's
32:28 this big thing coming at me so big and
32:30 so
32:30 round round round world ground
32:33 and then the whale says his last words
32:36 are i wonder if it'll be friends with me
32:40 in the bowl of petunias the only thought
32:42 it said it was the only thought it had
32:43 was
32:44 oh no not again what you find out about
32:47 the bowl of petunias is that
32:49 arthur dent consistently over time
32:51 messes with inventions
32:53 and always spawns this bowl of petunias
32:56 constantly and then it constantly dies
32:58 so whatever
33:00 artha didn't i think in the second half
33:02 of the last third and fourth book the
33:04 bowl of petunias tries to kill arthur
33:06 did finally
33:07 he's like i'm tired of you making me
33:08 exist and then i die
33:11 of course arthur has no idea what he's
33:12 doing so
33:14 time is a fabric of our existence
33:18 in a very interesting mandatory
33:22 methodology but we know from marsha
33:25 mcluhan's
33:26 experiments or research and thought
33:29 process and
33:30 philosophical exploration of language
33:33 i have a whole episode on language
33:37 we can look back at the first written
33:39 symbols of language and realize that it
33:41 was very iconic
33:43 meaning that's a symbol for a cat that's
33:45 a symbol for a walking that's a symbol
33:47 for
33:47 the story i mean it's like there were no
33:49 phonetic anything where you're using
33:52 letters to form multiple a few letters
33:55 to form every word
33:57 stringing them together into phonics
34:00 and that when man moved from iconic to
34:02 phonic
34:05 man gained a tremendous grasp
34:08 of how to conceive of and appreciate
34:11 and utilize the concept of time
34:15 a beginning middle and end to a story a
34:18 strategic plan of how to fight a war
34:19 first we do this then we do that
34:22 it was his philosophy that perhaps like
34:24 a pre-dynastic egyptian culture
34:26 was then wiped out by say mesopotamian
34:30 arab cultures where those that could
34:33 plan
34:34 destroyed those who couldn't and the
34:37 more you had a grasp of time
34:39 the better you did in life now think
34:42 about that
34:44 you have friends and you're probably one
34:47 of these people
34:48 where you have a tremendous grasp of
34:50 time
34:52 where you succeed and make mistakes you
34:55 are more content with those outcomes
34:58 because
35:00 not like anyone's not uh content with a
35:02 success but you're more
35:04 probably quite better to be said you're
35:06 more content with
35:07 making mistakes because
35:11 you can harvest your
35:15 attitude towards
35:19 your plans meaning
35:23 if you fail and this happens to me all
35:25 the time
35:26 we don't talk about this but you fail
35:28 perhaps it's something or you succeed
35:30 but it's not
35:31 it's lackluster it wasn't as good as it
35:33 could be you gave up on a piece of art
35:36 which if you're an artist that's always
35:38 the
35:40 the killer truth to all things steven
35:42 spielberg said you'd never finish a film
35:44 you just abandoned the film
35:47 but regardless when you hit that moment
35:50 where it is complete
35:52 your effort or your invention or both
35:55 you you go back and you take inventory
35:57 of the whole thing and you say well you
35:59 know it's as good as i
36:00 invested in that thing where it sucks
36:02 it's because i gave up
36:05 when i created the intro to the show it
36:07 is absolutely an abandoned film
36:10 for instance i knew i needed to
36:13 smooth the frames which is now the case
36:15 if you go back to the first 20 episodes
36:18 there's a lot of pixelation in the intro
36:20 and then i found out how to take blender
36:22 3d and reprocess my own frames and use
36:25 the denoise algorithm on finished frames
36:27 so i didn't have to re-render anything
36:29 it cost me 500 bucks roughly to render
36:31 all those frames
36:33 didn't want to put 500 bucks in to
36:34 re-render everything smooth
36:37 so when it came out and i saw it the
36:39 jupiter ship looked like crap when i
36:40 first released it very primitive
36:44 but i needed the show to start i was two
36:47 months past my normal schedule
36:50 i thought you guys would be impressed or
36:51 at least you know satiated with the
36:53 effort
36:53 so i was like well they're not gonna
36:55 care up to a point and then at some
36:57 point they're gonna walk away from the
36:58 show because nothing's coming out
37:00 as many as i as much as i might have
37:01 created for season five
37:03 you know extended episodes over the
37:05 summer
37:06 now the notion that i'm putting forth is
37:10 that our controllers may or may not have
37:12 any semblance of time not that they
37:15 don't understand it and use it to plan
37:18 what they're going to do for
37:19 us or have planned and walked away from
37:23 the simulation
37:24 knowing that we're going to be okay and
37:26 maybe they've got you know
37:27 i mean imagine they're in some round
37:29 robin thing where
37:31 it's our universe for a little while
37:32 then they go off to another one and
37:34 they're always upgrading the software
37:35 but we haven't had the update yet
37:37 and so they know oh yeah you're going to
37:39 love you know you're on 1.0
37:41 but we're up to 8.5 right now so you're
37:43 going to love
37:44 when we upgrade you however
37:49 you know if i had uh a year
37:52 or two or three to create a short film
37:56 using the 2001
37:58 set that i created in blender
38:02 i mean i had a whole skit i mean a whole
38:04 interaction with how
38:05 planned but i needed to get things done
38:09 and simulating the howl voice i actually
38:11 had a plan for that too
38:14 if you do not have mortality
38:18 as a part of your existence but you do
38:20 understand time
38:21 then interacting with another element of
38:24 the universe that has
38:26 a mortality you're incompatible
38:30 no matter how much you want to be
38:31 compatible your
38:34 empathy for the mortal
38:37 is way different right meaning they're
38:39 trying to design our reality but they
38:40 don't have any sense of
38:42 death they simply don't die
38:46 but they do understand the notion of
38:48 death perhaps they've even gone through
38:50 millions of years of being one of us and
38:53 but every
38:54 every whatever measurable increment of
38:56 time we could say every year
38:59 that passes where they haven't been like
39:01 us
39:02 then they're out of touch
39:06 if they were here let's say an epoch ago
39:10 like 3 500 years or however how long
39:12 those epochs are 2500 years
39:15 and we are primitive and it looks like
39:17 the time they've allocated for us to be
39:19 alive
39:19 is enough in that by the time our brain
39:22 atrophies naturally without toxins and
39:26 you know electromagnetic waves flying
39:28 around called radio and television and
39:30 cell phones
39:32 they're like hey looks like we got a
39:33 really good balance here humans
39:35 pretty much peek out everything they can
39:37 create and then they
39:38 start dying off it's perfect but there's
39:42 always an exception to the rule isn't
39:43 there
39:45 i've told you guys a long time ago when
39:46 i was studying egyptology i did find
39:49 this
39:50 romantic story about a character and i
39:53 forget the dude's name
39:54 but he is a guy that is
39:58 almost pinned or put up like a
40:02 a tesla almost they credit this one dude
40:05 in egypt for coming up with
40:07 virtually everything that we think that
40:09 is amazing about egypt
40:11 except perhaps the designs of the
40:13 pyramids
40:14 but this one guy was accredited with
40:17 architectural advancements to build the
40:19 temples and
40:21 in the dwellings he also was
40:24 accredited with creating the embalming
40:26 tools and the whole burial ritual that
40:28 we now
40:29 revere as the egyptian method of
40:31 worshiping their gods
40:33 okay may not be true or anything
40:36 but even back in that timetable i'm sure
40:40 all species of man have and creatures
40:43 alone have these
40:44 brilliant outcomes where the brain just
40:47 gets it right
40:49 i saw a video the other day you can
40:52 probably see it i probably can't link it
40:54 in because i'll get a copyright strike
40:55 but
40:56 it's a cat that saves a baby from
40:58 falling down a staircase and you can't
41:00 see the staircase in the video
41:02 because it's below the camera but right
41:04 where the camera surveillance camera is
41:05 on this little nanny room
41:08 there's a baby in a red little jumper or
41:10 whatever
41:12 and there's a cat taken care of i think
41:14 kittens or something
41:15 and i think it's like a siamese cat or
41:17 something which you're
41:19 definitely revered as being slightly
41:20 smarter cats
41:22 but this kid is is little brunette kids
41:24 going towards this
41:26 camera down below and you see the cat
41:28 look over at the baby
41:30 and he's like i'm probably mother and
41:33 but she's looking at the kid going oh my
41:35 christ are you going towards the
41:36 staircase
41:38 when the kid gets within inches of going
41:41 over the edge of the staircase
41:44 that cat activates man it is one of the
41:47 most amazing
41:48 freaking things i've ever seen that this
41:50 cat has a maternal instinct to know that
41:52 child has no clue
41:53 where that child is about to go and he's
41:55 going to hurt himself going down the
41:56 stairs
41:57 that cat jumps down off this little
41:59 piece of furniture
42:00 runs over jumps over
42:03 the precipice of the stairs turns around
42:06 and pushes the kid back
42:09 and then if you pay attention
42:12 the cat holds his paws out the last
42:15 second as the kid
42:16 finally says oh i guess i'm not supposed
42:17 to go this way and starts going back
42:18 into the room
42:19 but the cat's sort of like got his got
42:21 her paws up like you know
42:23 you you got it right you're not you're
42:24 not supposed to go this way
42:26 wow it's a prodigy cat
42:29 you know if you ever think about human
42:30 beings being cats
42:33 that either that cat's ready to be a
42:34 human in its next life or
42:36 previously was dogs do it too you know
42:41 so there's always going to be an
42:42 exception to the rule of humanity
42:44 where you're going to get a prodigy kid
42:48 a prodigy kid that needs more time
42:52 tesla needed more time said meat it
42:55 would have been nice to give more time
42:56 how many geniuses we lost jimi hendrix
42:59 janice joplin jim morrison
43:01 steve ray vaughan jim henson i mean walt
43:04 disney
43:05 the list goes on and on yeah those
43:08 people may have
43:10 gotten themselves into situations where
43:11 they were murdered
43:14 simply for being talented and
43:16 influencing folks
43:18 but that is precipitated by the notion
43:20 that man is allowed to become evil to
43:22 that level
43:23 and to be able to act on that evil
43:27 meaning forming the thought of oh you
43:30 know
43:30 michael jackson's really causing a
43:32 problem for sony sony wants to make a
43:33 billion dollars real quick
43:35 michael's been spent the last half
43:37 decade of his life going they're trying
43:38 to kill me man
43:39 if not two decades and eventually it
43:42 looks like they got him
43:44 so what would the world be if we gave
43:46 man perhaps twice the allocation
43:50 well studying if you're just like a
43:51 logistics kind of person
43:53 and you're familiar with like the basic
43:56 principles
43:57 of a socialistic experiment you might
44:00 be realizing that there might be
44:04 a video game lesson in this whole thing
44:08 for those who play video games and you
44:10 play games with ranging levels of
44:12 difficulty
44:13 you know that as much as you hate
44:15 perhaps at times or dislike at times
44:18 the leveling process in a video game you
44:22 know getting to that upper upper level
44:24 the second you reach that maximum level
44:26 of capability not necessarily a god mode
44:29 where you can kill everything with one
44:30 shot
44:31 but you're you know you're much more
44:33 invincible and you're capable of doing
44:35 stuff
44:35 your accomplishments lack
44:40 the reward that they typically would
44:43 have
44:43 because it wasn't as hard
44:46 we talk about this all the time money
44:48 never makes anyone feel
44:50 amazing for a prolonged period of time
44:54 trust fund babies sometimes uh turn out
44:57 to be great human beings but a lot of
44:59 times they
44:59 grow up to be poss right
45:02 they're entitled they don't know what
45:04 it's like to work hard everything was
45:05 given to them
45:07 sort of not their fault so perhaps
45:11 and this is what i i'm i'm still
45:13 debating this whole thing
45:14 perhaps they want man to grow at such a
45:16 slow pace because they're not really
45:18 interested in man's
45:20 invention or discovery of inventions
45:23 that they already have
45:24 right if you're a matrix coder for
45:26 instance or god you
45:27 you have seen all tech that could ever
45:29 be created and seeing man go through the
45:31 process
45:32 of defending tech which is sort of
45:35 there's a couple different things you
45:37 could do one you get to if you lived a
45:39 really long time you would gauge more of
45:40 your family
45:41 you get to meet your great great
45:43 grandkids instead of just maybe your
45:44 grandkids
45:46 you would also be able to create
45:47 invention which is
45:50 solutions to problems then you might
45:53 have
45:55 the creation creativity
45:59 that might be a part of it but let me
46:01 throw this at you
46:02 what if what they're looking for has
46:04 nothing to do with those arteries
46:07 they feel like they don't need any more
46:09 inventions they already have them all
46:10 they don't need
46:12 to find better inventions perhaps they
46:15 don't care about art
46:17 not that they don't think it's a method
46:19 to another solution that they're really
46:21 looking for
46:23 but perhaps they don't care about that
46:25 as far as you meeting your family
46:27 and actually for them might even be seem
46:29 like a messier problem
46:32 maybe it even makes death more painful
46:34 i've known my grandmother for 175 years
46:38 and now she's gone
46:40 someone would always be dying right but
46:43 what if
46:43 they're looking for something else for
46:46 those of you who saw the movie
46:47 dark city i'm going to spoil it for you
46:52 it will not spoil in my opinion the
46:55 entertainment quality of the film
46:57 because i can i own it and i can watch
46:58 it anytime i want and
47:00 it doesn't it's like if i said do you
47:02 like the movie blade runner
47:04 from 1982 and you say yes and you and i
47:07 said do you want to watch it again
47:09 you're like hell yeah man let's watch it
47:11 because we're both kind of really cool
47:14 uh smart people that are gonna we can
47:16 talk about it as it's going and we're
47:18 gonna both have insights and all that
47:20 kind of stuff
47:20 that's sort of like dark city but dark
47:23 city takes place
47:24 in a flat disc in space
47:27 where the city is constantly dark it's
47:30 nighttime
47:32 and this dude is a reporter for a
47:36 newspaper
47:38 believe that's the the arrangement and
47:41 he's he uh goes to bed at night just
47:44 like everyone else but on
47:45 one particular night he doesn't fall
47:46 asleep and he realizes that the whole
47:50 world which is his kind of gotham city
47:53 everyone paused and but there's these
47:56 dudes men and black kind of guys
47:58 exactly the definition of the men in
47:59 black big body small head
48:01 pasty skin the black hat on top
48:05 they're moving people around they're
48:07 taking a cab driver out and putting him
48:09 at a
48:10 breakfast table and the breakfast table
48:12 guy becomes the mayor and it's just like
48:14 that old twilight zone
48:16 but he finds that kiefer sutherland
48:20 is this weird genius dude who's also
48:22 awake
48:24 and kind of hiding from them and he's
48:26 really peculiar and strange it's one of
48:27 his
48:28 best roles and he then goes back to work
48:31 who william hurt is his boss
48:33 and he says you know when's the last
48:35 time you remembered it being daytime
48:38 and william hurt is sort of like a robot
48:41 in westworld
48:41 going you know what are you talking
48:43 about he says
48:45 why are we at work at night when has it
48:48 been daytime
48:49 and when do you really remember ever
48:51 leaving this place
48:54 and over time he figures out
48:57 that this place is always at night and
48:59 he's not going to sleep anymore
49:01 which i don't know if they went through
49:02 the sleep deprivation issue
49:05 that dog barks at this time of day for a
49:07 really short period of time it does bark
49:08 all day
49:09 that's why i think when his owner leaves
49:11 for work
49:13 but what you find out
49:16 is that these aliens have captured human
49:18 beings and put them in this disc in
49:20 space
49:22 simulated their world and the reason why
49:25 at night
49:26 they move people around is that they're
49:27 trying to find sort of the essence of
49:30 man to distill the essence of man and
49:32 put it into them
49:33 because their race is dying
49:37 their race is dying
49:41 it's it's not heavily explained but it's
49:43 okay
49:46 what i find interesting about those kind
49:48 of stories is that i can't help but
49:51 sort of romanticize the notion that
49:54 we may just throw us at you this is sort
49:57 of a funny but imagine that those type
49:59 of movies
50:00 are nothing more than echoes of the
50:03 reality of what's actually going on in
50:05 our world
50:06 that someone like you
50:09 meditated channeled had the epiphany
50:13 and somehow you grabbed a hold of what
50:15 the matrix
50:16 programmers were trying to do whatever
50:19 reason you got every microscopic
50:20 indicator or maybe you just got a
50:23 an open phone line to the laboratory and
50:25 you hear a couple
50:26 technicians talking to each other we
50:28 think we'll ever find it
50:29 fine i don't know and i hope so because
50:32 we're running out of time you know you
50:33 hear that conversation and then all of a
50:34 sudden you're
50:35 you're a screenwriter and you put
50:36 together dark city
50:39 i didn't ruin the ending for you which
50:40 is just cool man
50:42 gives you goosebumps man it's a
50:47 it's definitely there there's a dividing
50:49 line
50:51 between say an atheist's perspective of
50:53 the universe and anyone with any sort of
50:57 spiritual contact with
51:01 reality meaning you've had a sort of
51:05 extra experience in this world may be
51:07 called paranormal
51:08 whatever then you have those with a
51:10 strong spiritual hunch
51:12 i find that and there's no bias on what
51:16 i'm about to say in terms of being good
51:17 or bad
51:18 but obviously if someone is raised in
51:20 religion from birth then there's
51:22 again very little chance save perhaps a
51:25 catholic church experience
51:27 or either being molested or
51:30 something strange is occurring where it
51:31 seems like a negative experience to you
51:34 you're not going to fall away from
51:35 really you're going to keep it if you
51:36 kept it
51:38 then your perception and belief and
51:39 faith and reality
51:41 is sort of anecdotally predictable
51:44 because
51:45 you're just swallowing the paradigms and
51:46 moving every day in life and there's
51:48 nothing wrong with that because there is
51:49 definitely
51:51 a pleasantness and bliss and being
51:54 ignorant like i said recently
51:57 but the second you have an experience
51:58 that gives you
52:01 an additional perspective and i'll give
52:03 you two experiences
52:05 when you are near death
52:08 if you have a near-death experience
52:10 where you see your body and you go
52:12 have some interaction with the matrix or
52:15 whatever
52:16 then you're gonna be changed for life
52:17 and many many people have had those
52:19 experiences
52:21 whether it's self-harm or an accident or
52:24 something
52:25 then there's the second tier which is
52:27 you've had someone from the other side
52:29 visit you and communicate with you once
52:32 you have that experience then you
52:36 you just can't see the universe the same
52:38 anymore it's not an incidental thing
52:39 it's not a atheist universe it is a much
52:44 more meaningful
52:46 potentially infinitely dense set of
52:49 circumstances that are holding this
52:50 place together now i've had both
52:53 experiences i've had near-death
52:55 experiences where i had
52:56 a vision of what it's like to to take
52:59 your own life
53:00 and and they showed you they showed me
53:04 the punishment
53:05 of doing such a thing go see my episode
53:08 on suicide from episode one
53:10 which in 2020 i have to say that episode
53:13 has been brought up a lot in
53:15 my conversations with friends and that
53:18 people have gone through some pretty
53:19 tough times
53:21 and and we know people that have taken
53:24 their own lives
53:25 this last year you know like i said i
53:26 got a 18 year old
53:29 distant relative take her own life
53:32 she had some mental issues beforehand
53:34 but 2020 was enough to put her over the
53:36 edge and she was surrounded by people
53:38 who endorsed all the
53:40 fear-mongering of the event and so that
53:43 just put her over the edge and now
53:45 those who like to bear bad news those
53:47 who like to report
53:49 uh kova deaths as some
53:53 [ __ ] pastime anyone who touched the
53:57 kid with that information last year can
53:59 take a little bit of the responsibility
54:00 pool for her taking her own life
54:02 it's like oh you wanted to play that
54:04 game being the most important person in
54:06 the world with bad news well you
54:07 inundated your kid with that [ __ ]
54:09 she already had mental issues that you
54:10 knew about and now she took her own life
54:12 well i hope that little game of yours
54:14 are trying to become important by
54:15 passing around all the negative
54:17 information on social media or at the
54:18 dinner table
54:19 i hope it was worth it for you you know
54:22 i've had at least two experiences with
54:24 dead people communicating with me
54:28 that changes the whole game the
54:31 heartwarming thing about that is that
54:33 there seems to be
54:34 an ecosystem to the universe they're on
54:36 the other side they have
54:38 permission at times to communicate with
54:40 you
54:41 whether it be walt disney walking
54:43 through this you know the park and
54:44 saying well he's here i'm here i know
54:47 how to do this
54:48 poof here's your thing my grandmother
54:50 having the permission to come
54:52 tell me she's on the other side i'm the
54:54 only person she can talk to because i'm
54:55 the only person in the family
54:57 who wasn't raised in the catholic church
54:59 and has a super close mind
55:01 so no one else she can talk to but she's
55:03 like
55:04 this was my kid even though he's my
55:06 grandkid
55:07 i participate in his life heavily
55:10 there you go my previous grandmother
55:12 probably would have done it
55:14 but in 1995 i didn't have this open mind
55:17 like i do
55:18 spiritually so there was no there was no
55:21 communication protocol available
55:24 so let's go on to the other stage of
55:26 this argument
55:27 or this i shouldn't say argument but
55:29 this
55:31 question that we have about our
55:33 existence
55:34 let me ask you the question this is a
55:37 big one
55:38 this is what i've been contemplating for
55:39 years
55:41 i mean this is a very near and dear
55:43 thing to my heart
55:46 is it possible and i'm going to tell you
55:49 the default answer that will come into
55:51 your mind
55:52 if you haven't contemplated this will be
55:55 no
55:56 that'll be your answer the more you've
55:58 contemplated this you might have a maybe
56:00 or hell yeah and there's other factors
56:04 we're going to get into with
56:05 law of attraction is there something
56:08 that you could say
56:09 out loud let's say that god and the
56:12 matrix coders
56:14 give you a little bit of privacy and
56:15 it's it's your consciousness
56:17 that that temporary entity between your
56:20 body and your soul they let you have
56:21 that
56:24 as your own private domain it's a
56:26 firewalled
56:27 part of your little subnet your intranet
56:30 and they just don't go in there they
56:31 just say well we need to you know i like
56:33 my anonymity and
56:35 we all design this together so we
56:36 quarantine that part of the brain so
56:38 if you don't speak out loud or write
56:41 your thoughts down
56:42 then they don't know what you're
56:43 thinking so you speaking out loud to
56:47 your god
56:48 is important or matrix coders right
56:51 one in the same but can you convince
56:55 the coders of the universe whoever you
56:57 think that might be
56:58 to change the way the universe works
57:01 by a matter of popular opinion slash
57:05 enlightenment level to have the epiphany
57:08 to conceive of a different way in the
57:10 first place
57:12 we know right away if you're digging
57:15 this episode and you understand what i'm
57:17 saying
57:18 which i'm sure you do then you can just
57:21 stop this episode for a second
57:24 say you're in your car you just hit
57:26 pause right and you look out
57:28 at everyone walking across the street
57:29 and all the other cars out there
57:31 and it's not a moment of arrogance or
57:33 anything like that or holier than thou
57:35 existence but you look out there and you
57:38 you just know that 99 of most people
57:40 you're looking at can't conceive of what
57:42 we're talking about without you leading
57:44 them into the conversation i mean they
57:45 could get it if you explain it to them
57:47 but just as an everyday thing they're
57:48 not thinking that there's anything they
57:50 can do to change the code of the
57:51 universe
57:52 and so if this was a senate vote
57:56 it'll be you some other
57:59 deep thoughts listeners maybe some other
58:01 philosophers that have had this question
58:02 some other avenue or time and space
58:05 in our universe and everyone else is
58:08 voting
58:09 not even shown up for the vote so
58:11 however many souls are available to vote
58:13 on such a thing that exist in this
58:15 confined reality
58:17 it's not even a con not a contemplation
58:19 it's not even a concept that they
58:21 understand
58:22 so everything remains the same the rules
58:25 remain the same
58:26 the consensus reality we've been beating
58:28 up for five years
58:30 remains the same so if you want to
58:32 affect change in the universe in a
58:34 really huge
58:35 epoch kind of way well you need to
58:38 figure out a way to communicate it to
58:39 the entire
58:40 group of souls that you share your
58:43 reality with
58:45 now i've given you an episode called the
58:49 subid i don't know if that's exactly
58:50 what i'm going to call it out the door
58:51 but that's what i've got it called in my
58:52 computer right now
58:54 and i've also got an episode this sort
58:57 of law of attraction and i opened that
58:58 episode i believe with the notion that
59:00 is
59:03 might be the existential episode too but
59:05 what if the greatest secret in the
59:06 universe is that you can control it
59:10 but there's an area of influence that is
59:13 applies to this power meaning your
59:16 sphere of influence might be able to
59:18 create a reality distortion field
59:20 that is going to impact your life very
59:22 positively
59:24 but if you really want to change the
59:25 entire rule set mechanics of the
59:27 universe
59:29 there has to be some sort of consensus
59:31 that that is what we all want
59:34 so let's just say let's let's create a
59:37 fictional scenario and like almost like
59:38 a comedy movie
59:41 where this is something that you believe
59:43 can happen so you've had a little tiny
59:45 experience
59:46 where you were able to affect your own
59:47 little reality in a way that is
59:49 really atypical uh for instance you go
59:53 to bed
59:56 with a normal body but before you went
59:57 to bed you told god
59:59 or the universe man tomorrow morning i
60:00 want to wake up and be honest what's in
60:02 here
60:03 or whatever claudia shiffert or whatever
60:05 and you do you wake up the next day and
60:07 you have this amazing version of
60:08 yourself that's just utterly phenomenal
60:10 you don't look like those other people
60:11 but you have the best version of it that
60:13 you have
60:14 and so now you're like oh my god this
60:16 works
60:17 now let's fix the entire world to not
60:19 want
60:20 war and and repression and starvation
60:23 and blah blah blah
60:24 and so you start going door-to-door
60:27 right it's
60:28 it's to date myself horribly
60:31 the old movie with john denver and
60:35 george burns which i think was called oh
60:37 god
60:39 or george burns play god john denver
60:41 played an
60:42 atheist who's then approached by george
60:44 burns and he says i'm god and he's like
60:46 yeah yeah whatever
60:47 and of course he proves it to him and
60:49 then they made an oh god part two
60:51 where he was told by george burns to
60:54 change the world and i forgot what the
60:56 little message was they created in the
60:57 movie but
60:59 he tries to affect the world
61:02 and so let's say that's us but you're
61:04 going door-to-door trying to get people
61:06 to believe something that they can't
61:07 even conceive
61:09 but let's say you get a few people that
61:13 listen to you and they're in a crappy
61:17 state of life man they don't like their
61:20 spouse their kids their their reflection
61:22 in the mirror
61:23 their job they're really kind of looking
61:26 forward to the end
61:29 and you're trying to convince them hey
61:30 with another 100 years
61:33 you can change all this bad stuff and
61:36 get to the good stuff but they're tired
61:38 they can't conceive of what it would
61:40 like to be what it would be like to be
61:42 say 55 to 65 but feel like you're 14.
61:46 but that's what you're trying to tell
61:47 them come on let's change it
61:50 if you live to be 200 years you're going
61:51 to live a life of a vulcan or an elf
61:55 you're going to feel young at this age
61:57 just go along with it come on
62:00 but there's that old adage of it ain't
62:02 broke don't fix it
62:04 and they don't think it's broke so you
62:06 can't get any consensus
62:08 so again even though you've had an
62:10 epiphany of a much more interesting
62:14 path for mankind unless you can convince
62:17 the coders all by yourself
62:21 the cost benefit analysis
62:24 of investing in modifying the code for
62:27 all we know it took an eternity to
62:30 to make the code base that we have it's
62:32 perfect
62:33 it's all q8 it's great no bugs bug
62:35 database has zero there's definitely a
62:37 feature list in there
62:38 feature request list but you can't get
62:40 it done
62:42 or even worse it's kind of a bad news
62:46 or good news bad news thing good news is
62:48 you convince them to go ahead and
62:50 put a couple new features in that you're
62:52 gonna love
62:53 problem it's gonna take a trillion years
62:56 to finish the code
62:57 and test it before the new upgrade comes
62:58 out so you've already gone through
63:02 a trillion divided by a hundred years
63:04 worth of life spans
63:06 before you're able to enjoy it by the
63:08 time it arrives
63:09 yeah whatever i'm tired i'm cute i'm
63:12 tired
63:13 cue from star trek don't get it confused
63:15 with the 20 20 21
63:18 this is 2021 by the way but
63:22 uh this is january 8th just so you can
63:24 track this in your head
63:26 some of you have contemplated i i would
63:30 imagine
63:30 quite a few of you who listen to this
63:32 show on a habitual basis
63:34 you've contemplated at some point in
63:36 time probably even proposed it to your
63:38 friends
63:39 or professors or colleagues would it be
63:42 interesting to sit down with a famous
63:45 person for philosophical thinking or
63:48 invention
63:50 and have a conversation with them and
63:52 ask them their opinions about things
63:55 sitting down with nikola tesla sitting
63:57 down with
63:58 plato whoever
64:02 and having a conversation relative to
64:04 what you think that they might have
64:06 had inside their head but you never
64:08 learned it because it was never asked
64:12 the idea would be if this was a
64:14 corporate pitch that you're going to
64:15 give
64:16 to your partners you would have to
64:20 prove the benefits of the cost
64:24 what is it we would get out of ourselves
64:27 if these individuals were to live a much
64:29 longer life
64:30 i know some of you might quote the bible
64:32 with us living
64:33 800 to a thousand years you know
64:36 it's biologically not a huge stretch in
64:39 my
64:40 mind that that could occur and that it's
64:42 just simply cross breeding or
64:43 toxification of the human genome
64:46 that makes our dna age rapidly at this
64:49 point
64:51 but that perhaps in the past one dude
64:54 built the pyramids
64:56 because he had hundreds of years to do
64:58 it
65:00 if not thousands of years to do it i
65:02 don't really have a problem with that as
65:04 long as
65:05 there's no predatorial ecosystem whereby
65:08 over all eventually he's going to get
65:09 eaten by a saber-toothed tiger or
65:11 something right
65:13 is there beauty in our current ecosystem
65:16 of life
65:17 i'm going to say yeah for sure but
65:20 as i've said in several episodes i think
65:23 that if you don't live the
65:25 standard nuclear family life
65:28 then you are going to be cut short of
65:30 the entire human experience
65:33 and for those that don't believe in the
65:35 nuclear
65:37 family your gender identification is
65:40 different such that those lifestyles are
65:42 never going to be a part of your life
65:44 meaning you're never going to going to
65:45 get married with the opposite sex
65:46 partner
65:48 thus never having children
65:51 i assure you that whatever you gained by
65:54 being
65:54 you know employed longer without any
65:58 quote unquote burdens to your life you
66:00 missed out on a tremendous amount of the
66:02 human experience
66:04 of being young then getting older
66:08 getting educated in that phase of your
66:10 life
66:11 finding some trade skills career of some
66:13 sort
66:14 finding someone that you have to then
66:16 share your life with which is a huge
66:20 you know epiphany then making children
66:24 raising those children seeing them
66:27 become you
66:28 and their age as they get older
66:31 and then they have children and you're
66:33 able to raise those children as a
66:35 grandparent
66:36 from a completely different experience
66:38 from a completely different perspective
66:40 of overall burden they're not burdens
66:43 anymore
66:44 because they don't have to be watched by
66:45 you 24 7 necessarily and even if they do
66:47 end up in your house because your kid's
66:49 going through some tough times or
66:50 whatever
66:52 it's still a much easier experience
66:54 you've already done this before
66:55 even with the generational gaps and the
66:58 stuff that the new kids will bring home
66:59 that your kids never brought home
67:02 but then you hit your twilight years
67:03 where even those kids grow up and start
67:05 getting out into the workforce and
67:07 there's no one for you to help anymore
67:09 you're too old
67:10 to raise their kids let's just say your
67:12 great-grandkids
67:15 but you still have those experiences and
67:17 you're growing old with your spouse
67:20 you're both sharing in a marriage that's
67:22 successful you're sharing the burden of
67:24 getting older
67:25 your wife's got issues that you don't
67:27 have and you have issues she doesn't
67:29 have vice versa
67:31 and then eventually the body
67:33 deteriorates and
67:35 luckily in most cases the way that the
67:39 programmers have put our universe
67:40 together as
67:41 on an individual level we start to dial
67:44 out of our senses
67:45 over time we lose our ability to think
67:48 clearly
67:48 we get more foggy with our reality
67:53 and therefore when we die we've been
67:56 if we die in a natural methodology
67:59 timeline
68:00 then we uh
68:04 we're not so we don't care as much you
68:06 know we're kind of out
68:08 yeah you know my eyes don't work i can't
68:11 stop peeing
68:12 whatever the case might be you're like
68:15 yeah i'm done i
68:16 literally have been talked out of my
68:18 body i've been talked out of this form
68:19 of life
68:20 it doesn't mean i didn't love my life
68:22 and love all my relatives and
68:24 spouse and all that kind of stuff but
68:26 yeah it's time for me to go
68:28 and so there's this beautiful system in
68:30 place all i'm
68:31 contemplating in this episode is to say
68:35 are the architects of the universe
68:40 well equipped with the notion of
68:42 mortality
68:44 were they ever mortal i'm sure they they
68:47 play with their own
68:48 stuff but let's just apply
68:52 for one second the standard software
68:55 development processes
68:57 of or even any mechanical device as well
69:01 you have people that design software and
69:03 write software
69:05 but they don't use their own stuff
69:07 sometimes it's just a constraint of time
69:09 they have a deadline they've got to get
69:11 it done i've said several times on this
69:13 show in various capacities
69:16 you know i've been a photoshop guy since
69:18 the mid-90s
69:20 i'm gonna tell you man i've made i don't
69:22 know i don't know how much money i've
69:23 made off of probably a million dollars
69:25 off of photoshop
69:26 jobs alone the product hasn't enhanced
69:31 it hasn't enhanced since the mid-90s
69:33 whatever crap they say they came out
69:35 with the next suite
69:37 it's all crap it's all a bunch of crap
69:39 that you don't need
69:40 it's a gimmicky feature that who cares
69:43 and then it doesn't really work that
69:44 well to say oh man you can
69:45 you can race a person out of your
69:47 photograph and then you really try and
69:48 you're like oh
69:49 only if they're standing against green
69:50 grass you know but in a busy disneyland
69:53 set
69:54 uh you're not going to be able to do it
69:56 because it just does not have enough
69:57 information so it's a bunch of
69:58 crap to sell the product it's like your
70:00 toothpaste getting better and better and
70:02 better
70:03 for 80 years that doesn't happen okay it
70:06 doesn't
70:08 so what you realize with the photoshop
70:09 people is that the coders probably
70:11 aren't artists
70:12 to any degree meaning they don't use
70:15 their own products
70:16 and find that there are features that
70:18 would take minutes to program
70:20 that would significantly impact and
70:22 shorten
70:23 every single
70:27 use of the product you'd be like yeah
70:28 you know this little thing here you
70:29 don't use your own products you don't
70:30 realize what a pain in the ass this is
70:33 to create something looks good like one
70:36 of the old ones
70:37 in photoshop was that if you want to
70:39 create a round rectangle with smooth
70:40 edges
70:42 you can drag a marquee out and make a
70:44 rectangle that's got perfectly square
70:46 edges and
70:47 pixels are square and so they always
70:48 comes out no matter what resolution it
70:50 looks perfect
70:51 but the second you want to round the
70:52 edges if you use the round edge
70:55 technique inside their little selector
70:58 and you say fill that space with white
71:00 on black
71:01 your corners are all jagged because
71:03 these brilliant coders
71:05 can't figure out you need to preserve
71:07 anti-aliasing around these edges
71:10 it's a simple thing that hasn't existed
71:11 for 26 years but
71:14 interface design and all kinds of other
71:16 design issues need these round
71:18 rectangles to work
71:20 i mean technically i haven't tried that
71:21 a long time maybe they figured that out
71:22 but
71:24 there's tons of stuff like that and so
71:27 it i don't think it's uh beyond
71:32 assertion that our designers of our
71:34 universe have
71:35 not lived inside their own product
71:38 enough
71:39 to really address the issues that
71:42 we care about the most now let me throw
71:45 this scenario at you as well because of
71:47 my position in life
71:48 over time some of you might be feeling
71:51 little ebg bees
71:53 heebie jeebs i should say which is a
71:55 slang term from the 1920s
71:58 and a song that you're like oh man what
72:01 you're talking about is blasphemy you're
72:03 you're correcting you're suggesting that
72:05 we make corrections to god's programming
72:07 thus insulting god's
72:09 imminent design slash the matrix coders
72:12 maybe they're up there pissed off who's
72:14 this guy to tell us what to do and
72:16 i'm sure the coders at dolby feel that
72:17 way about my suggestions
72:19 hence their lack of implementation
72:22 video games are the same problem right
72:25 but when you are a senior
72:27 individual at a company you soon figure
72:30 out that that
72:31 barrier of suggestion doesn't really
72:33 exist that
72:34 actually the folks who are trying to
72:37 gain merit
72:39 from their product they want to be
72:42 rewarded for their accomplishment
72:44 they do want the next big feature
72:47 they're trying to think about it but
72:49 they're numb they've been in that game
72:50 for too long you know
72:53 like it's like a good director
72:56 kubrick was a genius at this he would uh
72:59 like there's an old story
73:02 where they're filming the 2001 scene
73:05 where dave and frank are inside the pod
73:09 having dialogue plotting a conspiracy to
73:12 potentially take out hal 9000 if he gets
73:14 out of hand
73:15 because it seems like he's
73:16 malfunctioning he said a product
73:19 he said that a module outside was
73:21 failing and they brought it inside and
73:23 they didn't have any problems with it at
73:25 all
73:25 so they're concerned that this computer
73:27 is losing his mind for some reason
73:30 but the dialogue that was written for
73:32 the character that the actor who played
73:34 frank
73:35 who actually worked with his daughter
73:36 once on a pilot which was really weird
73:39 my life i swear to god
73:42 he was in the middle of this take and
73:43 stanley was doing his typical
73:45 you know 100 plus take moment with this
73:47 dialogue and it just wasn't coming out
73:49 right and the frank character
73:51 actor was just unable to find the
73:54 genuine
73:56 track tracked in his head that was
73:58 making this dialogue work
74:00 and stanley's always about you know
74:02 don't ask me what motivates you with my
74:04 characters that i give you in this movie
74:06 you need to just show up and be this
74:08 character
74:09 and he allowed people to improvise all
74:11 the time he said just make it
74:13 believable make it real make it
74:15 interesting
74:16 and so finally this guy on set
74:20 this is told by the actor who played
74:22 dave
74:24 at a post-mortem interview he said that
74:27 dude lipped off
74:28 and said man you know like why are we
74:30 like stanley's setting up for another
74:31 take and and finally the guy just said
74:33 you know
74:34 this dialogue sucks this is never going
74:37 to sound good you can do a million shots
74:39 of this dialogue and it's awful
74:42 it's not what we would be saying it's
74:44 not what we'd be doing in this story
74:47 and so stanley it's it's like two in the
74:49 afternoon or something
74:51 so a big long day of shooting is
74:53 available right this is a very costly
74:55 production
74:56 tons of people getting paid every second
74:59 and stanley just looks outside the
75:01 camera
75:02 after the dude said it and he goes okay
75:05 that's a wrap for today
75:07 i think that's what he said something to
75:09 that effect like he's shutting down
75:10 the filming for today because of what
75:12 the actor said
75:14 and now the actor's like oh my god
75:18 um i can be replaced you know and so
75:21 stanley
75:23 just leaves and goes to his office on
75:26 set
75:28 and within minutes he calls in the i
75:31 think both the actors because the guy
75:33 was telling the story
75:34 the dave the other character was telling
75:36 the story
75:38 and this guy's pissing himself because
75:41 he's thinking oh my god i just lift off
75:44 impulsively to the greatest director
75:46 that anyone has ever known at the time
75:48 it's a big production is he gonna get
75:51 blackballed out of j out of acting
75:54 because he's unprofessional
75:55 but to his credit let's just say stanley
75:58 kubrick is the caliber of person that
76:00 would be a matrix coder or god himself
76:03 meaning god which should have all the
76:05 virtues of man
76:06 so we see man act virtuous we have to
76:10 probably assume that a creator would
76:11 have the equal if not greater powers
76:13 right
76:14 slash patience so the story goes is that
76:17 the actor comes into stanley's office
76:20 and stanley says okay uh you know
76:22 you got your opinion man what do you
76:25 think should happen
76:27 and i don't know i can't remember what
76:28 it was but the
76:30 the amazing scene where hal 9000 reads
76:35 their lips through the window
76:36 had not been determined yet
76:39 i think i got this right it's off the
76:41 tyler cinema series
76:43 but i think it was this actor who played
76:45 frank said you know i don't know like if
76:48 maybe he just reads our lips through the
76:50 window
76:51 and stanley was like whoa let me think
76:54 about this
76:56 i think it was arthur c clarke
76:59 who was interviewed in sri lanka and he
77:02 was saying i mean i know i saw him say
77:04 this
77:04 stanley had called him up and said what
77:06 do you think about hal reading this
77:07 dude's lips
77:09 i think that's a brilliant idea and i
77:11 think it was uh
77:13 arthur c clark that said i told stanley
77:14 that was a ridiculous
77:16 idea that that could never happen and he
77:19 goes of course it's happened already we
77:20 know how to do that exact thing now
77:24 and that was one of the most famous
77:26 scenes
77:27 in the latter part of the movie just
77:30 reading these lips
77:32 so that's an example of a genius
77:36 endorsing a suggestion from a person
77:39 who's actually
77:40 in it stanley's not in front of the
77:42 camera acting these lines stanley's not
77:44 trying to make these lines make sense
77:47 stanley never appeared in his own movies
77:49 reading his own lines
77:50 and so he realized you know what i'm not
77:54 going to discount this person's genuine
77:56 desire to make an
77:57 authentic scene seem authentic and so
78:00 he's having a problem
78:03 and so stanley respected that in him
78:07 and he got that other scene to happen by
78:10 being inquisitive
78:11 and giving and understanding
78:14 so are we to believe that the coders of
78:18 the universe have contemplated every
78:20 particular concept with our
78:22 current existence and that they can
78:23 never be talked in into anything else
78:26 i know it's easy to be impulsive and say
78:30 no we can't they're they're look at this
78:33 place it's completely ingenious there's
78:34 no way
78:36 that in creating all this other amazing
78:38 stuff that they would have missed
78:40 something well it's just like
78:44 you know there's a lot of ways to do one
78:45 thing they you have to pick at some
78:48 point
78:49 it's the fastest distance between two
78:51 points if you ever watched a tutorial
78:52 online about how to do
78:54 something and all you want is one way
78:57 that works
78:57 you don't want 20 [ __ ] ways this
78:59 thing works it's part of my french
79:01 but i see these tutorials all the time
79:02 where these kids are feeling guilty
79:04 if they don't tell you every single
79:07 technique that gets one thing done and
79:09 the reason why they're doing that is
79:10 they don't want criticism
79:11 in their comments about
79:15 well you know there's no that's not the
79:16 only way to do it you could do it this
79:17 way they don't want any criticism to
79:19 come towards them they're worried about
79:20 the criticism
79:21 and so they try to cover every
79:22 conceivable base and of course there's
79:24 always
79:24 more ways to do it so the criticism
79:26 still comes in
79:28 that's an immaturity of man to to
79:31 be accusatory or derogatory towards
79:35 someone for not coming up with the way
79:37 that you figured it out whether you have
79:38 a faster way or not
79:41 good commenters are usually fairly
79:43 giving and they're like well that this
79:44 is really good technique and you can use
79:46 that one
79:46 if you want but here's another technique
79:48 i use which has 10 extra steps removed
79:52 and then everyone reads that one and
79:53 goes oh yeah that's cool
79:55 i've been contemplating and probably
79:56 will end up executing this year
79:58 creating a little tutorial channel on
80:01 blender 3d i'm trying to figure out
80:02 what's been taught
80:04 sort of what the customers would expect
80:06 from such a thing
80:08 there's so many good channels out there
80:10 it's hard to compete
80:12 however the one thing i'm going to do in
80:14 my channel
80:15 is explain very quickly this is one way
80:19 to do it
80:20 there are other ways to do it but this
80:22 is one way and you're going to be coming
80:23 to me in an emergency
80:25 my channels are going to be designed to
80:27 quickly solve problems
80:29 so that when you're up against a a wall
80:32 and you're like oh my god i gotta figure
80:33 out how to do volumetric light i've
80:34 never done it in blender i know it's
80:36 easy but
80:37 the the documentation sucks the other
80:39 examples are 45 minute videos
80:42 and i'm gonna have it done in 60 seconds
80:45 like thank you i know there's better
80:47 ways but i don't care i gotta gotta get
80:48 this deadline done because i gotta go to
80:50 bed you know
80:51 and there you go you got a solution and
80:53 if i can show it to you in 60 seconds
80:55 you can do it in 60 seconds so who cares
80:57 if there's a 40 second version of it
81:00 but let's uh keep going on the logistics
81:02 of what might be occurring in this
81:04 universe
81:06 what if there's a dark city element to
81:07 this whole thing and it is a
81:09 like the woman who died in the bay area
81:14 having told her mother that this is a
81:15 matrix and this is all
81:17 a big thought experiment is what she
81:19 said which is a very interesting choice
81:21 of words whether she's high on something
81:23 or someone mess with their brain or
81:25 whatever happened to that woman
81:27 she owned i forgot her name but she
81:28 owned tinker websites if you look up
81:32 matrix and the word tinker ceo you're
81:35 going to find this story
81:36 it's very intriguing let's say they're
81:39 trying to distill
81:40 something out of our reality as a matter
81:43 of
81:44 in this whole investment remember
81:46 hitchhiker's guy the galaxy had earth
81:48 trying to find the question to the
81:50 answer of life the universe and
81:51 everything
81:52 and the vogons destroyed planet earth
81:54 just like a minute before the
81:57 question was going to come out and then
81:59 we find out the experiment actually was
82:01 compromised a long time ago
82:03 but they are going to listen to a
82:05 suggestion let's say they have an
82:08 objective and to
82:10 bring in another analogy to better
82:12 explain this
82:13 to make this easier to explain you're
82:16 driving from point a to point b
82:18 and it's a fairly arduous path
82:22 you're a passenger in the car when you
82:25 start the journey you don't know much
82:26 about the distance and the
82:28 the trail trail aka path
82:32 from point a to point b but sitting in
82:34 the car for say two or three days let's
82:36 say it's a big journey
82:39 you got your cell phone you got an ipad
82:42 it's all internet
82:43 enabled in the car you look at the path
82:46 that this person has drawn on a map or
82:48 something or
82:49 whatever they told you they're going to
82:50 do we're just going to stay on
82:51 interstate 40 and keep going
82:53 you start looking at it you start
82:55 looking at the map and you start looking
82:56 up faster ways and little shortcuts and
82:58 real shortcuts and better paths i know
83:00 maybe there's some highway construction
83:02 problems going to sleep
83:03 and you start to realize there's a
83:05 better path
83:06 kind of like the google maps thing when
83:08 talks to you in your car
83:10 and so you suggested to the driver that
83:12 there is a
83:13 potentially different method of getting
83:15 from point a to point b
83:16 they'll shave a couple days off the trip
83:20 hours even with less risk
83:24 or no risk or it's the opposite
83:28 they're like you know what if we're
83:29 gonna drive through arizona on the
83:31 interstate 40
83:33 do you mind if we stop off at that huge
83:35 crater in the ground because i've never
83:37 seen it i've seen it on the internet i'd
83:39 really like to go down to the little
83:42 whatever the gift center they got there
83:44 and just walk out on the
83:46 balcony and look down at the big crater
83:48 underground it's it's three miles around
83:50 one mile across and half a mile down i'd
83:52 like to see that in real life
83:54 and so the driver goes you know what
83:57 yeah you know we're not even expected to
83:59 be there until two days after our
84:00 current schedule puts us in that town
84:03 yeah we could probably add a you know an
84:05 hour to onto our schedule
84:07 to get this big enlightening epiphany
84:09 experience that might
84:11 lead to something else right
84:15 so we're asking the matrix coders to
84:16 give us
84:18 and i'm just using this example more
84:20 life you know like
84:22 roy batty going into dr terrell
84:25 so they might look at this and go well
84:27 what would that mean you know they're
84:28 all up there in the think tank going
84:29 well okay you know
84:30 not like we didn't think about a 200
84:32 year lifespan you know we tried it out
84:34 with the elves a long time ago middle
84:35 earth and
84:37 it was okay it was all right but uh you
84:39 know these are humans and this is you
84:41 know this
84:41 point in life where they now have
84:43 evolved quite a bit so when we
84:45 wrote the software they were still you
84:47 know putting
84:48 finger paint on a wall inside a cave so
84:50 maybe
84:52 could we get you know if we gave them
84:53 more life will we really get more out of
84:55 this would advance society faster than
84:57 we actually want them to advance i mean
84:59 let's look at all the implications maybe
85:01 even on their
85:02 super duper intellect they might say
85:05 some other dude across the table goes
85:08 you know well it would potentially solve
85:10 this other issue we have where everybody
85:12 seems to get very close to an epiphany
85:13 that we really want to distill
85:15 but since we gave him a shorter lifespan
85:18 like
85:18 you know on average we lose the the
85:21 question to the answer to life the
85:22 universe and everything because we sort
85:24 of blow up the earth
85:25 every time they get close to that moment
85:27 that we're trying to get to so let's go
85:29 ahead and give them a little bit more
85:30 life
85:31 and then boom you get your way i know
85:34 that
85:34 one version of this entire scenario that
85:36 i haven't mentioned at all
85:38 has probably occurred to a lot of you
85:41 in 2020 even this year
85:45 where you're just saying to yourself why
85:46 does the world have to be so
85:48 evil i mean
85:51 it's maybe it's always been this way and
85:53 we're simply becoming enlightened to it
85:54 and therefore to us it's new but to them
85:56 it's
85:57 maybe it's even more tempered now maybe
86:00 they did way worse things in the past we
86:01 know that probably for a fact right
86:05 but as we become capable of pushing our
86:07 mind
86:08 over the threshold of pain that is our
86:11 ability to contemplate their evil
86:14 it becomes easier and easier and so then
86:15 we're like oh my god really
86:17 how long have you guys been doing this
86:18 you know if you could have the
86:19 conversation like huxley supposedly did
86:22 and they just look at you and go oh my
86:23 god we should do a thousand times more
86:25 of this stuff
86:27 200 years ago here's the book you know
86:31 let me throw you a kind of a romantic
86:33 notion as i've got a couple inches or a
86:35 couple sorry minutes on my stick still
86:39 imagine and i there's definitely one
86:41 listener out there who's gonna smile
86:43 because she knows i'm talking about her
86:44 her family imagine
86:48 that that extra time always results
86:51 in man learning about the fabric of the
86:54 universe to an extent where they start
86:56 to tamper with the code themselves
86:58 example alchemy
87:01 a little bit more time on planet earth a
87:03 little bit more cause and effect
87:05 for whatever reason the methodology of
87:07 which we record
87:09 the cause and effect models in chemistry
87:12 we simply by design destroy the the path
87:16 that the person having the epiphany
87:20 you know turning water into gold using
87:22 moonlight for instance
87:25 you can't let that person continue for
87:27 200 years because eventually they're
87:29 just cranking out
87:31 element 115 with their tea in the
87:33 morning you know they're just so good at
87:35 it
87:36 perhaps those uh those little romantic
87:38 tales of witches and their brews
87:41 uh there's alchemy that can start making
87:44 spells happen and curses happen it's all
87:47 mechanical
87:49 but they figure out how to do it and so
87:51 they
87:52 prohibit a single human consciousness
87:56 from extending
87:57 to a point where these epiphanies start
87:59 to become
88:01 commonplace low-hanging fruit every
88:03 little kid eventually
88:05 develops a zero-point energy system
88:09 therefore it unravels the universe if
88:11 we're truly not supposed to be traveling
88:13 in the universe and for those who are
88:16 flat earthers
88:17 they absolutely believe this
88:20 space is just a decoration
88:23 but there's nothing that changes the
88:25 fact that if this is an intelligently
88:27 designed universe which just take a look
88:29 it's it's all gorgeous everything that's
88:31 alive is just
88:32 meticulously beautifully designed the
88:35 notion would be
88:37 if you're able to start traveling i mean
88:40 well
88:41 let me finish the thought i think that
88:43 the whole theory of flat earth
88:45 which i think is brilliant and very
88:48 logical
88:49 is that you know they believe
88:53 that the earth is a disc and that the
88:55 antarctica is not a
88:57 continent down south it's actually a ice
88:59 border around the outer edge
89:02 that as man tries to get close to the
89:05 border
89:06 of the disk it's true
89:09 the temperatures sink tremendously
89:12 everything a human being needs to exist
89:15 is challenged at the
89:17 absolute apex of challenge
89:20 the oxygen gets thinner the it's what is
89:23 it the average temperature is negative
89:24 60 fahrenheit
89:27 that's cold baby and that's not the
89:29 bottom that's just the average
89:30 temperature because it's got an
89:32 elevation to it
89:34 so it seems as if the world is designed
89:36 to keep us in the middle
89:38 that's brilliant whether that's true or
89:40 not that's brilliant so take it back to
89:41 heliocentric
89:44 thinking one could apply the same exact
89:47 logic to space travel
89:49 what are we we're carbon based
89:50 carbon-based life-forms that need
89:52 oxygenated
89:54 atmosphere to breathe
89:57 we also are gravity beings we have to
89:59 have gravity to have a digestive system
90:01 to have the density of our bone
90:03 preserved over time
90:05 so we know that just mechanically nasa
90:07 knows this
90:08 most people know this you get into a
90:11 zero gravity
90:12 environment and the mechanical
90:15 dependencies of the human body and the
90:17 autonomic system start to disintegrate
90:21 well there's also not an atmosphere up
90:22 in space
90:24 buck rogers the flash gordon aside
90:28 it's funny those old vid they would open
90:29 the window and start yelling at each
90:31 other in space it was hilarious
90:34 but we're technically just by design
90:37 not meant to be in space so if we're to
90:41 explore space we're going to have to
90:42 come up with a propulsion system that is
90:44 entirely different than rockets in space
90:46 because those don't work
90:47 we're gonna have to have an ethereal
90:48 gravity engine
90:50 okay but we're not supposed to be there
90:51 so we'd have to build an uh an
90:53 agrodome spaceship which has been in
90:56 several different movies
90:58 and bring all of our food
91:01 you know bring grass bring everything so
91:04 we can create oxygen out of our own
91:05 exhaling
91:07 of our food systems and then we have to
91:09 have zero point
91:11 failure with that the way it's all put
91:13 together because if there's ever a
91:15 catastrophic
91:16 famine on our ship then we die our
91:19 oxygen simply doesn't manufacture itself
91:24 and so it would look as if whatever is
91:27 supposed to be going on we're supposed
91:28 to be on this place
91:30 whether it be a flat disc or a round
91:32 ball we're supposed to be here
91:34 this is the game if any of you played a
91:36 video game that
91:37 is sort of um so like a fallout 4 or
91:41 something where you can scour the world
91:42 or um
91:44 was it obsidian whatever those games are
91:47 you know
91:47 world warcraft still has barriers to it
91:50 because the designers can't infinitely
91:52 design the universe in a video game
91:54 until ai can do it for us
91:57 run around call of duty one or two and
92:00 you'll run into like
92:01 barriers where tanks are parked against
92:04 the street and you're not allowed to go
92:05 past the tanks
92:07 real life you could definitely do it but
92:08 they don't have designs past the tank
92:11 so they got a little fake you know props
92:14 out there
92:14 but you're not meant to be out there so
92:17 it says you can't go any further in this
92:18 direction
92:21 man doesn't like that man wants freedom
92:25 again the second you balanced a bicycle
92:27 and found out that you can travel
92:29 anywhere in town on that bicycle
92:31 you no longer want to have someone tell
92:32 you well that street's off limits if
92:34 that street's off limits
92:36 guess we're coming every day and trying
92:38 to go
92:39 anyway i thought you would dig this
92:43 conversation
92:45 you know what's kind of funny is i i
92:48 sort of think about these more
92:49 existential episodes and
92:51 in normal circumstances when the world's
92:53 a really wonderful place
92:54 i think that you guys will get bored
92:56 with these episodes but as the world
92:58 gets more crazy
92:59 i think these are sort of probably nice
93:01 little retreats away from all the chaos
93:03 of life
93:05 and i think this conversation is talking
93:08 about an elevated perspective of reality
93:10 right
93:11 this whole conversation geographically
93:15 pulled you out of your world and put you
93:17 down put you way up in the heavens
93:19 looking down on this whole thing as an
93:20 experiment
93:22 you just sat shoulder to shoulder with
93:23 the matrix coders in your mind or god
93:25 himself
93:28 i think that's good i think that's good
93:31 you know again when you work for a
93:33 corporation one of the things i was
93:35 trying to get along or get through
93:36 earlier in this conversation and failed
93:38 miserably is that because i was
93:42 always a fairly senior dude because i
93:45 brought
93:46 very unique skills to the companies i've
93:47 worked for over time when i work for
93:49 other people
93:50 i always ascended like i've said several
93:51 times up to the ceo level
93:54 not necessarily being the ceo but
93:57 working with the ceos
93:59 and you get into conversations where
94:01 there's a there's a huge
94:03 shift in your mind many of you have
94:04 experienced this where you go from being
94:07 sort of
94:08 the lowly employee that's coming to get
94:09 your check and go home and watch the
94:11 football game whatever
94:12 and when you're brought into the upper
94:14 tier of things it's a very interesting
94:16 experience to know that
94:18 dissent is what they want they want you
94:21 to voice
94:22 concerns because they don't want to fail
94:25 and even if they don't agree with you
94:27 they at least want to hear your
94:28 perspective of why you think a
94:29 particular thing is a risk that should
94:30 be taken
94:32 in their mind they might find a way to
94:34 mitigate that risk or minimize it
94:36 because they're like hey you know we
94:37 already thought about that and there's
94:38 this this
94:39 i don't have time to explain it to you
94:40 but just know that that concern is taken
94:41 care of
94:43 imagine the difference on that 2001 a
94:46 space odyssey example i gave you where
94:48 this actor lips off
94:50 right in the middle of a chute well
94:53 imagine the grip who's holding a light
94:55 stand
94:57 hearing that dude lip off to stanley
94:59 kubrick
95:01 there's three different perspectives
95:02 going on in that room
95:04 at a minimum there's the grip who's
95:07 going oh
95:07 my god this dude just left off to
95:10 stanley kubrick
95:12 he is fired because that's just what
95:14 happens when you do that kind of thing
95:18 you have the actor reaching a point
95:20 where
95:21 in his brain if i were to describe it
95:23 correctly he
95:24 has been put into a no-win situation
95:28 he does not believe that he can achieve
95:30 what he has been hired to do
95:32 and after several takes several dozens
95:34 of takes he's like this is absurd
95:36 you can chew me down because the actor
95:39 is very aware of the process of
95:41 what stanley does many many directors do
95:45 you come in with this pre conceived
95:48 notion of how you're going to act the
95:49 lines and what stanley does is he wears
95:52 you out of any preconceived notion that
95:53 you had
95:55 and the second that you lose your
95:56 patience with your i figured out how to
95:58 do this in the hotel room
96:00 last night as i was practicing my lines
96:02 he wants you to
96:03 to burn that up and then come in
96:07 with the next take just being the
96:10 character
96:11 so he impulsively chose to lip off
96:15 to stop what he probably felt like was a
96:18 a groundhog day of insanity and failure
96:21 to affect change in the process and
96:24 stanley
96:25 being the omnipotent genius that he was
96:28 saw it all and said you know
96:32 i have pushed a human being to the point
96:34 where they
96:36 literally took all their chips on the
96:38 board and pushed it all the center and
96:40 said [ __ ] you
96:41 this is not working and then he was
96:44 smart enough
96:45 to have a session and then he found one
96:48 of the most famous scenes
96:50 in his entire cinematic career by being
96:53 patient
96:55 by being what we should assume our
96:58 creator or creators are capable of doing
97:01 with us
97:03 it's not about being arrogant it's not
97:04 about minimizing their brilliance it's
97:06 about
97:07 making this truly the community
97:11 that is their apparent design for
97:14 mankind
97:15 man is meant to be together which is why
97:17 the 2020 quarantining is anti-human
97:21 which is why people are killing
97:22 themselves because they're losing their
97:24 human contact
97:25 the entire notion of the internet has
97:27 created this illusion that you have
97:29 500 friends when if you were to only be
97:32 able to keep the friends and your
97:33 friends list that you have actually met
97:35 in real life
97:36 maybe you have a hundred left over after
97:38 you purge everyone out
97:40 it's important to contemplate these
97:42 things and see the whole system as
97:44 a as one so if we're saying to our
97:46 coders
97:47 or our god look ben this needs to be
97:51 more interactive between the two of us
97:54 it's i know you're you're what are your
97:56 uh
97:57 the anunnaki god on or whatever and
98:00 you're up there and you can't
98:01 participate because you don't want to
98:02 mess with our lives look around you go
98:04 here here's the deal
98:06 yeah for the neighbor that would freak
98:07 out if you showed up in their living
98:09 room
98:09 don't show up in their living room
98:11 because they're intellectually incapable
98:12 of dealing with the experience
98:15 but just let your creator know look i'm
98:18 good i'm good if you show up my living
98:19 room i'm good if you
98:21 change me while i'm asleep to be a
98:23 better person
98:24 to just rid me of bad behaviors or
98:28 or to endow me with great behaviors
98:32 go i give you full permission to
98:34 interact with me
98:36 and they're up there going hey man we've
98:38 never had one say that to us before this
98:40 is kind of cool
98:42 well let's uh you know don't go let's
98:43 not you know totally dive into this
98:45 guy's life because
98:45 he or she might be full of crap that
98:47 they can actually deal with this
98:48 experience so we're not going to show up
98:49 in the living room but let's uh
98:51 let's experiment a little bit uh you
98:53 know we know they have some goals
98:56 maybe they want to lose a couple pounds
98:57 maybe they want to have more focus when
98:59 they work
99:00 maybe they are ready for something
99:01 creative even though they have
99:03 never done anything creative you know
99:05 that that's deep down in that family
99:07 gene that
99:08 family is usually pretty creative in
99:09 this particular offspring
99:12 has never felt like they've had an
99:13 opportunity to engage
99:15 that genetic predisposition
99:18 let's we'll start we'll start small
99:22 you know the cat that saved the baby
99:25 i have a friend of mine and she's always
99:27 been saying for like probably last 10 15
99:29 years as the internet started to surface
99:31 these videos of
99:32 of pets being brilliant like humanoid
99:36 in behavior she said to me once she goes
99:39 man
99:39 i feel like something's going on i feel
99:41 like the evolution between man and
99:43 animal
99:43 is starting to increase to the point
99:45 where you got gorillas sign languaging
99:48 you know they'd like to have a ps4 you
99:50 know and so
99:52 it looks like we're bleeding into them
99:53 and they're bleeding into us
99:55 all because of consciousness and because
99:58 you see videos the second you see a
100:00 video of a cat saving a baby from
100:01 falling down the stairs
100:03 if you own a cat you might go into your
100:06 front room and go
100:08 you know fifa's um
100:11 you want to watch a particular show on
100:14 tv i mean i've been hogging the tv the
100:16 whole time but maybe you want to see
100:17 fish swim around on the screen
100:19 i don't know you want to see other cats
100:21 you know
100:22 and your cat walks up to the remote and
100:23 goes uh i want to see netflix
100:26 twilight zone let's go you know anyway
100:29 i thought this was a fun little
100:31 experiment here
100:32 let me know what you think in the
100:33 comments below
100:36 please go to deepthoughtsradio.com to
100:38 bookmark everything just in case we get
100:40 moved around
100:40 i think things are pretty stable now i
100:42 don't have any fear of us getting
100:44 cut off and i wanted to very blatantly
100:48 say i'm not going to
100:51 compromise bringing you information
100:53 because i am feared
100:55 fearing a ban what i will typically do
100:57 you guys
100:58 who are normal listeners know this is i
101:00 will definitely try to cleverly
101:03 move around certain keywords that will
101:05 be rasterized by the transcripting
101:07 ai such that we don't get dings that we
101:10 don't need
101:12 but as a disciple of rod sterling
101:17 he taught us all how to do this because
101:20 he had the same challenge back in the
101:21 day with censorship
101:23 and he got um what is 190 episodes made
101:26 of his show
101:28 both with his own contributions writing
101:29 half of the episodes and the other
101:31 gentleman writing the other half
101:34 i don't know if there's any female
101:35 writers i think there is a couple female
101:36 writers for the show but
101:38 pretty sparse for the other writers at
101:41 all
101:42 but anyway we got video audio social
101:45 media
101:46 all new remastered season one a store
101:49 and a couple ways to contribute to the
101:50 movement you know i watch a lot of
101:54 episodes from a lot of different shows
101:56 out there with hundreds of thousands of
101:57 subscribers talking about
101:59 very controversial issues we are
102:01 definitely shadow band for sure
102:04 none of our episodes are allowed to get
102:06 over
102:07 a surge of 900 views within a certain
102:10 period of time
102:12 so the second that uh it gets close to
102:14 900 views within a short period of time
102:16 they start shadow banning the video you
102:18 guys are being unsubscribed
102:20 ceremoniously it looks like they may
102:22 have adjusted their algorithm a little
102:23 bit
102:24 where for everyone that comes on they
102:26 knock one off sort of thing
102:28 so definitely make sure you're
102:29 subscribed to the channel if you have
102:31 ideas for episodes please throw it down
102:32 below
102:33 again if you have an individual you want
102:35 me to
102:37 explore i'll give you an example now i
102:40 know who david ike is i know his whole
102:42 life
102:43 story based on what he shared with us
102:45 but let's say i didn't know who that guy
102:46 was and you're like yeah i can't wait
102:47 for you you should talk you should go
102:49 explore david ike what you need to say
102:51 is the following
102:53 you need to look into david ike he is
102:54 the guy that is a proponent of
102:56 the lizard people theory and
103:00 blah blah blah and that way i'm like oh
103:02 yeah lizard yeah we want to do a little
103:04 reptile thing i've already done that
103:06 episode by the way
103:08 and so at least i have like you know a
103:09 little bit of a vector in my brain for
103:11 why a particular person's been mentioned
103:13 and since i've made that suggestion you
103:14 guys have been fabulous uh
103:16 upgrading your suggestions so please
103:18 know my pipeline for all of this
103:21 is i've got a to-do list on my phone app
103:23 and i put my ideas in there
103:25 sometimes i make a mistake and put a
103:27 great idea and forget to describe what
103:28 it is and so later on i look it up i'm
103:30 like what the hell was i talking about
103:33 but when you guys make suggestions to me
103:34 i've got on all my computers
103:36 a folder inside my web browser and what
103:39 i do is i go up
103:41 find the videos that you suggest all
103:42 that stuff and then just bookmark them
103:44 all
103:44 and it will take me months most likely
103:46 to get to fully ingest it
103:49 just know if you give me the reference
103:51 of a video that's four hours long you
103:52 better
103:53 preface it because i'm just going to
103:55 look at a four hour play time and go
103:57 unless this is really apparent to me the
103:59 value
104:00 i just don't have that time in my life
104:02 to get into it but i do my best
104:05 so anyway take care of yourself and
104:07 someone else and i'll see you in the
104:08 next deep thoughts
104:09 over now
