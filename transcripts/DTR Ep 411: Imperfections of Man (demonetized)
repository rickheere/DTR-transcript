00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen so I was thinking about what
00:34 episode to make and I may actually end
00:38 up including this inside of season 5 not
00:42 sure but the subject we're going to
00:44 cover today came out of a a meeting I
00:48 had with some friends of mine that I'm
00:50 working with and these this is something
00:54 I've alluded to and mentioned in
00:55 previous episodes but these are amazing
00:57 people
00:58 I mean profoundly amazing people we've
01:01 all been in think tanks some people have
01:03 created the think tanks but it's really
01:06 aimed at improving the world an
01:10 extremely formal level and taking formal
01:14 steps and if the project ever comes to
01:17 fruition I'll definitely point you guys
01:19 at it but if nothing else the amazing
01:22 the amazing amount of information that
01:24 we're sharing in these meetings I am
01:26 sitting there you know if I'm not
01:28 talking I'm writing down everything
01:29 everyone's saying yeah we use this tool
01:31 called zoom which is like Skype you can
01:36 share your screen all this good stuff
01:38 and so the show us websites you know
01:40 with sharing website sharing books and
01:45 this particular subject was just
01:48 mentioned but it was mentioned in the
01:50 context that I think is very important
01:51 and I think it will change the way that
01:55 we perceive wisdom the way we manifest
01:59 wisdom and the way we use wisdom in the
02:01 world because I think it is something
02:03 that has eluded me in the grand sense of
02:07 things and the macro sense of things a
02:09 lot of you know I'm posting up the
02:13 entire series to [ __ ] shoot which is an
02:17 excruciating process because if you go
02:20 too fast it starts to fail and it just
02:22 fails sometimes and so you're trying to
02:24 keep everything I'm trying to keep
02:25 everything numbered properly in the
02:26 channel so every once in a while one
02:28 gets ahead of the other one because the
02:30 one I upload before is either longer
02:32 takes longer to encode or just failed in
02:34 general but the subject is
02:38 what I'm going to call just human
02:39 imperfection and I was uploading the old
02:44 episode in season 2 on betrayal which is
02:47 about an episode where we deal with the
02:50 fact that humans are imperfect and then
02:51 as long as we rely on human beings then
02:54 we're gonna get hurt it's a betrayal
02:56 sort of definitely an advanced lay level
03:00 of cognitive dissidence between human
03:03 beings because someone should be
03:05 accountable enough to avoid ever
03:07 betraying another human being betraying
03:08 is a true cognitive I know what I'm
03:12 doing I'm going to benefit myself and in
03:15 benefiting myself I'm gonna betray
03:17 another person so that I can gain
03:19 something now it is possible to betray
03:22 someone and you don't know it but you
03:25 need to go see that episode if you want
03:26 a real personal view on things the
03:30 things that go through there is a
03:31 personal family level betrayal a spousal
03:35 relationship partner betrayal and
03:40 business betrayal those are the three
03:43 main categories in that but this one's
03:45 gonna be a lot bigger and a lot more
03:46 macro and a lot have a higher altitude
03:52 of observation I know it might seem a
03:55 little dry might seem a little less
03:57 interesting but bear with me on this
04:00 here is the the premise of our class of
04:04 our story of our discussion we are all
04:08 the teachers okay we are waking up we
04:12 are waking up to a world that is full of
04:16 corruption full of really bad people
04:18 full of narcissistic selfish people full
04:22 of people who live on the the
04:25 cobblestones of our solute pads where
04:29 they jump across the lake on something
04:31 and it's all betrayal all the way across
04:33 it's just how they live their lives and
04:35 they care not about your feelings or
04:37 anything because perhaps they're so
04:39 reptilian and and primitive in their
04:42 mind there's no empathy whatsoever some
04:47 are feral in their betrayal and that
04:49 they have no perception
04:51 of behaving any other way for the feral
04:56 it is a matter of survival not a matter
04:59 of social preference personal preference
05:02 of how to behave and so you know let me
05:07 just rewind here to give ourselves or
05:10 say we're zooming in on Earth from that
05:14 other place that we don't know if exist
05:16 or hunt and we're an alien race let's
05:19 just say for a brief moment our burbs
05:23 were a soul a soul that has been there
05:26 before but we've been inside of a human
05:28 body and so we had limitations to our
05:30 perception capability perspective but
05:35 now we're in this realm of all-knowing
05:37 we don't necessarily know it all at the
05:40 same time but we can definitely get the
05:41 god facts when we need it and we do
05:44 graphical overlays on top of the world
05:45 as it spins in front of us or however
05:48 that spin happens and we start to
05:52 realize you know I think the first layer
05:57 would be who does more harm like give me
05:59 a red tint over every soul that lives by
06:05 do harm betrayal
06:07 selfishness narcissism now of the of
06:12 that red sector wherever that is on the
06:15 surface of the planet now overlay who is
06:20 in power who controls more human beings
06:25 through adopted paradigms of mankind
06:27 because we're adopting all the control
06:29 mechanisms no one's forcing us to do
06:32 anything in this world we are adopting
06:35 our control mechanisms I think there
06:39 would be a massive overlap between those
06:42 two groups the evil the ignorance the
06:46 selfish the greedy the truly evil
06:51 devilish people and those that run the
06:54 world and it's not a cop-out I know a
06:58 lot of folks might say yeah you know
06:59 you're just angry you don't have their
07:02 money and their stuff it's like
07:04 honestly I probably have nearly all the
07:09 stuff that I want in this world or I've
07:10 had it and I've gotten rid of it are
07:13 there things that I would like to do
07:16 that I can't just immediately do yeah
07:18 sure but you know I wouldn't want that
07:20 to go away I wouldn't want to be them
07:22 and be like oh jeez I've experienced
07:24 everything now it's time to get super
07:25 evil and do things that are ultra taboo
07:28 and horrible for the world so I can get
07:30 a little you know adrenaline high here
07:32 and there no thanks man no thanks but
07:36 you know we are all participating in the
07:41 Great Awakening in a way that we are
07:43 trying to spread truth and we're trying
07:46 to spread lucidity such that we can see
07:48 evil so it sticks out like a sore thumb
07:51 instead of being able to coexist with us
07:56 I just simply go unnoticed unpunished
08:01 unhindered and there's a lot of steps
08:05 going on right now where a lot of very
08:07 evil people are getting detained but I
08:09 can almost assure you the majority of
08:11 them are still at large
08:13 the human imperfection subject matter
08:15 goes a little bit like this we know we
08:19 are imperfect everyone is imperfect so
08:25 that leaves us with a very interesting
08:27 problem we know this and we sort of
08:31 overlook it at the same time our hubris
08:33 our arrogance as man ends up protecting
08:37 a bunch of lies it's interesting we
08:38 don't want to admit that we are a part
08:40 of a human race a species that is flawed
08:43 a lot of us think well geez at least we
08:47 can do better than the evil people that
08:50 are seemingly running this planet and
08:52 that would probably be a very true
08:54 statement but we also have our super
08:56 weaknesses mentally physically whatever
08:59 it might be
09:00 perhaps you're able to conceal and hide
09:02 the thorn in your side as Paul wrote in
09:05 the Bible but if it eats up your life
09:08 and if he eats up your consciousness
09:09 then it's probably something that
09:12 frustrates you now let me give you a
09:16 little analogy that's
09:17 very interesting for the brain if we
09:20 built let's say a machine the
09:24 Everlasting Gobstopper machine and its
09:27 task is to create everlasting
09:29 gobstoppers that could then be put in
09:31 little packages and sold to children to
09:32 route their teeth the machine is
09:35 supposed to work correctly at all times
09:38 if it needs repair or service we want to
09:42 be able to anticipate that on a schedule
09:45 on a calendar stop the machine before it
09:48 actually goes haywire
09:50 open it up replace a spring a sprocket
09:53 and get a little bit of oil there a
09:55 little bit of this that and close it
09:57 back up again start it back up again and
10:00 we avoid through maintenance just like
10:03 our cars a blow-up alright well that's
10:08 our base model for all machines that we
10:11 use we don't have a television that
10:13 sometimes shows the picture and
10:14 sometimes doesn't right a blender that
10:18 sometimes works and sometimes doesn't I
10:20 mean all of us have had bad devices in
10:22 the world but then of course we're
10:23 wishing that the 99.9% of the rest of
10:27 the world's machines were ours right we
10:29 don't want to have a broken thing but
10:31 now look at humanity the human race were
10:35 organic we are object-oriented right we
10:40 are chaos and we are flawed meaning as
10:45 much as we would like to control
10:46 ourselves our mental thoughts our
10:49 desires our patience pools our goal
10:54 acquisition our planning we can't at any
11:00 point in time be perfect and so the
11:07 whole fabric of society based on
11:09 humanity is an approximation at best but
11:15 don't we make laws and rules which are
11:19 perfect by design and we in we treat it
11:24 as if it is something that should be
11:26 followed
11:28 to the T forever the Garden of Eden was
11:32 a flawed story it dramatizes and people
11:37 cover for by getting a little in my
11:40 opinion ludicrous about the subject
11:42 matter but God makes the Garden of Eden
11:44 builds first Adam and then obviously he
11:48 got bored so God miscalculated Adams
11:50 ability to be you know Sullivans and in
11:54 a solitary situation so he puts them to
11:57 sleep takes a rib gives it to the woman
11:58 makes woman boom everything's great for
12:02 some weird arbitrary reason he picked an
12:04 apple tree and said just owning off this
12:06 tree which is a perfect rule rules are
12:09 perfect humans aren't God knew he made
12:13 humans imperfect and so eventually
12:18 someone it just happened to be Eve a
12:21 from this tree God is surprised because
12:26 God is a [ __ ] in the Bible and then of
12:29 course there's all this punishment and
12:33 either banished from Eden the menstrual
12:35 cycle and birth cycle of women is
12:37 painful and annoying and it's all the
12:40 woman's fault of course and then that
12:43 thus forges the you know the initial for
12:48 Christians you know the initial spawn of
12:50 man plus all the Old Testament folks and
12:52 now we think we only ought live in this
12:55 tumultuous world of evil and we're not
12:58 in God's presence because of this
13:00 original sin event as I'm told only
13:04 Western Christians believe in that
13:07 Eastern Christianity does not believe in
13:10 that good for them good for them but now
13:15 that story aside we have all these weird
13:19 things in our world don't we they will
13:22 say this phrase and I'm not trying to
13:24 caride everyone a blank check but they
13:25 say this phrase quite a bit the
13:26 ignorance of the law is no excuse okay
13:29 name a human being on this planet that
13:32 knows all the laws of their local
13:34 district and I mean all of them all the
13:36 ordinances all the laws anything that
13:38 leads to punishment
13:40 or any type of penalty and I will put
13:45 all the money that I have all of the
13:48 possessions all that I love on a bet
13:51 that not a single human being exists in
13:53 any modern built up first world society
13:56 who would know all the laws of both
13:59 local district federal international the
14:04 ones that control us you're supposed to
14:08 be able to file your taxes and not make
14:11 any mistakes when the tax code is bigger
14:14 than the legal code ridiculous so you're
14:19 supposed to hire professionals to do it
14:20 you are forced to part with money to
14:23 hire professionals of which you may not
14:25 have that money to part with in the
14:27 first place to file your taxes and then
14:31 they sell insurance against the fact
14:34 that they don't know all the laws of tax
14:36 code either so how do you go into a
14:39 court of law and lose a case against
14:45 these complex situations now we have
14:48 several laws that are so basic and so
14:52 linked to common law
14:54 that we do know them you're not supposed
14:57 to kill anybody you know just outright
15:00 you can defend yourself no supposed to
15:04 rape anybody we know these things those
15:07 are the big sort of 10 commandments that
15:10 we know I think everyone knows at least
15:12 10 laws that will keep most of men from
15:16 hurting man
15:17 don't steal then you have metaphysical
15:21 once out of religion which are aimed at
15:23 improving your life which is not to
15:25 covet but we're living in this world as
15:31 inferior to perfection beings we are
15:36 amazing beings I mean no one would argue
15:38 that humanity is one of the most amazing
15:41 things ever created by a creator if
15:46 you're an evolutionist it should just be
15:47 more mind-blowing like a like an an
15:50 atheist evolutionary person who cannot
15:53 believe in a central consciousness of
15:55 any kind thinks that everything came out
15:58 of nothing they should literally be
16:00 walking around like they're completely
16:03 hi all the time in my opinion I mean
16:05 they should be able to lead you know
16:06 just crawl in the grass and just pick up
16:09 a blade of grass and just oh my god this
16:11 came from nothing there was no matter no
16:14 energy in the universe and then kaboom
16:16 it all existed I mean I mean come on
16:18 seriously IQ test failure right there so
16:24 now think about this how many of you
16:26 have seen a story or you have
16:28 experienced this personally
16:30 where there were rules and you saw
16:34 someone break the rules and it could be
16:37 fairly bad rules I mean maybe not
16:40 capital murder of some sort right but
16:43 even in some of those cases you might
16:46 say you understand and as a jury you
16:49 might remember you may actually cut the
16:52 guy or girl some slack because the
16:54 circumstances start to defined a little
16:55 bit better in the empathy that you would
16:59 do the same thing in the same situation
17:00 starts to manifest and you let the
17:02 person go how many times have you seen a
17:06 person who has gone through perhaps
17:12 major drug addiction and they get out of
17:16 their circle they go do their time
17:17 whatever they do they they maybe they
17:20 lost everything in their life maybe they
17:21 lost some things in their life but then
17:23 they go and they learn how to
17:24 rehabilitate other people with drug
17:27 addiction and it's because they
17:30 intimately understand what addiction
17:34 feels like on a mental level on a
17:36 physical level they even understand how
17:38 to detox works and how it makes you feel
17:40 and those people are magical to the
17:43 people of their same species right I
17:46 mean if we're human species maybe it's a
17:48 subspecies of that particular problem
17:50 but they understand and they empathize
17:53 and they save lives all the time they
17:55 keep people out of jail they keep people
17:57 from ruining their lives right how many
18:00 times if we had movie stars that you
18:02 find out later on serve time in jail for
18:07 big things murder that kind of stuff and
18:09 they regretted what they did and they
18:11 serve their time and now they're out and
18:13 they became gentle giants afterwards
18:16 because they they realized they made a
18:19 mistake and you know every single day
18:21 they wake up they remember that mistake
18:22 it humbles them every single day and so
18:25 they just try to brighten the world
18:27 where they took you know where they
18:29 introduced a lot of darkness into the
18:31 world it's different people I'm sure the
18:35 family that perhaps lost a loved one and
18:38 may never have sympathy for that person
18:42 but what can you do and you make that
18:44 kind of mistake so what if you got the
18:47 job of architecting society and this is
18:51 where we're going to get into sort of
18:52 two different Forks of thought in my
18:56 opinion one is the group of people that
18:59 would be the majority of the world the
19:01 99% pool of the world that one society
19:06 to grow to the next level we'll do
19:08 anything to fix society like education
19:12 would be your first agenda above all we
19:16 got to make sure the kids that grow up
19:18 don't grow up into lies don't grow up
19:19 into you know
19:21 lusting after material objects getting
19:23 oversexed
19:25 you know getting their very biological
19:27 binary gender all confused because all
19:30 the stuffs being thrown at them when
19:31 they're trying to figure out how to men
19:33 you know Mel with society so there's
19:36 that group and then there's this other
19:39 group that is the controlling group the
19:42 group that has used their wealth and
19:44 serendipitous fortune to under educate
19:49 everyone to keep everyone at bay because
19:51 they believe in their hearts that if we
19:53 got educated and wealthy that we would
19:55 simply remove them now of course we all
19:59 know that they could be replaced as I
20:01 can we get rid of those people other
20:02 greedy people defective human beings
20:04 will go up and you know power corrupts
20:07 absolutely restarts to show up again
20:10 there's been countless times in history
20:12 where a king or queen is displaced by
20:15 their family member or conquering party
20:17 with the intent to fix everything and
20:20 they immediately find the burden of the
20:22 king and they go right back into the
20:26 issues and I think the burden of the
20:28 king which they just say King and the
20:32 analogy could be the burden of the Queen
20:34 as well would they find out the society
20:37 is utterly chaotic and their fear
20:39 structure and their and their lusts for
20:42 things and as long as their society
20:45 lusts for something that they can have
20:47 which seems to be a common thread of
20:49 imperfection in a human being though no
20:53 matter how much you spoil and bless your
20:55 people they always want something else
20:57 and eventually going to run out of
20:59 resources run out of time to ever
21:02 provide that on your watch and so they
21:04 start to resent you now I don't know if
21:08 there's ever been a time in history
21:10 perhaps some of your history buffs can
21:11 enlighten all of us where a ruler
21:15 brought themselves down to the level of
21:17 the people and so that they didn't have
21:20 a house that was better than anyone
21:21 else's house they didn't have money that
21:23 was exorbitantly higher than everyone
21:25 else's money food that was better than
21:28 their food etc etc I don't know that
21:30 that's ever happened but if it has
21:33 happened it'd be interesting to see how
21:35 long that society lasted
21:37 I do believe several times in history we
21:40 have had untouched societies that went
21:45 for probably hundreds if not thousands
21:48 of years in a utopia and a blissful
21:52 state and they were simply conquered by
21:55 those that were aggressive because the
21:59 utopian state would probably have
22:02 reached a point I think Egypt was
22:03 definitely recorded in history as being
22:05 this but it you know then again we
22:09 simply don't know and a lot of the
22:10 history is just wrong and made up to
22:13 sell books the fun universities to just
22:16 fill up a gap so that we don't live with
22:18 the void of history but it looks like
22:21 perhaps they might have created a
22:23 utopian existence and then when the
22:26 neighboring factions came in which
22:28 hadn't achieved such bliss they're
22:31 looking at the haves they consider
22:34 themselves to have nots which they quite
22:35 frankly probably were and they're more
22:38 savage and they're more in the primitive
22:40 state so they attack well you you topi
22:45 in state did they keep weapons you know
22:48 and any great supply to the even train
22:50 an army I don't know maybe none and if
22:54 they don't guess what's gonna happen the
22:56 world is gonna roll back however many
22:59 thousands of years tens of thousands of
23:01 years it took for that one utopia to
23:03 exist and that scenario is before you
23:08 have elite people ruling class people
23:14 with methodologies to dominate societies
23:18 by design right you have your money
23:21 changers first it was the it was
23:23 literally the Masons those that could
23:25 build things ended up ruling areas
23:27 because my god you wanted better
23:29 shelters and water wells and all kinds
23:31 of other facilities that they knew how
23:33 to build i mean imagine you lived in an
23:36 area that had really bad weather it's
23:38 either super cold in the wintertime
23:39 super out in the summertime you had
23:41 monsoons or hurricanes whatever and they
23:44 were able to build structures out of
23:45 stone that could withstand all that
23:47 punishment and then you would chill out
23:50 and relax
23:51 the storm rolls over you want some water
23:54 well jeez we're gonna build a well they
23:57 provides water and we're gonna build a
23:59 building right on top of it so we'll
24:00 always have our water right there in our
24:02 house the Romans come along and they
24:04 create aqueducts and plumbing and all
24:06 kinds of beautiful things so we've had
24:10 these Mason's around the world first but
24:14 then the monetary system came along and
24:15 the money changers started wiping out
24:17 the Masons even in the Bible Jesus
24:21 turned over the tables of the
24:22 moneychangers well even if that story is
24:25 completely fake the authors of the book
24:29 were acknowledging to you and to me that
24:32 the money changers were blasphemous and
24:35 in plenty operating in side temples of
24:40 God so now I want you to imagine that
24:43 you become king or queen or maybe I
24:47 shouldn't say it maybe you become the
24:48 president and you're either male or
24:50 female it doesn't matter and someone
24:53 says to you okay this is gonna be a
24:54 golden era potentially because the
24:59 setups gonna be this you will have every
25:01 resource to gather information about the
25:05 societies around the world you're gonna
25:09 have books of knowledge about past
25:12 successes past failures and all you have
25:14 to do as a human being is correlate the
25:18 solutions with the problems and we're
25:21 off to the races
25:22 you're in charge people you need staff
25:25 we gotta for you anything you need I'm
25:29 going to suggest that no matter how
25:33 unbelievable your intentions are with
25:35 just what I gave you there it's only a
25:39 matter of time before you fail let's
25:42 just say I give you also a youth serum
25:44 where it's not the adrenal chromes and
25:47 it's not baby blood it's some little
25:49 nice sandwich made out of healthy foods
25:52 is going to keep you alive for five
25:54 hundred to a thousand years you can stop
25:56 taking it whatever you want whenever you
25:57 think you want to start aging again and
25:59 die naturally you have that too
26:03 now obviously right off the bat you
26:05 could probably start fixing things left
26:07 and right pull all the patents that have
26:10 been hidden start fixing you know food
26:13 distribution wealth distribution you
26:15 know make sure there's jobs for everyone
26:17 out there maybe even erase money like
26:20 the guy in zeitgeist movie suggested
26:23 some mayor years are gonna go really
26:25 quickly some areas are gonna go really
26:27 slowly some are gonna want no change
26:31 even though they have hardships and
26:33 they're sort of barbaric because maybe
26:35 they live in a jungle and they're just
26:37 freaked out of us
26:39 the civilized world you start coming out
26:43 I'm like that weird little island
26:44 I forgot what is this outside India is
26:47 that where it is maybe now it's outside
26:50 New Zealand right or something like that
26:51 that weird island where some of you guys
26:54 are shouting at the screen right now
26:56 where they just having this crazy
26:58 indigenous I don't mean say crazy as in
26:59 crazy crazy but like just this wild
27:02 indigenous race of spear throwers and
27:05 they have killed tourists Tigana went
27:08 over there and acted like absolute
27:09 morons one of the explorers supposedly
27:11 raped one of their girls and they never
27:14 forgot it of course at one level I
27:18 totally support them right but they
27:19 don't want any cheese so maybe just
27:20 black that little area out say I don't
27:22 need to help those people it's good
27:24 they're good maybe your methodology is
27:26 to ask everyone what they want but then
27:30 again you can have citizens that
27:31 disagree and in comes chaos one person
27:37 thinks that another country should just
27:38 walk across the border and just cross
27:40 pop populate the other people go keep
27:43 them back because they got more land
27:45 than we do and they don't need our stuff
27:47 and Bubba pop wah then you have the old
27:50 and the new right the old and the young
27:52 I should say the young are going to come
27:54 up with different ideas they're gonna
27:55 grow straight up into hopefully or this
27:58 utopian experience while the old
27:59 remember the old days and they fear
28:01 oversight to the fear promises right
28:04 they can't have good news that's I know
28:06 plenty of friends of mine that you
28:08 cannot tell them any good news it's
28:09 unbelievable you can say this is getting
28:12 better and they're like no it's not
28:14 because if it's any better than
28:16 then they're lying you know and it's a
28:18 Wow something went on in that childhood
28:21 right everyone always betrayed them or
28:24 they're trying to be a martyr 24/7
28:26 that's that's an old little Ark you sit
28:29 down after the chaos starts to show its
28:32 ugly little algorithm and so you you're
28:38 smart you bring in your finest minds
28:40 whoever that is maybe it's a global
28:43 group one delegate ten delegates you
28:46 have a gigantic conference call and you
28:49 say folks we need to deal with this
28:50 chaos we have to have to have to figure
28:52 out a way to make everybody happy where
28:55 the human race and desiring different
28:58 things doesn't mean we're flawed it just
29:01 means we desire different things we have
29:02 all had different upbringings it's the
29:04 beauty of the world right beauty of
29:06 God's design is that there's so many
29:08 different paths we could take that we
29:12 don't recreate boredom necessarily
29:15 unless we covet boredom we covet the
29:19 same patterns and then we punish
29:20 everyone else because we're bored to
29:22 death what starts to happen in my mind
29:25 when I think about this is sort of a
29:30 taboo thing in our world starts to show
29:33 promise I don't know if this would ever
29:37 work I don't know if what I'm about to
29:38 say and believe me I know what I'm
29:40 saying is the absolutely countercultural
29:45 to what we are trying to do in the Great
29:47 Awakening is absolutely the counter goal
29:49 of what we're trying to do here and I'm
29:51 not suggesting we do it but I think we
29:54 have to talk about it and analyze it to
29:56 see why we wouldn't do it and again this
30:01 is in a fantasy universe where the the
30:04 bad people have all been eradicated
30:07 however that is whether or not their DNA
30:10 has been flushed from the world or
30:11 whether or not we have them in caverns
30:13 rotting or we've already buried them all
30:16 they're all of their DNA is gone we do
30:21 run the risk of it being recreated
30:22 through just your serendipity and we can
30:24 almost guarantee with 10 billion people
30:28 on the world
30:29 at least say we had a few more did this
30:32 kind of stuff will happen but we have to
30:33 be able to monitor and see then the hope
30:36 would be that education will bring that
30:39 number way way way down and especially
30:42 if we were to educate about corruption
30:44 that would be another big way to avoid
30:46 things we don't teach corruption do we
30:50 we don't teach the kids of the world
30:51 about bankers destroying everything when
30:56 you learn history in high school and
30:57 middle school they don't tell you the
30:59 victors right history
31:00 I mean maybe your teacher might have
31:02 said that but they don't really go into
31:03 it he or she is not allowed to do that
31:05 you can't teach compound interest in
31:09 high school you're supposed to get a
31:11 credit card ii 218 and then go bankrupt
31:13 immediately and then try to figure out
31:16 what you're gonna do with the rest of
31:17 your life as the world mandates you have
31:20 a card for this and a card for that but
31:24 here's the taboo thought what if a
31:27 computer a very powerful computer could
31:33 do at least data analysis on how to
31:37 satisfy chaos on the track it tracking
31:42 it's going to be super difficult
31:43 computers need big machine datasets to
31:45 figure out whether or not it can learn
31:48 from the data set the way the big
31:51 machine learning works is that you have
31:54 every possible metric you could study
31:57 hunger education suffering I mean
32:01 anything you can possibly conceive of as
32:03 the human condition which would be damn
32:05 near an infinite dataset and then second
32:08 to second as fast as you can bring in
32:10 the data on each individual where
32:12 they're physically located in the world
32:14 whether or not they're happy with their
32:15 life or whatever and if you figure out
32:18 they're unhappy why are they unhappy now
32:22 man manifests almost infinite bad habits
32:26 that a computer would not want to try to
32:29 correct for but it would want to figure
32:33 out I mentioned this little thing I'm
32:36 going to give you a little example
32:37 because I mentioned it several times on
32:38 different shows to demonstrate the human
32:41 psyche
32:43 either you or someone you know I think
32:48 every human being has done this without
32:49 you realize it consciously or not and
32:52 the incessant need to eat you will eat
32:56 every different type of food you can get
32:58 your hands on whether it's just from
33:00 your kitchen or all the restaurants the
33:02 fast food places sit-down restaurants
33:04 you know the richer you are the worse
33:06 this gets and you will expire your
33:10 desire for all food in the same moment
33:12 and such that you've got plenty money in
33:14 your pocket to anything in the world you
33:17 can go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant
33:19 with a Michelin star - or you could eat
33:22 at the local fast food place and you
33:24 don't want any of it because you're
33:26 bored of every single palate option that
33:28 you could have so it turns into nothing
33:31 more than a physical CC satiation of
33:35 your body I need to stop feeling hungry
33:37 so I'm gonna eat something I really
33:39 don't like and then you know what
33:41 actually ends up taking place is you
33:42 stop feeling hungry and you don't even
33:43 care what you eat it's almost every
33:45 single experience in your entire life no
33:47 matter how good the meal is so our
33:49 little a I actually it wouldn't
33:52 necessarily be an AI because we're not
33:55 looking to the computer to necessarily
33:57 make the decision we're looking to the
33:59 computer to help us gather data so that
34:02 we as human beings with full empathy and
34:04 intelligence and chaotic Captain Kirk
34:09 genes you know where we could actually
34:11 say you know I think we just need to go
34:13 over here completely different direction
34:14 and think that'll solve this problem now
34:16 that we're now that we know this data is
34:18 here but the world is a different place
34:20 there's no other hemisphere southern
34:22 hemisphere there's equator hemisphere
34:24 equator sorry countries that are very
34:26 warm northern hemisphere southern
34:29 hemisphere areas that are colder we have
34:32 coastal regions we have internal regions
34:34 we have a little bit internal on a
34:36 continent and then we have like the
34:37 Midwest of America where it's dead
34:41 center it's 1,500 miles in either
34:43 direction to hit the coast everyone has
34:46 different history they have cultural
34:50 history which is related to their
34:52 country their nationalistic barriers we
34:55 have foods that we
34:56 of that we don't want to disappear we
34:57 have styles of beer and clothing and art
35:01 and music that we don't want to
35:03 disappear so we don't want to streamline
35:06 the entire earth to this grey ball of
35:08 grey people where we are just you know
35:11 dressing in white sheets every day and
35:13 going to work wouldn't it maintain the
35:16 diversity but society isn't perfect so
35:23 if you've ever been that aunt or uncle
35:26 or grandmother or grandfather and you're
35:31 sort of passing down some wisdom to your
35:34 your offspring they'll be your
35:37 grandchildren or your children you will
35:40 have a situation especially as an elder
35:42 you'll have a young person come in and
35:44 they're just flustered to death you
35:45 write these all the time and sitcoms and
35:48 television shows and movies where the
35:50 kid is just completely chaotic about
35:52 something and you look at it from your
35:54 perspective it doesn't mean anything to
35:55 you but you try to empathize with that
35:59 situation you try to remember what it
36:01 was like when you were that young and if
36:05 you're really lucky you've got one
36:09 sentence you can say to calm the soul of
36:12 that child it's something that gives
36:14 them the higher altitude perspective of
36:17 the problem one of the worst things that
36:20 happens in America and again I think the
36:24 controller's love this is that our
36:26 children our males and our females and
36:29 doesn't matter what they think they are
36:32 they surrender their self-identity to
36:35 others the first thing they surrender to
36:39 is the group they get into a group thing
36:41 does everyone think that I look good do
36:44 I look pretty
36:45 did the clothes that I wore at a high
36:48 enough status that I'm going to be
36:50 treated properly in the in the tribe
36:52 right and then it goes down to a finer
36:55 level of granularity where we surrender
36:58 our opinion of ourself to someone we
37:01 fall in love with whether they know we
37:03 exist or not as irrelevant my daughter
37:06 was really young I said look there's
37:08 been a ton of studies in the world
37:10 prove that men typically on an emotional
37:13 level mature a lot slower than females
37:18 especially little boys because they're
37:20 all into their computers and their video
37:22 games and their Legos or whatever it is
37:25 but nothing's gonna stop a girl from
37:27 arbitrarily falling in love with that
37:29 boy and the girl is thinking about all
37:31 of the emotional aspects the right brain
37:33 part of it as the Egyptians beautifully
37:36 taught their people you go back a few
37:40 hundred years and you've got the
37:41 hunter-gathering thing which is the boys
37:43 responsibility get out there with your
37:44 father your uncle whatever and catch our
37:47 food don't care if it's a fish to
37:50 squirrel a deer you got to catch it in
37:52 Africa you're supposed to catch the
37:53 lion's mane I mean it's some ballsy
37:56 stuff right
37:57 so imagine surrending yourself to this
38:00 mechanical male who's going through a
38:01 rite of passage to prove that he has the
38:06 upper-body strength and the coordination
38:07 and the skills to prove himself as a
38:12 young man to the tribe he comes back to
38:15 the tribe and they say the girl comes at
38:19 ML you have such a nice smile I love
38:22 your eyes I love the sound of your voice
38:23 I like the way you'd like your big arms
38:26 or whatever it is and he's maybe
38:28 attracted to the girl but maybe before
38:30 he even gets to the point of falling in
38:31 love he's like what what are you talking
38:34 about my eyes you realize I almost died
38:37 today take him down a bison uh-huh you
38:41 know a boar of some sort I don't care
38:44 about my eye color I'm carrying all I
38:47 care about is what's gonna potentially
38:49 happen to me tomorrow am I gonna live or
38:51 die because the other day you know if
38:53 what's in his name son died because the
38:56 boar got him the lion ate his head or
38:58 whatever totally different priority set
39:01 in the modern era obviously it's a lot
39:05 different through the various addictions
39:09 for boys and the dictions for girls
39:10 whether you perceive yourself as one of
39:12 the other doesn't matter you could be
39:13 gay but you're just in the other pile
39:15 that's all saying piles same categories
39:18 of life I hope what's coming into focus
39:21 here
39:23 is it perhaps our goal for this blissful
39:28 world where all things are fixed one on
39:33 an academic level it seems unattainable
39:38 gene roddenberry Star Trek world Wow how
39:41 many evolutions of man are we gonna have
39:44 to go through before we can even
39:47 conceive of the Star Trek universe
39:49 there's no money we have conquered all
39:53 science there's still guys that you know
39:58 as Benjamin Cisco's father who ran the
40:01 the soul food joint in New Orleans I
40:05 think that's brilliant he's in the
40:07 future like what is it 400 years in the
40:10 future and he's taking care of a little
40:12 soul food joint Cisco can't wait to get
40:15 back to his dad's place his son can't
40:17 wait to go back well they're flying
40:19 around in spaceships conquering the
40:20 universe or you know he's doing deep
40:22 space 9 but you know those two living
40:27 side-by-side is a real interesting
40:28 concept because they seem to be the two
40:30 extremes now I'm seen it about every
40:35 Star Trek episode probably three to five
40:38 times and I don't remember any episodes
40:40 that really accounted for undiscovered
40:42 tribes on America at that point they're
40:45 sorry you know in America of the earth
40:47 at that point seems like everyone had
40:51 been discovered everyone had been
40:52 integrated I did a whole episode on Star
40:55 Trek and season one I believe and it
40:59 haunts me every day because I think that
41:01 is really the most clinical interesting
41:05 emotional at the same time it's clinical
41:07 left-brain right-brain
41:09 representation of Earth that we've ever
41:12 had in any fictional story in this
41:16 timeline and it seems as if that's a
41:20 goal I mean to me it seems like a little
41:22 cheese that if we got to that level it
41:25 doesn't mean there's not theft and
41:26 murder and all the other things that
41:28 happen in this world but man isn't that
41:30 really the most balanced version of
41:32 humanity that we have ever conceived of
41:37 me the answers yes but now when I think
41:41 about the chaos of human frailty and
41:46 imperfection a part of you know that our
41:50 mistakes make us who we are our
41:52 hardships make us who we are I'm going
41:55 to digress to make a point here
41:58 there is a animated Japanese series
42:00 which was just introduced to me I've
42:03 consumed it all now
42:04 it's called Evangelium it's on Netflix
42:07 the first 26 episodes are on Netflix and
42:10 then the two 45 minute movies that were
42:14 made after the series I think it was
42:16 started around 1995 I don't know how
42:18 many years it ran very amazing Japanese
42:24 anime I almost feel foolish that I'm
42:26 seeing this in 2019 when I could have
42:29 been seeing this in my mid-20s I just
42:31 didn't have any access to that even
42:33 though a lot of my video game friends
42:34 were just preaching jab anime but it was
42:37 always ghost in the shell or Kira or
42:39 something like that it wasn't even
42:42 Gilliam now after that they waited like
42:45 15 years or whatever at least 13 years
42:48 or something like that and they made so
42:50 far three movies that remake seemingly
42:53 remake the 26 episodes plus the two
42:56 little short movies the modern films at
43:03 least the first two the third one is
43:05 really strange and didn't turn me on
43:07 that much but the first two two-hour
43:11 films that were made in the more recent
43:13 since 2007 I believe are mind-blowing
43:18 animation and I mean wow how this
43:21 slipped by how people went oh go see
43:24 avatar but I'm not going to tell you
43:26 about Evangelium it's like man it is
43:29 brilliant but in the story okay which is
43:33 where I'm aiming at this it
43:37 it's where Pacific Rim stole everything
43:40 and I think respectfully so and I think
43:43 in the third film they stole something
43:44 from Pacific Rim to just go if you're
43:46 gonna steal our stuff we'll steal your
43:47 stuff I'm not going to tell you much of
43:49 the story but I'll say
43:50 there are these sort of robots called
43:54 Ava's the kids who are specifically 14
43:56 years old if they are proven to be able
43:59 to sync with the computer in the ava
44:02 they can operate it and just like
44:05 pacific rim' who stole everything from
44:07 Evangelium there are these big mm-hmm
44:13 they call them angels fall out of the
44:16 sky show up
44:17 and these kids driving these Ava's have
44:21 to destroy these angels and if you're
44:25 already sensing the bizarre symbology
44:30 there you're already on to the story but
44:34 this storyline deals with the entire
44:38 human race and its potential
44:43 eventualities based on plan a plan B
44:46 Plan C and the fact that the world
44:48 itself can't agree on what those plans
44:53 should be not all of the areas of the
44:55 world are informed about what the
44:57 eventualities could be I don't even
45:00 think that the full spectrum of what
45:02 these angels are is known to the entire
45:04 world but what's interesting about
45:07 evangelium is that through watching it
45:10 it will sort of boil up to the top your
45:16 personal perspective of where we are
45:18 what we are and what we could be it
45:21 deals with this human imperfection on a
45:24 level that is profound obviously dealing
45:28 with a bunch of fourteen year old kids
45:29 of which there is only three primary
45:32 kids eventually they toy with two others
45:36 but the main story is three of these
45:38 kids and boy this the conspiracies and
45:41 twists in this thing are never-ending
45:44 and the impact of the twist it's not
45:46 just that they reveal a twist in the
45:48 story it's it severely impacts
45:50 everything from that point for a really
45:53 good story turn the guy you made this is
45:56 an utter genius but it really got me
45:59 thinking I mean it really got me to look
46:01 at this whole thing from a much higher
46:03 perspective of
46:05 we are you know there's the whole
46:08 paradigm of carrying the symptom or
46:13 curing the cause we know that carrying
46:16 the symptom is only something that we
46:18 should do if the symptom is about to
46:20 kill the patient right well you
46:24 obviously are doing something in your
46:25 sick so let's get you unsick and then
46:28 let's figure out how you're getting sick
46:29 and let's stop the cause of the event
46:33 well it's not it amazing that I think
46:37 you could take some mid-level IQ human
46:40 beings who are still very smart and I'm
46:44 saying this to make a point that you
46:46 don't need Ober geniuses so I'm saying
46:48 us right we're in the middle between
46:50 super genius and normal person who's
46:53 asleep let's just put that way so if
46:55 you're part of the awakening I consider
46:56 you to be flying somewhere in the middle
46:58 on this range I think without much
47:03 debate like we got together and did a
47:06 think-tank I think in the first half
47:08 hour if I said write down first we
47:12 present all the problems in some
47:13 overhead projection of some sort and
47:16 then we say okay you all have a piece of
47:21 paper and a pin I want you to write down
47:23 the single thing that you think wouldn't
47:26 start addressing all of the issues that
47:29 are plugging the world the discourse
47:31 that we have between each other the fear
47:34 and xenophobia that we built between
47:36 individuals and again we don't
47:38 necessarily have to agree to distribute
47:40 every human being evenly around the
47:42 world we like going in different places
47:44 in seeing different architecture and
47:45 different traditions that's not the not
47:48 the point
47:49 what I'm trying to say but I think that
47:51 almost unanimously if not unanimously
47:55 everyone would write down education
47:58 education is the key now some of it
48:02 might be we would say okay now we're
48:04 going on education but what education a
48:07 lot of us would probably separate it and
48:10 I'm going to give it some crude
48:13 descriptors but I would say one of them
48:15 would be the physical and the other one
48:16 to be the metaphysical
48:17 what would be the physical I would say
48:20 the physical be reading writing and
48:21 arithmetic you got to know how to do
48:23 those three things the metaphysical
48:26 would be perhaps your being your edit
48:30 your ability to communicate with those
48:33 skills what are you going to say now
48:35 that you know how to say it what
48:36 solutions and equations are you're going
48:38 to try to solve now that you know how to
48:40 solve any equation etc etc each region
48:45 each individual group is going to
48:47 probably pick something different that
48:50 relates to their needs some are going to
48:53 pick things that are of their immediate
48:56 need you know they don't have a great
48:58 home so they want to build a better home
49:01 you only have certain supplies certain
49:03 supplies they can afford and certain
49:05 supplies to go and get their hands on so
49:07 they're gonna calculate something design
49:09 something that works with what they have
49:11 some people might create a great mud hut
49:13 some people might create a good wood
49:15 house some people like heard a good
49:16 girder reinforced cinder block a sand
49:19 filled soundproof foam it's gonna be
49:23 different some people are gonna want to
49:26 solve global problems like hunger basic
49:31 health comes after that you know
49:34 malnutrition is probably responsible for
49:36 almost every single ailment on planet
49:38 earth right even in the first world
49:41 where everyone seems to be catching
49:42 cancer like it's the cold I just talked
49:45 to a good friend of mine and we were
49:46 reviewing in fact ice talked to two
49:49 friends of mine in last 24 hours one of
49:51 my friends has developed a diet in
49:53 Hawaii and now he has saved life's over
49:59 there
49:59 and unintentionally he's gaining a
50:04 reputation among the locals and he's
50:07 trying to deal with it because he
50:08 doesn't really want to be and has never
50:11 wanted to be in the limelight of
50:13 anyone's consciousness he likes being a
50:16 recluse he's got a full family and all
50:17 million friends he's not like alone but
50:20 he likes to keep his world fairly
50:22 quarantined because though we can keep
50:23 it pure but his deeds are sort of
50:27 gaining his attention
50:29 so he's telling me his diet is curing
50:34 everyone of everything from cancer to
50:37 diabetes to lupus to all kinds of things
50:39 people in severe conditions about to die
50:42 are just being reversed I told him about
50:45 our experience on deep thoughts would be
50:47 17c Gershom all these other techniques
50:50 he was laughing his butt off because we
50:53 he and I hadn't talked in probably about
50:55 seven years and you know we're the same
50:59 kind of people were like we're Blood
51:02 Brothers and so we go off and do the
51:05 same thing because that's what we're
51:06 made out of our theme and life is the
51:07 same whoo knives were whoo knives which
51:12 I guess is Hawaiian for blood brother
51:14 but I talked to another friend of mine
51:16 here in LA and the subject of cancer
51:19 came up and he's like man he goes I have
51:22 so many friends of mine who have died a
51:24 cancer and he goes this wasn't the way
51:27 it was when I was a kid
51:28 my parents didn't lose all their friends
51:30 and their 40s to cancer and now it's
51:35 everywhere and he said very specifically
51:37 he said look he said the word thing
51:40 about it is that he goes my friends will
51:41 get diagnosed and they're dead within a
51:43 couple months use this stuff is super
51:46 aggressive and nobody knows they have it
51:48 until they have it and then poof they're
51:50 gone which is why you should take UC
51:53 time-release powdered Solera see every
51:56 day 1000 milligrams at least and
51:58 probably at least 100 milligrams would
52:01 be 17 every day chase it off every
52:04 single day of your life you know so
52:06 let's say you've got to this point in
52:08 the episode it's about an hour in and
52:13 you're you're on board with what I'm
52:15 saying yep society's super chaotic super
52:19 imperfect we're probably never gonna get
52:22 on the same page no matter how much we
52:24 succeed unless we become the Borg so how
52:28 do we perceive society now and do the
52:32 people that control the world have this
52:35 perception hundreds of years ago
52:37 thousands of years ago of course there's
52:39 scholars who got this you know
52:41 you know this the same number of years
52:43 ago you know they saw this a long time
52:45 ago
52:46 I know scholars that have observed this
52:50 sort of thing and gave up on a society
52:52 immediately or at least gave up on the
52:53 problem not necessarily blaming society
52:55 but saying well humans aren't perfect
52:58 there's a movement for transhumanism to
53:01 embed machines within man - hopefully
53:04 totally control humanity well any of you
53:08 that understand humanity and the fact
53:10 that we are Homo sapiens sapiens
53:13 humanism is going to undo humanity we
53:17 will cease to exist and we will become
53:19 machine kurtzweil is trying to map the
53:22 brain into a computer Elon Musk is right
53:26 there like I'm gonna do it first just
53:28 because I want to right so let's say
53:31 that you've lived quite a bit of life
53:33 already and so what you're able to do
53:35 with your life the remaining decades of
53:38 your life it's slightly compromised
53:41 because you're not a young
53:42 whippersnapper anymore so you think
53:46 about this whole thing by looking at
53:47 children and going wow you have a chance
53:51 but I can't get this big thought into
53:54 your mind because you're young there's
53:57 so much paradigm of understanding
54:00 humanity that you don't have which is
54:02 the base levels of this platform of
54:05 thinking that are going to take you a
54:07 couple decades if you're a gifted kid to
54:10 get into your brain such that you
54:11 understand imperfection and I think I
54:14 about probably over exaggerating they'd
54:15 be looking at a two-year-old for that to
54:17 be completely true but I think an
54:19 entry-level kid who's fairly awake at 18
54:22 could start thinking about this but
54:24 definitely 20 22 you could start
54:26 thinking about it and would it improve
54:28 society and our chances of success if
54:31 this conversation were to start entering
54:33 the consciousness of man we start having
54:36 these conversations and I want you to
54:39 know that when I make episodes like this
54:42 my hope for all of you and this is I
54:46 just put this way this is what I see in
54:47 my brain every time I tell you guys
54:49 something like this one I hope that
54:52 you've already had these conversations
54:53 and you're way beyond me
54:56 but if this is new to you any one of
54:58 these kind of existential concepts that
55:01 really control who we are who you are I
55:04 see you at dinner with your loved ones
55:06 whether it be your friends or your
55:08 immediate family and you're starting to
55:13 have these conversations maybe this
55:14 episode rings in your brain and you know
55:17 watch this crazy nut you know on YouTube
55:19 and he was talking about this and I
55:21 think it was really interesting because
55:22 I thought about it for a couple weeks
55:24 and now I've got some additional
55:25 thoughts he didn't mention maybe there
55:27 are some ways to address this or it just
55:30 kind of eats you up inside cuz you're
55:31 trying to solve it you see what I'm
55:33 saying
55:33 maybe you've already thought of this
55:35 again but you're trying to pick the
55:37 brain of the other person across the
55:38 table and you're like do you have any
55:40 ideas I mean let me just throw this at
55:42 you and see if you can just knee-jerk
55:43 something out that is someone relaxing
55:46 their mind taking the consciousness of
55:48 the universe and then poof there goes
55:49 the solution or a solution it gets to
55:53 the next level for the next solution we
55:57 know this whole technology Big Brother
56:02 thing is really scary isn't it because
56:06 we have all of these amazing solutions
56:08 that we could get into we could make
56:11 computers predict crime you know they
56:15 already do it but I mean we could really
56:16 make that we can make an AI that as long
56:19 as we give all of our information to it
56:21 and it's sequestered away from being
56:23 queried by random deep Staters then we
56:27 could potentially have an AI that even
56:30 runs on our phone runs on our local
56:32 system runs in some you know implant in
56:34 our brain or whatever and it simply sits
56:36 there and goes you're having this
56:38 thought and you're seem to be having
56:40 that thought a lot and this is all
56:41 private between you and the AI and
56:43 they're lying
56:43 you might try this because we've got a
56:47 million other case studies maybe a
56:49 billion other case studies of people who
56:51 went through this and just like a
56:53 computer that will play chess what is it
56:55 doing it is predicting the moves and
56:58 just playing the game forward it just
57:01 builds the whole game based on the last
57:03 turn that the human made to see how it
57:05 could beat the humans
57:07 the human opponent we could do that if
57:12 we could get the computers put together
57:14 such that they're private to us and
57:16 they're guaranteed by design to be I
57:19 don't know block change or whatever it
57:20 is to keep everyone else's noses out of
57:23 our business
57:25 but anyone who's a technician and the
57:27 hacker knows that well as long as long
57:29 as the informations being submitted and
57:31 transferred back to you it can be
57:32 duplicated into other databases where
57:35 they can start stealing the information
57:37 hence the surveillance state that we
57:39 live in today but isn't is sad that we
57:44 can't engage a solution let's just say
57:46 we could pull that off and I'm not
57:47 saying we have the complete know how to
57:50 pull that off but I think big machine
57:52 learning is amazing man I mean just the
57:55 statistical analysis of data and
57:57 prediction is phenomenal so we're going
58:03 to have to address the organic method at
58:06 the current state because we can't trust
58:09 the technological methods because man is
58:12 still allowing man to to have class
58:18 structure we're still allowing people to
58:21 be over us we have people committing
58:25 massive crimes on this planet some are
58:28 absolutely hideous and they're being
58:31 arrested slowly and I'm sure all the
58:34 ones that are super powerful we will sit
58:37 there and watch them go into court we
58:38 know certain people have done horrific
58:40 things in their lifetime we know it and
58:43 they're gonna go to court and because
58:45 they had a certain position in
58:47 government or they're rich they're gonna
58:50 walk and we're gonna know that they walk
58:53 and they're gonna get to live their full
58:55 life being a complete devilish person it
59:00 sucks but it's true right but one of the
59:03 little subplots of this episode is to
59:08 say are we ready to engage any of the
59:12 solutions based on the fact that this
59:14 isn't something we talk about on a
59:16 regular basis it'll talk about the
59:18 problems in a sophisticated manner do
59:21 so his man asleep at a different level
59:24 we knew we were asleep with history we
59:27 were asleep with conspiracy to control
59:29 the world that was the first sort of
59:32 kindergarten version of waking up and
59:35 then when you wake up to get to the next
59:37 level in the next level I think looks
59:40 like this episode it's definitely a
59:43 future stage I think we start to look at
59:47 our own frailty let me go geez what are
59:49 we gonna do about this we wouldn't want
59:53 God to come down and make us perfect
59:56 that would take away all free choice
60:00 that would take away a destiny that is
60:04 determined by you but now as we close
60:07 off this episode let's think about it
60:09 this way if you believe in a creator
60:13 then these sort of questions are sort of
60:16 like annoying and painful to consider
60:22 you know we had a listener report in on
60:27 an episode and he shared his current
60:30 life situation and he did all the right
60:36 things as a human being as far as we
60:38 know and he has been met with betrayal
60:42 at least twice in his little paragraph
60:45 and misfortune of the ultimate kind
60:49 losing a loved one and he said look man
60:53 my life is really messed up right now
60:55 right this very second and we've all
61:00 been in those situations to some degree
61:02 and it's hard not to think and I might
61:06 make an episode about this but let's
61:08 just put it on the end of this one that
61:09 bumper it up that your God has forsaken
61:12 you to suffering left you for this world
61:18 of pain now for those of you watch the
61:21 show a lot you know that I have an
61:23 episode on reincarnation and I perceive
61:26 suffering and death in a completely
61:27 different way but boy I find myself in
61:30 these situations or oh my god how can
61:32 you let these people do what they do
61:34 I mean yeah all these kids might
61:38 reincarnate who are you know part of
61:40 Epstein's little thing let's say if they
61:43 lost their life in the process but for
61:45 the ones that didn't lose their life
61:46 which i think is hopefully the majority
61:48 of them they live a scarred life and you
61:52 know scars lead to more scars the parent
61:55 who's an alcoholic who beats his kids
61:57 usually creates kids that drink alcohol
61:59 and beat their feet their beat their
62:01 kids or their wife's or whatever all the
62:02 above
62:03 and so that algorithm if you really play
62:09 it up it's a little frightening because
62:12 you think as a an astute observer of
62:17 society and of reality it could be this
62:24 psychological version of the flu now as
62:28 I've said several times on the show what
62:29 you need to know about overpopulation it
62:32 is an impossibility to be overpopulated
62:35 on any given island continent or planet
62:38 because influenza is an every living
62:41 being and it's dormant and the more that
62:44 influenza gets in contact with other
62:46 influenza dormant strands and more it
62:50 touches and touches and touches and
62:51 touches and touches in them more that
62:52 rapidly fires it transforms into a
62:56 deadly virus and kills off human beings
62:58 birds everything so maybe mm-hmm take
63:04 flu the way the flu virus works and take
63:07 evil and the way that that works the
63:11 fear would be that this evil virus
63:15 starts to spread all over the world we
63:19 start having evil as a standard and what
63:23 is what is formally viewed as being good
63:26 is now evil because it's against chaos
63:30 it's against suffering being happy is
63:33 the thing you're not allowed to be and
63:35 there's all kinds of fictional shows and
63:37 movies that portray this kind of world
63:40 which is why we have to work as human
63:43 beings to extinguish it suffering we
63:47 the first thing suffering comes in all
63:49 kinds of forms certain physical forms
63:52 are just starvation a lack of resources
63:56 some countries at least probably two
64:00 countries in one giant region of
64:02 overpopulated they need to handle their
64:04 own [ __ ] it's not up to us to go in
64:07 there go look you handle there's a rally
64:09 not your little herd over here or
64:11 hopefully flu gets hold it and does the
64:15 job for us but the flu is gonna take a
64:17 while before it really pops like that
64:19 it's gonna de massive lots of people but
64:21 these people start immigrating all
64:22 around the world to spread their problem
64:24 all around the world that's a like a
64:27 basic physical problem we worship all of
64:30 our substance abuse and what's
64:34 interesting about it is you know in my
64:36 life those that are alcoholic or drug
64:39 addicts of like super drugs not just
64:41 marijuana or something like that
64:43 know anyone who under under the
64:45 influence of weed that's ever been
64:46 anything more than maybe a little
64:48 annoying from you every once in a while
64:50 but sure people drink and they get happy
64:53 certainly people get drunk and get
64:57 really nasty and make a lot of comments
64:59 on my show when they get drunk and
65:02 obviously that's not a narc that that is
65:05 part of being good it's an arc of being
65:07 evil that's linked evil infiltrate your
65:09 body through a chemical abuse of the
65:11 mind and again there's that threshold
65:14 there's that little barrier in the sand
65:16 every time you drink you get closer to
65:18 that barrier and you can never go back
65:19 cuz you're blowing out your brain cells
65:21 so you go you go you go and eventually
65:23 you just you're past that point and
65:25 you're constantly mentally insane to
65:28 some degree and if being mentally insane
65:31 makes you drink more or do more drugs
65:33 then eventually you're gonna die and who
65:36 do you take out with you hopefully
65:38 nobody so we all have to look at what
65:41 we're doing and have a higher in
65:43 perspective what kind of frequency
65:45 you're gonna put into the world some
65:47 people live such constant life's of
65:50 suffering to no fault of their own that
65:54 they start manifesting their own demise
65:58 thus suffering
66:00 their own hand what would stop that
66:04 well education is a first stage and then
66:08 opportunity is the second stage they
66:11 have a skill and they can get employment
66:13 doing that skill hopefully it's one they
66:16 love right then they see the light and
66:19 then everytime they experience something
66:21 negative something that makes them feel
66:23 bad they look at themselves instead of
66:26 other people and so we start building up
66:30 a fabric that has got a strong
66:32 reinforcement against evil against those
66:36 that would do harm acts that would be
66:38 harmful to others
66:40 including themselves but when you think
66:43 about you know G OD in the middle of
66:45 this equation it's a tough one we all
66:48 believe that heaven is this place where
66:50 it's all going to be awesome and
66:51 wonderful okay let me oppose this little
66:55 question if God allows this place to
67:00 exist in its current chaotic suffering
67:02 state
67:03 why would heaven be different does God
67:07 have one set of rules for us and another
67:09 set of rules for heaven isn't it one of
67:12 these things where God can't be in the
67:14 same place with evil I think that's a
67:15 very generic naive statement but it's
67:20 all from a particular perspective but
67:23 why would he create a bunch of rules up
67:25 there that are like no none of that
67:26 stuff that you do down there and earth
67:28 could be done up here in heaven why dude
67:31 you've made both places if it's not good
67:35 enough for you up in heaven why the hell
67:36 did you let us sit down there and suffer
67:38 and on earth do you lose free will if
67:42 you go to heaven in the traditional
67:44 sense of the definition
67:45 god I hope 9 you will eat this you will
67:49 dress like this you will do this
67:50 profession welcome to we turn to you
67:52 [ __ ] you know I hope not
67:55 I've said it several times on this show
67:57 that my friends just a few of them
68:00 people have dated god bless him they do
68:04 believe in this dual existence that
68:07 we're in this suffering state in fact
68:08 they think that they're suffering in
68:10 there just trying to live a noble life
68:12 until the day they die
68:14 so they can go up to this other place
68:15 where no one can hurt them meaning they
68:19 can't be disappointed remember you could
68:21 be disappointed all by yourself without
68:22 anyone taking something away from you
68:24 that you think is yours right well I
68:27 thought heaven was gonna be this and it
68:29 certainly wasn't so now you're depressed
68:30 you're depressed in heaven right but now
68:35 what if you know like in my episode the
68:39 answer what if your whole goal our goal
68:44 is just we have to live like this
68:51 we have to deal with this imperfection
68:54 will man ever evolve to a point where
68:57 imperfection is not a quality of our
68:59 existence an attribute of our existence
69:02 hmm guess is as good as mine it would
69:08 seem we would get on the same page but
69:11 now you know we if you study the cabal's
69:15 of the world all these powerful families
69:18 that we need to eradicate off the face
69:20 of the planet disarmed including all
69:23 their apparatus to do this and we need
69:25 to we need to forbid their apparatus
69:27 from ever existing again oligarchy can't
69:29 exist in you anymore
69:31 aristocracy's and monarchs that can't
69:33 exist anymore they just can't you can
69:37 have wealth you just can't have the
69:39 power over other people because we're
69:41 gonna redo this place hopefully at some
69:42 point they participate and the under
69:48 educating of the entire world to stay in
69:50 power you're never to learn one thing
69:53 that they do which is called the scam
69:57 they have tons of them right our money
70:00 system is a scam all the reasons why we
70:02 hate each other on earth is a scam
70:05 everything that they do to touch the
70:07 world is a scam because it's always to
70:09 bring push us down and push themselves
70:11 up again you can't keep your money after
70:15 your family dies this government comes
70:17 and takes half of it inheritance tax
70:19 it's all around the world you're not
70:21 allowed to get rich boom-and-bust cycles
70:24 with those are so you can't get rich
70:27 there will be no wealthy people on
70:29 planet earth but they will also be the
70:33 ones that complain about those people
70:34 they have created the nuisance that they
70:37 hate you think Makran in France liked
70:40 all the protesters that went out and
70:42 protested against him now those are
70:44 educated awake people but they have
70:47 microns people and his whole Rothschild
70:49 group would call these people peasants
70:51 and sheep and cattle right cattle when
70:53 they have to go to war and their sheep
70:54 when they have to listen to public
70:56 policy they are creating our problems
71:01 and because we don't take them out of
71:03 power they continue and continue and
71:06 continue every leader of the free world
71:09 in any capacity at all should be going
71:13 up to podiums regularly and giving us
71:17 status updates about the educational
71:19 improvement of their respective region
71:21 of the world all these regions of the
71:24 world that have dictators well they need
71:26 to rise up and get rid of the dictators
71:28 and put in elected officials that don't
71:30 have billionaire estates right now some
71:34 billionaires seemingly care about their
71:37 people it's amazing and I guess you can
71:39 keep your billions as long as you
71:41 routinely demonstrate that you care
71:44 about your people and you routinely
71:45 truly improve their lives and sometimes
71:50 we just have growing pains Russia is a
71:55 really good example of amazing progress
71:58 if you see Moscow today oh my god in
72:02 saint-petersburg I don't I mean Monaco
72:05 leading these to lay down and take a nap
72:07 compared to these two cities these
72:08 cities are like booming on an economic
72:11 level that's creates a lot of Arab
72:12 countries have cities like this Dubai
72:15 and those various locations right but in
72:20 Russia I have learned over the last two
72:22 years that around 2008 to 2010 they they
72:29 had this sort of economic boom in such a
72:32 way that everyone could buy cars for the
72:34 first time brand-new cars beautiful cars
72:37 every single thing that Europe in
72:39 America has
72:40 they have right they have this little
72:42 box car that I call it the devil car it
72:43 so he's involved in like horrendous
72:45 accidents but their people got cars and
72:50 China suffers from this as well they got
72:53 cars when they're in the 30s 40s and 50s
72:55 and above right they never touched the
72:57 steering wheel in their life they never
72:59 touched a car in their life they didn't
73:01 grow up like Americans where we were
73:03 driving at 14 years old learning all the
73:05 rules learning of the do's and don'ts
73:07 having parents that also had the same
73:09 privilege back two or three generations
73:11 and so the instruction from our parents
73:13 and our grandparents was superb my dad
73:16 again when I was learning how to drive I
73:18 said this story two or three times this
73:21 is important I'm on my first drive in my
73:25 new car and my father is telling me
73:28 while you're driving cuz we're driving a
73:30 little country town and speed limits
73:31 thirty miles an hour thank God if it was
73:34 any faster than 30 miles an hour in this
73:36 one moment I would have killed a kid on
73:38 accident but my father says look I want
73:41 you to look underneath cars as you're
73:43 driving look underneath cars and I said
73:45 why he says you're gonna see footprints
73:47 are feet shadows of people behind cars
73:51 they're you know they're on the other
73:52 side of the car you're coming in from
73:53 the opposite angle this is always look
73:56 underneath cars because you're gonna see
73:57 someone who's about to walk out in front
73:59 of you as if an angel had given my
74:04 father that idea one of those red balls
74:07 that you get at grade school right goes
74:09 doing going in front of my car I look
74:12 underneath the car to my right and I see
74:14 the two little feet and I slam on the
74:17 brakes and this little kid runs right
74:19 out in front of my car I mean the
74:24 parents got the worst [ __ ] grade of
74:25 the day for you're not telling your kid
74:27 don't you run your ass out in pharma
74:29 Street this is like one of the busiest
74:30 streets in my own town which ain't
74:33 saying much but it was enough and this
74:35 kid literally is like and run phase
74:37 stopped in front of my car as the ball
74:39 continued to go across the street had I
74:43 been going any faster I would have
74:45 bumped into his body and who knows what
74:48 I would have happened right my childhood
74:49 friends got creamed by a Jeep when I was
74:52 in kindergarten he
74:54 but goddammit messed him up well sir if
74:56 ik thing I've ever seen as a child I
74:58 watched his kid's face get bashed in by
75:00 a jeep fender but Russia's dealing with
75:04 now between 2010 and 2009 teen they have
75:11 had a I think it's like five times the
75:13 vehicles now driving all over Russia and
75:15 so they're experiencing a massive amount
75:19 of car accidents and deaths related to
75:21 car accidents I mean if you just go up
75:23 Russia a car accident videos on YouTube
75:25 it will if you live in Europe or America
75:28 your mind will be blown at the amount of
75:32 ridiculous accidents that were
75:34 completely preventable by just the basic
75:36 rules of driving that these adults who
75:38 just got into a car for the first time
75:41 violated those rules and lost their
75:43 lives killed other people it's
75:46 horrendous and that is sort of a
75:49 physical version of the mental
75:52 metaphysical version of society that
75:54 we're dealing with today I've said for
75:57 over thirty years now because I felt
76:00 this as a young man I said the man is
76:03 just kidding himself about how civilized
76:05 he is and by by lying to himself gaining
76:11 a hubris about how sophisticated we are
76:13 we're incurring more suffering because
76:17 we're not cautious does that mean we
76:20 don't launch rockets and drive cars in
76:22 the desert and Mach two no you do all
76:24 those things but we calculate the risk
76:26 and we willing to accept the risks that
76:28 forget behind the wheels of these
76:30 vehicles right of these risks and life
76:34 but a lot of the repercussions of what
76:36 we're doing hurt other people and there
76:40 are individuals who are doing this who
76:41 are very wealthy we know and there are
76:44 countries that are seemingly not caring
76:47 about anything and they're gonna punish
76:49 the entire world for their their
76:51 craziness right again it was announced
76:54 just before the the Olympics that were
76:57 held at believe in Brazil or Argentina
77:00 or one of those two countries that they
77:03 had sold their whole rainforest
77:07 to the Chinese to be clear-cut and sent
77:11 to China to be stored now in China's
77:15 defense I do not know what their intent
77:16 is with the rain forest but you can't
77:18 cut the [ __ ] thing down without
77:20 totally destroying the entire ecosystem
77:22 which has taken however many billions of
77:25 years it took you know whenever we were
77:27 created who the hell knows because it
77:29 existed before we existed and so all
77:33 that life is going to disappear even if
77:35 you plant trees in its place unless
77:38 there's some very beautifully balanced
77:41 methodology which it won't be right
77:43 there's no way to make it economical
77:45 okay you're gonna cut down every other
77:47 tree like they do in Washington State
77:48 now maybe they have a master plan I
77:51 haven't heard it I did hear that in
77:53 China they got their army together and
77:55 they were planning like millions and
77:58 millions of trees I think that's awesome
78:00 keep going guys right please do that
78:02 with everything else you do but don't
78:03 clear-cut freakin your oxygen machine
78:06 and then at the Olympics during the
78:09 intro they complained about the fact
78:10 that global warming was real oh really
78:13 once you cut down all the [ __ ] things
78:15 that make co2 and oxygen that we use to
78:18 breathe you want to mess up the entire
78:19 atmosphere why don't you destroy the
78:21 atmosphere machines all over Earth
78:22 called trees and plants so we have some
78:26 ridiculous things that are going on that
78:29 we need to heighten the awareness of and
78:31 you know all these kids protesting all
78:34 the stupid crap I mean not not Paris
78:36 things those are good things but you
78:38 know stupid political party stuff it's
78:40 like guys get yourself a decent movement
78:43 and save the [ __ ] planet would you
78:45 because just pick an agenda and spare me
78:49 your global warming crap just preserve
78:51 Gaia Mother Earth as what she is bring
78:58 it back restore it protect it develop
79:01 the plants go get college degrees that
79:04 will figure out how China could cut down
79:06 the rainforests without hurting a single
79:07 turtle or a spider or whatever the hell
79:09 it is right I guess one of the last
79:12 imperfections we really have is our
79:14 mental imperfection to find the truth
79:16 right I mean that's one of the biggest
79:18 problems The Awakening is attempting
79:20 to find the truth we know we don't have
79:22 all the answers but man we at least have
79:24 a lot more answers than people that are
79:27 worried about how many inches their TV
79:29 is what series just got upgraded you
79:32 know whether or not Game of Thrones is
79:33 gonna spin off to a bunch of other
79:35 things my philosophy on that is enjoy
79:39 the sports game enjoy all those elective
79:41 things but when you go to sleep at night
79:44 please please make sure your report card
79:46 for the day has at least a few things
79:48 that could help Society maybe it's not
79:51 every single day but at least but the
79:52 end of the year you've got at least 50%
79:54 of your time is spent reinvesting in the
79:56 world that we live in in the brain
79:59 that's in your head in the conversation
80:01 you have with other people you know I'll
80:04 tell you the secret no shut up
80:06 this is what blows my mind I'll talk to
80:10 people all the time and it's like this
80:14 show and I will turn people's brains on
80:17 I'm just seeing it happen all the time
80:19 girls love this too by the way guys but
80:22 women it's gonna work the other way to
80:23 trust men and women you talk about stuff
80:25 on this kind of show to a dude if a guy
80:27 can be wet he'll be wet right but you
80:30 have intelligent interesting
80:32 conversations with people
80:34 beasts don't try to create a bunch of
80:36 negative negativity and discourse be
80:39 careful about how much you know
80:40 pedophilia stuff you throw out there
80:41 that subjects for your hardcore friends
80:44 right but just interesting things like
80:47 this subject matter and all kinds of
80:48 other things that you're thinking of
80:49 that I don't have any knowledge of you
80:52 will have one of the greatest
80:54 conversations of your life you'll feel
80:56 like you were alive for the moment you
80:58 had that conversation and the other
80:59 person will be so interested in you you
81:02 know I just told you about my buddy from
81:04 Hawaii he's fascinating he's amazing
81:08 every single thing that guy touch he's
81:10 like Midas's son you know and Sue's old
81:14 King Midas dies he's gonna be the
81:16 replacement that's what he is but he
81:18 digs me because he knows I do the same
81:20 exact thing we both have a good time no
81:23 matter for rich or poor doesn't matter
81:24 we're always doing something interesting
81:26 you can be that person if you're not
81:29 already that person if you are that
81:30 person keep going baby
81:32 keep going
81:34 but if you're not that person guess how
81:36 much it costs to become that person zero
81:39 you make the decision to be that person
81:42 there you go can't see you can't afford
81:45 it can't say you're too young or too old
81:48 doesn't matter I mean god of all the
81:52 people I've been in my lifetime the well
81:56 one it's always fascinating to talk to a
81:57 young kid who's just like totally awake
81:58 amazing I know a few kids that I've been
82:02 toward for over a decade those there's
82:06 prodigy children when they're my age
82:08 they're gonna put me to shame but
82:11 talking to an old wise man or an old
82:13 wise woman some Oracle making cookies in
82:15 the kitchen isn't that the best
82:18 experience ever well I think you should
82:21 pine to be that person if you're not
82:23 already that person but we all know we
82:25 can be better than we currently are
82:27 that's the fun part about this game we
82:29 have to live with imperfections but we
82:32 also need to have skin in the game so I
82:36 just want to put this in your brain
82:38 please conversate with other people
82:39 about this kind of stuff please and then
82:42 if you have any successes epiphanies
82:44 whatever write them in the comments
82:46 below if you're coming in from
82:48 audio-only you can't come into the
82:50 YouTube channel drop a comment get out
82:52 whatever yes we all hate the deep state
82:54 mechanisms what are you gonna do we have
82:57 a lakh Facebook group too but that
82:58 brings me to the next point if you
83:00 haven't been deep thoughts radio calm
83:01 please go it's not too pretty the site
83:04 in the room I should say that it has
83:05 been rebuilt with a template that helps
83:08 you find all the episodes easily there's
83:10 a search field now there are categories
83:12 for all the episodes of you know I don't
83:15 like all this other stuff but I like
83:16 these alien conversations and other
83:17 stuff you can click on the category and
83:19 boom you're set up I'm looking at the
83:21 statistics on a daily basis we're
83:23 literally breaking all the records set
83:26 in previous years previous days so it's
83:29 working it's good up there all the links
83:31 for video audio ways to donate to the
83:34 page or donate to the movement and we
83:36 have again our LOC Facebook group full
83:39 of some really awesome people we did get
83:42 a funny question today someone joined
83:43 and is the first comment was are you
83:46 guys a bunch of flat earthers
83:48 another Flat Earth Society the answer is
83:51 we're not anything or everything so
83:54 don't worry about it
83:55 sit down pull up a smoke whatever you
83:57 got to do your favorite PB&J and have
84:01 some fun it's all about really laughing
84:03 it absolutely all the chaos that's going
84:05 on I would say that probably out of all
84:07 the posts on a daily basis 60% are just
84:14 hilarious I want to give a shout out to
84:16 Dave our moderator on that page he has
84:20 been a blessing to the entire movement
84:22 he has his beliefs I have mine other
84:24 people have theirs but he is gracious
84:26 and beautiful on that page so super
84:29 shout out to Dave thank you so much for
84:31 being a big part of the page I guess now
84:32 for probably about two years so it would
84:35 be the same without him and I am off
84:37 busy he keeps the thing just bumpin so
84:40 if you see him commenting out there give
84:43 him a shout out because he's definitely
84:45 pouring his heart and soul into this
84:47 thing and he keeps everything
84:48 distributed - so he's not - one way or
84:50 the other but like I said the brother
84:53 find some of the funniest stuff we have
84:54 some really great memes coming in from
84:56 all of the listeners so maybe I'll do an
84:59 episode to say thanks to everyone at
85:01 some point there's also the link to the
85:04 new season 1 remastered if you just want
85:06 to binge that there's a whole separate
85:07 channel with the links on the top of the
85:09 website but if you see any of the season
85:12 1 on the website you're guaranteed to be
85:14 on the right feed people are still
85:16 ingesting the old videos and I respect
85:18 that but just know they're a lot better
85:19 on the season one I'm on both so when
85:23 you comment on either one of them I'm
85:24 right there tryin to reply I am
85:27 currently in July this is about the last
85:30 week of July way behind so I'll get to
85:36 all you guys eventually appreciate your
85:38 comments appreciate all your stuff but
85:41 until next time take care of yourself
85:42 and someone else I'm not seeing the next
85:44 deep thoughts over now
