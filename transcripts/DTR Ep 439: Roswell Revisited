00:31 all right ladies and gentlemen
00:33 so tonight I'm just debating which one
00:36 to do in my head
00:37 I think it's upper 50s low 60s tonight
00:42 you know what's funny about doing the
00:44 show is that obviously I have to draw
00:46 from things that interest me that
00:48 hopefully interest you but what's
00:52 interesting about it how the buzz word
00:55 is interesting
00:56 don't drink every time I say it the idea
00:59 is because we think about it and talk
01:03 about it to a deep level because the
01:05 episodes are an hour to two hours long
01:09 what's interesting is that we thoroughly
01:13 really destroy a topic I mean we really
01:15 get in there and make it happen and then
01:18 your comments follow up and you anything
01:20 I miss you guys harvest and I go make
01:22 another episode and elaborate and so
01:25 it's interesting I get you know I get
01:27 out here and I'm taken down to hell am I
01:29 gonna talk about I got this really big
01:31 yearning to do an episode I got a few
01:35 ideas you know I mean there's they're
01:38 subject matters right we have NASA we
01:41 have some alien stuff we have
01:43 self-improvement stuff which is very
01:46 near and dear to me because I grew up
01:47 with quite a bit of mentorship on how to
01:51 be a human being
01:52 which is part of the theme of some of
01:55 the self-improvement but a lot of it's
01:56 the mentoring that you never get from
01:58 anyone unless you're really really
02:00 fortunate so I try to pass anything
02:02 that's worked for me to you then we have
02:06 all the existential stuff which I've
02:08 done a tremendous amount right now I've
02:11 got 436 and 437 queued both of them and
02:15 II monetize automatically so I waiting
02:16 for the the review to come about the
02:21 patreon people already have it so
02:22 they're gonna be able to see it with no
02:24 ads on there and again it's all matter
02:29 of principle it's like come on guys they
02:32 automatically D monetize everything that
02:34 I upload then I have to wait like a
02:36 random amount of days before
02:39 they get in there and flip the switch I
02:41 mean these are like harmless subjects
02:43 you know maybe I see a dirty word but
02:45 come on they gotta kill it's kids
02:48 slinging you know fake feces and you
02:51 know women's sanitary products and
02:52 bathrooms getting full you know double
02:54 roll adds front and back and they you
02:57 know whether they actually been pretty
02:59 cool you know they allowed me to smoke
03:00 cigars
03:01 that's not killing it they allow me to
03:03 curse which you know I'm not doing it on
03:07 purpose it's just a little and fascist
03:09 on the subject matter and I'll tell you
03:12 what really fuels an episode a little
03:15 digression at the very beginning of this
03:17 you already know what the hell I'm doing
03:18 and I have no clue at this point we have
03:21 two episode ideas we'll throw them up
03:25 and flip the coin here in just a second
03:27 trying to see if pontificating at the
03:30 beginning will actually create a better
03:32 opportunity for both of us but the two
03:36 things that few of my episodes the most
03:39 is that I've had a day where I've been
03:41 writing all day and even though i've
03:45 seen some friends perhaps for dinner or
03:47 for a cigar you know the conversation
03:50 never really happened so nothing really
03:52 stimulating happen for me
03:54 and so it's just like you know anyone
03:56 who likes to work out every day if you
03:58 don't work out you want to do it so I
04:02 like to work out my brain it's just like
04:04 a absolutely mandatory thing so the flip
04:07 side of that is almost completely the
04:09 opposite type of day I've hung out with
04:10 friends we've cracked open some
04:14 interesting subjects we've had a good
04:16 discussion and then I realized that we
04:18 haven't discussed it on the show until I
04:21 come home and I'm like man I'm not
04:23 jotting him down in my phone you know on
04:25 my wunderlist app wow that's a great app
04:28 it's spelled like the German wonder W u
04:34 nder list it's great little app so the
04:38 two episodes I'm tossing around right
04:39 now is thinking big which is important
04:44 people you know they have big goals but
04:49 that first step that inception step is
04:51 always really tough
04:52 so I've got a lot of techniques to get
04:54 you to that level and to prepare for it
04:56 now obviously I've embedded a lot of
04:58 best subject matter in other episodes
05:00 but it's always kind of hodgepodge
05:03 e-statements and not a fully dedicated
05:05 indicated episode which is one thing I
05:08 like to do is kind of make 100 episodes
05:10 you touch on it a dozen times and and
05:12 within 100 episodes and then I'm like
05:14 okay we need to do one episode about
05:16 that subject the other one is managing
05:21 patterns we live in loops and those
05:28 loops are typically what can make our
05:32 life wonderful or make our life mundane
05:34 and like I said in that previous episode
05:37 which I can't wear what I called it but
05:38 it's the episode that the reason why
05:40 time speeds up for you as you get older
05:43 is that your patterns start to repeat so
05:45 badly that your life is completely
05:47 boring to your brain and that's why you
05:51 need to do something interesting
05:52 now folks that live the normal
05:55 traditional life of an American
05:57 Midwestern American you get married you
06:00 have two or three four five six ten kids
06:03 then you raise them they go out they
06:07 have their kids then you become a
06:09 grandparent you're so busy till the day
06:12 you die then they have kids you know you
06:14 have a great grandparent a great great
06:17 grandkids and then you just you expire
06:20 one day and you've lived a wonderful
06:22 life hopefully because we don't do that
06:24 we're able to now crawl inside of our
06:27 homes never go outside never walk
06:29 anywhere and never do anything and so
06:33 life can become boring so you need to be
06:35 aware that you have patterns that need
06:37 to be managed you need to actively
06:40 manage them change them if you're not if
06:44 you're totally content with your life
06:45 you don't need to do anything I'm
06:46 suggesting then they're subjects I want
06:49 to really really do but I'm still in the
06:52 middle of researching and then there's
06:54 subjects that are like SpaceX Elon Musk
06:58 in general this guy's a mystery his
07:02 companies are weird he does really cool
07:04 things
07:05 times he wins sometimes he fails I
07:07 totally support either way but there's a
07:11 weird thing you know we don't ever see
07:13 those boosters land by pedestrians right
07:15 pedestrians that are not allowed to see
07:17 that only you know staged folks and I
07:21 think I've only seen one landing film by
07:23 a pedestrian quasi but they're always
07:27 employees at NASA they're employees of
07:28 SpaceX and so you know what do you
07:32 believe right I think we beat up the
07:35 moon mission so much you know I have to
07:36 find another angle that a really good
07:38 run earlier this year so far or earlier
07:41 this season I don't want to sit there
07:44 and repeat myself I debate creating a
07:48 kind of variety version of a single show
07:51 and just bouncing all over the place
07:54 I've been watching a lot of stuff on
07:56 YouTube
07:57 interesting channels that do a fairly
07:59 decent job at things some that seem to
08:04 do they had a good idea and it's
08:07 executed you know poorly and so I think
08:10 I mean I could take that probably make
08:11 an hour and a half out of it easy some
08:14 of them are follow-ups that you know
08:18 what's really crawling up my back at
08:21 this point for a subject matter in the
08:23 interesting super interesting realm for
08:26 me is the Roswell crash because it's
08:29 this weird linchpin of history that is
08:36 it is you know they've always attacked
08:38 the Roswell crash and meet what I mean
08:42 by that is that they found this disc
08:44 embedded in the ground and man the story
08:46 has recently changed a lot like they
08:48 talk about what's really funny is the
08:50 people that are covering up the crash
08:52 constantly tell you that the individuals
08:55 who are the witnesses of it or the
08:58 second-hand witnesses from their
08:59 relatives they're the liars they're the
09:03 ones that changed all their stories but
09:05 the one that's really changing the story
09:06 is the government and so let's take
09:13 let's take was well today since the
09:16 original episode is doing really well
09:19 let's beat that up I got a big ass stick
09:21 so I gotta get creative with this one
09:25 somebody like you and I sitting on this
09:27 patio having the discussion just
09:29 shooting it back and forth and I'll
09:31 imagine your your questions and views so
09:39 just a little recap in case you haven't
09:40 seen the Roswell episode which is in
09:43 season 2 highly recommend you see it
09:46 because it will open your eyes now I do
09:48 want to say that I put all of the links
09:52 and I mean every single one that I use
09:54 to make the episode down in the
09:57 description and last time I edited the
09:59 description and tested those videos
10:02 probably 40 to 50 percent of them are on
10:05 channels that have been turned off and
10:08 it's not a video that's been disabled
10:11 due to copyright notice it has been
10:13 simply turned off it's that's the notice
10:16 I get and I've run into ones where they
10:18 have copyright strikes you've all seen
10:19 it right but in the summer of 1947
10:23 outside of Roswell New Mexico outside of
10:27 the Roswell Air Force Base a farmer
10:33 finds this disc crashed into the ground
10:36 now every single eyewitness that I have
10:38 ever heard talked about what state the
10:42 disc was in they've all been a hundred
10:46 percent consistent the only thing that's
10:48 different between their testimonies is
10:50 that they have one has seen more of the
10:53 details of its position in the ground
10:56 but I just watched something yesterday
10:59 which tried to insinuate that that
11:03 vehicle was embedded in the ground
11:04 several hundred feet I think the guy
11:07 said like 300 feet in the ground like it
11:09 was a big giant chasm in the ground that
11:13 is unequivocally not what everyone said
11:17 it had a ridge one side of it was
11:20 embedded in the dirt and it didn't seem
11:23 like they were saying that it was
11:25 embedded like halfway or something it
11:27 was just a part of the edge was in the
11:29 bridge or in the bridge excuse me and
11:31 that once
11:32 it had blown open but so you could kind
11:35 of see inside but it was pretty damaged
11:38 there's three survived well there's
11:40 three aliens they're ones dead very very
11:43 damaged burned up one is mortally
11:47 wounded and dying and will eventually
11:49 die and one appears completely fine and
11:54 he's tending to his buddies he has laid
11:56 out three little blankets that seemed to
11:58 be foil foil nature I'm considering that
12:02 we do the same thing for our
12:05 firefighters
12:05 we have foil for a lot of different
12:07 things because it reflects heat and all
12:09 this other stuff yeah you know first
12:12 family to run into the disc after the
12:15 farmer had found a bunch of debris was a
12:20 man his nephew I believe his brother and
12:24 his 8 year old kid like minimum minimum
12:29 group of people and there's a great
12:31 testimony from the eight-year-old kid
12:33 who gave testimony you know as he got
12:36 older and got older so he wouldn't
12:38 forget what he saw and he said that he
12:41 thought that the the alien was a was a
12:45 toy and so he went over and sat next to
12:50 it and put his hand on its left thigh
12:53 and as soon as he touched it it moved
12:56 because it's being touched and it
12:59 freaked him out he was like oh my god
13:01 this thing's alive runs behind his
13:03 father's leg grabs a leg you know
13:04 looking around the leg meanwhile his
13:07 father and his I think it's uncle we're
13:10 trying to talk to it in several
13:12 different languages on earth maybe like
13:14 two or three Spanish and French and
13:16 English I think within the nephews
13:19 running around looking at the craft the
13:23 craft an archaeologist shows up with
13:27 three or four or five students I think
13:29 and he and his students had seen it
13:31 crashed the night before and he speaks
13:34 like four to six languages or something
13:37 and he's going through that regiment
13:38 with the the alien and nothing's
13:42 happening the military find this thing
13:44 what do they do
13:46 they report in their newspaper not on
13:50 the cover page I think it's like page
13:52 three that they had found a flying
13:55 saucer from outer space and of course
14:00 the big brass find out and they're like
14:02 well you did what so then you have three
14:05 things that are happening here we have
14:08 obviously the ruling class they're like
14:11 this is all going to be coveted stuff
14:13 for us the cover story for the internal
14:17 staff is this will make the world panic
14:19 and the cover story for the outside
14:22 world is it's a weather balloon now the
14:25 sad sad sad thing is that of all the Air
14:30 Force bases on planet earth Roswell New
14:33 Mexico is Air Force Base is the key
14:37 cornerstone of weather balloon
14:39 development and deployment with
14:42 top-secret balloons that are sent way up
14:46 in the air weather balloons that are
14:48 sent up there with big sensors are
14:50 raised on them to sense echoes in space
14:52 if anyone detonates a nuclear bomb they
14:55 can kind of sense it at least that's the
14:57 story it's really believable because all
15:00 they have to do is put sensors up in the
15:02 sky while we're doing our testing which
15:07 you know area 51 was a gigantic nuclear
15:08 bomb test area before it became area 51
15:11 and so they see the the type of wave
15:14 that comes off of one of these things a
15:16 very unique wave that comes off of a
15:18 shock wave from an atom bomb or the TNT
15:21 bombs or whatever and so you just roll
15:25 that algorithm down if you sense even a
15:27 hint of this very specific wave someone
15:30 has done that in the world okay and it
15:33 makes sense but the one thing that these
15:35 individuals would never do is mistaken a
15:39 weather balloon for a flying saucer
15:43 how do weather balloons come down folks
15:46 how do they come down they go way way up
15:49 the atmospheric pressure no longer holds
15:52 the balloon together the hot air that's
15:56 in the balloon
15:57 finally ruptures the membrane
16:00 and all this electronics come back down
16:02 into the ground of course on a round
16:04 earth it would probably drift a really
16:06 far away from its launch point but in my
16:09 research this is what was interesting
16:12 the numbers vary but they're very high
16:15 the highest number I read was somewhere
16:17 in the low 80 percent rate of weather
16:20 balloons are never attempted to be
16:22 recovered they just go up and do
16:25 whatever they do they might fall in the
16:26 ocean they might fall in some farmer's
16:28 field they just wait for someone to
16:29 report something weird in their land and
16:32 then the military comes to scoops it up
16:33 a lot of times they said there's no
16:35 attempt to recover these things meaning
16:38 no operation ever happens the debris
16:40 falls wherever it falls and that's it
16:43 so they've got this thing and of course
16:48 you know you know when you touch this
16:50 third rail of Roswell
16:53 you get folks that are pragmatists and
16:57 they're like well nothing makes any
16:59 sense because we don't have other UFOs
17:01 anywhere else that they've seen so this
17:03 can't be UFO it has to be the weather
17:04 balloon or something else covert
17:06 aircraft then you have the more
17:08 elaborate new story that's been sort of
17:11 surfacing and I finally saw a very
17:13 detailed version of this other story and
17:16 it is probably as outrageous as Hitler
17:21 going down to the South Pole and
17:23 building a gigantic base in the South
17:26 Pole
17:26 meanwhile also waging one of the biggest
17:31 world wars per capita of a size of a
17:34 country in world history right you've
17:37 got X amount of Nazis X amount of people
17:40 that can be conscripted into his army
17:44 and he's got time to go down south and
17:46 put together this gigantic base yeah you
17:50 know if he did it would be something
17:51 that we would easily find down there
17:53 there wouldn't be this you know find the
17:57 dome wall talk to the dome owners if he
17:59 did that I doubt he would have lost the
18:01 war right I mean you would have
18:02 supernatural capabilities of some sort
18:04 and he wouldn't flood do when it
18:06 wouldn't have fled to Argentina he would
18:09 have fled outside this container of ours
18:12 right but the latest thing
18:14 this thing I've heard was just it's just
18:17 funny how again this really correlates
18:21 to the stuff we hear about the moon
18:24 missions the moon missions are
18:29 impossible with current 1969 technology
18:33 272 technology and probably 2019
18:36 technology so what they do des cleanse
18:40 it all to launder the lie it's to say
18:44 that alien bases were found on the moon
18:46 and alien alien alien and that appeals
18:48 to a whole other idea that we would love
18:51 to meet someone else in this universe
18:54 but because this face set is a lonely
18:56 universe when you find out that the
18:57 ignorant masses have allowed tyrannical
19:01 leaders to control us and then if you're
19:03 intelligent you know this is happening
19:05 you don't want it to happen but you know
19:07 you have to convince everyone that it's
19:09 happening when all the educational
19:11 systems are completely co-opted in
19:14 propagandized away from modern science
19:17 you don't even know Tesla exists until
19:20 you exit college yet so it's appealing
19:23 it's appealing to have the idea that
19:25 aliens are just right around the corner
19:26 and if we just you know send up the
19:28 right smoke signals or lead the right
19:31 writing in the soil and some Peruvian
19:33 desert floor that they're gonna go oh oh
19:36 they want us to land and talk to him now
19:37 okay let's do it you know but the latest
19:40 story I've heard is that Stalin man if
19:45 there's any place on earth that wasn't
19:46 sophisticated it was Russia at the time
19:50 of 1947 in terms of this sort of
19:53 technology that he had developed an
19:55 anti-gravity vehicle that he had been
19:58 conducting experiments on children to
20:02 make them look alien like and that they
20:07 flew this craft with these kids inside
20:10 which I guess our three children hybrid
20:13 to look weird hybrid it with what I
20:16 don't know and that they crashed it to
20:19 try and create mass panic within the
20:22 United States of America where could he
20:24 have even conceived of that theory
20:27 well we're gonna go through that just a
20:29 little bit cuz there's a bunch of logic
20:31 missing from the theory again these
20:32 things get thrown out there like aliens
20:35 on the moon and we found them well hey
20:36 let's just get to the moon first let's
20:38 get a platform that actually works with
20:40 1969 technology oops not so much we'll
20:43 forget your alien theory unless you're
20:45 sensing them through telescopes Stalin
20:49 if he had anti-gravity vehicles think
20:54 about it
20:54 Europe all democracy and CFO or real
20:59 whatever and that includes England or
21:03 Great Britain Australia and the United
21:06 States of America
21:07 and so Stalin is sitting there in a
21:10 communistic bubble trying to fight for
21:13 the doctrine of communism he wants to
21:17 win that doctrine of communism at any
21:19 cost you don't think the guy would
21:21 create a fleet of anti-gravity vehicles
21:25 and wipe out Europe and take more than
21:27 just half of Berlin and half of Germany
21:30 he would have wiped everything out in
21:33 fact you know if he was super smart
21:35 they were pretty brutal that dude was
21:37 really really brutal I mean maybe he
21:39 would kill absolutely everyone but he
21:42 would have if he's smart he just has to
21:45 land inside of Washington DC he needs to
21:48 land inside of London Paris Madrid and
21:53 just say look at me men we have 500 of
21:59 these vehicles with nuclear bombs in
22:02 them because man these things can lift
22:04 anything they're antigravity man it's
22:06 easy we could put a smart bomb in there
22:09 we could do whatever we want and we're
22:11 gonna blow you all up if you don't get
22:13 that you know if you don't surrender to
22:15 me
22:16 right now you're all gonna become a
22:17 communist country it's a great idea for
22:20 a video game but no he created this
22:23 craft put little creatures in it in the
22:25 defense mechanism to further the story I
22:29 mean in one level the the writing is not
22:31 too bad the writing is not too bad on
22:34 this little movie they've created to
22:35 keep the story going and it's
22:38 fascinating to me that people do sit at
22:40 home
22:41 and craft these stories are sitting some
22:43 government think tank to craft these
22:45 stories to basically disinfo the truth
22:47 and what's phenomenal is just you know
22:52 imagine me going into a studio in
22:54 Hollywood to pitch a film I go to my
22:57 agency or whatever pitch a film and it's
23:01 a you know it's a make-or-break moment
23:02 yeah yeah that's pretty good once you go
23:04 in write that or no thank you
23:06 we've got five of those scripts or we
23:08 don't really spaces done right we're
23:10 gonna lean off space for the next decade
23:12 okay but someone is going into a PSYOP
23:16 commander but he got on the air and
23:18 Roswell disinformation campaign oh you
23:21 got this only deal you know it's like
23:24 Stalin and he's got flying saucers with
23:27 genetically modified children oh I love
23:29 it
23:29 run with it okay but what they said was
23:33 because we smuggled in Nazis after World
23:35 War two that we smuggled in all these
23:39 Mengele guys and we had them also
23:43 creating hybrid human beings at the same
23:45 time again high birding with what I
23:48 don't know we do know that that sort of
23:52 island of was it dr. Moreau that kind of
23:57 stuff definitely has happened I
23:59 guarantee you they have mixed spiders
24:01 with humans they have done some crazy
24:04 crap probably reptilian lizards with
24:07 humans just to see what happened and a
24:10 real good example of that is the the
24:16 movie aliens for where Sigourney Weaver
24:20 goes in the room and finds them trying
24:22 to industrialize the creation of the
24:27 crazy alien thing and she has seized all
24:29 those jars and all those containers of
24:31 all the experiments that went wrong
24:34 probably somewhere there's that research
24:38 with a bunch of tanks of formaldehyde
24:41 and other preservatives containing these
24:44 pickled experiments for the sake of
24:48 their research you know well you just
24:50 literally have the recipe tied to the
24:52 jar in four parts
24:55 Spyder one part earthworm the rest of
24:57 its all human boy there you go you get
25:00 that thing right there the son of the
25:07 military guy that was sent out to
25:09 capture a bunch of this debris who
25:12 eventually said he you know met the
25:14 alien at the crash he's the one that
25:16 made the recording in his 70s he's got
25:20 no teeth he's talking about you know
25:23 having talked to the alien and that the
25:25 crazy thing is I went up to try and find
25:27 that video and I found a bunch of
25:28 truncated versions of the interview at
25:31 this location but they cut the part
25:35 where he said it told him two things one
25:39 he has conceded that he is stuck here on
25:42 earth and he said he felt really sad and
25:44 he said - don't worry no one's coming to
25:48 get us and he said it made him so sad
25:51 and here's the guy out there walking in
25:53 the desert at dusk and you could see he
25:57 was going through this emotion he was
26:00 starting to cry without crying you know
26:02 he was getting the choked up voice
26:03 glassy eyes because he was reliving the
26:05 the emotion because he felt sorry for
26:08 this little guy but the son of that dude
26:11 he was now in his 70s and wrote a book
26:14 finally and said like I'm married I'm
26:16 writing this book because I'm gonna die
26:17 soon and I want my story out there I
26:20 think he's a physician as well obviously
26:22 retired and his story just to recap is
26:26 that his father drove to the house got
26:28 him out of bed and had a little box of
26:30 the different types of plastic and steel
26:33 with the i-beams the live memes with the
26:35 writing on it which his father
26:38 transcribed for us so you can see it on
26:40 the internet but he threw it all over
26:42 the kitchen floor and told his son son
26:44 this is from a flying saucer this is
26:48 from an alien race
26:49 somewhere out there you will never see
26:52 this again because I have to turn this
26:54 in and they're gonna hide it but I
26:55 wanted you to see this now contrary to
26:59 some people retelling that story they
27:02 said that the kid was able to that he
27:07 attempted the experiment of crush
27:08 the steel that then had memory shapes
27:11 which we sort of have that today already
27:15 it was adults at the bridge game that
27:18 said that they were the ones that were
27:20 crushing it up it was adults the next
27:22 morning before all the evidence was
27:24 seized at around one o'clock in the
27:26 afternoon the next day they were the
27:28 ones playing with it they were the ones
27:30 trying to shoot bullets through it and
27:31 trying to disrupt this this foil that
27:34 was the thickness of the paper on a
27:37 cigarette because he used to use eggs
27:40 eggs back in the day in addition to
27:43 buying you know store factory-made ones
27:45 they still hold their own just go watch
27:47 just go watch The Maltese Falcon but he
27:50 said look since the late 70s all the way
27:53 up until present day he goes he will get
27:56 a call annually from someone in the
27:59 government who identifies themselves
28:02 remotely meaning not really you know the
28:06 heavy credentials says you're the guy
28:08 that was the son of this dude right yeah
28:10 yeah yeah you said you saw the debris
28:12 right yeah yeah now then they try to
28:15 brainwash him over the telephone now
28:17 isn't it really the case that you didn't
28:20 see an eye beam with writing embedded in
28:22 the steel that had purple reflections
28:25 isn't it true that you just saw tape
28:28 from like a game company like a physical
28:32 board game company coming out of New
28:34 York City and they've even sent him the
28:36 tape and he said you know now I know
28:41 what you're trying to do conversation
28:43 over see you later but he goes they've
28:45 been trying to brainwash me since he was
28:48 a young man to deny what he saw to clean
28:52 up the story
28:53 I mean why he doesn't just play into
28:56 their hands on the telephone
28:57 are you just oh yeah yeah probably you
29:00 know what you're probably right and they
29:01 just hang up the phone and go now you
29:03 don't need to call me anymore the tape
29:06 has been analyzed by a lot of people who
29:07 saw the real thing and they said look
29:09 this has nothing to do with that tape
29:11 the tape just so that you know is a very
29:15 flowery tape it's flowers in the tape
29:18 add the the flower has had like whole
29:20 you know like it was all
29:22 outlines like you're like a coloring
29:23 book whereas the i-beam with the purple
29:26 print on it was embossed and it's like
29:30 it for those of you who've ever
29:31 collected art or you're a welder when
29:34 you disrupt metal with heat you get this
29:37 sort of petroleum look because it
29:39 changes the frequency of light
29:40 reflecting off of the outer layer of the
29:44 steel used to be a big thing in the 80s
29:47 to get jewelry that had been you know
29:50 treated life like a blowtorch but he
29:54 said it looked nothing like the stuff
29:55 that I saw and again what's interesting
29:59 is this I beam with this print on it
30:06 seemed to be decorative and you can look
30:09 it up online you can look up the guys
30:11 sketch online hey try to crack it you
30:16 know be a little hieroglyph translator I
30:19 was just recalling this whole thing to a
30:21 friend of mine and when I really because
30:25 the one thing I never learned was that
30:26 Roswell was this hot this keep saying
30:29 hot-air balloon weather balloon spy
30:34 covert air force base the division was
30:37 made out of these people and it's just
30:41 good to remember that the dude who
30:43 gathered up all this stuff put a bunch
30:46 in the back of his pickup had a little
30:48 box full of it when he was he was
30:51 supposed to be running a bridge game
30:52 that night he failed to show up because
30:56 of the call but he did show up and the
31:00 guy that we ended up running the British
31:02 game that night he was like I swear to
31:04 god this guy was in his late 70s to
31:06 mid-80s recalling this story what's the
31:08 guy had to do to lie I mean he has no
31:10 motivation to lie whatsoever he said
31:13 look you know he came in with his box he
31:15 told us what he found we all looked at
31:19 it we all have incredibly technical
31:22 backgrounds and we definitely have all
31:25 knowledge about weather balloons
31:27 nothing existed in the world in weather
31:30 balloon research construction or
31:32 deployment that these individuals
31:35 including some women at this bridge game
31:39 and he says he's shown him the boxes got
31:43 a couple different plastics and three or
31:45 four different metals and they're
31:47 fascinated and they're in their life
31:49 they're happy they're happy that this
31:51 was discovered and so he said that's
31:55 nothing man you got to come out to my
31:56 truck I got a ton of this stuff big
31:59 pieces and so they all went out to his
32:01 truck all right and they were convinced
32:07 that this was real and that guy talked
32:09 about the next day going to work and
32:13 everyone's looking at the box of stuff
32:15 that's sitting on a desk in this kind of
32:17 big room and he said by again one
32:21 o'clock or so that afternoon blackseed
32:24 showed up and went had to sign the
32:26 secrecy Act which they already were on a
32:29 secrecy act but they had to sign one
32:30 that was 50 years secrecy act before
32:33 they could talk about it which is kind
32:35 of funny people were murdered who were
32:40 just secondhand folks as well as
32:42 firsthand folks you know that the poor
32:44 secretary woman who was watching the
32:46 desk at the Air Force Base or the
32:48 hospital week it was a hospital where
32:51 they were doing the autopsy of these two
32:54 that died the story goes that someone
32:57 came to her and said hey you want to see
32:58 something come on down the hallway I
33:00 took her down the hallway stay in the
33:02 door jamb and now watch this
33:04 they walked deep into the room open a
33:07 sheet go right there that is an alien
33:10 from another planet blink now what's
33:14 really interesting about Whitley
33:15 streamer's book called majestic the way
33:18 the book is written is that he claims
33:22 he's trying to be he's trying to be
33:26 alluring at the same time he's trying to
33:28 be mysterious he says that he arranged a
33:32 meeting with someone who was deep
33:33 involved in this project majestic aka
33:36 the Roswell crash I got the paper back
33:40 from a grocery store and it was
33:43 beautiful the cover was all foil so it
33:47 had you know like aluminum on the
33:48 front kind of thing right and it was
33:51 like a sprawled out gray on the ground
33:55 but he said he met with this old man in
33:58 the hotel motel and that which is kind
34:02 of ironic because a lot of the
34:03 interviews of these individuals who
34:04 claimed to have been a party's programs
34:07 it's always in some little motel but way
34:11 back in 1989-90 Whitley Strieber was
34:17 saying that the aliens looked like
34:20 hybrid children and he took it a whole
34:23 nother route
34:24 he said that Truman created the Central
34:27 Intelligence Agency agency as a direct
34:31 result of Roswell kind of funny those of
34:36 us who follow Skull and Bones know that
34:38 that's probably categorically not true
34:41 but then Whitley was going into in the
34:44 book if I remember it right was that
34:46 there were a tremendous amount of
34:48 unexplained pregnant women losing time
34:52 and finding themselves like walking home
34:54 from someplace because America was safe
34:57 back in the day I think the last one I
34:59 remember very vividly it's probably the
35:01 scariest one in his book as a woman it's
35:06 like I don't know she's six to nine
35:09 months pregnant she's walking home
35:11 probably not nine but she was abducted
35:14 her baby was taken from her by them and
35:18 that she ended up he prints like
35:21 articles and stuff in the book he even
35:24 prints what he book well what he claims
35:26 to be the autopsy report from the grey
35:31 again I think the first one was so
35:34 damaged that there wasn't a heck of a
35:35 lot you could get off of it but the
35:36 second one was fairly intact physically
35:40 but damaged enough that it died and the
35:44 third one supposedly lived a long time
35:47 and there's all kinds of stories about
35:49 him having a name than taking care of
35:52 the guy but he's printing these articles
35:55 that these women were known to be
35:56 pregnant by their OBGYN and all of a
36:00 sudden miraculously the
36:01 he's gone and you know delivering a
36:05 child after six months is going to be a
36:07 hell of an ordeal and probably not
36:10 something a woman's going to just say oh
36:12 it just disappeared
36:14 now consequently when he was writing his
36:16 other three books which was communion
36:20 transformation and breakthrough I
36:22 believe in that order
36:25 he really communicated that he was a
36:30 chosen one and that he was being
36:33 abducted constantly and that as part of
36:36 his abduction of course he's the one
36:39 that really launched the anal probe
36:41 thing and again think it through first
36:44 split-second people there is nothing
36:46 that can be gained through that
36:49 methodology that couldn't be gained
36:51 through every other means that didn't
36:55 involve such a thing I constantly joke
36:59 you may have had another love in his
37:01 life that that little story covered for
37:04 it no hun hun engaged any other rest
37:08 area activity is a lian's that are doing
37:10 it sure yeah but he said that routinely
37:16 an alien would come in fondle him in a
37:20 particular way to arouse him and then
37:22 within seconds he climaxed and produced
37:27 obviously his side of the genetic pool
37:29 so to speak and you know they wanted his
37:34 stuff okay you probably fall around the
37:37 average twelve-year-old and get the same
37:39 thing right he also claimed that you
37:42 know inside these vehicles after his
37:44 abduction he would see all kinds of
37:48 people in there with him
37:49 male female I don't know if he ever said
37:53 that there were young people or not but
37:56 his insinuation was that they were
37:58 harvesting reproductive materials from
38:03 humans and then you know conducting
38:06 experiments and was really weird about
38:09 that for me personally is that you have
38:13 this supposedly obviously
38:15 clean this claim that there's hyper
38:17 intelligent beings out there that want
38:20 to genetically splice and that they are
38:24 engaging in probably one of the most
38:26 risky plans on earth to do this I mean
38:31 yeah this is gonna sound like I'm joking
38:33 but I'm not joking
38:35 how many people routinely go to sperm
38:40 banks how many people if asked by their
38:44 government whether they be a covert
38:46 government employee Q clearance employee
38:48 or anything you can put a Craigslist
38:52 post on hey we're here we're engaging in
38:55 fertility experiments we need a constant
38:58 source of materials are and we'll pay
39:01 you for it you show up they evaluate you
39:05 psych psychologically the more
39:07 intelligent you are they eventually find
39:09 a professor that's willing to do this
39:10 and they lean into the guy really
39:12 quietly insane how'd you like to work
39:17 for us full-time will pay you way much
39:20 way more than this college is paying you
39:22 and all you got to do let's look at
39:24 girlie magazines or whatever turns you
39:26 on and your stuff is going to be given
39:31 directly to an alien race that we have
39:34 made contact with such that they can
39:37 create hybrids because there's a bigger
39:39 plan going where we're going to need to
39:42 be able to live on each other's planets
39:43 or whatever realms of existence man
39:47 dudes would line up left and right
39:49 you know can't say I would turn it down
39:52 and then the females
39:54 well how many women young girls do the
39:57 surrogate mother thing they are I mean
40:01 these in my in my experience of talking
40:05 to my friends that have used surrogate
40:07 mothers these are heroes these are women
40:09 that go in for a female that's unable to
40:12 carry a child and they take their body
40:15 through a nine-month pregnancy with all
40:19 the stretch marks all of ramifications
40:22 so that a family can have a child you
40:25 know they are getting compensated for
40:26 but come on what's what's your
40:29 you know health worse you know I mean
40:33 again it you know have young and you
40:34 know bounce back with that no one will
40:36 even know and you had a kid but I'm sure
40:38 some of these ladies you know they they
40:41 take on some scars for the rest of their
40:43 life and God bless them you know but I'm
40:46 sure that they would participate too
40:47 without all this abduction right without
40:50 all this anal probing if you need some
40:53 cellular tissue from that region of the
40:56 body well how many people do
40:58 colonoscopies just as a little check
40:59 checksum to then get scammed by
41:02 oncologists you know there's no need for
41:04 that just like there would be no need to
41:07 mutilate a cow I just leave it there it
41:12 happens I think it's at a very man-made
41:14 thing to check the radioactivity
41:16 absorption of all the testing that we
41:18 did they scooped out the mouth they
41:21 scooped out the rectum and they checked
41:24 to see radiation on lip tissue soft
41:26 tissue and radiation at the exit point
41:28 entry point exit point and they can do
41:31 some very basic math on the isotope
41:34 counts and say this this is the ratio of
41:37 absorption 1 this is what's still
41:40 occurring at feeding time from grazing
41:44 on grass or whatever and this is what's
41:47 exiting out the back so whatever's
41:49 missing is what's being absorbed by the
41:51 animal but now why wouldn't the
41:54 government just go up to a cattle
41:55 rancher I have one of my family and just
41:59 buy buy a cow buy an old cow you know
42:03 and just take it off and do a test you
42:08 don't need to create all this mystery
42:09 all this weird mutilation which then you
42:13 know drums up a bunch of conspiracy
42:14 theories and fear that can be linked to
42:17 anything great if they're not gonna tell
42:21 us about aliens because we're so fragile
42:24 then what are you doing you know leaving
42:26 cattle out in a field all mutilated that
42:29 makes no sense you're not solving the
42:31 problem you're creating the problem
42:33 right but it's interesting because you
42:38 know we do have this bizarre area 51
42:43 which just had the recent funny little
42:46 you know thing where everyone was
42:47 supposed to rush the joint I'm willing
42:51 to bet that changed a few things I'm
42:53 willing to bet some money was spent
42:55 that's gonna change that whole place I
42:58 wouldn't be surprised if in 10 years 51
43:01 is just dormant no one's there anymore
43:05 then there's video games that have
43:07 actually taken it to the next level I
43:09 think Deus Ex did a brilliant job where
43:14 it's all underground well we know
43:17 there's underground bases Colorado's Air
43:19 Force Base goes down into the 20s
43:22 there's over 20 floors underneath that
43:24 place it's either 23 or 27 I can't
43:27 remember but a family member of mine
43:29 worked there and she only had
43:31 authorization to go to three alright
43:35 it's not like we're all gonna crap
43:37 ourselves because our government has
43:38 some places that they want to keep safe
43:40 I mean I'm kind of glad that if we ever
43:42 get this formula right that someone
43:44 can't just wipe everything out that
43:47 they're like yeah we're so far down on
43:48 the ground no one could touch us I think
43:50 that's good right it's so mysterious
43:53 isn't it I mean it's so alluring to
43:56 think that we've made contact with some
44:00 alien race and you know there's all
44:02 these stories where you have Truman -
44:05 Eisenhower is really really gets
44:07 interesting and it gets interesting
44:08 again with Jimmy Carter so Truman is
44:11 supposedly again creating the
44:12 Intelligence Agency because they have to
44:15 manage this thing where human beings are
44:18 having their children stolen the
44:20 potentially human beings are being
44:21 abducted permanently and then you have
44:24 the stories of eisenhower again no one
44:27 can confirm anything but there's that
44:30 old man I think he's got the oxygen
44:32 tubes in his nose and he said that he
44:34 was he was kind of a mid-tier Q
44:39 clearance guy who had access to area 51
44:42 but the president didn't have access I
44:44 don't believe any President United
44:45 States has been allowed to enter area 51
44:48 once and you know I don't know how much
44:52 I support that can't the commander in
44:53 chief go in there I don't necessarily
44:55 need to go in there
44:56 as much as I'd like to but come on the
44:59 commander in chief please he's sitting
45:00 inside the war room and he's like yeah I
45:02 take that covert aircraft and go deploy
45:04 it and do this covert thing but he can't
45:05 go and visit where it's in the garage
45:07 you know or the new one that's being
45:08 built but this guy and I forgot his name
45:12 he he said that he went there on behalf
45:17 of Eisenhower who said to him this is
45:22 the claim from this guy that he said
45:24 that Eisenhower said if you don't let
45:26 him in this middleman guy but Eisenhower
45:30 is gonna put the military right there on
45:33 the border of 51 and roll over the whole
45:35 joint and open the whole thing up and
45:37 there will be no more secrets and so
45:40 they were like okay you can come in but
45:43 the guy said he was taken in I'll get
45:47 the highlights of the story correct but
45:49 he said he went into this facility and
45:52 the guy that he was supposed to meet was
45:56 in a room talking to one of these
45:59 creatures it was being so I shouldn't
46:02 call creatures but beings and neighbors
46:04 having a conversation just then you know
46:06 how's it going Bob nanu-nanu you know
46:09 and I guess they learned how to speak at
46:11 some point but he had to wait for that
46:15 guy to finish the meeting before he was
46:16 able to have a conversation and so he
46:19 finds out that we have this contact with
46:21 the Saleen race and takes it back to
46:23 Eisenhower and I guess Eisenhower's cool
46:25 I don't need to meet these aliens
46:28 imagine your commander in chief and
46:30 someone says to you we talked to aliens
46:33 on a daily basis they are within our
46:35 midst
46:35 they're nice we got all these covert
46:40 programs with them and the commander in
46:42 chief goes I'm okay not having any say
46:44 in this I'm okay never meeting these
46:46 things Jimmy Carter is famous for having
46:50 in his first few months in office as I
46:52 was told the story he is flying over 51
46:56 or by 51 and he wanted Air Force One
47:00 just to just land right there at 51 they
47:05 make the radio calls down and he has
47:07 been denied access and that was the last
47:10 of it
47:11 several presidents have talked about
47:13 their first day in office really their
47:15 first three days in office and then in
47:17 those three days the entire world looks
47:21 like a different place because they get
47:23 briefed on what's really going on in the
47:26 world someone told me that actually
47:30 Barack Obama of all people took some
47:33 interview either in paper or video must
47:36 have been paper I don't know and claimed
47:38 that that was like the most sobering
47:40 moment of his life I've never been able
47:43 to find a reference to that so if
47:44 anyone's ever heard that story please
47:46 link it below because I would love to
47:49 read the claims of what he said there
47:52 was nothing related anything you know
47:54 alien based but he's been asked several
47:57 times I think on the Jimmy Fallon show
47:59 you know do aliens exist and of course
48:01 he gives these kind of funny answers
48:04 Trump has already said you know I think
48:07 not but you know we'll see I think
48:10 that's interesting
48:12 there is the of course the ongoing rumor
48:17 that as soon as they mastered the
48:21 illusion of landing on the moon that
48:23 according to von Braun's secretary who
48:26 has a PhD as well that he warned her
48:29 that there was a plan to do a fake alien
48:33 invasion we've talked about it on the
48:35 show I think I did a full Episode on it
48:36 and you know I think the 17 dude has
48:41 even talked about it you know beware of
48:42 this claim if they ever tried to do it
48:45 and look what's going on last two years
48:48 / three years the amount of Declassified
48:51 UFO stuff is starting to just tumble out
48:54 like crazy and some of it is like here's
48:57 a video of a thing totally not from this
49:00 world
49:00 it's intelligently designed it's
49:02 intelligently flying around so obviously
49:04 it's not some anomaly and then you have
49:07 you know the I think the super flow fake
49:12 military response well that was not
49:14 supposed to be released and you know
49:16 you're not supposed to have that on your
49:17 computer just to kind of make you want
49:18 it really bad and you know we all know
49:22 that art students
49:23 lots of fake UFO videos there's this
49:26 weird page as someone has this awful
49:30 website that I found once which I
49:31 bookmark because it was so awfully good
49:33 and they harvest all that stuff they
49:36 harvest you know CG students doing
49:39 things you can just tell you know once
49:40 you play with CG software like I did to
49:42 make the intro you know what the
49:46 volumetric particle systems can do what
49:49 the smoke systems can do and my god
49:51 like I've said to you guys blender which
49:53 just released 2.81 this week it's so
49:57 unbelievable what you can do in your
49:59 home on a laptop you could have a
50:01 12-inch laptop and create you know 4k
50:06 movies negatives that no one could deny
50:10 but when you really educate your eye one
50:14 of the things that you have to do and I
50:15 thought about creating an episode where
50:17 I do it in front of you I show you how
50:19 we model something together and I was
50:22 thinking about doing it with them an
50:23 episode I've already recorded I might I
50:27 might just do some overlays but just
50:31 show you what I did to make the intro
50:33 but the big telltale sign if you educate
50:37 your eyeball
50:38 it's called tracking so you say you
50:42 credit UFO you can go out anywhere in
50:46 the world and just take your camera on
50:47 your phone put it the highest or as you
50:49 possibly can it's probably a good idea
50:51 and then you can just film just hold the
50:54 camera and you could actually in your
50:56 head go okay I'm gonna do this is the
50:59 UFO is gonna come around that building
51:00 hover and then move really slow and then
51:04 it'll go off into space alright I'll
51:08 give you the thumbnail version how it's
51:10 done you just take blender 3d which is
51:14 free at blender.org everybody's
51:16 interested you get a copy you upload
51:20 your phone footage into it it turns into
51:21 a frame-by-frame movie and they have
51:24 this beautiful video editor inside once
51:27 you've got it in there then you can go
51:30 to the first frame select anything in
51:32 the frame if you're supposed to select
51:33 about I think minimum of four things
51:35 would you can select hundreds of things
51:37 even have an automatic feature which
51:39 you'll find it'll study the video and
51:40 find everything it's stable and not you
51:44 know flex um pom moving or something and
51:48 it automatically tracks the shot meaning
51:50 it figures out from where you were
51:52 standing you moved a little bit with the
51:54 camera you panned it in a certain kind
51:57 of way to even tell it how you moved
51:58 your camera whether or not you tilted it
52:00 Pandit tracked it like a like a dolly
52:03 shot where it moved it figures
52:05 everything out and now it's ready for
52:07 your 3d object you put your ship where
52:11 you want it and you just animate it you
52:12 move it from Waypoint to Waypoint and
52:14 when it from here to here in so many
52:15 seconds you can rotate it whatever you
52:18 want to do you can do all this kind of
52:19 stuff I change the intro and no one ever
52:21 said anything the UFO now does a little
52:23 bit of an adjustment before it lands
52:25 it's been out there for five episodes at
52:28 least no one ever said anything it's
52:30 kind of funny but you get your move down
52:33 and again the smaller you make it the
52:36 more it's just a little blip of light
52:37 that's unexplainable it's even better
52:40 and you know one can say well look at
52:42 that window that looks dumb look at that
52:43 thing it looks dumb there's too much
52:45 reflection here you're blah blah blah
52:46 just make it a white thing then once you
52:49 have it all figured out
52:51 the only problem you have is you want it
52:53 to go behind objects right if you only
52:56 want to get elaborate with it you could
52:57 create some wild s-shape flying pattern
53:01 where it's going between poles and all
53:03 kinds of stuff you can do whatever you
53:05 want because inside blender everything
53:09 is in 3d all of a sudden and now you
53:10 have to just make the buildings and
53:16 every obstacle flagpole whatever a car
53:18 just real generically and then you tell
53:22 blender that's a mask subtract that out
53:26 of the UFO shot that's going to be
53:30 animated sorry I ran out of lighter
53:34 fluid once you got it all set up you can
53:38 scrub the playhead you'll see it perform
53:40 the way you want it to perform you make
53:42 adjustments and again less is more in
53:45 these shots right less detail and then
53:48 you just say render
53:50 and that thing will put out either a
53:52 composite of both layers with your video
53:55 and the UFO or you can do the UFO
53:56 separate use Photoshop or Die Photoshop
53:59 but final cut or premiere to composite
54:02 everything together you can at that
54:05 point if you separate separate the two
54:07 layers then you can do color correction
54:08 on your UFO separately it's easy man
54:12 it's so simple and you can shake your
54:15 camera around go nuts and it'll figure
54:18 it out however if you get anything off
54:22 if the tracking is off one pixel in one
54:25 frame to another frame an educated I
54:28 will see it and you can see it without
54:32 being a big CG expert you can see it
54:35 because you see things move every single
54:37 day you see planes land all the time fly
54:40 by all the time and they don't kind of
54:41 float you know they're moving in a
54:44 straight line and there's nothing that
54:46 can change that so even you know some
54:48 horrific situation right but there's two
54:51 things that are blowing my mind right
54:52 now that I think are very wonderfully
54:56 suspect one is again and I mentioned
55:00 this a couple times I want this to kind
55:02 of start becoming something that you
55:03 talk about and something you'd think
55:05 about if nothing else which is you know
55:09 it's like every month now some meteorite
55:13 of an exact shape and size is now coming
55:17 at Earth and it's going to swing by
55:19 earth at this particular altitude and
55:22 whatever it's you know it's not a
55:25 threatening thing it is a threatening
55:27 thing sometimes they seem to know
55:30 exactly how it's gonna be and other
55:32 times they're like it might hit earth
55:33 you know it's one of those kind of
55:34 things usually it's not gonna hit earth
55:38 99% of the time and their predictions
55:40 because if it did then you create mass
55:42 panic all NASA wants is money from you
55:45 through a rationale in your mind that
55:48 you need them to help out even though
55:51 there's nothing they could do besides
55:53 get people evacuated from an area but
55:56 you know look at the claim of the
55:59 volcano eruption in in Arizona which
56:02 they say is a
56:03 a meteorite hitting earth about the size
56:06 of a bus again
56:08 looks just like Diamond Head in Hawaii
56:11 which is most certainly a volcano crater
56:14 lake is a volcano and it's funny I could
56:18 talk to people or experts and I say
56:20 that's not a crater and they'll go yeah
56:23 it is it's definitely well they'll say
56:24 yeah it's not a meteorite yes it is
56:26 definitely mean write-ups and they're
56:27 going and why do you think that well
56:31 they told me it's like okay you haven't
56:33 been there to see anything and they
56:35 might say well there's a lot of iron
56:36 rock everywhere and that's what
56:38 meteorites are made of all right
56:40 maybe maybe all the meteorites in the
56:43 desert which I you know I told you
56:45 several times or the clubs that go out
56:47 and look for it maybe all it is is
56:49 volcanic residual that thing in Arizona
56:53 blew up so much that it's a mile across
56:55 half a mile down three miles around
56:57 diamonds even bigger whatever made
57:00 Diamond Head I think you could probably
57:03 see at North America after it exploded
57:05 it would have been Gigantor what do you
57:08 think the bowels of the earth or I mean
57:11 up you know over the plasma ball I mean
57:13 the crust down there is probably fairly
57:14 primitive but doesn't have a lot of
57:17 mixture down there a lot of super-heavy
57:20 particles if you know of a complex
57:24 composite right maybe I'm wrong I don't
57:28 know but the UFO thing is starting to
57:32 explode and you know again the the
57:37 insinuation that here we are I don't
57:39 know if you really think of the Day the
57:42 Earth Stood Still which is a movie made
57:44 in 1951 with the War of the Worlds which
57:46 did cause problems in 38 but they were
57:48 telling everybody on the radio that they
57:49 were here that's a little bit different
57:52 than the show you're going to pay to see
57:55 a movie right but you know Forbidden
57:58 Planet I'll add would stuff all of the
58:01 space shows that came out of the 60s and
58:03 then we've just been had space shows
58:05 since the 60s I mean always had one on
58:07 TV but he had Buck Rogers before that X
58:10 minus one mm plus radio shows and in the
58:13 50s again people are tuning into a
58:15 fictional show
58:17 but we're now approaching a hundred
58:21 years of belief in aliens at least in
58:25 theory for sure and they're towing this
58:29 line that if we learn that they exist
58:31 that we're all gonna freak out
58:32 who's gonna freak out who's alive today
58:36 who's gonna freak out I don't think
58:39 anyone's alive today that'll freak out
58:41 what do you think the difference is for
58:44 say an undiscovered tribe in Peru an
58:46 undiscovered tribe and say the Brazilian
58:50 rainforest or in that little island
58:53 north of Australia north of New Zealand
58:58 what's the difference between them
59:00 seeing a helicopter land and a UFO land
59:03 the only difference would be and I'm not
59:06 even sure what I'm about to say is a big
59:08 difference for these folks if an alien
59:11 got out what do you think a white man
59:14 looks like to some sort of you know
59:18 black culture of a man a race of man
59:22 that has never seen a white guy before
59:24 it's probably around the same thing as
59:27 long as they don't shoot death rays and
59:28 kill people they always said that Native
59:32 Americans when the conquistadors came
59:35 over and their ships well he didn't have
59:38 anything they could travel on water like
59:39 that you know big ocean water well they
59:43 thought they were gods for a little bit
59:45 until God was a not-so-nice dude I mean
59:52 imagine that little funny story
59:54 scientists discover some they make first
59:58 contact with some undiscovered tribe and
60:00 they get in there and all the artwork is
60:02 all alien stuff which there are
60:04 definitely evidence of that in history
60:07 but maybe they're just walking around
60:09 with the aliens you know they're
60:12 tracking alien spacecraft and they go
60:15 there you know where they're used to
60:16 going into modern societies let's just
60:18 say the fictional stories are the
60:19 specialty let's just say the stories are
60:21 correct I shouldn't judge and I've heard
60:24 some that are very believable we have
60:27 you know modern men finding a UFO and
60:29 then of course that
60:30 military guys show up and this is what
60:31 happened at Roswell I was a redhead guy
60:34 and a black guy that redhead white guy
60:35 was completely mean and ridiculous like
60:38 I was reasonable and it was like cussing
60:41 up a storm at a time when that wasn't
60:42 really you know in folk but they show up
60:46 and it's a primitive tribe going do
60:49 what's your problem these are our
60:51 friends they come from the stars look at
60:54 this little anti-gravity Rock I made you
60:56 know they wanted to learn about us
60:58 they'd probably go as some primitive
60:59 tribe to avoid all the problems I mean I
61:02 think I would wouldn't you
61:04 having at least one friend who's very
61:10 well-educated and agreed in sort of you
61:15 know geological world history it's
61:19 interesting how you know the the idea
61:22 that man has only been on this planet
61:25 for a really short period of time like
61:28 5,000 years I mean there's some
61:29 geologists think we've only been here in
61:32 any level of sophistication and Homo
61:33 Sapien sabian level less than 10,000
61:36 years it's mind-blowing you're like what
61:39 you know I mean we have recorded history
61:42 and in Africa that goes back 40,000
61:46 years but what do they do and I've
61:48 warned you guys about this a thousand
61:50 times
61:51 probably nearly a thousand times the Ice
61:55 Age the Ice Age is a genetic mental
61:59 barrier from allowing yourself to
62:01 believe that anything existed before the
62:03 Ice Age okay that nice even though no
62:07 one ever suggested a glacier ever got to
62:10 Africa northern tip of Africa that's not
62:14 the way an ice age works even in their
62:16 theory and their Theory gets really cold
62:18 and the ice caps really get down you
62:20 know in the North America yeah they
62:22 swell up on South America and the bottom
62:25 of Africa maybe maybe Australia is all
62:27 messed up too but the Equator is always
62:30 warm right you have to have 30 degrees
62:33 Fahrenheit zero Celsius to maintain ice
62:36 and what's really funny about them
62:39 trying to tell you that the the North
62:42 Pole's melting of the south
62:44 gonna melt away it's like okay the South
62:46 Pole of all places is negative 60
62:49 Fahrenheit on average oh yes so the
62:53 whole thing's gonna swing 92 degrees
62:55 hotter to subtract the 60 and add 32 and
62:59 and we're still at freezing at 90 at 32
63:02 fahrenheit and 90 degrees 92 degrees up
63:05 it's never gonna happen folks
63:08 why does ice crack and fall into the
63:10 ocean well he'll min at some point it
63:13 structurally can't just continue to grow
63:15 it's going to hit water that's a little
63:18 bit warmer than 32 that's gonna melt but
63:22 it's a continent man it's a continent
63:24 whether it's a disc or a continent or
63:26 Islands sort of thing it's still really
63:29 really cold and it's not gonna melt away
63:31 right it's nuts but what is one of the
63:34 most alluring questions that man gets
63:36 and it's a master's degree Stanton
63:41 Friedman who constantly corrected people
63:45 and I know this because of your comments
63:47 dr. Stanton Friedman was not a doctor
63:50 and he kept trying to tell people it
63:52 wasn't a doctor he had a master's degree
63:54 in physics I think it was from Harvard
63:57 or something it was a big you know he
63:59 said smart dude
64:00 they were always asking him when how
64:02 long it was gonna be before we actually
64:04 made first contact with aliens you know
64:07 in a public sense right so they usually
64:09 insert in two phases right well I think
64:11 we already have because of Roswell and
64:13 other things and I think it's gonna be
64:17 you know I remember of an interview with
64:19 him on the sci-fi channel and probably
64:23 the History Channel maybe even the
64:24 Discovery Channel's all three of them
64:25 touched this because it sells a lot of
64:27 tickets they said that you know
64:29 something's gonna happen after the year
64:32 2000 that we're all expecting paradigm
64:34 change because of the century turning
64:36 over it's just something we all adopt in
64:38 our minds that hey guys let's go to the
64:40 next level don't you want live in a
64:41 George Jetson world let's go and so he
64:45 felt like it was going to happen his
64:46 life done sadly he passed I think your
64:49 last year or this year and it didn't
64:53 happen for him sort of a bummer man I
64:55 feel like
64:58 if the military ever had that kind of
65:01 contact they should have come up to him
65:05 in his last five years or whatever and
65:06 just dude here's the deal well would you
65:10 like to work on a secret project and you
65:15 know we'll give you a big cover story
65:17 what is some hobby that you have oh you
65:19 know I like to make stained glass okay
65:23 great so you are gonna be on a stained
65:26 glass expedition you're gonna do some
65:28 archaeological stuff and we'll take you
65:29 down to this other alternate location
65:31 we're gonna take three or four thousand
65:33 photographs of you videos of you we've
65:36 got a whole wardrobe change we're gonna
65:38 CG your face to grow over a couple years
65:40 but what you're really gonna be doing is
65:42 you're gonna be an S for helping us out
65:44 with these alien spacecraft if nothing
65:46 else you're gonna get a chance to live
65:48 your dream and because you're gonna be
65:51 in such a euphoric state and you're
65:53 never going home we don't need to worry
65:55 about brainwash and you beating you up
65:56 like bob lazar said we're just going to
66:00 see what you can contribute to the DNA
66:02 but it's a one-way ticket man you can't
66:05 go home I think the guy would take the
66:07 deal I think he would take the deal I
66:10 hope at some point something like that
66:13 has occurred for someone if there truly
66:14 is you know contact that we're working
66:18 on on a daily basis right my fear is
66:22 that because scientists are so
66:25 left-brain in order to achieve their
66:27 intelligence that their right brain is
66:29 not creative and I know that that's just
66:33 a worry of mine and probably not a truth
66:36 but you know it's it's saddening to see
66:39 so many disturbingly bad scientific
66:42 theories go decade after decade century
66:45 after century like really do we really
66:48 believe this stuff because if we're
66:51 believing a bad paradigm then we can't
66:53 engineer a different paradigm you know
66:56 and it's one of these things of course
66:58 people say oh well the government has
66:59 technology way more advanced than you
67:01 money I'm sure they do as I said though
67:05 I believe that due to the internet do
67:08 the to the proliferation of information
67:10 I think that Delta which was always held
67:13 over our head is like 50 well 20 to 50
67:16 years I think 20 is more believable
67:19 of course they private-sector the stuff
67:21 after a while because they want to make
67:23 billions of dollars right cellphones are
67:25 most likely something was probably in
67:27 pockets in the 70s and maybe early 80s
67:30 and then eventually we got the big
67:32 gigantic you know telephones and then
67:35 they went down to candy bars maybe they
67:37 had miniaturization at the military
67:39 level no so that's how stuff gets
67:40 smaller but that's such a you know I
67:44 heard the friend of mine I just talked
67:45 to a friend of mine yesterday and he was
67:47 talking about that differential in
67:49 technology because he has family members
67:50 that are you know pretty high clearance
67:52 folks and they were telling him you know
67:55 you have no idea the technology that we
67:56 know about and we are fairly certain
67:59 that even we just have a tiny breadcrumb
68:03 of what is being used over our heads
68:06 maybe I still have a bit of a problem
68:10 believing that because you know you have
68:14 you know evil people running the world
68:16 and I don't know if they're you know
68:19 like you be evil over there and suppress
68:22 the people try to get this whole freedom
68:26 thing dissolved right we need a
68:27 one-world government thing meanwhile
68:30 we're over here flying around the galaxy
68:32 II again if they had covert technology
68:37 that could get to the moon with a
68:39 payload we would not be sitting here
68:42 with crappy photographs of bad scaled
68:45 Apollo Lunar Lander kickstands
68:49 at 4 X their scale on the surface of the
68:51 moon because NASA couldn't figure out
68:52 how to forge it properly right and for
68:55 those of you don't know you'll think oh
68:57 we did go to the moon because there's
68:58 photographs of the moon landings and
69:00 they have little rover prints everywhere
69:02 and they have the kickstand to the
69:03 litter to the lunar module the part that
69:06 was left behind all right well one the
69:10 top part of the lunar module is gonna
69:11 crash down on the moon somewhere they
69:14 should have that too but the scale was
69:16 wrong when the ask NASA how big is it
69:18 pixel on this piece of paper on this
69:20 image they gave him a
69:22 scaled and then when they use that scale
69:25 to figure out how big the kickstand was
69:27 it was four times the size and Leo this
69:29 is a forgery then you've lied to us once
69:31 again but if they had technology to get
69:36 to the moon
69:37 they'd take the payload up there they'd
69:40 lay it down
69:41 they tariff all in the joint and then
69:44 they'd take a picture of it and go there
69:45 you go they take a rover finally you
69:49 know American Rovers on the moon
69:50 seriously seriously come on give it up
69:54 right but they drive it over and take a
69:56 look and believe me they could create it
69:59 exactly the same way as we see in the
70:01 photographs right but we don't have that
70:04 because they don't have that real simple
70:08 so the most popular theory as to why you
70:11 know there's an s4 let's just say Bob
70:13 Lazar is telling the truth which I don't
70:15 believe he is and you know for those of
70:19 you didn't watch the first episode of
70:21 season five the major contingency with
70:23 Bob Lazar is that he said he had two
70:25 degrees one from MIT and one from
70:27 Caltech and because those degrees would
70:32 take time to achieve one would have a
70:34 whole portfolio of photographs and
70:37 paraphernalia from that school you don't
70:39 just go to those schools and not take a
70:41 picture right if you live in
70:43 Massachusetts for three years to four
70:44 years or two years or whatever you're
70:48 gonna take a picture
70:49 same thing with Caltech he was the only
70:52 evidence he ever went to Caltech as
70:53 someone said they gave him a ride to
70:55 Caltech one day no big deal it's just
70:58 here in Pasadena man I can take you to
71:00 Caltech for my house doesn't mean you
71:03 got a degree there it's like I said I
71:05 lived it Stanford University for the
71:08 last probably I don't know three or four
71:11 years I was in the Bay Area once I
71:12 discovered their library and I was like
71:14 oh my god step aside I start buying
71:16 their academic books taking him home
71:18 sadly I've donated already but he nice
71:23 to show him on the show right so you
71:27 know that's what breaks his story right
71:29 into why lie about that kind of thing
71:31 plus his life history is fairly well
71:34 photographed because he was into
71:36 turbine engine drag race cars which he
71:39 built and raced in front of people to
71:42 make money he also made a database for a
71:46 whorehouse so they could track license
71:48 plates to make sure that those who came
71:49 up to the whorehouse were evaluated for
71:52 whether or not they were police officers
71:53 or not so you know guys got an
71:56 interesting past I think he's a cool
71:57 dude I like the guy I wish I could meet
72:01 him and talk to him my skepticism of his
72:04 story is probably what will prevent that
72:06 from ever occurring but I would love for
72:09 him just to go oh yeah you know what
72:10 it's funny you mentioned that I've never
72:11 proven I had these degrees here's my
72:15 alumni shirt go ask the college this was
72:17 made in 1981 or whatever here's mall my
72:20 photographs of my apartment and my
72:21 friends and then boom he's back on track
72:24 he's not telling tall tales but he's
72:27 good for the brain in my opinion because
72:28 he gets us to think but according to his
72:31 story of the sports model UFO that he
72:36 worked on which is one in nine again his
72:40 story changed his first story was that
72:43 the other eight were all damaged that
72:47 they had suffered either a crash injury
72:49 or we shot one out of the sky or
72:51 whatever and the sports model was one
72:55 that was perfect and he you know he said
72:58 look maybe we made the one that I'm
73:00 looking at that's really nice but one
73:03 thing he clarified on Joe Rogan was that
73:07 he said that a couple things he said
73:09 they were very interesting one he
73:12 finally said in the 21st century and his
73:14 reemergence which I'm very glad he came
73:16 back out and talked to us that was great
73:18 and again his is beautiful explanation
73:21 of element 115 was a real treat you know
73:25 regardless if he's making this up man
73:27 that guy he's good he should just write
73:28 movies or books or something but anyway
73:31 or be an adviser at least on something
73:33 like then but he said he heard that you
73:36 know that what he was working on and
73:37 what these ships were these ships came
73:39 from was an archaeological dig that they
73:44 were man-made but that we lost some
73:46 advanced civilization
73:48 which again always you know always poses
73:52 the question of okay let's say that
73:55 happened to us and again there's the
73:58 this is amazing special on discovery
74:01 which interestingly enough my uncle
74:04 who's an eye doctor was an eye doctor
74:05 he's now retired he obsessed on this
74:08 documentary which I was very impressed
74:10 with because it was the sight of him
74:12 that I'd never seen before was really
74:15 cool but he the documentary was what
74:18 would happen to all of man's inventions
74:20 if we let him sit man was gone and
74:25 everything sat for 10,000 years
74:28 what would New York City look like and
74:30 you know the people that contributed to
74:33 the documentary claimed that in 10,000
74:36 years New York LA any big city with
74:40 skyscrapers would dissolve back into the
74:42 ground but that the only thing that
74:45 would survive would be stone like a
74:49 pyramid like a stone hinge maybe the arc
74:54 de triumphe is enough stone in it maybe
74:56 some of the cathedrals have enough stone
74:57 in it they wouldn't fall apart or at
74:59 least there would be something left to
75:01 see like a Colosseum sort of thing right
75:03 the other thing he laid down was that it
75:08 was his opinion that they pull these
75:11 craft out about every 10 years and they
75:15 they'll get the greatest minds of the
75:18 era and they look at it and they say
75:21 look can you we got it to this stage ten
75:23 years ago now you have studied whatever
75:27 Division of physics or whatever and can
75:30 you figure it out now right it'd be nice
75:32 to have a whole troupe of ether all
75:34 scientists in there because that's what
75:37 I think Bob Lazar is lamenting about
75:39 whether or not you realizes it or not
75:41 right so I think that's kind of
75:42 interesting but there's the big big
75:45 question beyond the obvious sort of
75:48 conspiratorial answers of someone trying
75:50 to keep the technology only for their
75:55 purposes of why they hide it why not
76:00 bring it out and have a world
76:02 contest here's an antimatter any bring
76:04 the whole thing out they just bring me
76:06 one of the hanging engines in this in
76:07 the bowels of the ship right which again
76:09 according to some researchers and
76:11 anthropologists they have found
76:13 schematics of ships that match the exact
76:17 description maybe not the outer fender
76:19 shape but the exact description of what
76:21 Bob talked about and maybe Bob and
76:24 fabricating his story if he did I saw
76:26 those in the 70s and just went for it
76:30 just talked about it got his story
76:32 straight and again you're looking at a
76:34 guy that would love for Bob to be
76:37 completely a hundred percent honest and
76:39 true you know it's it's hard yet to
76:43 prove that in my mind but either it's
76:46 it's one of two things or maybe both
76:50 what if they could take one of these
76:54 things apart once they figure out had
76:56 the synthesize 115 if that is truly a
76:59 piece of the engine but they open it up
77:02 and they're like oh my god it's got
77:04 about four parts in it and all the metal
77:06 that's inside this thing we now know how
77:09 to make it we know how to make the
77:11 little tiny wires and whatever the
77:14 pinball's inside right the ball bearings
77:16 or whatever whatever is inside where
77:18 these engines they're like okay
77:20 the problem is this is really easy to
77:25 make and a great design and a great
77:28 engineering feat would be to make it so
77:29 simple that it could be built by anyone
77:32 and I always try to remind people look
77:36 at the world war two movies of
77:37 housewife's going into Lockheed Martin
77:41 factories or wasn't called Lockheed
77:42 Martin back in the day but you know
77:43 these these b-52s that they helped make
77:46 these b-1 bombers and also whatever it
77:49 is right because you be 57 and they were
77:52 able to make them well are they
77:56 aeronautical engineers know do they know
77:58 exactly how all the lift happens on the
78:01 shape of the wing not at all didn't even
78:03 know what the computers do with the
78:05 joysticks and stuff no but they're told
78:07 hook wire from red to blue A to B one
78:12 two - it's like a it's like drawn by the
78:15 you know
78:15 by numbers so say America at whatever
78:19 expense it took launched a clandestine
78:23 intelligence operation to steal these
78:26 schematics from everywhere in the world
78:27 out of museums out of people's houses
78:29 out of universities out of the ground to
78:33 make sure no one can get this stuff the
78:35 schematic on how to do it plus they have
78:37 the craft that was either dug up or
78:39 crash and their whole purposes they
78:43 don't want someone even more evil than
78:45 them to be able to make a whole fleet of
78:48 these things and wreak havoc on the
78:51 world thus they lose their control maybe
78:56 it's a combination of both elements you
78:59 know pardon the pun have you ever
79:03 wondered if something like district 9
79:06 happened or independence date where a
79:09 mothership came down and just went right
79:12 over New York City right over Los
79:14 Angeles or Paris or London or whatever
79:16 and they started to attack us have you
79:21 ever wondered with all these rumors
79:24 about you know our governments having
79:25 technology.we over our head if they have
79:29 weaponized this technology in the form
79:32 of craf real spacecraft anti-gravity
79:35 engines whatever type of guns they might
79:38 have and that we would be witness to our
79:44 side fighting back with stuff we've
79:46 never seen before with the whole secret
79:48 fleet of pilots that we've never seen
79:50 before and all of a sudden you know we
79:52 look up at the sky and then all sudden
79:54 there's this huge space battle going on
79:56 in the air and we don't know who the
79:59 hell is friend or foe did they have
80:02 American flags on Russian flags on
80:04 Chinese flags on moon were these things
80:06 coming from I would imagine if that was
80:08 the the next Mars attack movie they land
80:12 on earth and all the ships have American
80:16 flags own and you know as much as we
80:19 have wreaked havoc on the world in the
80:21 name of banking cartels the world you
80:24 know at this point we're really peaceful
80:25 we're jumping out all the wars we're not
80:27 alone
80:28 no longer being this police state for
80:29 the whole planet thank God you know they
80:33 give the Nobel Prize to a guy that keeps
80:34 it going and they crucify the guy that's
80:38 actually stopping it isn't that funny
80:40 boy you know truth is stranger than
80:43 fiction right but here come all the
80:46 ships landing and they're all alien
80:48 ships but they were smart enough to say
80:49 we're gonna put insignia on the ship
80:51 which gives psychological trust to the
80:54 human beings that see them and they come
80:56 out you know and they just blow
80:58 everybody away
80:59 wouldn't that be [ __ ] hilarious I'd
81:02 be really interested in your opinions
81:04 about all this stuff and I hope you guys
81:06 make it to the others episodes because
81:08 that's really ass that's when I ask the
81:10 question because I built up my case I
81:12 built up the questions for your mind
81:15 plus a lot of fodder to think about and
81:18 I dearly hope that if I could ever be a
81:22 fly on the wall at your home at some
81:24 public gathering with your good friends
81:26 who will really listen to you and you
81:27 respect you that you are just barfing
81:30 out these subjects all of them hey guys
81:32 you ever thought about this boom boom
81:34 boom boom boom and harvest all their
81:36 answers and then because your mind is
81:38 nicely massage on a weekly basis you're
81:42 just connecting dots and coming up with
81:45 bigger and better theories the thing is
81:48 is if we ever did make contact with
81:50 aliens and let's just let's just a
81:53 little scenario here 2020 is a pretty
81:55 cool year right to even numbers buttered
81:57 up together it kind of feels good right
82:00 2019 ramped but let's say the our alien
82:05 friends whoever has the closest
82:06 proximity to us let's just go with the
82:09 greys because they seem to be pretty
82:10 popular these days January 1st for the
82:15 northern hemisphere and the cold of
82:17 winter southern hemisphere middle of
82:20 summer
82:20 here comes enough crafts to land in at
82:25 least every capital city of every single
82:28 major country in the world help maybe
82:30 every country in the world who knows
82:31 right
82:32 they've done their geology and they've
82:34 our geography excuse me and they've
82:37 figured out where of all this is any
82:39 land so
82:41 January first becomes this day and
82:44 infamy this day in history where oh my
82:47 god we all have to just roll over and
82:50 think this thing through again
82:53 well the listeners the deep thoughts
82:55 would be like I got to get to Facebook
82:58 right away you know but what would be
83:01 and now I have a whole episode about
83:02 meeting an alien and it's a really
83:04 important episode because I slowed down
83:05 the psychology of you physically meeting
83:07 one how your brain would interpret
83:11 seeing one get out of a vehicle and I
83:13 just slow time all the way down go to
83:16 deep thoughts video calm and search on
83:18 it look in the alien category and you'll
83:19 see it but just type in the word meeting
83:23 and you'll find the episode very quickly
83:25 and watch it okay so think about it
83:29 you're in some government think tank
83:32 contributing all of your psychological
83:34 DNA is sociological DNA for those of you
83:38 religious the religious DNA those are
83:40 you're a theist atheist DNA and what
83:44 does January 2nd look like and third and
83:47 fourth and the 15th to the 31st and then
83:50 what does February look like what's
83:53 gonna happen what's gonna happen in your
83:56 local church what's gonna happen in your
83:58 local Walmart the Capitol building where
84:01 your government does business the
84:03 Parliament the EU headquarters the UN
84:07 what's it gonna look like what's the
84:09 farmer gonna say in the middle of Kansas
84:11 Hutchison Kansas the center of the
84:14 United States of America what are they
84:16 gonna say it's a very interesting
84:18 thought process right it's going to be
84:22 like the guy in Total Recall that's
84:23 riding on the subway car and or at least
84:26 the Train where's Aaron Swartz 'near
84:29 he's looking out the window he sees the
84:33 pyramids and on Mars and the dew goes oh
84:36 you like it right you know we used to
84:38 work there until they found aliens [ __ ]
84:39 in it oh yeah Wow and then the guy you
84:46 know
84:48 just blew it off after a while yeah I
84:49 found hidden stuff in it and no one's
84:51 surprised so what's gonna happen in 2021
84:54 January 1st one year later how does the
84:58 world operate do they create new classes
85:00 in K through 12 new cat classes in
85:03 college do we do an exchange program
85:07 maybe they say when you can't really fit
85:09 in our vehicles and you probably can't
85:10 breathe you know the atmosphere that we
85:13 have there it's taking us forever to
85:16 figure out how to exist in your room
85:18 maybe they're in interdimensional it's
85:20 even weirder all right here's what I
85:24 don't think is gonna happen because
85:25 that's kind of valuable too it's sort of
85:27 like when you have someone you want to
85:28 eat dinner with a loved one and you say
85:33 where do you wanna eat natto now and you
85:37 say you want to you know what Italian
85:38 yeah you want barbeque no and so you
85:41 find out okay let's do a process of
85:44 elimination let me just name everything
85:45 they name everything to me you don't
85:47 want to eat I don't want this so don't
85:49 want that don't want this boat in the
85:50 end you actually have what's left and
85:52 you can pick from what's left it's not
85:54 that many choices in America I believe
85:56 it or not depending on where you live of
85:59 course but I don't think what happened
86:02 worldwide would be chaos some areas of
86:06 the world might have damage control if
86:11 for those who still think that the Pope
86:12 is God on earth presiding over all the
86:16 pedophile rings in this planet you know
86:19 that dude's gonna come out and say see I
86:21 told you so
86:22 and Jesus says that there's this and God
86:26 says there that I meditated last night I
86:28 got this you know he's gonna try to spin
86:29 it and control it he's gonna try to
86:32 maintain his empire his pyramid
86:34 structured empire of control
86:37 governments are definitely gonna do the
86:39 same thing but the reason why you still
86:42 need to pay taxes is the SIS in this the
86:44 reason why you have to go to war and
86:45 kill someone on the other side the plan
86:46 is because of this the reason why
86:49 everyone still races is because of this
86:51 reason why at this party's bad this
86:53 party's good it's still because of this
86:54 well they're gonna try to maintain
86:56 control
86:58 but what if just like in Hong Kong
87:02 god bless him no they're tired of it all
87:06 you know I mean just to digress for a
87:09 split second in this huge psychological
87:11 paradigm shift thinking China's really
87:16 the only country on planet Earth that is
87:18 still trying to say that a worn out
87:22 method of ruling the world called
87:24 communism is still a good thing when
87:27 everyone else has moved on but
87:30 supposedly there are giant intellectual
87:31 threat to the rest of the world oh
87:33 really
87:34 really what kind of mind can believe the
87:38 communism is good I don't know if I
87:41 throw a big IQ at that species Hong Kong
87:45 has moved on they've been blessed by
87:47 democracy and whether it be photo
87:50 democracy or real democracy it's the
87:52 right direction by then fighting and
87:55 fighting and fighting and of course no
87:58 one can support everything everybody
88:00 does in a protest but you know the
88:01 overall gist is the elections are coming
88:04 in record voting looks like you know
88:07 there's a virus over there it's a mental
88:10 virus it's a mental technology go see my
88:13 episode of mental technology it's gonna
88:17 bleed into mainland China it's already
88:19 happening I have friends who work over
88:20 there who Americans and they're like
88:22 none of the kids buy this [ __ ] they're
88:25 all just counting the days for the old
88:26 guys to die wasn't it
88:31 Charlie Chaplin who said in his Great
88:33 Dictator speech you know as long as men
88:35 die freedom will prevail something to
88:39 that effect may be said democracy I
88:41 can't remember where one of our
88:43 listeners posted a really good reply to
88:46 something I put on Facebook on my
88:47 personal page because I posted I got
88:50 like a few seconds left on the cigar I'm
88:52 gonna go for it
88:54 Charlie Chaplin in by March of 1941
88:58 before Pearl Harbor was orchestrated to
89:01 get us into World War two made a movie
89:04 about being a Jewish barber who just
89:07 happened to look enough like Hitler that
89:09 he was mistaken for Hitler at one point
89:10 and at the crescendo of the movie and
89:13 the third act of the old way of writing
89:15 he's pushed up in front of a podium here
89:18 is a Jew he's in a neighborhood that's
89:20 being completely brutalized by Nazis and
89:23 he eases it's a brilliant film it's his
89:25 first taki film I think it might have
89:27 been his last too but he gave this
89:29 speech that will go down in history as
89:32 probably the best speech ever given to
89:34 mankind to fight against the tyranny of
89:37 our day and so I love it I think it's
89:41 one of the most incredible things I've
89:42 ever seen and the one it's the best is
89:44 the one that actually has a lot of
89:45 editing on top of it showing what he was
89:49 saying as being true but one of our
89:53 listeners replied and said did you know
89:54 that this guy was accused of being a
89:58 basically a pedophile
90:01 now Charlie Chaplin right after he did
90:05 that movie was implicated in a bunch of
90:07 stuff something to do with price
90:11 regulations and some other federal thing
90:13 that he was involved in and they made
90:15 him run - I believe Sweden or
90:18 Switzerland one of those two countries
90:19 and he hid there until the 70s when he
90:21 came back and got his Lifetime
90:22 Achievement Award but of course when
90:24 they're out to get you they're out to
90:25 get you they were all sought to get
90:27 Lincoln because he betrayed the bankers
90:30 during the Civil War and printed the
90:31 greenback thank you day for my two
90:34 five-dollar bills I got Dave gave me two
90:37 five-dollar bills one with the red seal
90:39 on it one with the green seal on it
90:41 I keep him on my fireplace mantel so I
90:44 can make the point to my friends that
90:45 come in one sovereign and one's Fiat
90:48 your money has green on it because it's
90:51 all fiha the red ones are sovereign I
90:53 don't even know how I got these things
90:55 but you know they've said that you know
90:58 Lincoln's wife was a total nutcase and
91:00 he had all these flaws and they're just
91:02 going to attack this guy until everyone
91:05 hates Lincoln that's just the banker
91:08 attack on this guy well the banker
91:10 attack on Charlie Chaplin was that he
91:13 had kids in his movies and so now the
91:16 guy is long gone and they're saying that
91:19 you know he would keep these kids next
91:21 to him and he would do all this sexual
91:22 stuff with him now he may have been a
91:25 little kinky on the side there are some
91:28 testimony from a divorce settlement that
91:31 he was pretty kinky and he wanted his
91:34 wife to be with another woman that's
91:36 just what people do when they're famous
91:38 maybe he did that don't know I know that
91:41 when you talk to a divorce attorney they
91:44 will go for the jugular whether or not
91:47 it's true or not and I'll give you an
91:49 example they kind of filter this into
91:52 the equation when I found out that my
91:56 daughter's mother was pregnant we
91:57 weren't married for a very specific
91:59 reason I wanted to be a good dad right
92:02 from the very beginning so before she
92:03 was even born I wanted to give her child
92:05 support and so because we're best
92:08 friends but I went you the attorney who
92:12 I didn't realize was about to retire and
92:14 he was giving me a free consultation
92:16 just at the end of his shift he had his
92:18 own law firm so it was just him inside
92:20 this building and I mentioned the
92:23 circumstances to him and this guy goes
92:25 for the jugular this guy's like we'll
92:27 we'll frame her so many different ways
92:29 to Sunday oh my god I mean he was like
92:32 thinking that I hated this woman and
92:35 that she was trying to extort money out
92:37 of me and I'm like I'm listening to this
92:38 barrage of rehearsed falsehoods that
92:43 this guy was gonna put on the mother of
92:46 my child and I finally looked at the guy
92:47 I said the only evidence is re the only
92:50 information I got out of him was you
92:53 know you want to make more money in life
92:55 than you need so that you never had to
92:57 worry about your bills that was the only
92:59 thing he said at one point that I was
93:00 like oh that's good as I did sort of
93:02 where I am now but it's a good idea but
93:05 so when I saw that I was like wow you
93:06 can't trust attorneys man they just
93:08 they're going for jugular you know it's
93:10 just crazy I think he was 19 and he
93:14 married a 17-year old for his first wife
93:16 and then I think he was 29 when he
93:19 married a 16 year old this is a long
93:21 time ago folks this is in the first half
93:24 of the 20th century when girls got
93:27 married for anywhere from 14 and up
93:30 pretty common thing especially the more
93:33 rule you were heyyou menstruated they
93:35 just thought hey you can have kids let's
93:37 do it and it wasn't I mean god you go
93:40 back 50 years before that the late 1800s
93:42 and then it was 45 year old guys
93:44 marrying 15 year olds it was and it was
93:47 not you know frowned on by society so
93:50 society doesn't have a moral code
93:52 against it then you're going to do it
93:54 because it's just the way it is and
93:55 today we have figured out that you know
93:58 especially with the perversion of adults
94:00 today it's not a good idea all right
94:04 so the story's a little you know it
94:09 needs perspective let's just put that
94:11 way now maybe the guy was totally a
94:13 weirdo I don't know but he's gonna be
94:15 attacked until he is pounded into the
94:18 ground as long as we forget his name
94:19 they'll let him go but we're never gonna
94:21 forget his name so they're gonna
94:22 continue coming after the dude but
94:25 anyway that speech is great then the
94:27 point he made was as long as these old
94:30 guard dudes die which is an inevitable
94:33 consequence of being a human being the
94:36 anything that you're dealing with right
94:37 now in society will erase itself but you
94:39 have to train the young kids which they
94:41 have figured out of course to want
94:43 freedom to want you know their sovereign
94:47 rights of the Republic you exist
94:50 therefore you get these rights and no
94:53 one could take them away from you kind
94:56 of an odd ending to this episode but
94:57 there you go

95:02 been to deep thoughts radio.com please
