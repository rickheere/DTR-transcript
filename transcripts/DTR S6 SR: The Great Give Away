00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen
00:37 on this uh pretty sunny day
00:41 i think it's about maybe 68.
00:46 not too bad for this time of year my god
00:49 what a crazy year we've had
00:52 and we're only getting started so i'm
00:54 talking to a friend of mine yesterday
00:56 a very amazing person she said something
01:00 utterly brilliant
01:01 in our conversation she was just riffing
01:04 and had to stop her and say
01:06 that's brilliant did you hear that
01:08 somewhere else
01:11 so oh no no i just made that up like
01:13 even more brilliant
01:16 and it's a title this episode the great
01:19 giveaway
01:23 the great giveaway is a
01:27 reference to the inverse of the great
01:29 awakening
01:31 and what's interesting about it is uh
01:36 the phraseology of the statement is
01:38 utterly perfect in my opinion which is
01:42 there is a group of us who i think are
01:44 mentally stable
01:45 at least enough and we
01:50 recognize and respect history we also
01:53 have done
01:54 some due diligence from time to time to
01:56 figure out what really happened
01:57 in various areas of the world at various
01:59 times and we're always searching and
02:01 we're always comparing notes because we
02:03 really want the truth
02:04 but we understand that we have been
02:06 birthed out of our mothers and
02:08 we have gone through phases of childhood
02:11 adolescence pre-adolescence adulthood
02:14 etc etc
02:16 and now we are trying to engage reality
02:19 outside of our mother's womb
02:21 i'd figure out how this thing works and
02:24 then i think there's
02:26 quite comfortably and separate group of
02:28 people a very small group of people but
02:30 enough to be noticed in society
02:34 and they're trying to crawl back in
02:35 their womb they weren't ready to be
02:38 birthed or
02:39 they found the outer world to be too
02:42 terrifying and they just like a little
02:44 cat they want to crawl inside
02:46 some space and and have the comfort of
02:48 four walls
02:50 a floor and maybe a little peaky door to
02:54 look through every once in a while right
02:56 when they're not scared of reality
02:59 this statement tied a lot of things
03:00 together because i watched people wear
03:02 those
03:04 those strangulation things on their face
03:07 that destroy your brain cells and
03:09 put your body in a absolute inverted
03:14 acidic state blows out your
03:17 alkaline levels you get necrosis and
03:20 your
03:21 neurons in your brain over time
03:24 everything struggles to exist with one
03:27 of those little things on your face
03:29 and yet some people like them they'll
03:32 get into their car and then they still
03:33 have them on and they're all by
03:34 themselves
03:36 i mean maybe they technically put one on
03:38 and they can't figure out how to ever
03:39 get it off so it just stays there
03:40 who knows but why am i saying that these
03:43 people want to go back into the womb
03:44 what's the thing
03:46 well what is freedom what is freedom
03:50 in say a movement analogy
03:53 your mobility you can get around you can
03:55 make things happen right
03:57 you go left right front back up down all
03:59 the combinations they're in
04:02 and for a lot of us that is a very
04:04 appealing
04:05 way to live and that's the very first
04:08 iteration
04:10 of freedom being born getting outside
04:13 your mother's womb
04:14 and enjoying the freedom as crazy as it
04:17 might be as scary as it might be
04:19 as ugly as your relatives might be it's
04:22 better to be outside and stuck inside
04:23 even though that was probably a fairly
04:25 good experience for some of us right
04:28 i have no memory if i liked it or not i
04:30 tend to really enjoy being born
04:33 your second tier of freedom would be
04:36 meeting other people
04:37 and gaining that beautiful feedback
04:39 between two souls
04:42 staring in someone's eyes pushing your
04:45 chest against someone else's and feeling
04:46 your heart beat
04:48 and but more importantly feeling your
04:49 souls just
04:51 wrap around each other like the tails
04:53 and avatar
04:56 it's beautiful so we tend to have a
04:59 theme to our lives to spread our wings
05:01 and be free
05:04 but there's another group of people for
05:06 whatever reason
05:08 whether it's some pre-prenatal situation
05:11 where when they're still in their
05:12 mother's wombs their moms are
05:15 playing them some sweet music and they
05:17 just don't want to leave or
05:19 or maybe has nothing to do with the
05:20 differential between wombs
05:23 between our two groups maybe it is that
05:25 once they were born
05:26 their household was so perverted
05:30 that crawling back inside seems like a
05:32 pretty good idea
05:34 it could be something on the level of
05:35 hey
05:37 parents were good people but they
05:38 weren't that educated so i got into a
05:40 bunch of trouble a bunch of bad
05:41 situations and
05:43 boy i just like to crawl back up into
05:45 the womb because there's no bills up
05:46 there
05:47 no responsibility entitlement is even
05:51 moot because
05:52 you just suck your thumb and go through
05:55 that umbilical cord to get lunch you
05:56 know
05:58 but now i'm gonna focus on this idea of
06:01 the great giveaway
06:03 it's a fantastic phrase because in it
06:06 just a couple words we now can
06:10 communicate with others very quickly
06:12 about what we think at least is
06:14 occurring from our end
06:16 let me ask you have you ever given
06:18 someone
06:20 either a friend friends i'm gonna stick
06:22 with friend
06:23 some friend comes over your house and
06:25 maybe you've known it for a long time
06:26 maybe
06:26 for whatever reason but you're really
06:28 good friends at that moment
06:30 and you got a lot of knickknacks in your
06:31 house right and
06:33 have you ever just picked up something
06:34 you know that your friend says man
06:35 that's really nice i really like that
06:37 you just pick it over here take it
06:39 i know i've done it a couple times okay
06:43 now there are things where you
06:46 there's things that you give away
06:47 because they have one level of value
06:50 to you and then there's other things you
06:53 don't give away
06:55 because of the value is too high maybe
06:57 it's even not
06:58 the monetary value but it's a
07:00 sentimentality value you can't possibly
07:02 give your
07:03 grandfather's world war ii badge away or
07:05 whatever
07:07 metal i want you to keep that in your
07:10 mind you don't typically give away
07:11 things that are worth a lot unless
07:13 you're dealing with someone who's
07:14 extremely special
07:16 maybe get mr miyagi's secret book right
07:20 but you have to have a connection to go
07:23 over that basic price
07:25 price level why mention that
07:28 because the only way that this other
07:30 group
07:32 that is engaged in the great giveaway
07:33 can actually rationalize giving it away
07:36 is they don't perceive its true value
07:40 to them it's like uh yeah yeah i take
07:42 that out here that's i think that's ugly
07:44 that constitution and my rights my
07:46 alienable rights which i'm using right
07:48 now to be
07:49 the way that i am
07:52 complacent entitled
07:56 self-loathing yeah sure take that thing
08:00 that's uh honesty
08:01 goodness integrity self value it's all
08:05 right there
08:05 but i don't know what it is so you take
08:07 it it just reminds me what i can't get
08:09 for some reason in my mind
08:12 i think bad parenting is probably the
08:14 best way to say
08:16 what's wrong with the world sounds like
08:19 a
08:20 so such a trivial statement that doesn't
08:23 even take
08:24 grip in your mind of like really being a
08:26 real statement but that's really what it
08:28 is
08:29 now we're going to catch up a little bit
08:32 um sort of what's going on 2021
08:34 just a little bit i don't want to date
08:35 this particular episode too much
08:39 if you mess up your life do you need
08:40 help
08:42 and if you haven't messed up your life
08:44 do you need as much help
08:47 i'm blessed to be in an area where we
08:50 have the full spectrum of humanity and
08:52 obviously there's
08:52 one spectrum i wish the best to and
08:55 another one that
08:56 um is really hurting like your homeless
08:58 groups around here
09:00 we don't have homeless groups in orange
09:02 county we definitely have a lot of
09:03 homeless
09:04 la has streets full of people right
09:09 when you're hurting you technically need
09:12 a lot of attention you need someone to
09:14 take care of your medically
09:16 then you need someone to feed you you
09:17 need someone to shelter you if you can't
09:19 get these things by yourself and hey
09:22 2020 uh kicked everyone in the nuts
09:25 when we weren't looking because that's
09:27 always how cowards
09:28 pull their conspiracies and so we're
09:32 going to be suffering for a while
09:33 because
09:34 we have this gigantic group of these
09:36 people
09:37 apparently in control of the media and
09:39 our military up to this point
09:41 of february 2nd is allowing the
09:44 constitution to get
09:45 gang-raped in some horrible
09:49 but we'll look back on that a bit
09:52 well if you have a support system in
09:55 your neighborhood for these various
09:57 groups that are seen to be suffering a
09:58 little bit
10:01 or just take the other groups that
10:02 aren't suffering uh kids go to school
10:04 and they have really good teachers and
10:06 we have police forces that come and help
10:08 us out you know from time to time
10:10 i know that varies in different
10:11 locations then they
10:14 you know then we can kind of operate
10:15 without thinking about it you guys know
10:16 that we always run the analogy
10:18 of like hey you really think you got
10:20 control of your life until there's no
10:21 electricity and then you realize all
10:23 your food is coming from that source
10:26 you know and being refrigerated and what
10:28 have you so
10:30 we know that if we lose various core
10:31 amenities strategic resources we could
10:33 be in the stone ages in a couple years
10:35 we know that but that's not occurring to
10:38 us
10:39 now the homeless who have no home no
10:42 phone
10:43 no nothing their families have no idea
10:45 where they are whether they're dead or
10:46 alive
10:47 they're in a more feral state of need
10:50 and we got to do everything we can to to
10:52 help out man
10:53 because these aren't normal times right
10:56 problem is
10:57 we're getting kicked in the nuts now so
10:59 the whole idea is
11:02 those that would give are being strained
11:06 you know the government has plenty of
11:08 money to go around
11:10 so here's the point i want to make i
11:13 think those that go out to protest
11:15 those that go out to even loot
11:21 to burn down stuff and i don't care how
11:23 delusional we all agree that these
11:25 people are
11:27 and i'd i think we can even lump in the
11:30 the scumbags that'll take money to sell
11:33 out their people
11:35 it seems to be a bunch in america at
11:36 this point or at least they flew here
11:40 we always want to look at the systemic
11:41 causes of all this crap right
11:44 they're calling out for help that old
11:46 statement right
11:47 sounds like you're crying out for help
11:49 somebody's complaining a lot
11:51 complaining a lot and they're really i'm
11:53 gonna kill myself i'm gonna do whatever
11:54 really do it and then it's like
11:56 all right all right what you're really
11:57 saying is we've ignored you
12:00 we haven't given you enough interaction
12:04 it's fair game every once in a while you
12:06 need a lot and there's just not a lot
12:08 being given your way voluntarily or
12:10 serendipitously
12:12 and sometimes you do need to say amen i
12:14 need you
12:15 you know i don't even know what we're
12:17 supposed to do but i just need someone
12:18 next to me
12:19 so when i talk somebody hears me
12:22 sometimes that's all you got to say and
12:25 you'll find that people
12:27 you know you think about how many people
12:28 rescue animals and do all these
12:31 selfless things these random acts of
12:33 kindness and
12:34 they're your friends and they're your
12:35 family or they're even random strangers
12:38 you meet
12:39 you know even if you had nobody in your
12:40 life nobody
12:42 fine then find a guy or a girl whatever
12:45 sex you are i recommend you go to the
12:47 same sex there's no
12:49 uh fear that you're gonna be a weirdo
12:52 and then just say would you mind talking
12:55 to me
12:56 you know but we don't have those
12:59 interactions we're not mature as a
13:00 society on average
13:03 and so they go neglected for a million
13:05 different reasons
13:07 of how they got neglected or how and why
13:08 they feel that they were neglected
13:10 it could be even a ptsd situation that
13:12 we have the trauma in our chest
13:14 that something's not right something's
13:16 not right something we don't know
13:19 and so we're just trying to reach out so
13:21 imagine you get a bunch of these sort of
13:23 refined black holes
13:25 together and then they start combining
13:28 they couldn't actually build themselves
13:29 as a 10 person
13:30 thing some alien from the thing they
13:33 couldn't combine all their bodies
13:35 but together each one of them completely
13:37 converted to the monster form
13:39 can then get together and be a bigger
13:40 monster
13:42 and so they're trying to affect change
13:45 a lot of them don't have demands they
13:48 don't have anyone running the
13:49 organization
13:50 with a measurable iq which is a shame
13:55 maybe even have a decent idea anytime a
13:58 faction comes out that's causing
13:59 problems they're
14:01 damaging property and they're hurting
14:03 people and threatening people
14:05 and they have no demands then i think
14:08 that you're going to find that they are
14:09 an extension of the old formula of the
14:11 economic hitman
14:12 which is you have fortunate foreign
14:16 agitators in your country trying to
14:17 overthrow your country
14:19 they actually don't have any demands
14:21 they're only there
14:23 to cause unrest
14:26 so that there can be a switcheroo at a
14:28 different
14:29 area a different time
14:32 but now let's and i know i'm preaching
14:34 to the choir but what i'm trying to
14:36 equip you guys with
14:37 if it's helpful is a way to actually
14:41 talk about this with people that
14:42 completely disagree with you
14:45 how many times have you
14:48 recognized one of these situations where
14:51 i'm going to give you a silly analogy
14:52 but you've
14:54 out almost every human being who can
14:56 hear my voice have had
14:57 has had this silly analogy actually
15:00 happened to you
15:02 someone gives you a cupcake and man
15:05 whatever flavor you like it's that
15:07 flavor
15:09 frosting is your favorite frosting if
15:12 you like sprinkles it's got sprinkles if
15:13 you like something else on there
15:15 you like it bait you like it small it's
15:17 exactly the one
15:18 that you love and you're looking forward
15:20 to it you had one earlier in the day
15:23 and you're like you brought one home
15:27 in between the time you acquired this
15:29 second one
15:31 and pushing it into your pie hole
15:34 you drop it you drop it
15:37 you don't literally you don't have it
15:38 taken away from you necessarily
15:40 you just drop it poof
15:44 either drops completely out of some pile
15:46 of
15:47 something that you would never put in
15:48 your mouth after that or whatever reason
15:50 it's just gone you're never ever gonna
15:52 taste that thing
15:54 like son of a [ __ ] and it wasn't a
15:57 common occurrence that you got this
15:58 thing it was a special thing
15:59 it took a lot of labor for that thing to
16:00 be put together the way it was put
16:02 together
16:03 you knew you had something special and
16:05 then you lost it
16:07 now that puts you in one state of mind
16:10 you're in a mourning phase now because
16:11 you know you lost something
16:13 that was really important to you at that
16:15 moment nah not the end of the world of
16:16 course just a little
16:18 sugar you probably shouldn't eat but
16:19 whatever but now how many times have you
16:22 said in your lifetime
16:24 this other thing this inverse thing
16:26 which is
16:27 somebody said uh well you know i came
16:29 over your house and i
16:31 i picked some roses i'm really sorry i
16:33 meant to ask you
16:35 hope it's okay and
16:38 you have a lot of roses in your backyard
16:39 and so you look around you go
16:41 i don't see any missing so i didn't
16:45 know they were there and you took them
16:46 so no harm no foul
16:48 i don't feel like anything's missing
16:51 okay good man thanks it's great
16:53 so something got taken away from you
16:55 that you didn't know really existed it
16:57 wasn't really in your registry
17:00 that's another one it's the benign loss
17:03 of property
17:05 and then there's one where you had some
17:07 rights
17:09 and they were taken away from you
17:11 because you didn't pay attention to it
17:14 and for a while there it didn't seem
17:15 like it mattered then all of a sudden it
17:18 starts mattering
17:20 you have forced medical procedures on
17:22 your body
17:25 you have passports you have to show just
17:28 across the
17:28 road your kids are being
17:32 taken away from you and put into some
17:34 educational camp
17:36 you don't even make any money anymore
17:38 you just get this food pellet
17:41 you know i'm going with that well now
17:43 mix all
17:44 three of those species together into one
17:48 analogy and that's the world
17:52 except there's one little difference
17:54 okay and all three of those analogies
17:56 it was something that that those
17:58 individuals possess that then they lost
18:00 some mechan uh lost to some mechanism
18:02 right they gave it away
18:04 it was taken without their permission
18:05 but they didn't realize it was there so
18:06 they didn't care
18:07 and the other one didn't care and gave
18:09 it away and found out later it was
18:11 regretful that they did
18:13 the problem with the way that the world
18:15 is set up today
18:17 is that we are talking about i am
18:20 talking about
18:21 the rights of humanity the inalienable
18:24 rights because you exist
18:26 and now they're all on the table
18:29 and apparently again the corruption of
18:32 democracy
18:34 is that two people can vote on what the
18:37 three of you
18:37 experience as a matter of fact two can
18:39 vote the other person doesn't have any
18:41 rights and they have all the rights
18:44 you're voting on your inalienable rights
18:47 and let's keep it clear
18:51 i don't think and correct me if i'm
18:53 wrong
18:54 i can definitely vouch for the united
18:56 states of america
18:58 there is no public office that i am
18:59 aware of
19:01 and we're not talking about judges and
19:03 cops that have to have
19:04 certifications and what have you but
19:06 there's no congressman
19:08 senator or president of the united
19:09 states or vice president united states
19:11 and a lot of their cabinet members as
19:12 well
19:15 that have to come with any
19:16 qualifications
19:18 there's no test how much do you know
19:21 about france
19:22 well i don't know a lot about france
19:24 quite frankly some basic history and
19:25 stuff well then you can't be the
19:27 president or prime minister
19:29 or chancellor of france you can't
19:33 doesn't that sound reasonable but i can
19:36 tell you right now if someone who was
19:38 technically born on perhaps a
19:40 american soil american united states
19:44 air force base or army base but then
19:47 quickly left
19:48 got their dual citizenship became a
19:50 french citizen
19:52 don't even know how to speak english but
19:55 technically they're an american as well
19:58 they can run for office here in the
20:00 united states of america
20:02 hold local positions first with barely a
20:05 command of the english language
20:07 it happens all the time my area but
20:10 you know believe me i'm not blaming
20:11 foreigners for this problem the problem
20:13 i'm talking about is straight up
20:14 american grown
20:16 people who have grown up here who don't
20:19 know a damn thing about the country
20:21 i don't even know if aoc could name all
20:24 the states in the united states if given
20:26 a map to do so
20:28 i mean i'm seriously i don't know
20:32 but i know that the immigration test
20:33 that that
20:35 eligible migrants
20:38 complete to become a united states
20:40 citizen
20:42 is probably beyond the capacity of most
20:43 18 year old graduates of high school in
20:46 the united states
20:47 and i would actually speculate like way
20:49 beyond their iq
20:52 but i would say that your average 18
20:55 year old
20:57 high school graduate probably has around
21:00 the same iq as an entry-level
21:02 congressman or senator now one level
21:05 that would be
21:06 actually i could see how people could
21:09 construe that as that's actually a good
21:10 idea because those people exist in the
21:12 country and we need constituents
21:14 to elect people
21:18 to then be represented and there are 18
21:21 year old
21:22 females and males and they need to have
21:25 their priorities looked out
21:27 for now we do have an age limit for a
21:29 lot of positions but center you can go
21:31 really young
21:33 the reason why i'm mentioning this is
21:34 that we
21:36 we tend to make the wrong assumptions
21:40 about
21:41 what affects our life the most like i've
21:43 always told you guys on this show
21:44 it's really not the big decisions you
21:46 make that change your life it's the
21:48 millions and millions of teeny tiny
21:50 decisions that you make
21:52 that ruin your life give an example
21:55 uh getting married is typically
21:57 perceived as
21:58 either a really good idea or a really
21:59 bad idea depending on the partner that
22:01 you hook up with
22:03 but if they were the wrong one you'd be
22:06 saying well of course
22:07 the biggest mistake i ever made was
22:09 marrying that person that big thing of
22:11 walking down the island saying i do
22:13 well that's definitely where you
22:14 commensurated your relationship
22:17 legally however
22:21 if you're marrying the wrong person
22:25 there's a few million if not 100 million
22:28 decisions you made
22:29 that led up to that moment depending on
22:32 why you're marrying them in the first
22:33 place
22:35 had those littler decisions been more
22:37 analyzed you may have
22:39 changed partners and believe me we've
22:41 all been there
22:42 okay we've all been in bad partnerships
22:45 even though those people might be great
22:46 people they just weren't compatible with
22:48 us
22:49 the great giveaway is a little trick
22:52 get enough people to legally give away
22:55 all of your rights
22:57 the ones that you're born with and
23:00 perhaps some elective ones
23:03 and again in my opinion as long as what
23:05 you're going to do has no possibility of
23:09 doing harm to others
23:10 then that should just be your right
23:11 right the one you're born with
23:14 if a particular action that you're going
23:17 to complete
23:18 could hurt somebody buying a gun
23:24 a little bit of regulation there to make
23:25 sure again just like we would love to
23:27 have politicians take a test
23:29 to prove who the hell they are
23:33 you know we seem to have uh
23:37 you know people becoming president where
23:39 we don't even know their
23:40 background they seal their records their
23:42 birth certificate's a hoax
23:45 that's okay i guess there's no
23:48 qualifications for the individuals
23:50 that steal all the stuff that should be
23:54 yours
23:54 by divine right and i don't care if
23:58 you're an atheist
23:59 they shouldn't rub you the wrong way if
24:02 you're an atheist you just go well i am
24:04 i would almost think it's even more
24:07 simplistic for the mind if you're an
24:09 atheist because you're just like
24:12 it's a mathematical equation that i
24:13 should be left alone but i should have
24:15 freedoms
24:17 once you bring in some king earth or
24:18 jesus christ cool calling thing and
24:20 that's the reason why you have to have
24:22 it
24:22 then you have to sort out that story in
24:24 a book over there to figure out what
24:25 rights you're allowed and all this other
24:27 stuff
24:29 but do do no harm is a wonderful thing
24:32 but what is the inverse of losing all of
24:35 your rights
24:36 because this is where it becomes really
24:38 important at the
24:40 roughly for me it's about a halfway mark
24:41 in the episode it won't be halfway for
24:43 you probably
24:45 you would get constrained
24:48 right you'd get constrained into
24:52 no rights forced medical procedures
24:56 forced taxation of everything they could
24:58 possibly think of
24:59 if you thought the golden gate bridge
25:00 tax was bad no one look at every other
25:03 bridge
25:04 in the world that charges the toll
25:07 they tell you that line of crap but once
25:08 it's paid for the taxes will be done
25:10 oh well we found another reason oh we
25:12 found another reason just keeps going
25:14 and going
25:16 it's the stretch in the squeeze
25:19 this is uh you know there's a there's a
25:22 word illuminati
25:24 i always mention it to you guys and
25:26 preface it with a notion
25:28 we did not come up with that word that
25:31 is not our word that is the word they
25:33 came up with
25:34 for themselves they wrote a book like
25:36 the 1640s or something like that
25:38 i apologize if i have that off should be
25:41 that far off if it is
25:43 okay well that's their word for
25:45 themselves and in that book
25:47 i watched a whole documentary on this
25:49 book
25:51 many years ago but they talk about the
25:52 stretch and the squeeze
25:55 so you stretch out all of their
25:56 resources to the point everyone's living
25:59 on fumes and then even the fumes
26:03 you start to regulate that breathing
26:05 apparatus
26:07 so people cough it up what's happening
26:10 right now
26:12 we're in the playbook of the illuminati
26:14 book
26:15 we've had our income destroyed by
26:18 infiltrators
26:20 people who again i don't think could
26:22 pass the basic immigration
26:24 test we have businesses that pretend
26:27 like
26:29 there are no problems in the world
26:32 meaning they're still charging you full
26:34 amounts of money even though you're not
26:36 legally allowed in some cases to work at
26:38 all
26:40 because there are some careers out there
26:41 where people just it's getting a little
26:43 better right now but it's
26:45 some people have completed about 10
26:47 months without any ability to earn
26:49 income
26:51 they don't have a bunch of skills they
26:53 they never
26:54 were told as children you better have
26:56 five careers because
26:57 when pandemics come around you're gonna
26:59 have to
27:01 switch to one of the other careers and
27:03 they need to be really
27:05 diametrically opposed careers so they're
27:08 completely
27:08 different sectors of the world and you
27:10 have to keep your skills
27:12 100 employable in those areas
27:15 does that make any sense um
27:20 for instance you can't just casually be
27:22 in my opinion
27:23 a coder on the side you need to keep up
27:26 you need to practice you need to have
27:28 projects you need to be assigned to
27:30 things
27:30 you need to be challenged beyond your
27:32 capacity to imagine a challenge
27:35 so that can't be a fallback career it's
27:37 got to be your primary career
27:39 pick any other career with any
27:41 technology in it and that's going to be
27:42 the case
27:44 if you put down electronics for a little
27:45 while a year passes two years passes and
27:48 you want to pick it back up again
27:50 well unless you have someone employing
27:51 you for the legacy knowledge that you
27:53 had maybe as a niche or something
27:56 you're going to need to know the more
27:57 recent stuff
27:59 so they have us leaned out they're
28:02 giving us ridiculously low
28:04 stimulus checks i have never received a
28:06 stimulus check
28:07 completely qualify for them i've got a
28:09 dead friend that got one
28:10 and i got a guy who's uh many people
28:12 who've never stopped working
28:15 have collected all those checks plus
28:17 unemployment a bunch of other stuff
28:19 and i'm not knocking those individuals
28:21 i'm just telling you how ludicrous the
28:22 system is he can't find the people that
28:24 should get them
28:26 it's interesting and the main group i'm
28:28 talking about
28:29 friends of mine that are really
28:32 suffering way more than myself
28:35 they need those checks they need them
28:38 they're not getting them
28:39 it's crazy there's a kid out there that
28:42 did a video
28:43 a bunch of you have most likely seen it
28:45 he's calling himself
28:47 it's like underscore the underscore real
28:49 underscore samson
28:51 underscore and it doesn't have a p in it
28:53 i
28:54 i thought there was a spelling that had
28:55 a p in it but it's s a s-a-m-s-o-n
28:58 samson and the kid does a rhyme about
29:01 the fact that he is doing a rap and he's
29:03 this white kid in the middle of nowhere
29:04 he's like a gen z
29:06 and he's out there saying look i work
29:07 all day long apparently like repairs
29:10 cars or something and he said you know i
29:12 come home and i'm scrubbing the
29:14 grit out of my fingernails and then i
29:16 hold up my check to my friends and they
29:18 laugh at me because they're making twice
29:19 as much money as me
29:20 living off the door living off the state
29:23 living off the checks
29:26 he's like they're making fun of me
29:28 because i'm working really hard to earn
29:29 nothing
29:31 he's right 100 right
29:34 the game apparently is to bankrupt
29:36 everyone in the planet for this economic
29:38 reset for this huge digital currency
29:41 that's going to be coming our way i've
29:43 seen the leader of the imf talk about it
29:44 and meetings before this whole
29:46 thing happened last year and now we've
29:49 had this
29:50 bizarre four years in america
29:54 you will see that the intellectual
29:55 conservatives are behaving
29:57 like adults
30:00 what's interesting is all the ball
30:02 babies on the other side are
30:04 finally calming down thinking that
30:05 they've knocked it out of the park with
30:08 an illegal selection process
30:11 don't mention that we're behaving really
30:13 well and that they behaved really bad
30:15 they just want to join your party as if
30:18 they're intellectuals
30:20 when they are the absolute inverse
30:23 they're flying the plane into the ground
30:26 they're giving away
30:27 everything it's the great giveaway
30:31 that's the phase that they're in depends
30:34 on how
30:34 young you are how vested you are in this
30:36 world how many dreams you still
30:38 have on your quiver that you'd like to
30:40 live
30:41 things that are very important to you
30:42 before you die
30:44 as to how this will affect you how
30:46 important this is to you
30:48 so let's do a little current event recap
30:51 here
30:52 because i think you guys completely
30:54 understand that
30:56 and you're good preachers of that
30:57 information
30:59 so there was this weird movement that
31:01 started in
31:02 the tail end of 2017
31:05 grew bigger and 18 grew bigger 19
31:10 even larger in 2020. there were all
31:13 these commitments
31:15 about what was going to take place we
31:17 were even told
31:19 we were told a lot of conflicting
31:20 information you know sit back
31:23 watch the show you don't need to do
31:25 anything
31:27 nothing can stop what's going to happen
31:30 i you know nothing's going to stop
31:32 what's going to happen and that's just
31:34 an absolute statement of truth right
31:36 yeah whatever's going to happen is going
31:37 to happen
31:38 [Music]
31:39 doesn't mean it's going to be what you
31:41 think is going to happen or what you
31:42 want
31:44 but you're right i mean this this
31:45 movement was right a bunch of stuff's
31:47 going to happen
31:47 and you can't stop it so the
31:51 rumors you know i've done a fireside
31:53 chat i did a limbo
31:55 part one then i listened to both of them
31:59 back
31:59 after releasing the second one and then
32:02 i was watching new information
32:05 and i realized that i don't have the
32:07 right to be
32:08 saying certain things the way i was
32:10 saying them to create any type of false
32:12 hope
32:13 even though there might be a really
32:14 wonderful thing about to occur
32:17 i don't want to phrase things the way i
32:19 phrase them so this particular episode
32:21 we're going to button it up with
32:24 a recap of what might be possible
32:30 but the quieter it gets the less action
32:33 that we see
32:34 and believe me i know that these people
32:36 are trying to look at every single video
32:38 on planet earth and every picture to try
32:40 to extort another
32:42 round of trust from us the people
32:46 but just remember there was that old uh
32:50 it was like a warner brothers cartoon
32:52 invention but i've seen it in film as
32:54 well
32:54 i think papa used to do this but you do
32:57 the big wind up you're moving your
32:59 right hand and you get the person you're
33:02 boxing to look at your right hand look
33:04 over here look over here and then you
33:05 punch him with a left jab
33:06 and you knock him out look over there
33:10 while we do this to you over here now
33:13 what's funny about it is when i look
33:14 back at all my episodes
33:16 it's like you didn't need this movement
33:18 dude
33:19 to really become awake and figure this
33:21 stuff out but
33:22 the way that this guy this group of
33:24 people
33:25 potentially complete fraudsters set this
33:28 thing up was
33:29 quite brilliant it almost feels like an
33:33 ai that was set up with
33:37 this movement as part of its programming
33:39 and there was always a post by this
33:42 leader of this group to say wait till
33:44 you find out who's talking to you you're
33:46 going to be amazed when you find out
33:47 who's talking to you
33:49 and a lot of people thought that meant
33:52 you know like jfk junior or
33:55 i don't know somebody that'd be like the
33:58 only person that would be really like
33:59 shocking what if the answer is you're
34:02 just listening to a computer
34:04 set you up you're testing it
34:07 it's some quantum computer that maybe
34:09 has the ability to
34:10 really really really emulate humanity at
34:13 this point
34:13 remember the in my last ai
34:17 episode i was talking about and even in
34:20 the quantum
34:21 computer episode as i explained what
34:23 those computers are
34:25 you could have an ai teaching ai
34:28 how to behave better more human
34:32 by analyzing human behavior everything
34:35 we're doing is
34:36 digitized today was another one of these
34:39 uh
34:40 facebook challenges to post an old
34:42 picture of yourself
34:44 and a new picture of yourself side by
34:45 side thus giving
34:48 these ais these uh
34:52 minority report computers the ability to
34:54 do analysis
34:55 on your growth pattern facebook is all
34:58 about
34:58 face recognition people give me all this
35:02 crap about wearing sunglasses all the
35:03 time
35:04 like that's a big part of the algorithm
35:06 isn't it
35:08 probably needs a couple photos of you
35:09 and they got you so i'm in the system
35:11 too of course
35:12 i'm blind to what was going on before i
35:14 woke up
35:16 so the big rumor is that the
35:19 we know that the united states of
35:20 america is both a country
35:24 that's governed by the constitution but
35:26 we also know that
35:28 it's a corporation that
35:31 operates under maritime law within the
35:33 washington dc area which is its own
35:35 sovereign country
35:37 just like the vatican's its own country
35:38 and london is its own country
35:41 the london one i didn't know and i've
35:43 heard this mentioned several times
35:44 recently
35:45 so if that's an incorrect statement it's
35:47 only because i've heard it in the last
35:49 90 days i knew there were districts that
35:53 were like that but i didn't realize
35:54 they were saying the whole the whole
35:56 city is like that and the fact that
35:58 the queen has to have permission to come
35:59 into the city of london i believe she
36:02 there's a place that she goes to get
36:03 permission to go in
36:04 that sounds really weird to me because i
36:06 was in london went to buckingham palace
36:07 and
36:09 i thought i was still in the same city
36:10 man i don't know not going to claim to
36:12 have a lot of knowledge of
36:14 britain but there was a weird thing and
36:17 i
36:17 i think the year is 2019 but
36:21 the federalreserve.com and i don't know
36:24 if you guys remember but dot com means
36:26 commercial property
36:27 commercial business for profit
36:31 suddenly change to dot gov
36:34 which means it's a government-owned
36:35 property now which should be technically
36:38 and completely impossible without some
36:40 crazy imminent domain on your company
36:44 that is supposed to be an indicator that
36:46 this
36:47 united states of america corporation was
36:49 dissolved during donald trump's
36:50 administration
36:53 the federal reserve that creates our
36:54 fiat currency can't remain a private
36:56 for-profit
36:58 corporation creating the money for a
37:00 sovereign nation under a republic
37:04 apparently the last president united
37:06 states that was elected was
37:08 the 18th president of the united states
37:10 and everyone since then has been a ceo
37:12 of this corporation
37:14 but we call them president and we put
37:15 them in history books as such
37:17 even though technically they're ceos
37:21 and quite frankly there could be any
37:22 position that you want to create in the
37:23 corporation you could
37:25 you could call it president of the
37:26 corporation
37:28 we just don't say inc after we say it
37:30 right
37:32 so this big thing has been hatched by
37:37 this movement although that dude hasn't
37:39 posted anything since
37:40 december 8th last year we should tell
37:42 you that grouper's been eliminated
37:45 entirely whoever that group was in my
37:48 opinion they were found
37:50 and they were murdered or the next best
37:54 thing
37:54 for them i truly believe that
37:57 i would love to be wrong trust me not
38:00 trying to be a
38:00 buzz kill but now we got some
38:03 personalities that ended up showing up
38:05 out of thin air
38:07 this gentleman who goes by the name of
38:09 juan osavin
38:10 seems like a patriot definitely likes
38:13 the limelight
38:17 i think charlie ward was the guy that uh
38:19 said his real name and i just wasn't
38:21 paying attention but it could be someone
38:22 else one of those
38:23 other ones but you have two brits
38:25 charlie wart
38:27 and you have which is an he's an ex
38:30 hotel air it looks like he said
38:34 and you have uh simon parks you have
38:36 x-22
38:38 red pill bunch of these people good
38:40 people
38:42 uh at least some of those names are
38:44 genuinely genuinely good people
38:46 some of them are not sure because they
38:48 keep talking about all this stuff that's
38:49 going to be taking place or that is
38:50 taking place
38:52 i think with the two gentlemen from
38:54 britain they can just riff
38:56 whatever they think is occurring just
38:57 like i'm riffing to you
39:00 107 claims to be embedded in that
39:03 movement
39:04 simon parks says he's also talking with
39:08 on an open line which makes no sense at
39:11 all okay
39:13 with this individual that that
39:14 individual who's the leader of that
39:16 movement
39:17 that we're talking about calls him in
39:19 england and has a conversation
39:22 i can assure you that's most likely not
39:23 the case whether he believes that or not
39:26 is a different thing
39:27 reason being is that voice recognition
39:33 would pick up on who this person is and
39:35 there would they would be just a minute
39:36 or two before they would know exactly
39:38 who that individual was by
39:39 cross-referencing it with other suspect
39:41 suspects of that origin
39:44 so i don't buy it i don't buy that this
39:47 person is making phone calls to
39:48 individuals in the world and not posting
39:51 on a [ __ ] i don't believe it
39:54 a bunch of weird stuff's going on
39:57 prime minister of italy i think resigned
40:00 they said i've heard one rumor he was
40:01 arrested
40:02 okay whatever don't know definitely some
40:05 dude in the italian
40:07 courts admitted that the leonardo
40:09 satellites were definitely leased the
40:11 vatican and used to steal
40:13 votes from literally quote donald j
40:16 trump
40:17 over to joe biden okay
40:20 no international news on that one
40:21 because that would mess up the
40:24 plan a bad one
40:28 vatican lost all of its power it was
40:31 black
40:32 for several hours they say oh that means
40:35 that there was some sort of raid on that
40:36 place and a bunch of guys are in jail
40:39 okay the white house lost power
40:43 probably the most mysterious bizarre
40:45 thing see i can't believe
40:46 for an instant that the vatican doesn't
40:48 have
40:50 backup lights a generator i don't buy
40:52 that
40:53 it's that place has more treasures in it
40:55 than any other location on the planet of
40:57 this earth
40:58 except for perhaps buried in the soil of
41:01 egypt
41:03 maybe to be the only contender i could
41:05 think of the white house of the united
41:07 states
41:08 was black and i don't know if this was
41:11 something orchestrated but you wouldn't
41:13 want
41:13 a very important home location
41:16 government building to be
41:18 dark because that allows infiltrators to
41:21 physically get on the building and i
41:22 don't care how many
41:24 gunmen you have and all this other stuff
41:26 it would make it more difficult
41:29 to see them even if you have infrared
41:31 and all this other stuff
41:33 i'm sure that building's got insane
41:34 security right
41:36 then all of a sudden there's a giant
41:37 searchlight out front the kind you use
41:40 in a movie set to light the whole room
41:42 like the whole parking lot could have
41:44 been in response to losing the power
41:47 we see weird prison buses touring all
41:50 around
41:51 dc with no imminent threat right
41:53 republicans don't do the stuff that the
41:55 other folks do
41:57 so what's interesting is the the sources
42:00 that we're working from
42:02 to make up this dying plan thing right
42:05 because they kept calling it the plan
42:08 and i just read um a few minutes ago
42:10 that jeff bezos
42:11 just dropped out of uh being the ceo
42:14 of amazon
42:18 which you know i would too man
42:21 why not you got more money than god just
42:23 go and enjoy your life man
42:26 no one's getting any younger why do you
42:28 need to be a control freak
42:30 so that's cool someone's gonna say it's
42:33 part of the plan
42:34 someone's gonna say he's part of the
42:38 arrests or whatever
42:40 most likely not so now the assertion
42:44 is is that the gentleman that just
42:49 was technically kind of erroneously
42:52 sworn in
42:53 uh using what looks like a hollywood set
42:56 somewhere
42:58 isn't actually the president of the
43:01 united states
43:02 he has sworn himself into a dead
43:04 corporation
43:06 there's ample evidence that they change
43:07 the camera feed
43:09 as if he just simply put his hand on a
43:12 book
43:14 they switched the feed and people behind
43:15 him switched and
43:17 two girls disappeared i mean i think
43:19 that's really legit
43:21 and that he's actually on a movie set
43:23 not actually swearing in not actually
43:25 committing a crime
43:26 that he's being accused of technically i
43:29 got other crimes perhaps
43:32 and that somehow somehow between now
43:35 february 2nd
43:36 and march 4th the previous president
43:39 united states is going to be reinstated
43:40 somehow some way
43:42 may never go to the white house again
43:44 may ever go to d.c again
43:46 may never carry the name again of
43:49 president
43:51 because there may be a better name for
43:53 that that's a little bit more for the
43:54 people for you know by the people
43:57 i have no clue what you would call that
43:58 besides maybe commander in chief or
44:00 whatever
44:01 i don't have any problem with the p word
44:03 but yeah somehow this is all going to be
44:05 made
44:05 a public
44:08 through some emergency broadcast message
44:13 and everything's gonna be great it's a
44:15 hell of a thing to ask people to have
44:17 faith
44:18 in something as pivotal as the great
44:21 giveaway
44:22 or the great awakening or the rebirth of
44:25 this world
44:26 it's a heavy heavy thing to do to
44:28 another human being
44:30 it's very frustrating that it would have
44:32 to be orchestrated as such
44:34 we are trying to fix a problem
44:37 that at its most fundamental cause
44:41 is secrecy the jfk
44:44 speech he gave apparently just a few
44:47 weeks before he died about secret
44:48 societies and the fact that we can't
44:50 tolerate them and that
44:52 good human beings would never want to be
44:53 in a situation where these people
44:56 could get things done through quote
44:58 covet means
45:00 but what is the actual tactic right now
45:03 of this
45:04 great reset supposed thing right this
45:08 plan
45:08 thing it's by covet means
45:12 it's secret now do we want to line up
45:15 like the old british soldiers did in the
45:17 revolution and just get
45:18 picked off by the minutemen who were
45:20 hiding in the shadows
45:22 of course not but i think that through
45:26 just sheer mathematics
45:28 of the command structure of the united
45:30 states military if they are truly still
45:32 bound to the constitution if they truly
45:34 don't want to marginalize
45:35 the deaths of everyone that is at least
45:37 in their mind died for the constitution
45:40 regardless of the wars have been noble
45:41 or not
45:43 orchestrated or not they have enough
45:46 power to go and do it
45:48 right now to not do it through covet
45:50 means
45:51 to simply say i don't think so
45:54 to arrest the supposed cabal of
45:58 criminals
45:59 when they were all in one place on one
46:00 particular day
46:02 but then we get into the same formula of
46:05 the people that tell us they can't admit
46:08 whether or not we've ever made any
46:09 contact with aliens because
46:12 you know we can handle it we can be
46:14 randomly informed
46:15 that aliens exist and be just fine
46:18 but you can't be randomly informed that
46:20 aliens exist because you're going to go
46:22 crazy which is completely bunk
46:25 completely bunk i think it was stanton
46:28 friedman who
46:29 was in a special once and they asked him
46:32 once what do you think would happen if
46:34 they did make contact with
46:35 humanity aliens from another planet or
46:38 another dimension or whatever
46:40 and i think it was him that said
46:44 well people still have to pay rent
46:46 people still have to eat
46:47 they still have to educate their
46:48 children so life is going to go on
46:51 just fine it would seem like a big deal
46:54 in one day
46:55 and then it would just temper down
46:57 because people have to do what they have
46:58 to do to survive
47:00 would your stomach's not going to get
47:01 hungry because you have photographic
47:03 proof of an alien
47:04 maybe even saw one in your neighborhood
47:06 and walking by hey what's up
47:08 nano man same thing applies to these
47:12 this plan that's supposed to be
47:13 occurring
47:15 in my opinion okay so a bunch of people
47:18 got arrested
47:20 evidence through surveillance and a
47:22 bunch of other
47:24 means eyewitnesses whatever
47:27 them saying stuff illegal on tv
47:31 i don't buy it i don't buy that they
47:34 couldn't have gone with the original
47:35 impression of the plan so now what
47:38 they're trying to say like the 107 guys
47:41 and you know that dude could be getting
47:42 played as well he could think he's
47:44 connected to this movement
47:46 they could have played that guy for
47:47 three years as a disinfo
47:49 guy who literally believes everything
47:51 he's told sort of a
47:54 an inverse formula of project
47:55 mockingbird
47:57 as rod sterling said in 59 his interview
48:00 in 59 he says they're pre-censoring
48:02 people
48:04 explanation is find someone who believes
48:06 all the hype
48:07 and you don't have to indoctrinate them
48:09 they automatically gravitate to the hype
48:12 i will say this to you as a word of
48:14 encouragement for
48:15 really no rational reason whatsoever
48:19 which is i feel good
48:22 for some reason and i am by no means
48:26 sold out to any of these notions of what
48:28 they think they're going to be doing to
48:29 the world
48:31 do i have morbid curiosity of what that
48:33 would look like and how the
48:36 folks that will truly hate it
48:39 will respond to it yeah totally right
48:42 these kids that can't be told what to do
48:44 are ushering in an orillian world
48:47 or getting told what to do will be
48:50 exactly
48:50 what happens in my opinion those
48:54 individuals will
48:55 if this you know let's just say this uh
48:58 this sort of thx world shows up and it's
49:00 nuts and it's fascist and all this other
49:02 stuff which is what they seem to love
49:04 even though they think they're against
49:05 it
49:07 they will all be eliminated either
49:10 through self-elimination
49:11 or the state will eliminate them because
49:13 they actually can't handle what they've
49:15 ushered in
49:16 and then those of us that are more
49:17 rational and awake
49:20 will be in a situation to either fight
49:23 if we can
49:24 or to tolerate it so imagine that the
49:27 people that ushered in are gone
49:28 it's just like every time they took over
49:29 a country in south america
49:32 the dissidents that helped overthrow the
49:34 government well they go back to the
49:35 country they came from
49:37 or they they rot under the new
49:39 totalitarianism
49:40 they didn't understand that they were
49:42 doing because they had such small brains
49:44 they didn't know what they were doing
49:47 it's just
49:48 indigenous they're everywhere every
49:51 country
49:52 has this group of people right the
49:54 implications of this whole
49:57 pivotal moment in history is so
50:01 unbelievably
50:04 destructive to the entire planet
50:08 that it is beyond my comprehension
50:11 to understand if the plan didn't happen
50:15 that the united states military somehow
50:18 stands down
50:20 and allows this cabal to take over the
50:23 place
50:24 it's literally the last play it's the
50:26 last
50:27 paralyzing coup de gras take out move
50:30 the military united states will be
50:32 dissolved
50:34 but they'll also be told to fight a war
50:36 at the same time they're being dissolved
50:37 use up all the ammo use up all the stuff
50:39 no one's gonna we're gonna go back to
50:41 the old
50:42 um post 911 stuff where
50:45 we literally had to put together money
50:47 to give to people
50:48 so their kids could have body armor so
50:51 they wouldn't
50:52 die from a single bullet
50:55 because they weren't funded all the way
50:57 during that whole bush
50:59 retaliation about 9 11 we were not
51:02 taking care of our soldiers at all but
51:05 we're the richest country in the world
51:07 we're giving billions and billions off
51:08 to other countries for stupid programs
51:10 and we're not protecting our soldiers
51:14 and what i keep telling you they want
51:16 our alpha males to go die in war
51:19 if nothing else they just want them out
51:22 of the country so that when there's some
51:24 sort of
51:25 physical takeover of the country the
51:26 homeland they're not there
51:29 and our last president brought them all
51:31 home to make sure they were here
51:32 in case something occurred built it back
51:35 up
51:36 funded them properly for some reason
51:39 this
51:39 sovereign country of washington dc
51:42 probably has about
51:43 10 to 20 million dollars worth of
51:46 chain-link fences with barbed wire all
51:48 over them
51:49 soldiers walking around everywhere
51:53 there's two theories of course one
51:55 they're all being
51:57 used to catch the bad guys which boy
52:00 you're certainly taking your time
52:02 make sure you don't go too far our
52:04 congress wanted to recess so they're all
52:06 in their individual
52:07 locations i can't imagine that's a huge
52:09 problem for finding them and arresting
52:11 them if this
52:12 fantasy comes true or they're supposed
52:16 to be there because they're defending
52:17 against an
52:18 impending military action to actually do
52:21 the plan which doesn't make any
52:23 mechanical sense because those troops
52:25 would simply get a
52:27 call from their commanding officer to
52:29 step down take a knee
52:30 while the other guys go in or assist
52:33 that doesn't make any sense to me the
52:35 former president has been extremely
52:37 quiet
52:38 talking about creating a new party
52:40 talking about creating this new office
52:42 of the former president united states
52:45 never has said that he conceded
52:48 never mentioned the other dude's name in
52:50 a speech
52:52 we know that when uh mr biden
52:56 was leaving his inauguration supposedly
52:59 in the
52:59 limousine headed over the white house
53:02 the
53:04 national guard that was looking at him
53:07 didn't salute him but all this super
53:10 active duty 10th infantry guys
53:13 didn't look at him turned around and
53:15 looked the other way
53:17 which initially was construed as well
53:20 they're protecting that front
53:21 right because someone runs at the car
53:23 from the other side well
53:25 there's no one allowed in that entire
53:27 area place is all chained off there are
53:28 troops on the other side of the park
53:30 so i don't know how anyone runs on the
53:32 soccer field naked it's just not
53:34 possible so keeping your back turned
53:36 seem like a very strategic thing it
53:38 seems very encouraging
53:39 if this thing is true or not
53:43 but what if it is all a big larp
53:46 if the whole thing's been a lie that
53:49 means that a few of my friends who had
53:51 that early concern about being
53:53 lulled into a false sense of security
53:55 for an immediate elimination at some
53:57 future point in time
53:59 is true and what's really interesting
54:01 about that is the friend that vocalized
54:03 that to me which i then shared with you
54:05 guys in a previous episode
54:07 but be careful about this movement
54:08 because it could be that
54:10 that alternate you know plan actually
54:13 flipped about a year
54:15 ago and thought oh my god this is
54:18 actually real
54:19 they had seen a collection of things
54:22 that occurred
54:23 that made them feel like this was real
54:25 which was shocking to me
54:27 because i'm sort of on the fence i mean
54:28 for everyone who's seen every single
54:30 episode
54:31 you know i've been reaming this
54:34 this letter floating around the internet
54:36 because it's like
54:39 it's time to poop or get off the pot if
54:41 you know what i mean and i never saw any
54:44 bowel movements the entire time it is
54:47 nice to see
54:49 the internet become slightly nicer on at
54:51 least facebook for me
54:53 twitter's still a place where the devil
54:57 controls your soul man second you touch
55:00 that platform
55:02 you got a black apple pushed into your
55:04 heart trying to
55:08 bait you into the worst version of
55:10 yourself that you could possibly
55:12 manifest
55:13 and then to lock
55:16 your bad behavior in time
55:20 but there was a weird one that uh
55:24 right after that uh january 10th event
55:29 the president's son did a video that
55:31 said or he's screaming into the
55:33 microphone
55:35 the best is yet to come he screams it
55:38 again because his
55:39 girlfriend or wife or whatever walks
55:41 over and says that wasn't good enough
55:43 and so yells it again and then she says
55:44 still not good enough let me show you
55:46 how it's done and then she screams this
55:48 thing well i don't think there's any
55:51 best is yet to come unless that january
55:54 10th event is actually illegitimate
55:56 because that january 10th event
55:58 if legitimate authorizes enough
56:02 power to upset the apple cart
56:06 in a really bad way god
56:09 is apparently real important again in
56:11 people's lives
56:14 people i know who have never been
56:15 religious
56:17 are now religious and people who were
56:19 religious
56:20 are now calling you know end times
56:24 okay at the same time
56:27 it goes back to that alien invasion or
56:29 alien visitation i should say
56:31 analogy which is you gotta eat you gotta
56:34 make money
56:36 so until one of the other thing happens
56:40 we gotta go on with our lives we have to
56:43 stop focusing on the negative
56:46 because you're going to be eaten alive
56:48 by it
56:49 you're going to use that as an algorithm
56:51 to attract bad things to yourself
56:54 you don't want any of that stuff it's
56:56 already hard enough right
56:58 i get a lot of text messages throughout
57:00 the week from very close friends of mine
57:03 both feeding me information that i
57:06 haven't seen before
57:07 and or coming to me to say what's the
57:10 latest what's going on what do you think
57:11 is
57:12 going to occur well what's interesting
57:15 about it is you probably have
57:17 one of two of you listening if you're in
57:19 the same position i'm in
57:20 you've kept up on the information as
57:22 best you can
57:25 the again the pundits that used to talk
57:27 well one a bunch of them got
57:29 knocked off the platforms that you can
57:30 watch to your television
57:32 so now you're watching to your cell
57:33 phone you're watching it through a web
57:34 browser
57:37 and they're starting to get silenced a
57:39 bunch of them are getting nervous
57:41 some are you know still hanging on for
57:43 dear life
57:45 they've built up followers they they've
57:47 been able to monetize
57:48 aspects of what they do
57:52 it's really strange because there'll be
57:54 i forgot that dr
57:56 steve guy he's got a beard he's got a
57:59 slightly heavy set guy he's written
58:01 several books he does a video every day
58:04 fully monetized he has monetization
58:07 inside his videos
58:08 and for some reason they don't have any
58:09 problem with that guy saying generally
58:11 the same thing that the other people say
58:15 he's got hundreds of thousands of
58:16 followers there's guys with the same
58:18 amount
58:20 that been kicked off uh salty crackers
58:23 still there
58:24 you know i just don't know how they're
58:26 picking and choosing
58:28 who's a bad influence and who's a good
58:29 influence
58:31 it does seem like this is the weirdest
58:36 transition of leadership that i've ever
58:38 witnessed in my life in this country or
58:40 any modern country
58:42 in my life it seems like it's
58:46 hollow it seems like it's not real it
58:49 seems like if it were real
58:51 other more concrete things would be
58:52 occurring
58:54 now it's one thing to sign a bunch of
58:56 blank pages and
58:58 then they tell you later what was in the
58:59 what were on those pages and
59:02 let's say a pipeline was canceled and so
59:05 the
59:05 i've heard mixed stories about how
59:06 that's going on i've heard
59:08 the video from the guy at the pipeline
59:10 going yep we're all losing our jobs
59:14 i've seen four or five videos of guys
59:16 now talking from their homes since they
59:18 moved back to where they live in the
59:19 united states
59:21 and then i heard a report that
59:22 everyone's still going to work in a
59:23 bunch of those places they're ignoring
59:26 the shutdown well which one is it man
59:29 i can't figure it out i don't know
59:30 anyone on the pipeline
59:32 we know it's a kickback for warren
59:34 buffett
59:35 who put in about 50 i think around 58
59:37 million dollars
59:39 into the opposition group and so he's
59:41 getting his money back because they're
59:43 going to create a carbon footprint now
59:45 moving oil on trains instead of moving
59:47 it through a pipe
59:49 which is completely carbon free if it's
59:52 built correctly right it doesn't spill
59:54 anywhere
59:55 we're going to go from energy
59:57 independent to energy dependent
60:00 the green new deal is getting a full
60:02 blown full throttle
60:04 movement even though it's practically
60:08 on paper financially impossible to
60:11 achieve
60:13 guys in their 50s are being told to just
60:15 find another job
60:17 as one gentleman said he goes look i
60:18 spent my entire life 30 years of my life
60:21 becoming an expert
60:22 at what i do i have a lifestyle
60:26 that aligns with the income that i can
60:29 generate through this very specialized
60:31 job that i have and now the president
60:33 united states just told me
60:35 to go find another job or that i can
60:38 find another job
60:39 oh sure maybe he could find another job
60:42 with you know i don't know
60:44 60 million people looking for work in
60:45 the united states there's all these jobs
60:47 supposedly available for these people
60:50 they're going to lose their standard of
60:51 living
60:53 right in their retirement years getting
60:56 a job between 50 and 60
60:58 you better be a specialist between 60
61:00 and 70
61:01 near impossible near in
61:04 possible in the united states of america
61:08 can't take your um your full social
61:11 security benefits i think until you're
61:13 at least 70.
61:15 not enough to pay any bills depending on
61:17 where you live
61:18 because they always seem to give you a
61:20 check just slightly smaller than what
61:22 you need to survive
61:24 so then what the stock market had this
61:27 really weird thing happen with
61:29 gamestop and amc theaters
61:32 a bunch of people are excited about it
61:33 good friend of mine
61:35 actually made some money off that he
61:37 didn't put a lot in so he wasn't nuts or
61:39 anything he's just a normal guy
61:41 so good for him but i'm going to tell
61:43 you right now
61:45 that one of the greatest scams on the
61:48 average human being
61:50 is this lottery ticket model of life
61:53 which is
61:53 playing the stock market
61:56 these people have no money making money
61:58 to get anything done that they need done
61:59 the money is created and immediately
62:01 handed over to these investment banking
62:03 houses which
62:04 then immediately invested in those
62:06 gigantic corporations they don't need
62:08 your money
62:08 they like your money but they don't need
62:10 it it's a mechanism to offer the world
62:13 this again nonsensical
62:16 system to earn money
62:20 and yeah you may have had nothing but
62:22 profit in these
62:23 regions and good for you man good for
62:26 you
62:27 some of you might do like uh the day
62:30 trader stuff where you're making
62:31 microtransactions in minutes buy and
62:34 sell within
62:35 five minutes and to make a little bit of
62:37 scratch here and there
62:39 but just like vegas odds the peasant
62:43 which is us and their eyes loses all
62:46 their savings loses all their money
62:48 they sort of bait you with this notion
62:50 you can be like us
62:52 rich and powerful just give us your
62:54 money and we'll be okay
62:57 there are famous cases where
63:00 and we you know once you realize this
63:02 you'll never put your money in those
63:04 systems again casually at least
63:06 or let's just say a hundred people put
63:10 their money into a company
63:13 well the company's not actually doing
63:14 too well and the insider trading which
63:16 is the way all of it's done at the
63:17 investment banking level they
63:19 they make the trends they make it with
63:22 news they make it with rumors
63:25 they realize this company is not going
63:27 to be generating much money in the next
63:29 quarter
63:30 to a year to two years maybe it's even
63:31 gonna be knocked out of business for
63:33 some other functional reason
63:35 maybe there's a lawsuit maybe their
63:36 medicine doesn't work maybe their
63:37 mechanical device doesn't
63:39 doesn't work or isn't being used by the
63:41 government contractor
63:43 so in order to bail out
63:46 the rich let's just say out of 100
63:49 people
63:50 20 of them are rich people and 80
63:52 percent of them are normal people
63:55 what investment banking houses have been
63:57 caught doing multiple times and believe
63:59 me this is happening every split second
64:01 that you've been alive
64:03 is that they tell the 80 percent if they
64:06 don't already have permission
64:08 to spend your money without your
64:10 knowledge
64:11 because you just surrendered to them to
64:13 manage your fund
64:15 your retirement they take all your money
64:17 and they give it to the twenty percent
64:20 then they cash the twenty percent out
64:22 the rich get richer
64:23 from the eighty percent money and it may
64:26 even be that the 20
64:27 that's invested is way more than 80
64:30 because they're richer
64:31 they don't lose any money they break
64:32 even and they get out but usually they
64:34 make money
64:36 then the 80 that invested
64:39 is going to be notified that they lost
64:41 all their money
64:43 maybe they give them a little bit of
64:44 money and roll it over into something
64:45 else but
64:46 for the most part they got robbed the
64:48 stock market
64:49 is not in my opinion a healthy way to
64:52 move your money around
64:54 it's just not
64:57 in the current financial system
65:00 if we reset the system to a sovereign
65:02 system a goal back system
65:05 if the republic were truly the way that
65:07 america was run
65:09 and all parties are dissolved because we
65:11 don't need to be
65:12 started with a divide you don't need to
65:14 start with the divide as much as you
65:15 might think so
65:16 america was founded without the
65:17 democratic party
65:20 in the 1830s we had three things occur
65:24 that were horrendous that have been
65:26 ripping this country apart ever since
65:29 we had the formation of the divide which
65:31 is the democratic party
65:33 and to be honest my statement in that
65:35 realm is not that
65:37 they are evil at that point it's just we
65:39 didn't need
65:40 to split it up to be an opposition
65:43 government
65:45 it's romantic on tv it's romantic if you
65:47 want to think you have a different
65:48 opinion someone else and there's
65:50 a party that's representing you but it's
65:52 unnecessary
65:54 your elected officials can represent you
65:56 without being on a different party
65:58 they simply represent you look at all
66:01 the ridiculous stuff we have where the
66:02 left aisle doesn't talk to the right
66:04 aisle
66:06 or the right side of the aisle
66:09 it's just romantic drama to make it feel
66:13 like a government
66:14 so that was the 1830s then you had the
66:17 skull
66:18 and bones move into yale university
66:21 their charter was to take over the
66:24 united states of america by all
66:26 financial means necessary which i
66:27 believe is the same thing the japanese
66:29 general said to
66:31 patton or whatever the hell the guy was
66:33 who took care of that on the boat
66:36 it's fair game for a foreign country
66:38 it's not a fair game for a
66:40 infiltrating company or group of people
66:42 secret society
66:44 but we also got out of the other party
66:46 this formation of a super racist group
66:48 called the kkk
66:51 which i don't know if exactly off the
66:53 top of my head
66:55 was the issue but we also had andrew
66:57 jackson in there who defeated the banks
66:59 and he's about to be taken out the 20
67:01 bill for a very strategic reason because
67:04 he's to be erased
67:06 this sudden introduction of that energy
67:10 became this force that we all had to
67:13 fight in the united states
67:17 your south was obviously very democratic
67:19 but not
67:20 really he had a bunch of european people
67:23 move in
67:24 start plantations with tons of money
67:26 bought lots of slaves because they had
67:28 tons of money
67:29 traded the slaves absolutely abysmal
67:32 creating this divide they had their
67:35 sort of militia group kkk to take care
67:38 of anybody who stood up against them
67:41 outside of the law so it's like the the
67:44 mercenary groups that the
67:46 vatican created during the crusades
67:49 you know the inquisitions i should say
67:52 so they were like hey it's not us
67:53 we don't we didn't kill anybody the
67:56 militia
67:57 the mercenaries did excuse me but this
68:00 rose up lincoln continued jackson's
68:04 sentiments he's murdered for it
68:08 we kind of fascinated around until about
68:11 1913 get the 16th amendment our money
68:13 system screwed forever
68:16 everything else has been a foregone
68:17 conclusion
68:19 democratic party fought against blacks
68:22 until the
68:22 70s when in some random day of which
68:25 they can't name
68:26 in a month they can't name in a year
68:27 they can't name they switched
68:29 they switched and also they're good
68:31 people but they also gave their
68:33 hatred to the other group which is the
68:35 most illogical thing you've ever heard
68:36 in your life
68:38 there's a party that has been pretty
68:41 good
68:42 not not perfect but pretty good about
68:45 sustaining human rights
68:47 that are inalienable to you because
68:48 you're born and there's a group that has
68:50 been judging you by the pigment of your
68:52 skin
68:54 after this fabled swish in the seventies
68:56 that those groups that were
68:58 hated by this party were then exploited
69:01 by that party
69:02 for votes but now they don't need them
69:06 anymore
69:07 why don't they need them anymore because
69:10 they got the voting system rigged
69:13 why should i worry about getting you
69:16 from your country to this country and
69:18 all that
69:18 negativity we have to spend our money on
69:22 all these fake fake promises we're gonna
69:23 make campaign stops
69:26 but now they don't have to say anything
69:27 to anybody well they might try to
69:30 throw some crumbs at them in the next
69:31 year or two but overall
69:34 a lot of the black communities saying
69:35 hey just replacing or putting harriet
69:37 tubman on the 20 is not actually
69:39 anything that we asked for they're not
69:42 criticizing it but they're like that's
69:44 that's not going to cover your
69:46 commitment to us do something for us
69:50 don't hold your breath man don't hold
69:52 your breath
69:53 but it's amazing how many friends of
69:55 mine that get indoctrinated into this
69:57 stuff and they'll sit there and
69:59 it's funny i'll get these conversations
70:01 and their nonsensical conversations
70:03 about
70:04 you know the damn yankees and all this
70:07 other stuff they just don't know history
70:09 to save their soul
70:11 and when you start talking to them
70:13 you're like okay you're on the phone
70:15 i don't want to have a four-hour
70:16 conversation about this because i don't
70:18 even know if you'll believe me if i tell
70:19 you the truth like the kgb guy said in
70:21 85.
70:23 it's other years and years and decades
70:25 and perhaps a whole lifetime in the past
70:27 believing propaganda the entire way
70:30 because all they care abouts being on
70:31 the winning team
70:33 they don't know what winning means why
70:36 because they
70:37 support groups that burn down cities
70:39 with no demands
70:42 come on if you have half of an
70:44 intelligence and you're starting a
70:45 a party go watch the life of brian
70:49 okay it's a comedy about a guy named
70:52 brian who was mistaken for jesus
70:54 but irrespective of that controlling
70:57 idea in the movie
70:59 go watch the first act or first half of
71:02 the film where they're meeting
71:04 it's it's all the pythons so i can't say
71:06 it's john here and
71:08 john cleese here and eric guttel there
71:09 but they're they're all meeting
71:11 to create these kind of
71:14 sensitive movements but they had demands
71:19 they had demands that they were writing
71:21 down in this ridiculous comedy
71:24 about their movements can't do this
71:26 anymore to us can't do that anymore we
71:28 have equal rights here
71:29 hey even in a comedy they were smart
71:32 enough to know that if you have a
71:33 movement you have demands
71:35 very strategic things that need to
71:36 change because you understand the
71:38 problem that you're complaining about
71:41 that's not what we're dealing with we're
71:43 dealing with an excuse
71:46 to lash out an excuse to give it all
71:49 away
71:51 and because these are really low
71:53 vibrations super low iq people not
71:55 necessarily bad people
71:57 in fact quite quite frankly good people
71:59 in most cases
72:00 but just misled they're giving it all
72:04 away
72:06 and what i have discovered is two things
72:09 and i think i might have mentioned this
72:11 in the other two episodes but what i
72:12 have surmised
72:15 from feedback is that the young 30 and
72:17 under
72:19 they love the masks they love all of
72:21 this control control control because
72:24 a child can call an adult and say are
72:26 you following all the rules because if
72:28 you're not i'm going to
72:29 chastise you personally and then i'll
72:31 tell on you if i can
72:33 i get to control you because i don't
72:34 control anything else
72:36 mainly my own life so i'm going to kind
72:39 of passively aggressively punish you
72:41 for creating such a crappy world
72:44 because they think that you're a part of
72:46 the problem
72:48 the other side is the folks that are
72:51 within 10 years of their death
72:54 they're getting kind of loopy because
72:55 they're old
72:57 but they just want some someone to
73:00 promise them on their deathbed that the
73:02 world's a better place
73:04 even if it's not they don't care
73:06 integrity and truth and honesty
73:08 those aren't factors that they consider
73:09 on a daily basis
73:11 they've been swallowing so much
73:12 propaganda it's how they manage their
73:15 lives
73:16 one of the things that i have been doing
73:18 is just calling people out on it you
73:20 know
73:21 very nicely but just saying oh i see so
73:23 we give up all these uh
73:25 freedoms to get more liberty more
73:27 liberty to give up freedoms like
73:29 or to get freedoms i mean all this
73:31 crosstalk and
73:33 double speak meanwhile we know that the
73:37 the thought police are gaining in number
73:41 it's still a pretty small number but
73:43 they control where you express yourself
73:45 in a lot of cases
73:47 people will be able to articulate
73:50 millions of reasons why
73:52 a particular social media platform is
73:54 bad but they can't stop going to it
73:56 every single day
73:58 we're guilty on this show i posted a
74:01 video on um
74:03 was at 107 daily which is 107's new site
74:07 it's just a video and a guy came in he
74:10 said hey this is a pretty good video but
74:11 it's still on
74:12 youtube it was like well
74:16 if i post it from bitshoot it's uh
74:19 it does no preview for it because for
74:21 whatever reason the the api
74:23 for that sort of more pleasant viewing
74:26 post
74:26 pleasant looking post with a picture so
74:29 you can see what the hell you're about
74:30 to click on
74:33 you can't do it so we're all stuck
74:36 to these platforms until they upgrade
74:38 which is very difficult
74:40 we know that there's a bunch of
74:41 conspiracies against them to
74:43 de-platform them when it walks like a
74:46 duck and quacks like a duck
74:47 it probably is a duck and when it looks
74:49 like a totalitarian
74:52 government a socialistic communistic
74:55 move
74:56 it probably is just that simple man
75:00 you don't have to do a bunch of research
75:01 man it's just right there in your face i
75:03 know i'm preaching to the choir
75:05 i just want to advance the dialogue in
75:07 your mind i want to advance the
75:09 sort of cause and effect models in your
75:11 minds that when you talk about this with
75:12 someone
75:14 you come in at a very deep level where
75:17 all of the low-hanging fruit stuff you
75:18 might say
75:20 you don't say it because one they've
75:22 probably already heard it anyway and it
75:23 wasn't affected the first time
75:26 but two you really want if you want to
75:28 affect change you're going to have to
75:29 have a slightly different message
75:32 a more effective message and i think the
75:35 greatest statement is the great giveaway
75:39 maybe we should start hashtagging the
75:40 hell out of that man anyway
75:44 my you know if you guys are probably
75:46 just asking me straight out so i'll just
75:48 give you the answer straight out
75:51 which is you know what in my faith that
75:52 there's going to be a miraculous
75:54 change in things it's kind of a two-fold
75:58 answer
76:00 i think that there's people out there
76:01 that are god-fearing people
76:03 who appear to be backstabbers and
76:05 treasonistic people
76:07 i have a suspicion that maybe some of
76:09 those people if anything good is going
76:10 to occur
76:11 are actually pretending that they're
76:13 moles
76:14 they're doing what has to be done
76:16 they're even taking it on the chin
76:18 any of you familiar with andre the giant
76:21 the wrestler who did his last match with
76:23 hulk hogan
76:25 it's all staged we know that it's
76:27 entertainment
76:28 but if any of you watch the documentary
76:30 on andre the giant you'll know what this
76:33 this what a mole has to do
76:36 which is andre had to go on stage with
76:39 almost a completely dysfunctional body
76:41 at the time
76:42 his back was hurting his knees were
76:43 hurting it was just he was in a lot of
76:45 pain
76:45 and hulk hogan had designed a fight such
76:47 that he would take advantage of
76:50 his more comfortable positions standing
76:52 up so they could have a fight
76:55 and he wasn't sure because andre never
76:56 confirmed with him that he was agreeing
76:58 to this fight
77:00 choreography but when he got into the
77:02 ring
77:03 one by one every single thing that hulk
77:06 wrote down
77:07 andre started doing and so he realized
77:09 oh my god he's going to give it to me
77:11 because andre was the hero his whole
77:13 career loved by the world one of the
77:15 most famous
77:16 wrestlers ever live but in order to give
77:20 the baton to hulk hogan they switched
77:23 the narrative where he's a bad guy
77:26 and so he is finishing his career and
77:29 all the fans out there the little kids
77:30 that think it's real
77:31 and the other fans that just go along
77:32 with whatever the funny story is about
77:34 him
77:36 pretended to hate him or did hate him
77:38 but he was the sweetest guy on planet
77:40 earth
77:41 he was going man i had to do this for my
77:42 business i can't do this anymore my body
77:45 doesn't work so i hand it over
77:47 my other suspicion that is again i've
77:50 already
77:51 put it into words a little bit here but
77:52 let me put it right on point
77:54 it does not make any sense to me
77:57 whatsoever
77:59 that the military at this stage with the
78:02 leadership they've had for four years
78:05 is going to lay down and let the
78:08 constitution be
78:10 destroyed i mean gone
78:14 all those rights that you enjoy gone
78:17 the economy that you've worked really
78:19 hard as an american to build up so that
78:21 you have a retirement
78:22 so your kids have a future gone
78:26 i find that super duper hard to believe
78:29 it goes back to that analogy i gave you
78:30 a superman one the movie with
78:32 christopher reeve
78:33 miss casbacher has superman in the tank
78:38 she's got some kryptonite on his neck he
78:40 can't
78:41 get out of the pool there's two nuclear
78:43 missiles that have been launched
78:45 one hit the east coast and one hit the
78:47 west coast
78:48 and she gets down in the water with him
78:50 and says if you
78:52 get rid of the eastbound missile where
78:54 my mother lives
78:56 because that's where it's going to hit
78:57 and i'll take this off your neck then
78:58 you can go get the west coast woman you
79:00 got to get my mom safe first
79:02 so having no choice superman agrees
79:06 he goes and rescues the east missile and
79:08 then his girlfriend gets killed
79:10 in the west missile and he does
79:12 something special to fix it right
79:16 i just have a hard time believing that
79:19 any commander in the military the united
79:21 states thinks that
79:22 this cabal winning destroying
79:25 all the foundation of the free world is
79:28 somehow not going to affect
79:30 that person individually in addition to
79:32 all their family members right
79:35 i mean if you think let's say you have
79:36 no one in military in your family
79:38 if you think that having a high-ranking
79:40 military official in your family
79:42 protects you
79:44 i mean i think you're smoking something
79:47 man
79:48 even if it was like we don't really have
79:49 any five-star generals united states but
79:51 let's just say you had the most highly
79:52 decorated general in your family
79:55 what could be the most that that guy
79:56 could do to save the whole family i mean
79:59 a family's a big thing it's your
80:01 wife it's your kids it's all your
80:03 relatives your brother your sister your
80:04 mom your dad all this other stuff what
80:05 could they possibly do
80:08 get a bus and put you in it and take you
80:09 to like
80:12 some mountain in colorado well that's
80:14 going to fill up really fast
80:16 what kind of future is that anyway it's
80:18 no future
80:19 i don't think they're that stupid but if
80:22 they do lay down
80:24 then what has been a very celebrated
80:26 institution at times
80:28 for supposedly fighting noble wars will
80:30 turn into
80:32 with the patriotic people that have been
80:35 empowering this institution since the
80:38 beginning of this country
80:39 to protect the freedoms protect the
80:41 constitution
80:42 they will be suddenly the worst traitors
80:46 in the world if this plan weren't to
80:48 take place
80:49 they would because it's one thing to be
80:51 the criminal that hatches a plan to
80:53 destroy a country
80:54 but it's another thing altogether
80:57 to have the training the capability
81:01 to quickly and peacefully for the most
81:04 part
81:05 short-circuit that sabotage put the
81:07 country back on its feet
81:09 and launch an era in the future of
81:11 mankind that man is
81:13 not experienced probably in
81:17 10 20 30 000 years
81:20 let's just say pre-dynastic egypt is a
81:22 benchmark
81:23 or maybe they lived in some euphoric
81:25 state of
81:26 the maximum that they were able to do
81:29 i just find that super hard to believe
81:32 and as part of me is just kind of like
81:34 well this is going to be an interesting
81:35 ending to the movie
81:36 either way because this big giant mighty
81:39 beast called the military-industrial
81:41 complex is going to lay down
81:45 and then forever be disrespected you got
81:47 a bat you know like today if you see a
81:49 soldier
81:51 you thank them for what they've done to
81:53 preserve the country
81:54 you're proud of them they're the best of
81:57 the best in a lot of cases
81:59 and all of a sudden to know
82:03 really credit of their own they were
82:05 told to stand down while this takeover
82:08 occurs
82:10 and i'm sure they've been told some
82:11 story that that's
82:13 a good thing when it's not
82:16 so i feel like something can definitely
82:20 still happen
82:21 i feel like it's logical but it sure is
82:24 quiet isn't it
82:28 there's the big thing about the 10 days
82:30 of darkness and all this other stuff and
82:32 everyone's trying to figure out what
82:33 those 10 days are
82:34 we i'm going to say we've had months and
82:37 months and months and probably even
82:39 years and decades and maybe even a few
82:41 centuries of some pretty dark days
82:44 we got plenty of that we don't need
82:46 anymore
82:47 it's time to nut up and get [ __ ] done in
82:50 my opinion but who am i
82:52 i'm just an opinion in the backyard
82:56 let me know what you think are you on
82:57 the fence do you think nothing's going
82:59 to happen
82:59 you think something's going to happen
83:02 what do you hope happens in the first
83:03 place
83:04 let's say that nothing happens from the
83:06 military side and this coup takes over
83:08 what do you hope happens then
83:09 and let's say they do take over what do
83:11 you hope and hope happens then
83:14 don't know we got two soldiers that
83:16 walked into two different lounges
83:17 cigar lounges in southern california
83:19 said that guantanamo bay is preparing
83:22 for
83:22 royalty they're prepping the soldiers to
83:26 tolera to
83:27 to not soften up to these really rich
83:29 people that are supposed to be in this
83:31 the newfound prison down there right
83:34 it's not it's not big enough to hold any
83:35 major of the
83:36 united states population there are a
83:39 bunch of fema camps all over the place
83:40 maybe those will
83:41 get involved that's difficult too
83:44 we're going to have a bunch of people
83:47 fighting with guns and stuff i find that
83:48 super hard to believe
83:50 there's just not enough military to
83:52 arrest the rest of the country
83:54 you know 350 million people and say you
83:56 had a 2 million army
83:57 that's nothing divide 2 by 350 that's
84:00 the percentage
84:02 move the decimal two places so anyway
84:07 if you haven't been to
84:08 deepthoughtsradio.com a good time to go
84:10 and bookmark it
84:11 i am still at this exact point doing my
84:14 research on ipec goat
84:17 uh what's very interesting about the
84:18 ipic goat video which again
84:21 if you hear me saying that you like the
84:22 show go see it
84:24 ipet goat too just watch the original
84:28 clip so that when i do the episode
84:31 you'll have already seen it and you'll
84:32 be ready to go
84:34 because i'm going to tell everyone at
84:34 the beginning of that episode if you
84:36 haven't seen it this
84:37 this this episode is going to make no
84:39 sense to you
84:41 but the biggest and best videos that
84:44 i've seen that have
84:45 analyzed this perfectly are all been
84:47 removed
84:48 from youtube or you can't find them one
84:50 way or the other you can even use
84:51 duckduckgo
84:53 you still can't find any good videos on
84:54 it anymore you find these blathering
84:56 idiots that god damn they just talked to
84:59 themselves for
85:00 30 minutes before they even start the
85:01 video i mean it's just unbelievable
85:04 so we'll get through it quick and then
85:05 we'll see we have some interesting new
85:08 conspiracies inside that video that i
85:10 had not heard when it first came out
85:13 i think alex jones's response to the
85:15 video is actually
85:16 very suspect and very weird he thought
85:19 it was the greatest thing on planet
85:20 earth and
85:21 that there was nothing there's nothing
85:23 satanic about it he said
85:25 there's a dude at the beginning of the
85:27 video with an
85:28 s ring on his finger which stands for
85:31 satan he's a reptile
85:32 hand and he's got a the marionette cross
85:35 you know with the strings going down and
85:37 he's holding
85:37 his right knuckle i mean this fingers
85:39 bleeding down the wires
85:41 yeah alex there's nothing satanic about
85:44 that at all
85:45 really really great journalism there
85:47 dude
85:48 i'm going to use the dirty word here
85:52 the world can suck really fast
85:55 by a group of people and this is where
85:58 the dirty word comes in because it's a
86:00 it's a phrase that describes these
86:02 people
86:03 and they're called star [ __ ]
86:07 um they do i just had an episode where i
86:10 talked about a guy that was doing this
86:12 at electronic arts he was bringing in
86:13 some super bad individual
86:17 and surrendering all the power to these
86:19 people because he wanted to be
86:20 he wanted to say he knew people in
86:22 hollywood so he's destroying the company
86:25 because he wants to meet someone who was
86:26 on a show once i mean
86:29 and this guy had met every famous
86:31 athlete on planet earth before he
86:33 started capitulating like this
86:34 so it's this weird addiction he has to
86:36 being hey i'm somebody i know this
86:38 famous person
86:40 believe me nothing there's nothing to
86:42 that game
86:44 nothing to that game you are still you
86:46 they are them
86:48 yeah you got a nice party order a big
86:50 deal it's over and you still got to go
86:51 home
86:52 it's not going to be you you know so
86:55 i think part of that was occurring in
86:56 alex jones's coverage of this thing
86:59 but yeah there's been a lot more
87:00 revealed about the individual who made
87:01 it and so that's good too
87:03 so we should have some phone with that
87:05 but again deepthoughtsradio.com it's got
87:07 everything you want on there
87:09 for those of you donating to the show i
87:10 always want to say thank you very much
87:12 there's a patreon without you
87:13 the show really doesn't go on to be
87:15 honest
