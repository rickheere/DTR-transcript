00:00 [Music]
00:33 gentlemen deep thoughts today I've
00:38 decided to talk about enlightenment just
00:40 about 60 seconds ago because I think I
00:44 finally got the the definition that's
00:46 good for me now my house is full of tons
00:52 of books so I've been given away a lot
00:54 of them but still have four bookshelves
00:58 packed and there's a have a section
01:02 that's yet history and philosophy in it
01:04 and you know I've read just tons of
01:10 stuff on what enlighten that is and how
01:13 to get enlightened for various
01:16 perspectives all right every book has
01:17 got it's um you know spiritual
01:21 enlightenment personal light my family
01:23 enlightenment you know work
01:24 enlightenment that kind of thing you
01:28 know all the way up to your existential
01:29 who are you enlightenment let me submit
01:33 a very basic definition of enlightenment
01:36 that will take every book that's ever
01:38 been written in every class that's been
01:40 getting given and every guru that's ever
01:43 spoken to all fit into one category
01:47 enlightenment for me means that you can
01:49 see more than you saw before you are
01:54 becoming more lightened the more in you
01:56 inform yourself to see more if you think
02:00 about it what are we trying to do on the
02:01 internet through a podcast like this or
02:05 some sort of video channel
02:10 we're trying to hear something or see
02:12 something or both that increases our
02:18 intake of data and the interesting
02:22 biological thing about this is that your
02:24 ears simply do the same thing from the
02:27 moment you came out of your mother to
02:30 the moment you feel the first spiritual
02:32 enlightenment it's the same device your
02:37 five senses are always there now you
02:42 know that as you get older and you start
02:44 to calm your soul and stop living in
02:47 this sort of feral state of I exist I'm
02:51 dealing with every second that comes at
02:53 me the second it comes at me the more
02:55 you meditate and go within yourself and
02:58 start to disengage this notion that you
03:01 are your body you start to first feel
03:06 this kind of spatial anomaly you know
03:09 you start to realize that you are a
03:12 being you can feel it and even though
03:16 you can see your hands and that sort of
03:17 thing you're still up there in your head
03:21 but then you have this spatial awareness
03:23 and of course you know there are plenty
03:25 of scientists that would just tell you
03:28 this is this holographic sort of
03:30 projection that you're the narns in your
03:33 mind create this chemical illusion that
03:36 you actually have a body and then when
03:38 we lose a limb we have phantom pain and
03:40 fans are feeling and we still feel like
03:42 we have that part of our body and that
03:44 makes complete sense on a scientific
03:46 level because you have assigned various
03:48 neurons in your brain to handle what
03:50 your foot supposed to feel like and do
03:52 and if you're missing your foot all of a
03:55 sudden you still have the circuitry
03:58 that's going to report in and it's going
04:02 to give you the illusion you have a foot
04:05 until it realizes I've got nothing to
04:07 talk to
04:08 maybe we should reassign ourselves right
04:11 now what's interesting is is when you're
04:15 let's just say you're happy and you're
04:17 in point a some sort of level of
04:21 enlightenment more than a location
04:23 physically
04:23 the universe it's more reference of this
04:26 is how enlightened you are at point a an
04:29 evolutionary development milestone right
04:33 and then all of a sudden you realize
04:36 that you have the opportunity to walk in
04:39 any direction 360 degrees for as long as
04:42 you want for as long as you can take
04:45 whatever is in those areas right meaning
04:48 if you know one area is on fire you
04:51 probably walk that far and if one's that
04:52 got an ocean you probably will only swim
04:54 for so long where ever you can
04:57 physically exist mentally yeah
05:01 conceptually well you know basically can
05:04 your brain conceive of it and
05:07 comfortably be in that space you can be
05:09 there and what I mean by that is this
05:12 it's always interesting when you are
05:15 let's say less enlightened and you know
05:18 you know moments in your life when
05:19 you've been young and more
05:21 impressionable and you were gullible or
05:24 whatever and then you grew up and you
05:28 were less impressionable and less
05:30 gullible and more intelligent all this
05:32 knowledge that you learned from school
05:34 had finally turned into wisdom the
05:35 difference between [ __ ] and shinola you
05:38 finally figured it out and you become
05:42 stronger and stronger and stronger the
05:45 moments that you can realize this is all
05:47 the case right I mean that this is the
05:49 case excuse me but now let's think about
05:52 this you're safe and you're sound and
05:57 you're happy and you're feeling
05:58 adventurous you're feeling adventurous
06:01 because point eight is totally worked
06:03 out man it could be the point eight was
06:06 built for you by your parents and you
06:10 just had them they just provided
06:11 everything that you have for need you to
06:12 answer to every question that you wanted
06:14 provided opportunity for you to do some
06:16 local exploration maybe if you're lucky
06:20 kid they flew you around the world so
06:21 you've got a chance to see other
06:22 cultures you know hear language you
06:26 don't even understand and then you have
06:28 this opportunity to go out and start
06:30 making your own decisions right to
06:34 explore and it starts getting really
06:36 exciting
06:37 I'm going to go discover something mom
06:40 dad honey sweetheart
06:42 and sometimes it's rewarding and
06:45 sometimes it's not
06:47 sometimes it's information that you have
06:49 been dying for and sometimes it's
06:53 exactly what you didn't want to know
06:54 what's interesting about the world right
06:57 now that I think we have to consciously
06:58 realize as we go through this process
07:01 and I wanted to paint that image in your
07:03 mind of starting off happy and then
07:06 potentially being disappointed with some
07:10 enlightenment in some areas right now if
07:12 you just to kind of split hairs for a
07:14 second because I'm about to go off in
07:17 the more traditional conspiratorial
07:19 enlightenment areas for a brief stent
07:22 here you could obviously grow up in this
07:26 world and be very conservative about
07:30 your enlightenment paths meaning you
07:34 know you could stay within like pr√≠ncipe
07:37 for instance like the Midwest and you
07:38 could just be in love with your
07:41 sweetheart and work at the local grocery
07:43 store and go to college or whatever you
07:45 got to do but you stay in this nice
07:46 beautiful little circle and you will
07:49 live a wonderful life most likely as
07:50 long as someone walking in your backyard
07:52 you know Red Dawn you which hasn't
07:57 happened in my lifetime so there's
07:59 plenty of people out there can live a
08:00 really good simple fully enlighten to
08:04 the extent they need to know life but
08:07 what's the trend of today let's say we
08:11 we have that farm in Kansas and you know
08:14 they got two or three thousand acres
08:17 that they manage that they grow various
08:20 crops on right okay and they're happy
08:24 they've got two families in the area and
08:26 they crossbreed their families and so we
08:29 don't get any necessarily too vertical
08:31 of a of a tree you know have that family
08:35 line looks like a telephone pole and
08:36 they're just happy they make their own
08:39 food even you know they make their
08:40 vegetables and they grow livestock and
08:43 it's all good they got wind meals and
08:46 [ __ ] for power or whatever
08:48 as long as they could quarantine
08:50 themselves like the village right that
08:52 movie they could do it but the second
08:56 that they reach out to find out what the
09:00 rest of the world is like out of this
09:02 sort of Amish example I'm giving you
09:04 then they start bumping into horrible
09:07 arteries of essentially terror of sort
09:16 of fictional narratives created by fake
09:18 news fed by military industrial
09:21 complexes fueled by self-righteous
09:24 douchebags every corner you stand on
09:27 right where the ill-informed right you
09:31 know protest signs about whatever
09:33 they're you know currently on in terms
09:37 of a stick but in that particular
09:40 example which is a little bit extreme
09:42 think about how easily it is easy it is
09:45 for your mind to grasp how polluted
09:47 they're going to be very quickly they're
09:50 going to see hatred around the world you
09:53 know they're going to see this Muslim
09:54 invasion of Europe they're going to see
09:57 the Democrats and the Republicans after
09:59 each other they're going to see you know
10:02 black lives matter they're going to see
10:04 antifa
10:06 everyone's warring at every level as if
10:10 again civil unrest is the goal of those
10:15 who control the narratives and the only
10:17 people that control the narratives are
10:18 those with the money that own all these
10:20 arteries and you know they do sell
10:24 banner ads and advertising around any
10:26 dramatic thing that occurs so if the guy
10:28 in New York drives around and kills
10:30 people with this car CNN and Fox
10:33 automatically make profit from that
10:36 death immediately because they sell news
10:39 around it isn't that fascinating
10:43 so I mean it's just it's just bizarre
10:46 how someone could walk into a
10:48 convenience store they could film
10:49 themselves live you know and on Facebook
10:51 and say I'm about to make Fox and CNN
10:55 and BBC RT a bunch of cash watch this
10:59 walks in and arbitrarily just
11:02 those people and then offers the footage
11:04 up that offers the information up to the
11:06 news agencies and boom how much money do
11:10 you think they could make and you know
11:12 some sort of drug store murder that's
11:14 probably going to keep the presses eye
11:16 for a week a week and a half right and
11:20 so they're going to sell banner heads
11:21 and they're going to sell pre-roll ads
11:22 and also the [ __ ] around a horrendous
11:26 moment because that's what they do man
11:28 that's their business the back to our
11:32 family the fact that we can easily see
11:35 without any major degree in sociology or
11:38 whatever we can see how the the world
11:43 will corrupt this these two families in
11:45 this little community and what's going
11:49 to happen when they have grown up their
11:51 whole lives and you know they're let's
11:53 just say they have the whole Anne Frank
11:56 spectrum from little kids all the way up
11:58 to grandparents like charlie buckets
12:00 house and everyone who's lived a charmed
12:03 life and then all of a sudden they meet
12:05 civilization and it just turns to [ __ ]
12:10 whatever reason they didn't own a
12:12 television or if they did it only got
12:14 channels that were showing movies
12:16 without any narrative of the world now
12:22 if that's a little unsettling right
12:25 think about the family getting corrupted
12:26 and how your soul kind of aches for them
12:31 think about us think about us where are
12:35 we
12:35 micro you know they're [ __ ] knee-deep
12:38 in this stuff we're neck-deep were you
12:41 know baloney on a cold roll no I mean
12:43 like we are way deep in the ocean of
12:45 this [ __ ] the bad narratives run through
12:49 us you know for those who are Christian
12:51 you talk about the holy spirit going in
12:53 alright if you watch news if you watch
12:56 television if you read you know [ __ ]
12:59 rags like TMZ and you go to these news
13:02 organizations without a filter turn on
13:05 huge right reading the news online the
13:08 metaphor for how to do this without
13:11 getting hurt is about the same as fine a
13:13 welding mask that allows you to look at
13:15 the
13:16 Sun because the Sun is luring just like
13:20 bugs love light light feels good
13:22 metabolizes our body many different ways
13:26 pituitary gland pumping out vitamin D
13:28 same thing we're a lure to moving stuff
13:31 like a caveman you ever been a
13:33 restaurant with your loved one and
13:34 you've got a TV behind her and she
13:37 doesn't have a TV behind you and she's
13:39 looking you in the eye and you just you
13:40 hate sports but you can't stop looking
13:43 at the game like a mesmerizing circuit
13:46 60 frames a second I should say 60 Hertz
13:49 is a sort of suggestive frequency
13:54 there's a reason why it is the frequency
13:57 of television devices because it puts
14:00 you in a meditative sense and a docile
14:03 frequency I mean just imagine this for a
14:06 brief second they have chosen 60 frames
14:09 a second because it makes you docile
14:12 that's why fluorescent lights are 60
14:14 Hertz
14:16 now imagine you're they've done this and
14:18 it makes you makes you sensitive to
14:20 whatever you're viewing you tend to
14:21 believe whatever you view and that's
14:23 because they're pumping [ __ ] their
14:24 tubes at you online and then I'll sudden
14:27 you watch a conspiracy video and the
14:30 same substrate that is making you
14:32 believe [ __ ] is now making you
14:35 believe conspiracy a little terrifying
14:39 right as you would genetically be
14:42 predisposition to believe anything
14:44 that's broadcast through a television
14:46 unit no matter what it is right but I
14:50 know what you're thinking again well
14:51 this is supposed to be about
14:52 enlightenment dude and you're just going
14:54 off on sort of the basic mechanisms of
14:57 learning how life works I think it's
15:00 going to be very difficult life to be
15:01 enlightened if we don't have a strict
15:03 definition of what it is to see more you
15:06 know to not only widen the aperture of
15:09 your eyes and increase your peripheral
15:11 vision and the intake of that data you
15:16 know like I'll give you an example of
15:18 something I find interesting I just
15:19 found out last year which is that your
15:21 peripheral vision has higher frame rate
15:22 than the frames in front of you I'm not
15:27 sure why that is but that's supposed to
15:28 be with the cases
15:29 right but we have to learn how to mulch
15:36 data once it comes through the door
15:37 because I think that when you're young
15:39 we just see things and believe them
15:41 right you go to Disneyland as a
15:44 five-year-old and you see a hard plastic
15:47 costume cast member at Disneyland and
15:50 you know the thing is in animating for
15:52 some reason you look at Mickey Mouse and
15:55 you're like totally real man I always
15:57 thought it was such a depressing thing
15:59 when I was a kid when I go to Disneyland
16:01 or Disney World these you know these
16:03 cast member suits have come out and you
16:05 know they animate a little bit their
16:06 hands and they get a cute and they go to
16:08 college for that but in the end I was
16:11 like that's a crock of [ __ ] man this is
16:12 not real
16:13 you're a [ __ ] dude in a costume okay
16:16 what starts happening as you get older
16:19 you start processing information
16:21 multiple times it comes into your brain
16:24 you stop it before it goes into your
16:27 long-term memory and you look at it and
16:28 you analyze it for every angle you try
16:32 to see if it's a friend or foe is this
16:35 something to be alarmed about or can I
16:37 just throw it back there is this
16:38 something even give a [ __ ] about and
16:40 then you just throw it out the front
16:41 door I have a pretty good memory for
16:44 several aspects of data types I have a
16:47 photographic memory but I tell you what
16:50 when I see something I don't give a [ __ ]
16:52 about I don't remember at all I just I
16:55 don't I don't remotely attempt to store
16:58 the data with a little bit of analysis
17:01 I've decided I don't wanna do any more
17:02 analysis and I throw it away now I think
17:05 we're all this way you ever been up at
17:08 night you can't go to sleep you've lied
17:09 down but your brain won't turn off and
17:11 sometimes that's a more of a creative
17:13 epiphany loop that you're in it's
17:15 beautiful to experience and other times
17:16 you have a subject on your mind which is
17:18 driving you crazy and not necessarily a
17:21 negative piece of information just a
17:23 piece of information something that your
17:24 constant looking at you know it's like
17:26 an orb of data came into your spectrum
17:29 of influence and you just keep analyzing
17:32 and analyzing it until you feel like you
17:34 understand what the hell is going on you
17:36 try to gain a perspective of how you
17:37 relate to the information to find out
17:40 what it means to you in proximity so you
17:43 being right meaning for instance you can
17:46 watch on television or YouTube a lion
17:50 tearing something apart in the jungle
17:53 right in the desert and then you have a
17:58 line in your backyard and you're out
18:00 there and the door is locked and you
18:02 know he's got you pinned down or he's
18:03 right in front of the door and you're
18:04 like [ __ ] where can I go he could hop
18:05 over every fence and kill me now the
18:08 sudden that data means something
18:09 completely different to you it is a
18:11 personal threat model all intellectual
18:17 and physical data coming into your five
18:19 senses are being assessed on this level
18:22 and I would say that the sixth sense is
18:24 obviously given for most of you which is
18:26 your spiritual interpretation of data as
18:29 I've said several times you have your
18:34 feeling of truth and your feeling of a
18:37 lie
18:38 yes we can be duped right you could have
18:43 your first relationship with someone who
18:46 is incapable being loyal to you and then
18:49 it feels great it feels great and then
18:51 all of a sudden boom you find out that
18:52 they weren't loyal to you and that
18:54 frequency that feeling that everything
18:56 was okay you're starting to to look into
19:00 those feelings a little bit more and
19:01 maybe you can discern that the amount of
19:04 analysis that you did on those feelings
19:06 was zero you just took it in as pure
19:08 love which is the world we should be
19:10 able to live in but now you go back and
19:14 reanalyze every moment you have at this
19:15 individual and you try to parse it
19:17 further you try to see more within the
19:20 data set that you've already taken in
19:22 you just didn't realize that there was a
19:25 level of granularity that you aren't
19:27 analyzing with meaning you know you were
19:29 looking at you what you didn't have
19:32 enough parts-per-million
19:33 within the data of this individual to
19:36 realize that they weren't really being
19:37 sincere that there were indicators that
19:39 they had kissed someone else five
19:42 seconds before they came home or
19:43 whatever but it'd be you smell someone
19:46 on this person or you just sense a
19:49 differential between the first day that
19:51 you met and the day the day seemingly
19:54 was with or with someone else right
19:57 and so there's these little tiny levels
19:58 of granularity and that's what you get
20:00 really good at as you get older
20:03 obviously for any of you who are parents
20:05 you know all about the I was dumb once
20:09 as a child and now I'm gonna parent and
20:12 I'm not trying to pick my friends my
20:14 child's friends or their boyfriends or
20:17 girlfriends you're just trying to
20:18 protect them I can slimy people or
20:23 people that are aren't awake but seem to
20:26 be kind of a bam bam in life right there
20:28 just slinging a big club and hurting you
20:31 know potentially other people with no
20:33 real care or knowledge that they do so
20:35 maybe out of ignorance may be out of
20:37 intent you never know if you don't care
20:39 you want them away from your kids here's
20:41 one beautiful thing about your brain and
20:44 I covered this in a couple different
20:46 episodes and season one one of the
20:48 episodes is called thinking and the
20:50 other one's called left and right brain
20:53 but it goes like this you know we always
20:57 talk about how thinking at first is just
21:00 like picking up your your weights after
21:02 two years of not working out and it just
21:04 will just actually out man you still
21:06 feel good when it's all over but you
21:08 know you just have that resistance until
21:11 you do until you feel to you for jump as
21:13 a result of lifting weights well same
21:18 thing goes for your mind right you have
21:21 neurons in your mind and the reason why
21:23 they multiply is almost entirely up to
21:26 you because they're not like normal
21:29 cells that mitosis on a regular 35 to 90
21:32 day basis because they have to a neuron
21:38 only multiplies if it gets overworked
21:40 overstimulated its cycle says and this
21:43 is absolutely brilliant the more I am
21:45 used the more that I ratchet up this
21:49 sort of bonus bar in the fighting game
21:52 right you know and you punch a lot punch
21:54 a lot punch let ins bonus bar goes up
21:55 and also to get the super punch it's
21:57 almost exactly the same
21:59 it says the more you use me the more I'm
22:01 going to kick off a replication cycle
22:03 because obviously this person is
22:05 thinking a lot and the more they think
22:08 the more we need to give them the
22:09 equipment to do so
22:11 and so if you want to have a really
22:12 dense neural mesh think all the time
22:16 hurt your brain all the time and have
22:19 fun with it of course right so the
22:21 interesting thing is is a lot of times
22:23 people will say well Lightman is merely
22:25 hearing the right thing at the right
22:26 time
22:27 being able to again add to your
22:30 portfolio of what you can see and
22:31 therefore accomplish more in life or
22:34 enjoy the little things in life a lot
22:36 more than used to but this is definitely
22:38 the case you know why do they have that
22:40 old saying that cliche about stop and
22:42 smell the flowers that's because when
22:45 you're a young person a lot of times we
22:48 appreciate a flower but we only
22:50 appreciate at a very basic minut level
22:52 we don't see Mother Nature and Earth all
22:55 participating together to give that
22:57 flower life we don't think about the
22:58 rain just the fact that predators aren't
23:02 eating the flower I mean it's there's
23:03 all kinds of things that when you get
23:05 older you increase your portfolio and
23:08 essentially the data metrics that you're
23:10 able to appreciate things buy and so you
23:15 could become you know not necessarily
23:17 enlightened about flowers but you could
23:20 you're increasing your neural mesh such
23:24 that you can see more and if we are
23:29 truly a symbiotic connection between
23:31 what I believe to be your soul and your
23:33 body then the manifestation of mind
23:35 which is the two coming together think
23:39 about it
23:39 you feel powerless to really reach into
23:43 the universe and be where your soul is
23:45 every single day now a lot of people
23:47 claim all kinds of [ __ ] then they don't
23:50 really ever have any stories about you
23:53 know the experience meaning someone will
23:55 say the astral projection like oh that's
23:57 great
23:57 tell me about that well then I can't
23:59 really do it manage this you have to
24:01 sort of be there man say okay whatever
24:03 if you really ask for projected you
24:05 would be bringing home the bacon in
24:07 terms of full enlightenment but let's
24:09 think about this you got your body over
24:11 here your vessel you have your soul but
24:13 you can feel you can feel it you're
24:16 again a lot of the emotional spectrum
24:18 that you go through in life have very
24:20 little mapping to your body
24:23 it's a lot of the love and hate and
24:25 sorrow and sadness and the gut feelings
24:27 one way or the other your intuition all
24:29 of that is coming from your soul and
24:31 bears no witness to your body whatsoever
24:34 your brain does not account for that
24:36 kind of stuff right in my lifetime you
24:39 know there hasn't been a huge increase
24:42 in the knowledge of the brain all there
24:44 have been have been new paradigms
24:46 created to claim that in computer
24:49 simulation we can emulate increased are
24:53 the results of our Turing test basically
24:55 but we haven't really figured out the
24:57 mind much more than we had it 20 30 40
25:00 years ago at least in the public sector
25:05 and I think about this if you ever
25:09 wanted to feel like you wanted to get
25:10 closer to your soul then you believe in
25:15 a symbiotic creation a relationship
25:18 between your body and your soul which is
25:19 sort of what you have to adopt once you
25:21 believe in a collective amount of energy
25:23 that is who you are
25:25 again it's not electron energy so you're
25:27 not going to find it in some sort of
25:28 oscilloscope but if you increase your
25:35 neural net by any means necessary it
25:40 means possible you were going to
25:43 increase your relationship with your
25:44 soul and because I believe your soul is
25:47 connected to all the other souls and
25:49 connected to all things that matter in
25:51 life right life is the soul life life
25:54 manifested in the body is just a
25:56 temporary current in water right but the
26:00 life that never dies the lightbulb that
26:03 never burns out is the overall
26:04 consciousness of the universe so the
26:06 more that you stress your mind and think
26:09 and think and I'm a telling you man let
26:12 me give you some examples of what I'm
26:13 talking about
26:14 you've never whittled wood and you just
26:17 get yourself a pocketknife
26:18 be very careful always push away from
26:19 your hands and you start carving things
26:23 your brain is going to have to increase
26:26 its neural mesh to handle that task
26:28 especially if you haven't done it before
26:29 and then you're going to carve real
26:33 basic shapes first then you're going to
26:35 get into the nuances
26:37 of using the tip of the knife to create
26:39 various you know you're going to get
26:40 wedge tools and you're going to start
26:42 creating curly hair or feathers with all
26:44 the details and the more you jump into
26:46 that one thing if that turns you on the
26:49 neural mesh in your brain increases and
26:51 then when you look at the rest of the
26:53 world the way that you take in data
26:55 could potentially be way more intense
26:59 now take anything else in life reading
27:03 books alright no my people come to me
27:08 all the time and say what's the last
27:09 book that you read and what they're
27:11 really asking me is what's last
27:12 fictional entertaining book I've read
27:14 and I always say none you know I've read
27:18 tons of fictional books but I prefer to
27:21 read factual books I prefer to learn
27:24 something as opposed to be entertained I
27:26 can find great television shows to fill
27:29 up every single free moment I've got
27:33 when I lie down a bed I want to pull up
27:35 you know a book that's written by a
27:37 mastermind but isn't that exciting that
27:40 we can take a 100% control over our
27:44 enlightenment but now let's go into
27:48 let's say that you adopt that that
27:51 format you understand that you believe
27:53 that and you start to just become
27:55 smarter really I mean it's going to help
27:56 you in everything in life it's not just
27:58 anything on this show you know nothing
28:01 else take this technique and run off and
28:02 you know make your own show but now
28:07 let's think about the pop culture
28:10 methodology of becoming enlightened in
28:12 this world again I once had a family
28:16 member of mine say that she would like
28:18 to create sort of a bed and breakfast
28:22 and have an Enlightenment camp and
28:27 what's really interesting about this is
28:29 an individual who's telling me this is
28:31 obviously a super sweet person but has
28:34 really you know she's physically been
28:37 places in the world and looked at things
28:38 but everything that that she believes is
28:41 in a hardbound book and a pond a
28:44 bookstore it's in a pop culture magazine
28:46 like The New Yorker
28:49 and so I'm sitting here thinking that
28:50 wait a minute how can you enlighten
28:52 anyone out of the standard pop culture
28:55 envelope as long as someone is mildly
28:58 informed about the world they're going
29:01 to have all the knowledge you already
29:02 have you haven't lived outside of the
29:05 standard bubble of influence and so what
29:09 you have to bring anyone is really just
29:12 sort of a bias of the official story
29:14 who needs that I have a very close close
29:18 friend of mine that used to do DMT with
29:21 a bunch of shaman in Berkeley University
29:24 area he was looking for enlightenment in
29:28 that realm and found that you know even
29:31 even though he had trips and they were
29:32 phenomenal they were very personal to
29:34 him they said the only annoying thing
29:36 was is that they did these rituals
29:38 around he's sort of Native American
29:40 rituals bunch of white guys and he said
29:43 it's really done to protect them against
29:45 the police invasion and they could claim
29:47 religious rights but if they just sit
29:48 around doing DMT without doing the
29:50 chants then they all get busted or
29:53 whatever really odd there's people who
29:55 go to gurus in do gurus and they sit and
30:02 they talk and these guys are phenomenal
30:05 I mean a lot of these people are
30:05 anomalous women and there's men mostly
30:08 men people do the ayahuasca trips down
30:11 in South America which is actually I
30:14 guess becoming a trend here in
30:15 California people are doing ayahuasca
30:17 all over the place I don't know if I'd
30:19 trust anybody in California to actually
30:22 bring me ayahuasca they'd have to pay OD
30:25 parties why do I mention those I
30:28 mentioned those because there's a cliche
30:32 around becoming enlightened and it is
30:35 anything but being enlightened in a lot
30:38 of cases now people find enlightenment
30:40 within those avenues but here's the
30:42 thing this is what I'm going to suggest
30:45 to you a lot of you guys really dig the
30:49 channel and you love the shows and we
30:52 love the information exchange especially
30:54 in the comments but I would never
30:57 personally sell you that I can enlighten
31:00 you
31:02 as much as I try to pass information to
31:05 you the notion that I am somehow
31:08 qualified to enlighten anyone and again
31:09 I've never ever thought I was qualified
31:12 to enlighten anyone but I would know
31:15 that if you came to me for enlightenment
31:17 you would be coming into my bias and
31:19 when you come to me for enlightenment
31:21 it's different from then you're watching
31:24 the television or watching sorry one of
31:25 the episodes on the channel when you
31:28 visit an episode on this channel
31:29 hopefully your attitude is well we'll
31:31 see if we agree oh I've never heard of
31:34 this let's let's see if I could agree
31:36 with it once he presents this new
31:38 dataset to me boom but if you come to me
31:41 and you're like enlighten me and you sit
31:43 in this backyard we have a bunch of bean
31:44 bags out and incense burning and it's a
31:47 good day was not a lot of helicopters
31:49 flying over I don't know if I'd know
31:52 what to say you know I can mentor an
31:56 individual really well I can get into
31:59 someone's brain and say what is it
32:01 you're looking for what makes you the
32:02 happiest on this planet and we could
32:04 break everything down to again like I
32:06 always say on the show the sub themes
32:08 that really drive you every single day
32:10 and make sure that you know however you
32:12 want to view it
32:13 however God made you to lust after life
32:16 we'll use that as a template to mirror
32:20 it to this instance of reality that
32:22 we're in which is the jobs that you can
32:23 get the education you can get to get
32:25 different jobs all that kind of stuff
32:27 right so when I see individuals and
32:30 again I was dead LMU University Loyola
32:32 University in LA and I was there for I
32:36 think it was my screenwriting class with
32:38 Robert McKee one of many they had a some
32:42 festival going on or something going on
32:44 where they had all these Indian gurus
32:45 everywhere and they had these tents all
32:48 set up and they were selling all kinds
32:49 of yoga mats and and you know stuff so
32:52 there's a commercial element to it as
32:54 well and I'm sure these these guys have
32:57 gotten together and they do circuits
32:58 around colleges and you know a lot of it
33:02 look legit I sat and watched a couple
33:03 for a few minutes in between lunch break
33:06 Argus I stood up but it was it was a lot
33:10 of beautiful knowledge like if you've
33:11 ever seen a little tiny book called the
33:13 Prophet it's just a beautiful
33:16 of great parables about how to live life
33:18 and so it's not like they were doing
33:20 anyone harm but think about I was
33:23 watching these kids and I was seeing
33:25 kids be swept away because they were for
33:27 the very first time hearing a
33:28 philosophical thought for the first time
33:32 a lot of these kids were hearing any
33:33 mechanical advice about how to live life
33:36 about how to love love and life had come
33:39 at them in an abstract sort of random
33:43 way and they just were absorbing it
33:47 believing it or not believing it not
33:49 really analyzing how does it apply to an
33:51 overall strategy of life the problem
33:54 with the Millennials who have these you
33:56 know $100,000 degrees and they're
33:57 they're serving lattes all day is that
34:00 they didn't have any training from their
34:03 parents about how to strategically plan
34:05 their life and they never found a love
34:07 because they were preoccupied with
34:09 [ __ ] telephones and the internet and
34:11 [ __ ] snapchat horseshit and never
34:14 never defined what they could do with
34:16 their lives
34:17 and so when it came time to get kicked
34:21 out of the house and pay their own bills
34:22 my god
34:23 talk about feeling alienated lost angry
34:26 no wonder this this promise of socialism
34:30 is so popular believe me it's a strategy
34:33 it's a strategy from on high socialism
34:37 obviously yields control to the
34:39 controllers even more it's failed every
34:42 single time it's ever been tried to be
34:44 turned on and spare me all the examples
34:47 of where it has it failed if you know I
34:51 personally a couple places on earth they
34:53 say it hasn't failed and it's like
34:54 either the population is like you know
34:56 50 million or sorry 50 thousand people
34:58 or they're full of [ __ ] you know all I
35:01 gotta say is the clock has not struck
35:03 12:00 yet on the test of whatever you
35:07 think is a successful socialized
35:08 experiment out there I'll give you a
35:10 quick example of how socialism is
35:12 impossible all right goes like this
35:15 journey of you who have been to church
35:17 are you familiar with churches you know
35:20 that if you hand it out the same exact
35:22 Bible to a bunch of people and they'd
35:25 never read anything else and you tell
35:27 them read it
35:29 tell me what you think no one is going
35:31 to have the same interpretation of the
35:33 whole book they're not it's because
35:37 they're going to bring their individual
35:38 experiences to the table and it's going
35:40 to be different and that's why socialism
35:43 will never work a lot of people come
35:46 into the equation and say well I know
35:47 that everyone would think differently
35:48 but then we'll just [ __ ] pass laws
35:50 and everyone will be forced to believe
35:52 the right thing right thing right now
35:56 you're going to have a bunch of robotic
35:57 cops around there with chrome faces and
35:59 cattle prods and you're never going to
36:02 get unification of mind you're never
36:05 going to be able to ever get freedom out
36:07 of the heart of man that is impossible
36:10 as much as the you know the deep state
36:13 folks want to make us toxified so bad
36:16 that we can't use our bodies to resist I
36:19 assure you the driving force of man is
36:24 freedom that is the kernel piece of code
36:28 that can never be extinguished or muted
36:33 even if you look at someone in North
36:35 Korea for instance is terrified to speak
36:38 up they are still in a state of misery
36:41 because they have that kernel of freedom
36:44 that whoever created us put in there
36:47 it's just there it's there in every
36:50 single person period enlightenment has
36:54 to be a personal journey by the
36:56 individual if you adopt a guidance
37:00 system from someone else a guru an uncle
37:04 a mother a father a brother whatever you
37:07 must understand that that is merely an
37:09 artery of information that still needs
37:12 to be discerned and factored into your
37:14 own life you have to decide whether or
37:18 not you agree with that and believe it
37:20 or not you can agree with something on a
37:22 Monday and disagree with it on a Friday
37:24 and the inverse is also true seem like a
37:27 good idea that when I applied it it
37:29 really didn't have anything to do with
37:30 me and what's challenging about this is
37:33 that we all know those individuals who
37:36 are what we would say to be lost not bad
37:40 people not stupid people
37:42 they're just lost they have awakened and
37:47 they don't have any guidance it's almost
37:50 as if they they found the trapdoor out
37:53 of the matrix but there is no you know
37:55 Morpheus on the other side and so
37:58 they're just they wake up in this pod
38:00 all this [ __ ] hook to their back and
38:02 they're terrified right or maybe they're
38:04 inquisitive they're not terrified but
38:07 now what do they do and that's how cults
38:09 find their members right they want to
38:11 find the most ill-informed excited
38:16 energetic person that's looking to take
38:18 on new paradigms of enlightenment and
38:21 what's interesting is when you feel lost
38:23 there's an amazing attraction right
38:26 there's an opposite attracts sort of
38:28 formula you're lost you're empty and as
38:33 information comes at you life it feels
38:36 chaotic and disorienting and the more
38:41 that you think that other people have
38:43 all their [ __ ] together and you feel
38:44 lost it's terrifying
38:48 like why is how does everyone else have
38:51 a job how does everyone else driving a
38:52 Mercedes every single day and I can
38:54 barely keep the roof over my head
38:56 how's everyone eating at these fancy
38:58 restaurants but I can't afford
38:59 McDonald's how's everyone where else
39:01 wearing $10,000 worth of clothing every
39:03 day and I can barely afford you know
39:05 hand-me-downs and so if someone steps in
39:10 front of that uncertainty and says I'm
39:12 David Koresh let me tell you about Jesus
39:16 and guns you could be really apt to
39:21 follow a guy like that and as he solves
39:26 the basic problems because he's just
39:28 he's never been disoriented with his
39:29 hubris you start to say well this guy is
39:33 my Savior I was completely lost I was
39:36 completely disoriented I was scared and
39:37 he made me feel secure and protected and
39:41 he brought me an awareness of God that I
39:43 had never seen before it's a big deal
39:47 man and you know for anyone mad at me
39:50 for mentioning him yeah we all
39:52 understand that we don't know who that
39:53 guy was
39:54 the last person I'm going to [ __ ]
39:56 believe is the big giant [ __ ] gorilla
39:59 Janet Reno who's now probably safely
40:03 tucked away in some hot place but you
40:09 know they're out there and it doesn't
40:10 even have to be that the person is
40:11 trying to help you has anything to do
40:14 with a nefarious plan whatsoever it's
40:16 just it's their plan it's their life
40:19 what they're giving you is what's been
40:20 appropriate for them maybe it's
40:23 appropriate for you for a little while
40:24 right there was a movie I've mentioned a
40:28 couple times on very shows Bill Murray's
40:32 finest movie in my opinion is a movie
40:34 called razor's edge it's made in the 80s
40:37 it's made about 83 if you like Bill
40:40 Murray and you haven't seen that film I
40:43 would wager you have not seen his finest
40:45 work but let me just tell you the basics
40:50 about the movie so you can understand
40:51 how it applies to enlightenment because
40:53 his character in that film became
40:55 enlightened through a very tumultuous
40:57 path it was I believe around 1916 or so
41:02 when this movie starts obviously there's
41:05 a world war going on but America is not
41:07 involved he was involved with sort of an
41:12 upper-class family I think he was fairly
41:17 normal by middle class upper middle
41:20 class something like that but anyway he
41:22 goes over to participate in World War
41:25 one I believe he was a medic and he
41:30 suffers the slings and arrows and gets
41:33 damaged over there and he doesn't get
41:34 you know hobbled or anything but he sees
41:37 some pretty nasty [ __ ] over there and he
41:39 comes from a wonderful world of America
41:41 goes over there and sees things that no
41:42 one of his age bracket had ever seen he
41:45 comes back changed but he also comes
41:49 back finding out that his his love
41:52 interest has taken a different path I'll
41:54 just put it that way and in the 19's the
41:59 1900s in the teens life was pretty basic
42:02 you you graduated high school only some
42:07 people went to college
42:08 back in those days but you were to get
42:09 married at 18 and have your kids by 20
42:11 or 22 and life was supposed to begin you
42:14 get a trade skill you get a nice job and
42:16 you just go to work well obviously when
42:19 he came back things were different and
42:21 so he's sort of lost he's devastated the
42:24 formula that was sold to him this whole
42:26 life is not working out which is the way
42:27 it is today all all year round right so
42:30 he goes on this adventure around the
42:32 world he ends up going to a Tibetan
42:37 temple and studying from Tibetan monks
42:41 it feels like he's out there for almost
42:43 10 years or so but I can't remember how
42:45 many years he was out it's quite a few
42:47 years at least two or three and then he
42:51 makes his way back to his his home
42:53 territory and there was there were these
42:57 two couples at the beginning of the film
42:58 his girlfriend his buddy and his
43:00 girlfriend well there was a that was
43:03 across his buddy went after his wife
43:05 went out sari went after his girlfriend
43:07 made him his wife so his best friends
43:10 married to his old squeeze and then
43:14 there's this other girl that is
43:17 devastated by what happened and she ends
43:19 up becoming what you believe to be sort
43:22 of an opium den woman who I guess would
43:25 be a prostitute as well and of course he
43:28 knows her from childhood he knows her
43:30 from his teenage years and he realizes
43:33 this is a really good woman who's just
43:36 been devastated by the relationship
43:38 chaos that he also suffered but instead
43:42 of going around the world she ended up
43:43 getting swallowed up by the system so he
43:47 takes her on as a project and that's
43:50 that's all you need to know from the
43:51 movie to go see it but for him he was
43:57 able to achieve his own enlightenment
44:00 but he didn't come back thrilled to
44:03 death just because he got enlightened
44:06 when he came back with what with was the
44:10 perspective on what is important in life
44:12 and what isn't important in life he also
44:15 came back with several tools to be able
44:18 to address problems when it wanted to
44:22 when they occur the weirdest thing about
44:25 being alive is the paradox of feeling
44:28 like there's a purpose for you being
44:30 alive
44:31 the realizing very quickly that there
44:34 are no instruction manuals for man there
44:38 aren't and so we are sharing this domain
44:41 of existence and if we you are within
44:44 the circle of individuals who have
44:48 somehow accumulated some relevant
44:51 enlightenment towards a particular
44:53 objective right there are bankers that
44:56 have enlightenment about how to control
44:58 populations there are government
45:00 politicians that know how to play the
45:01 Lobby game and they get to steal the
45:04 best health care and best retirement
45:05 packages they've got enlightenment to
45:07 that degree we want enlightenment to
45:09 obviously protect ourselves from those
45:12 individuals to imbue our own lives with
45:15 as many rewards through perspective
45:18 right when you wake up in the morning
45:20 and you're alive for anyone who's had a
45:21 near-death experience
45:22 when you wake up alive okay when you
45:25 wake up at all right and you breathe and
45:27 you you have most of your faculties your
45:29 body works well even if you've got aches
45:31 and pains at least it works you feel
45:34 wonderful but without the perspective to
45:38 compare it to a lot of people wake up
45:40 with no excuse why they can't conquer
45:43 the world but they constantly make
45:46 excuses why they can't conquer the world
45:49 right and so we engage in the process
45:52 that we're doing on the show which is
45:53 share I stimulate the conversation with
45:57 a one-hour episode and you guys jump in
45:59 the comment section and blow it up right
46:02 some of you guys make comments that are
46:04 so damn good that it's like an
46:07 exponential right it's x 2 x 3 x 4 one
46:11 of the things that always warms my heart
46:12 when I see you guys really productively
46:14 talking to each other in the thread one
46:16 person posts up the cool and there's
46:17 like 25 replies and it just stays
46:19 beautiful it stays positive no one's you
46:23 know yelling obscenities at each other
46:25 but what I need you to understand is and
46:27 this is just going to speak to a few of
46:30 you but it is important to realize that
46:32 what works for you may not work for
46:33 someone else and vice versa
46:35 we do not have to impose everything that
46:39 works for us on someone else now it does
46:40 get frustrating okay when you see
46:42 someone doing something silly
46:43 maybe they drink too much maybe they do
46:45 too many drugs or whatever or whatever
46:47 they're lazy and you're like cheese you
46:51 know I know that that's never going to
46:52 really yield any benefit to their life
46:54 other than when they get out of that
46:56 experience they're going to double down
46:58 and know that that thing that they were
47:00 doing was the reason why they weren't
47:02 getting what they wanted in life I will
47:05 say that as we move into this last
47:07 section here there's a very interesting
47:09 thing with enlightenment once you
47:11 achieve some form of it some category of
47:13 it right none of us will be fully
47:15 enlightened you know this idea that
47:17 you're in a your Tibetan monk in a
47:20 Tibetan temple and suppose you spend 50
47:22 60 years trying to be enlightened there
47:24 is no top end of the game right
47:29 I think you would have to be God to be
47:31 fully enlightened and then that job is
47:34 something that you better thank your
47:36 lucky stars he does for you there are
47:39 some of you who lived life and you
47:41 realized what it's like to hear your own
47:42 voice and to be in your own world
47:45 regardless if you have a spouse with a
47:47 bunch of kids and a really thick family
47:49 and a good circuit of friends you will
47:51 have those moments that you're capable
47:54 of recognizing your existence then there
47:58 are those who are so overwhelmed with
48:03 your immediate circle of friends family
48:06 and whatever that you're unable to hear
48:10 your own voice but you want to and
48:13 that's where you find this this force
48:17 coming at you that says you know make
48:20 time for yourself make time for yourself
48:22 or sometimes you just feel the
48:23 frustration that you can't control your
48:25 own destiny because you're constantly
48:27 serving other people for those who are
48:31 enlightened I guarantee you either
48:32 through serendipitous experiences where
48:35 you have more time than you want you get
48:38 enlightened because you have to you're
48:39 forced to listen to yourself but for
48:41 those who have punched through the
48:42 busier format they will always tell you
48:45 you have to make time to listen to your
48:47 own voice you have to make time to
48:48 meditate
48:49 and again meditation is not very
48:51 attractive you know you actually sit
48:53 down and you do nothing I would say I
48:56 rarely ever do that but what I do is
49:00 like I don't sit down in any formal
49:03 Hindu technique or Buddhist technique
49:05 what I end up doing is sitting down in a
49:07 chair with my notebooks and I jump into
49:10 one of my research projects and I just
49:12 take off where I left off and I started
49:14 describing tons of notes one of the most
49:18 beautiful parts about getting more
49:21 enlightened according to you right not
49:23 according to me not according to anyone
49:24 else and you're picking and choosing the
49:26 things that you want to analyze more as
49:30 when you gain control over the process
49:35 right you gain control you say I am
49:38 going to force myself to think about
49:40 these things right here because they're
49:42 curious to me and I will tell you that
49:44 you will find things that seemed
49:47 extremely mysterious and interesting and
49:50 then all of a sudden you dive into that
49:51 and you realize ah you know really I
49:53 just need to think about it for about 10
49:55 minutes and then I was completely fine
49:56 with where I ended up you need to know
50:00 that's cool that's okay and there would
50:03 be this thing that you thought you did
50:04 give a [ __ ] about and you start thinking
50:06 about in Chevrolet's oh my god that's
50:07 the rabbit hole over there and again
50:11 it's a rabbit hole down inside your soul
50:13 or maybe you're trying to punch through
50:15 your mind over to your soul you know I'm
50:18 always saying on the show Fairly
50:20 indirectly said that what study the way
50:23 you feel in certain scenarios and I
50:27 think that is the most wild frontier
50:31 that exists you know if I said to you
50:32 hey by the way we found this giant
50:34 continent on earth maybe if it is a flat
50:37 flat disc and we found an artery where
50:40 you can literally sail a boat through
50:43 the coastline of flat earth and get to
50:45 this other outer ring of other
50:47 continents and I said you have the
50:50 opportunity of discovering that
50:51 continent you know right away which if
50:53 you watch shows like Survivor and you
50:56 got to be physically fit probably young
50:58 you're going to have to know a lot about
50:59 sailing you have to know about
51:00 everything of
51:03 a civilization you know if you're lucky
51:05 enough to find a completely uninhabited
51:07 you're going to have to give birth to
51:08 your own babies I mean it's a it's an
51:10 intense circumstance you're actually
51:12 going to physically do something and you
51:14 have to be a certain age and da da da
51:16 right
51:17 but now here's the cool part about being
51:19 enlightened within yourself spiritually
51:22 you are sitting probably where you I
51:26 would say 95% of you are sitting in a
51:28 location with a pure car or your house
51:31 or your bed you're exactly where you can
51:34 be to start the process how cool is that
51:40 man how cool is that you got everything
51:43 you need if you really want to energize
51:46 it and record it in a much more
51:49 productive manner what I would suggest
51:51 is you get the pad and paper what I buy
51:54 these black notebooks
51:55 unfortunately ridiculously expensive
51:57 it's just [ __ ] paper and a bound
51:59 format they have no writing on them at
52:02 all they have no lines doesn't matter if
52:05 they do or not but this is blank sheets
52:08 of paper if you would look inside my
52:10 notebooks you would find diagrams of
52:14 what I believe to be like I have etheral
52:19 particle research I'm doing I have
52:22 infinity research I'm doing I have
52:24 spiritual research I'm bringing them all
52:26 together into one realm but I've drawn
52:28 photographs or sorry pictures of what I
52:30 believe to be the proximity and the
52:32 physical models the various things and I
52:34 will tell you that by drawing things on
52:36 paper I realize I'm wrong a lot of the
52:38 times and the the funny thing is is
52:41 there's all these folks like da Vinci
52:43 that obviated his writings by writing
52:45 things backwards so you can only view it
52:47 in a mirror which is kind of a joke like
52:50 I'd be hard to decipher but the nice
52:52 thing is is that in my material it's I
52:56 have gone past a lot of what I've
52:58 written so you might read one of my
52:59 passages and say oh he says this is the
53:02 way it is it means he believes this is
53:04 the way it is and it's not actually the
53:05 case the most you could possibly say
53:07 about my nose is to say that's what he
53:09 believed the moment the ink was written
53:11 on the paper but I will tell you this a
53:14 lot of times a second I pull the pin up
53:16 for
53:17 a piece of paper and read it back to
53:19 myself I look at what I've drawn
53:21 I immediately vanquish that theory from
53:23 my knowledge now what I don't completely
53:27 vanquish it what I do is I put that on
53:29 the false shelf and I'm looking for the
53:33 one I'm going to keep on the truth shelf
53:34 but I don't go back and put a T in an F
53:37 buy everything to say this is true this
53:38 is false what you might see later on is
53:40 me contradict my own theory at a later
53:43 date but because I don't date all my
53:45 pages you would never know I guess
53:47 chronologically left-to-right it's
53:48 probably how it's mostly transcribed I
53:51 think it's interesting that we had
53:53 Diaries a long time ago and you know
53:57 kids still do it to this day but what
54:00 are you what are you really writing
54:01 about I mean you are writing about your
54:03 daily experience and you're able to see
54:06 your daily experience after its occurred
54:09 which gives you more analysis of your
54:12 life right it's a very valuable process
54:16 you know women did it I would say ten to
54:20 one over men back in the day now you
54:23 don't hear about it that much anymore
54:24 I have a few friends of mine that have
54:28 Diaries and that what's interesting is
54:31 you have your fake Lee Harvey Oswald
54:33 diary which is written in female
54:34 handwriting from start to finish what
54:37 seems like all one day and you see a
54:39 real diary and the pins change right use
54:42 an ink pin one day that's black and then
54:44 you have a blue in the next day maybe
54:46 you scribe in a pencil one day the other
54:48 thing too is a really healthy diary in
54:49 my opinion has tons of diagrams in it
54:52 any drawings of things well I saw a star
54:54 today it was really cool and I draw the
54:56 star that they saw or they're feeling an
54:59 overwhelming you know moment of love and
55:01 so they light up the page with love or
55:03 they have a dark day and they draw
55:06 darkness right I never kept a diary I
55:10 did used to make these audio tapes which
55:12 I'm looking for right now somewhere in
55:15 my garage where I would do what's called
55:18 self seminar at the end of every year
55:19 I'd pick it I wouldn't be on December
55:21 31st or anything but I would push record
55:25 on my stereo with the microphone and I'd
55:28 sit there and just record
55:30 I would talk about the last one year of
55:32 my life and when I thought I
55:33 accomplished that was great and then I
55:35 would predict or just essentially say
55:38 what I'm going to go after the next year
55:39 and what was amazing and if you go back
55:42 to Law of Attraction I was able to
55:44 always accomplish my goal and what that
55:47 taught me was make your goals pretty
55:49 profound because you'll get them it's
55:53 almost as if you've made a contract with
55:54 the universe that is if you give me
55:57 these opportunities I will take
55:59 advantage of them and I will nurture
56:00 them and it seems like the universe just
56:02 responds beautifully to that the other
56:05 one that happened to me which I
56:06 mentioned a couple of times in the show
56:07 in the 90s I for whatever reason I
56:10 started when I start writing lyrics
56:11 probably late 80s and they were horrible
56:13 you know I was writing a lot of music at
56:15 the time and I couldn't even play an
56:18 instrument sing at the time in the late
56:20 80s and then by the mid 90s I'd figured
56:22 it out figured out how to put it all
56:24 together but it started writing tons and
56:27 tons of lyrics that sort of you could
56:29 now call poems and I think I wrote you
56:31 know what I would consider to be poetry
56:33 I probably written maybe 50 poems and
56:37 the rest is like four hundred and fifty
56:38 lyrics but the interesting thing was is
56:41 that I would take my emotional spectrum
56:43 for the day sometimes I write four in
56:45 one day sometimes were at one a week but
56:48 I would take any frustration or glee
56:50 that I had and I would turn it into a
56:52 lyric that talked about sort of
56:54 something related to the theme of what I
56:56 was talking about right and I believe it
56:59 was extremely enlightening because I I
57:01 went to the phases that everyone goes
57:02 through when you write poetry which is
57:04 you pick all the stupid words you know
57:07 you're right ecstasy and that kind of
57:09 [ __ ] in your lyrics and you kind of
57:10 realize Jesus Christ that's got to be
57:12 the worst word to ever exist in a poem
57:15 everything brime dit first because it
57:17 was a lyrical for music and then it was
57:21 a more just straight you know imagery
57:26 and and the depth of what I wrote got
57:31 really deep and really solid and I
57:35 suggest one it increases your ability to
57:38 articulate amazingly you start learning
57:40 new
57:41 and you start saying I'm tired of using
57:43 all these little words because they
57:45 sound stupid I mean they just sound
57:46 remedial it's not actually true but
57:49 you'll start to expand your horizons and
57:51 you'll start to find out that you've
57:53 expressed love the same way and say 25
57:57 poems and you start to realize there's
57:58 so much more to love I got to figure out
58:00 a better way to describe things instead
58:03 of going on point saying love you don't
58:05 even say the word love but you create a
58:08 bunch of images and scenes and scenarios
58:10 in your lyrics such that you are
58:12 illustrating quite unequivocally love I
58:17 had something that I used to call the
58:20 dark side which is my suite of poems and
58:24 every time I wrote something was very
58:25 negative I put it in the dark side I
58:27 used to have this [ __ ] online and
58:29 believe it or not and what I found was
58:33 this profound moment when I realized
58:36 that writing it down purged it from my
58:38 system whatever was eating me up it was
58:42 gone and that was this amazing process
58:46 and hariom by myself living at my house
58:48 up north in Silicon Valley and I'm
58:51 pounding out these lyrics and sharing
58:53 them with people and people read them I
58:56 snap a little fan base online the mid
58:57 90s and they would they would realize
59:02 that I had the same frustration they did
59:04 but I had worked for but I know a half a
59:07 decade to perfect my language and say
59:09 they're like oh my gosh she said this
59:10 the way I feeling it but you said it in
59:12 a much deeper way which is the way we
59:14 feel it and so they were vicariously
59:16 living through my lyrics which was cool
59:18 and I'll give you kind of a shortcut to
59:20 running decent poetry if you've never
59:23 done it before but you may you know have
59:26 some sort of desire to try it out it
59:29 used to be this must still exists if you
59:32 go to a creative writing class at any
59:33 point in junior high high school college
59:35 there's usually that day where the
59:37 teacher assigns you to a project where
59:40 you simply sort of write into a document
59:44 just every single word and concept
59:46 that's coming to you as fast as you can
59:48 you don't worry if the previous word has
59:51 anything to do with the next word you
59:52 don't worry the previous sentence
59:54 matches the next sentence you just keep
59:56 writing and you'll either have a you'll
59:59 be having a good day where you're
60:01 writing a bunch of positive stuff or you
60:02 may be feeling frustrated and you start
60:05 to purge I would say do that experiment
60:11 with yourself for as long as you can
60:13 until there's going to be this wild
60:16 sweet spot it's it's really phenomenal
60:19 it's almost as if to to plagiarize my
60:24 episode on creativity way back in season
60:26 one I believe very wholeheartedly that
60:30 the universe is a very conscious set of
60:33 beings I think that everything that's
60:35 ever lived on earth transcends into that
60:37 realm I don't think everything in that
60:38 realm has been human but there's a
60:41 there's a beautiful contract that you
60:43 can write with the universe without
60:45 signing any documentation of blood it
60:48 basically says that if the way that it
60:50 works is this if you demonstrate to the
60:52 universe that you are willing to invest
60:54 the universe is right there to invest in
60:56 you but if you don't buy the guitar
61:02 there's no one out there is going to
61:04 give you a guitar solo in your head I
61:05 mean they might but they're trying to
61:08 entice you to get the instrument to pay
61:10 attention to what you have is the
61:11 capability once you start doing sort of
61:15 this kind of sort of abstract writing
61:17 and you do it consistently
61:20 you start to teach the universe that you
61:22 are willing to express and channel
61:24 thoughts into words eventually the
61:28 universe will start to bless you with
61:30 clearer and clearer visions of what you
61:32 want to say they understand that you
61:35 know being alive is to be experienced
61:36 right we get I think a little bit
61:38 confused in this world with experiencing
61:41 life means you have to go out to a beach
61:43 and run around in the sand you have to
61:45 go to a football game or travel to Rome
61:48 hey I'm not going to take that away from
61:50 the assertion sure we should probably do
61:53 those things as well live in the
61:56 environment that you live and enjoy it
61:58 right but there's a huge frontier that
62:02 makes those experiences in my opinion
62:04 much more rewarding which is the one
62:06 that's inside your mind
62:07 for a second you have to you have to
62:10 accept the fact that we are inside a
62:12 vessel for reason in my opinion it is
62:15 not because this is the only way to be
62:16 alive it's because this is a way to be
62:19 alive it brings with it restrictions and
62:24 those restrictions I believe have been
62:26 imposed to sort of focus us on what is
62:32 important perhaps it's a stage you know
62:35 the caterpillar turns into a butterfly
62:36 perhaps until we become enlightened we
62:39 are nothing more than a caterpillar
62:40 running around eating pop culture all
62:42 [ __ ] day and what we need to do is
62:44 turn into a butterfly and what's the
62:45 difference what is the physical
62:47 difference between a caterpillar and a
62:48 butterfly besides the way that their
62:50 bodies are put together one crawls on
62:52 the ground one crawls on vegetation one
62:56 is heavily preyed upon because it can't
62:59 go anywhere else but on surfaces and
63:03 then a butterfly happens this is crazy
63:07 metamorphosis of the body
63:09 it grows freaking wings a caterpillar
63:12 and a butterfly look nothing alike do
63:14 you realize that it's got to be one of
63:16 the most amazing things that's happened
63:18 here but you can then fly you can fly in
63:23 3d space perch yourself on something the
63:28 butterfly can now man is probably not
63:31 going to get to a point where we cocoon
63:32 ourselves and come out of a flying being
63:36 physically but enlightenment feels just
63:41 the same how many of you have ever
63:43 looked back on yourself 20 years ago and
63:46 you say Jesus I am so not that person
63:49 anymore
63:49 it's not that you have anything critical
63:52 to say about yourself at all it's just
63:54 look how I mean you might even Envy what
63:56 it was like to be ignorant and blissful
63:58 but in the end you probably take the
64:01 idea that it's better to be enlightened
64:04 because you become more like perhaps the
64:08 entire universe itself the more that you
64:10 do the universe has the burden of the
64:12 universe if there is a God then God has
64:15 the burden of all things and the more I
64:18 grow up and the more I become loosely
64:20 more enlightened as time passes the more
64:22 I realized that the job of God is
64:24 something I would never want it's a big
64:28 job
64:29 it's an all-consuming job how do I even
64:32 have time for myself if I'm taking care
64:34 of everything in the universe I'm sure
64:37 that mystery will be solved in a much
64:39 more elegant way when we find out the
64:42 answer if we ever do right now I'm in a
64:44 physical human body with you in this
64:47 universe and so the game is between
64:50 myself my immediate surroundings my
64:53 three sectors of life self work and
64:55 family and you my fellow men I do not
65:02 believe for a second that God has
65:03 outsourced salvation to another man
65:05 therefore all organized religions that
65:08 are selling salvation I personally
65:10 believe is an act of the devil if there
65:12 ever was one
65:14 always remember always remember for
65:18 those Christians out there get all upset
65:20 with me the first voice that you listen
65:23 to to tell you that you're not with God
65:26 and that you can't be with God because
65:29 you're sinful
65:30 the voice that told you that was the
65:33 serpent in the garden there couldn't be
65:37 a more OnPoint metaphor than that first
65:40 book if you are Christian unfortunately
65:44 you've been buying the story of a
65:46 metaphorical devil in the form of a
65:48 snake talking to perfect man let's not
65:53 do that listen to ourselves
65:55 listen let's listen to the universe feel
65:58 how you feel every moment that you feel
66:01 if you're filling in emotion you don't
66:03 want to have especially towards about a
66:05 human being go find out if pop culture
66:08 is the reason why you feel that way why
66:11 do we get angry in traffic well why are
66:15 we in traffic in the first place why do
66:18 we feel like we have to get to a
66:19 destination usually it's a pop culture
66:21 based the whole invention of a car is
66:25 the corporate entity to burn oil to burn
66:29 energy to buy a car that's not meant to
66:32 sustain its value
66:34 I mean how [ __ ] up is if you buy a car
66:37 for say $30,000 you drive off the lot
66:40 and it's only worth 20 doesn't that
66:43 sound like a criminal organization and
66:45 yet we swallow it every single day
66:48 because it's pop culture's way that's
66:51 why this show exists here's the thing
66:53 what's the value of being enlightened
66:56 the value of being enlightened is that
66:58 you increase your ability to perceive
67:00 truth to see more we obviously know that
67:05 the more that you can see the truth
67:07 whether or not we totally agree on what
67:09 is true or what isn't true you start to
67:12 see at least the evil forces that are
67:15 destroying your life if your parents you
67:18 have one amazing epiphany that happens
67:20 every single time you have a child you
67:23 have the life that you've lived up to
67:25 the point your child was born and then
67:28 you have the life that you're fearing
67:29 that they're going to live after you're
67:32 gone and you realize at that point that
67:36 what everyone believes in the world is
67:38 important we mistakenly make the the
67:44 goal of saying well just do all I have
67:46 to do is live my life to make everyone
67:47 believe how I believe like specifically
67:49 not theoretically theoretically you
67:52 could be right be enlightened you know
67:54 realize that love they actually exist
67:56 drop some acid for Christ's sake if you
67:58 have any problem figuring that out at
68:00 that point you live the rest of your
68:02 life
68:02 trying to fix the planet for your kids
68:05 I've got friends of mine they're
68:08 billionaires and they it's what they're
68:09 trying to do and there's only so much
68:14 you can fix in a lifetime so you go for
68:15 the low-hanging fruit maybe a couple
68:17 couple high hanging fruit but man it's
68:19 tough I know you feel me I've gone on
68:22 quite a bit here a lot of positives and
68:25 this one's always try to overshoot so if
68:26 I'm looking at the camera in the cameras
68:28 is I've gone an hour but I know I've
68:29 paused probably ten minutes I usually
68:31 try to go over at this point this
