00:29 good evening ladies and gentlemen
00:31 welcome back to deep thoughts I got me a
00:35 new box of rocky Patel's sometimes you
00:40 guys asked me what I'm smoking I'm
00:42 soaking at a 10 edge which has got this
00:46 kind of was it called the barbershop
00:51 rappers it's gonna duro rapper and
00:55 that's a Connecticut or nut let me be a
00:57 sun-grown or something so I'm trying to
01:00 give you know a really good episode
01:02 topic that doesn't go back into some of
01:04 the stuff we've already recently covered
01:06 because I've kind of done a big 360 now
01:09 and this is the time in the season in
01:11 the 70s that you know I'd say okay we've
01:15 done 70 episodes this season and it's
01:20 kind of like okay what do we talk about
01:23 cuz we could talk about a lot of little
01:25 things which i think was what i'm gonna
01:28 do with this episode back because i
01:30 usually create a big picture episode and
01:34 i think this will be a big picture 2020
01:36 cuz their other option is to talk about
01:38 one thing for a really long time as of
01:41 right now the most current episode is
01:43 the NASA waste episode 470 we just
01:48 crossed the 47 years of time listened to
01:52 on YouTube so for those of you don't
01:54 know what that means if you total up all
01:56 the minutes consumed on just YouTube
01:58 it's 47 years and I assure you with the
02:02 podcast factored in it's at least half
02:04 more so we're well over probably 67
02:10 years at least consumed I'll never know
02:13 how much the podcast has been consumed
02:17 okay so a big-picture episode for those
02:20 of you have never heard one maybe you
02:22 just subscribed the last episode which
02:24 we had a net zero on the NASA thing the
02:28 episodes gotten within about 30 hours
02:33 850 views which is a lot and zero
02:37 subscribers
02:38 so you know they do things when I they
02:41 penalize me with canceling a bunch of
02:43 counts or whatever doing their purge on
02:45 our account any time we have a success
02:49 so there's just all kinds of [ __ ]
02:51 going on with you too but whatever you
02:54 know without you guys referring it and
02:58 it's a weird entity to be first I don't
02:59 even blame anybody I'm just glad you
03:01 found me so let's have some fun here so
03:05 the first time I came up with the idea
03:07 for a big picture
03:08 I guess dissertation it was on my
03:13 website one page news.com which I share
03:17 some of the writing with other folks one
03:20 of them being my former Coast of them
03:21 killed to radio Kyle but I wrote you
03:26 know the overwhelming majority of the
03:28 articles but I created a big diagram in
03:32 that article and it broke down
03:35 everything as I saw it but the the cool
03:39 thing is is we have a new president the
03:41 I seats of America which has completely
03:43 blown up the absurd level of negativity
03:48 that the big picture typically had to
03:50 bring the reader right it was always bad
03:53 news and there's there's more bad news
03:55 and then there's more bad news right I
03:57 think the big picture for 2020 and what
04:01 I'm going to say is going to sound
04:03 cliche if you watch a lot of sort of
04:07 Great Awakening content on YouTube or
04:11 bid shoot or wherever you're going to
04:13 get that content and that is that we are
04:17 at war in this world we are in a deep
04:25 state ideological war they thought they
04:32 had this whole thing in the bag with
04:34 smuggling Hillary into the presidency in
04:36 2016 starting in 2017
04:40 and she lost and then they thought okay
04:45 well we got this dopey guy that wears
04:47 you know you know orange makeup on his
04:53 face give himself a false tan
04:55 he's got weird hair yada yada and so
04:59 they thought oh this will be easy we'll
05:01 just knock Trump right out of there
05:04 they have not been able to do it not
05:08 only that well very quickly into the end
05:12 of 2017 we got this this seventeen guy
05:16 that shows up and he starts throwing
05:20 down all this wild crazy [ __ ] right now
05:24 for those of you are hardcore listeners
05:26 you know that I'm I'm almost fed up with
05:28 that dude too many too many promises too
05:32 many gypsy reading metaphorical [ __ ]
05:35 that could just be absolutely
05:37 interpreted however you want to
05:39 interpret it the same way two people are
05:42 great argue over a Bible passage that's
05:44 2000 years old and read by a million
05:47 people before them if not a billion is
05:51 the same thing that Q has been doing
05:53 he's been writing a bunch of you know a
05:55 bunch of stuff and when he's caught
05:57 lying he has taught his listeners to say
06:03 oh well this information is necessary
06:06 sometimes all right you know and it's
06:11 the guy's a genius because that those
06:13 are real place those are real plays
06:14 disinfo is necessary but that guy's
06:20 saying we landed on the moon through
06:21 some secret covert space program was
06:25 unnecessary so this is where the guy
06:29 just got drunk on his power to influence
06:33 others came up with some ridiculous
06:36 thing and then walked away from it is
06:41 the fast as fast as he admitted it he
06:43 walked away from it because he knew oops
06:45 that's a huge lie we had the one thing I
06:48 do actually think that is the most
06:53 and this is not gonna be a queue up so
06:54 bunny means the one thing that he said
06:56 that was I think potential
06:58 disinformation but might make more sense
07:01 to me would be saying that JFK jr. is
07:04 dead
07:05 when this might be him I know that
07:10 sounds nuts
07:11 I am never seen anyone other than the
07:13 Fort Knox queue photograph it looks
07:17 anything like the guy this Vincent fusca
07:20 guy is five seven five six or something
07:23 like that he's not that tall he's not
07:25 JFK jr. size JFK jr. is one of most
07:28 handsome dudes out there so you know if
07:30 you're gonna if he's gonna even if he's
07:33 eighteen years older give me a break
07:35 look at you know half the movie stars in
07:39 Hollywood that her but Johnny Depp he
07:42 was handsome in the early 90s and he's
07:45 handsome now he's 30 years older so this
07:48 idea that he suddenly turns into a pudgy
07:50 thing is sort of ridiculous but anyway
07:54 so you know that I started mentioning
07:56 the agenda21 stuff about me 2030
08:02 episodes ago and then I started
08:05 experimenting with sharing it with
08:07 friends very strategically like I don't
08:09 do anything that's just oh I'm just
08:12 gonna come in here and it's just for no
08:14 reason I'm just being a dick or whatever
08:17 every words chosen every technique is
08:21 chosen the people are chosen the
08:24 demographics are chosen the geography is
08:26 chosen and what was interesting is as I
08:30 shared the agenda twenty one thing and
08:33 I've mentioned this I think in one
08:35 episode listen yeah you know one of them
08:41 was like a part of my house wife's the
08:43 other ones are working females in the
08:44 Midwest where I'm from and the guys will
08:47 chime in as well but they're they
08:49 weren't leading the conversation
08:50 initially but I started sharing Rosa
08:54 Corey's link and actually sir I shared
08:59 the information first that was the
09:00 strategy behind it was to share it in
09:03 221 and see what they would say so you
09:06 should study this
09:06 because this is what's really going on
09:08 in the world and if you're really scared
09:09 about what's what Trump is doing then
09:12 you may just need to get updated on
09:15 what's really going on and then you'll
09:16 realize he's the only guy in the world
09:18 fighting these people with his staff and
09:21 perhaps the military and so like
09:25 clockwork one of the self-righteous
09:29 working females came in this is not even
09:32 a female thing because the guys did the
09:33 same thing right after so I'm not
09:34 picking on women here at all she came in
09:38 it was like oh you and your conspiracy
09:39 theories buh buh buh buh buh I'm saying
09:42 great I got you right where I want you
09:44 I wrote a script you read the lines now
09:47 watch for the crescendo and I posted
09:50 Rosa Cory video from the I think she was
09:55 in was it Iceland I think or Norway
10:00 somewhere in that area she was just
10:01 given a really great little video again
10:04 the woman's an attorney for eminent
10:06 domain evaluations she is a lesbian and
10:10 she is a liberal libertarian scuse me so
10:13 the last person on earth that would ever
10:15 fall into a Trump demographic she is
10:19 tweeting every day well no not every day
10:21 but every week calling out policies
10:24 supporting Trump saying Trump doing this
10:28 knocks out this agenda21 think now Rosa
10:31 Korey formed an organization around 2012
10:35 to legally go after this infiltration in
10:39 the United States of America and the
10:42 funny thing was is that she mentioned
10:47 how Americans think this is a conspiracy
10:49 it is not true but in the European Union
10:53 they meet once a year from all the
10:56 countries to make sure Jenna 21 is
10:58 continuing forward which again starts
11:02 with a big depopulation then it ends
11:05 with poverty being the top tier of
11:10 everyone except for the folks that are
11:12 running the show so everyone's in
11:14 poverty
11:17 97% of the world is gone we're all
11:20 pushed into these cities where
11:23 surveillance is biologically implanted
11:27 into your body it is part of your home
11:29 you will always be listened to if you
11:33 happen to develop a critical thinking
11:35 you are then grabbed and probably killed
11:41 because why waste the energy and trying
11:43 to rehabilitate you me seriously it's
11:47 really interesting to me about agenda 21
11:48 and I mentioned you're gonna you know
11:52 the hark our listeners bear with me for
11:54 a second
11:55 there's two fictional things that
11:57 happened in Hollywood and TV that are
12:01 agenda twenty one sort of archetypes one
12:04 probably I don't know if the Jena 21 was
12:09 somewhere in the works in the 50s but
12:13 there was a well actually I'll give you
12:15 three so I believe it's an X minus one
12:18 radio show episode where a gentleman was
12:22 trying to hoard a book in the future
12:25 because books were not allowed and he
12:28 liked poetry and so it's him escaping in
12:34 a ship with his stuff I can't remember
12:37 how the conclusion works if he died or
12:39 not but then very shortly after that
12:42 within a few years Rod Serling the
12:46 creator and writer of half of all the
12:48 Twilight zones the gentleman who you
12:50 know introduces the show he wrote an
12:54 episode called obsolete man I believe he
12:56 wrote it burgess Meredith plays the
12:59 character and it is this agenda21 future
13:02 and burgess meredith character who i
13:06 can't remember his name in the show he
13:08 was a carpenter
13:09 well nice Jesus kind of metaphor right
13:12 and he was deemed obsolete but at the
13:16 same time he hoarded books at his his
13:22 apartment his you know
13:25 government-appointed apartment
13:28 and so he was tried in this court with
13:33 no representation at all they just
13:35 looked at him and said from this huge
13:36 tall podium that's like 30 feet tall or
13:39 something and they're looking down on
13:40 him and they said you know you were you
13:47 know what is it coveting like contraband
13:49 and so you were caught with these books
13:51 and therefore you're sentenced to death
13:55 and in this futuristic world you were
13:56 allowed allowed to pick your form of
13:58 death and there's a really funny version
14:01 of that and the Monty Python meeting a
14:02 life and he said well I want it
14:05 televised
14:05 and I want to die by a bomb in my
14:10 apartment just kill me gnarrk okay hey
14:14 because you're a citizen of this
14:16 beautiful communistic weird world a
14:18 socialist a communist ik world no
14:21 problem so they rigged a bomb in his
14:23 house and the guy who's in charge who's
14:26 I know he's the president or what he is
14:28 but he's like the man who put hands down
14:31 the law he is invited to burgess
14:34 Meredith this apartment and I believe
14:38 he's reading the Bible he gets a copy of
14:40 the Bible out he starts reading it and a
14:42 camera's been installed in the room
14:44 Burgess I believe tricks him and says I
14:51 locked the door and you can't get out so
14:53 you're gonna die here with me and the
14:56 guy panics and screams and shouts and
14:58 says a bunch of stuff that you're not
15:00 supposed to say trying to get out of the
15:01 door and Burt you know Burgess goes over
15:03 and unlocks the door go ahead
15:05 but by that time bomb explodes Burgess
15:08 dies but now the guy is completed
15:11 committed heresy on camera and he gets
15:15 sentenced and he is obsolete but he
15:18 fights back but he can't nothing he goes
15:21 down they roll credits
15:22 basically they tell us that he's gone
15:24 he's gonna be prosecuted and killed it's
15:27 interesting and then of course there's
15:31 thx 1:38 george lucas's first movie ever
15:35 very very massage agenda 21 world
15:40 it's kind of a hard movie to watch
15:42 because it's an old-style slower white
15:46 shot kind of movie the kids don't dig
15:49 today so that people haven't seen it
15:51 they'll start watching it and god this
15:53 is just morbid and you're like yeah it's
15:56 morbid and you know why it's morbid
15:58 because this is your [ __ ] future if
16:00 you don't get rid of agenda21
16:02 this will be your whole life this
16:04 fiction you don't want to watch on TV
16:06 that'll be your future and of course
16:09 George Orwell did a beautiful job back
16:13 in the 30s
16:14 we have Huxley's brave new world which
16:19 we have seen so many typology matches
16:24 between the brave new world and today
16:26 and one of them is getting all these
16:28 kids and all these drugs little did we
16:31 know if he wrote it about like sexual
16:34 assimilation drugs and stuff we're
16:37 talking about ADHD stuff ATD stuff every
16:40 ramification of taking a vaccination is
16:44 why you take a drug it's just this cause
16:46 and effect model
16:47 that's horrible right so the big picture
16:53 until we can look at the first world
16:57 nations of this planet and look at them
17:01 very closely look at their prime
17:03 ministers their Chancellor's and their
17:05 presidents until we can look at the
17:07 world and say there are no more kings
17:09 and queens maybe in their head they know
17:12 they were related to them at one point
17:14 but there are no more functioning kings
17:16 and queens anywhere in the world you can
17:18 say you're royalty that's fine but you
17:20 have absolutely no possessions of any
17:22 kind and you have no control because you
17:25 have no possessions you the money has to
17:26 be ceased the property has to be
17:29 distributed to the people there cannot
17:31 be any more monarchies on this planet
17:33 banking has to be completely reformed
17:36 petrol you know dollars have to be
17:40 reformed now I know a lot of folks are
17:44 especially the own Bitcoin are very
17:47 excited that they own Bitcoin just hit
17:49 10,000 the other day like two and a half
17:52 months ago is 8,700 buck
17:55 that's a good appreciation it's been way
17:59 higher in the past and you know get this
18:01 McAfee dude saying it'll be a million
18:03 dollars a coin reinsulate whatever
18:06 here's the problem with Bitcoin and
18:09 anything that's currently been submitted
18:12 as a Bitcoin species it doesn't work for
18:18 one reason you cannot have an economy a
18:23 money supply by which it is not endorsed
18:28 by any country it is not endorsed by any
18:31 bank which should probably be federally
18:35 controlled and again I know that we have
18:37 corrupt federal people the Federal
18:40 Reserve is obviously not federal it's a
18:42 private for-profit bank perpetrating
18:44 itself as federal but we cannot have an
18:48 economy by which someone invents it
18:52 sends out a bunch of emails to their
18:54 best friends and says I'm gonna sell
18:55 allotments of this stuff to you you will
18:59 then be the new Monarchs you will be the
19:02 new trillionaires of the world because
19:05 there's a sooner quality to it sooner
19:08 those of you are not from America and
19:10 those of you from America with no
19:12 historical education I totally get it
19:15 here we go
19:16 Kansas was a state well let me give the
19:20 full perspective here Kansas is a state
19:23 in the United States of America that's
19:24 directly in the center of the country it
19:26 is where I am from you talk about
19:29 Midwest does get any more Midwest than
19:31 where I came from but it was a state in
19:34 the Union prior to Oklahoma Oklahoma is
19:38 just south of Kansas so the Kansas
19:40 Oklahoma border is the southern border
19:43 of Kansas and the northern border of
19:44 Oklahoma looks like a frying pan in case
19:48 you want to look on a map or case you've
19:50 seen a map oh yeah remember that state
19:53 but when they decided to pass out the
19:56 land for Oklahoma they had a Bitcoin
20:02 experience
20:03 they told everyone okay tomorrow morning
20:08 at a certain time you're gonna get on
20:10 your horse
20:10 you're gonna have your wagon or whatever
20:13 you have you're gonna have spikes and
20:15 rope and you're gonna write out there
20:18 and whatever land you can mark off it's
20:22 yours for free I believe was free but as
20:28 history always has it a bunch of people
20:33 went out the night before illegally and
20:37 marked off you know hundreds if not
20:40 thousands of acres so that when the
20:43 people that were obeying the law came
20:45 across a bunch of great land was already
20:47 taken and that's Bitcoin and that's
20:51 [ __ ]
20:52 now blockchain Bitcoin technology it's
20:56 fine that's totally fine but you cannot
20:59 have an initial allotment whereby it is
21:01 just a happenstance moment or a bunch of
21:05 people own the coins the United States
21:07 of America should probably create some
21:09 sort of Bitcoin purposely you know its
21:15 own economy so we don't mix with other
21:19 call you know other virtual economies
21:23 around the world because once you have
21:25 one central economy which I know sounds
21:28 great
21:29 corruption can get in there and
21:31 immediately control the world will have
21:34 to fight corruption in any country
21:37 around the world with the digital
21:38 currency no matter what happens but
21:40 they're gonna look at the population of
21:42 individuals in the world or I should say
21:46 United States of America where about 350
21:48 million here so we have to create a
21:51 virtual economy create a fixed supply
21:53 based on how many people we have and
21:58 because we don't want to be dealing with
21:59 point zero zero zero zero one Bitcoin to
22:02 pay for dinner we're going to have to
22:05 create more bitcoins than there are
22:07 human beings in a particular country I
22:10 don't know what what we pick but it
22:13 should be something on the level of
22:16 you've got some cash dollars you get to
22:19 convert those directly into this new
22:21 economy maybe the giant majority of it
22:24 sits in some computer and waits to be
22:28 consumed by a new banking system with no
22:31 compound interest of any kind you know
22:35 as I always say the perfect banking
22:40 system is fees for loans penalties for
22:43 not paying back loans second you get the
22:46 loan pay back you get your new llem
22:49 because [ __ ] happens you know but again
22:52 bitcoin can't be the choice in any one
22:55 of those currencies cannot be the choice
22:57 because it has already been messed up
22:59 through its privileged distribution now
23:04 one of the you know one of the linchpins
23:08 one of the pivotal things about the big
23:11 picture
23:11 is education and the war that we are
23:18 fighting against the jinn 221 let's just
23:23 say that we had everyone in the United
23:24 States of America wake up tomorrow and
23:27 we were able to at night when everyone
23:30 was asleep being down a hundred percent
23:34 of Jenna twenty-one knowledge but the
23:39 problem is is if we didn't beam the
23:41 solutions if we didn't have all the
23:43 legislation reset to exterminate agenda
23:48 21 out of our country the next thing you
23:51 will find is what Pompeyo just told
23:55 everyone Secretary of State former head
23:57 of the CIA who said look China is trying
24:00 to take over the world they are actively
24:03 assessing every single governor mayor
24:06 and they're trying to buy everybody off
24:08 I think what Pompeo was really saying is
24:12 we know a bunch of you took money so
24:15 this is your only warning shot the
24:19 schoolbooks that our kids use in public
24:23 schools
24:24 are all written by the ruling class most
24:30 of their publishers link back to
24:32 European publishers okay what else is a
24:36 European organization by which we form
24:39 reality Reuters and ap Reuters body P
24:44 it's the same organization on top of
24:49 that you've got you know maybe some
24:51 local agenda folks but what do we know
24:55 about the infiltration of the media in
24:58 the mid 50s in the United States of
25:00 America and believe me it happened in
25:02 Europe and it happened all over the
25:03 place welcome back to education a second
25:06 year but I'll try and make a bigger
25:07 point first project Mockingbird project
25:14 Mockingbird was the Intelligence Agency
25:16 this is gonna be I think repeating my
25:19 liars episode they infiltrated the press
25:21 and they bought everybody off and you
25:27 know what kind of scumbag takes a check
25:29 to lie to their own citizens I mean that
25:33 is a special kind of scumbag but by 1970
25:37 they estimated the amount of journalists
25:40 senior journalists and people on TV was
25:43 up to a thousand people this is these
25:47 are the editors of newspapers the
25:49 editors television shows producers plus
25:53 like a Dan Rather's someone who anyone
25:55 any one of these folks that join the
25:57 Council on Foreign Relations they're one
25:59 of the Mockingbird folks Donald Trump
26:03 does not belong to the CFR it would have
26:05 been really easy for him to get a
26:07 membership trust me so you can't trust
26:11 the press they are literally put there
26:15 to lie to you constantly okay so let's
26:20 say we wake up and we realized that
26:23 educating our children is the only
26:26 insurance that the world has a hope of
26:29 being run properly in the future because
26:31 these kids are gonna erase everybody
26:32 because everyone's going to die
26:33 eventually and they're gonna have to
26:36 raise up into
26:37 believing in a republic understanding
26:40 with communism and socialism is same
26:43 thing and they're gonna have to defend
26:48 freedom but they're gonna have to
26:49 understand what freedom is
26:52 we need a prosperous country to not need
26:55 socialistic handouts right if you're
26:58 broke you got to go in for government
27:00 aid if you're broke you're gonna have to
27:03 have free education free health care
27:07 free money
27:09 because you have nothing okay right now
27:15 the educational system is completely
27:17 skewed they barely teach you anything in
27:21 school anymore I give you a case in
27:23 point
27:24 you could be valedictorian at your high
27:27 school taking all the top classes all
27:31 the EAP classes right advanced placement
27:34 classes you will never be taught how a
27:37 credit card works unless the teacher
27:39 breaks the script of common core and
27:42 teaches you it just to protect you and
27:46 then you met you have a fraction of a
27:47 chance of actually understanding what
27:49 the teachers talking about because you
27:51 never had a credit card before he or she
27:53 is going to have to give you probably a
27:55 week if not a month's education with
27:58 role-playing so that you can find
28:00 yourself in a hole really really quick
28:03 sciences oh by the way if you got a
28:07 business degree in college
28:08 through Harvard University got your PhD
28:11 in business you may or may not ever be
28:14 taught how a credit card works now they
28:16 assume you're gonna figure it out
28:17 because you're gonna get one you're
28:18 gonna get bit I've been never gonna
28:19 teach you that you're not to learn the
28:22 things that if you got fed up with it
28:25 you could control them by turning it off
28:28 now as we see on the show a lot and it's
28:31 a very popular thing to say and it's a
28:33 very important thing to say you can also
28:36 be a science major in high school
28:39 especially get all the way out go into a
28:43 college get a four-year degree and you
28:45 may never hear the name Nikola Tesla
28:48 you hear about Nikola Tesla on YouTube
28:51 that's where you hear it
28:54 okay well almost all of you were
28:57 subscribers you know exactly the guy is
28:59 exactly what he did but if you're just
29:02 finding this episode okay he's the guy
29:05 that invented alternating current it's
29:07 all the power sources that we use today
29:08 save a battery which is DC and Edison
29:11 invention wireless technology of all
29:14 kinds 1g 2g 3G 4G 5g your wireless
29:18 routers at home all Tesla Nikola Tesla
29:24 charging a battery with induction
29:26 without plugging a wire to it Nikola
29:29 Tesla this guy died with hundreds of
29:34 patents who are you thought about you're
29:38 talking about Albert Einstein a complete
29:41 farce right the dude is a complete farce
29:44 go see my episode I believe 400 to get
29:49 the scoop on that guy he was a complete
29:52 charlatan the only thing he was ever
29:54 attached to was the photoelectric Nobel
29:57 Prize because the two guys wanted the
30:00 Nobel Prize for their work because it
30:01 gave them a ton of money as a prize to
30:04 further research so they attached him to
30:06 it
30:06 he smiled if they got it he walked
30:09 around with it had to give all his money
30:11 to his ex-wife who was the mathematician
30:13 and the genius who he hated to death was
30:17 said to have beat her routinely many
30:21 divorces her right after that and then
30:22 marries his first cousin
30:24 so you're taught the BS of the world but
30:30 education has to utterly be gutted and
30:33 rebuilt in this country what's
30:37 interesting about where I live which is
30:39 California which if you're in any other
30:41 state in the United States there's a lot
30:43 of perception not everybody believes
30:45 this and they shouldn't but there's a
30:47 lot of perception that California you
30:50 know is this sunny beach Disneyland
30:53 Hollywood place and granted there are
30:56 some wonderful wonderful geography
30:59 locations here that are amazing
31:02 but you gotta be rich to live in a lot
31:05 of these places but our education system
31:09 is so dysfunctional because these
31:11 Democrats have been running the place
31:12 for so long again when I arrived in
31:15 California 87 we had a Republican
31:16 governor and the place was booming
31:19 everything was booming everybody was
31:21 happy everybody was nice and now
31:25 everybody is so stressed out because
31:29 it's all turned into an agenda 21 thing
31:31 where they just keep raising taxes and
31:33 squeezing you and get rid of small
31:34 businesses for instance if you form a
31:38 corporation in California there's an
31:40 $850 year fee to keep a corporation open
31:44 well Delaware it's free right so in
31:49 other states have fees but they're
31:51 reasonable like a hundred bucks or
31:53 whatever you know you could get a
31:54 business license in California for about
31:56 a hundred and ten hundred twenty bucks
31:57 depending on your county you gonna file
32:00 in the newspaper and declare yourself
32:02 and all that kind of stuff but our
32:05 school systems are so poorly funded in
32:07 California that schools randomly shut
32:11 down district by district because they
32:15 didn't get their money from the state /
32:18 the federal government that's [ __ ] up
32:22 the kids barely go to school but they go
32:26 all year long the schools are designed
32:29 to break the parents's back by letting
32:32 kids off at noon on Wednesdays and 2:45
32:37 or so every other day the of the of the
32:42 week well then parents have to go pick
32:44 up their kids well how the hell you
32:47 gonna have a job but you got to pick up
32:48 your kid in the middle of the day
32:49 employers I have never worked for an
32:52 employer in California that would let a
32:55 parent leave to go pick up the kid take
32:57 them somewhere so what do you do you pay
33:00 for after-school events which is the
33:03 keep you kid
33:04 for another couple hours three hours
33:06 whatever you need they by six o'clock
33:08 the the fine goes up you know they'll
33:11 charge like a hundred bucks an hour I
33:13 mean they want you to come get your kid
33:16 but the schools are also indoctrinating
33:19 the hell are your kids there
33:21 indoctrinating your kids teaching them
33:23 climate change things trying to
33:26 determine their gender before they
33:28 should ever have to deal with what their
33:30 gender is they're not allowed to make
33:32 decisions on their own the decisions are
33:35 made for them according to the deep
33:37 state now used to make this point I'm
33:40 about to make in the first couple
33:42 seasons a lot I want to make it again so
33:47 yours truly I was technically born in
33:50 Germany spent two-and-a-half years over
33:52 there as a kid but as I was growing up
33:53 and going to school I was in Kansas for
33:55 all but a couple years where I spent it
33:58 in Massachusetts so when you go to
34:02 school in Kansas what ends up happening
34:03 is our libraries are full of books that
34:06 almost no area of the United States has
34:08 except for Midwestern farming
34:11 communities so I could go to the library
34:13 in my school and pull out a book that's
34:15 a hundred years old
34:16 two seconds and start reading it but the
34:19 teachers when you're in grade school
34:20 which for us when I was a kid was one
34:22 through six kindergarten through six
34:27 they'd read us Prairie stories and you
34:31 learn about how they used to live in
34:33 this country with almost nothing right
34:35 you learn interesting things like you
34:37 know sugar was almost never consumed by
34:40 a family it tells less about someone's
34:42 birthday and then dad would going to get
34:44 a little tiny bit of sugar just to make
34:46 a cake and the cake wasn't some
34:48 triple-layer thing it was just the
34:50 little tiny cake and the family shared
34:51 it but here's the interesting thing
34:56 again for those of you not in the United
34:58 States the Civil War in the United
35:02 States between the north and the south
35:04 was about 1861 about 1865 okay well
35:10 those soldiers wrote letters to their
35:13 family members from wherever they were
35:15 it was really the only communication
35:17 they had with their family while they
35:19 were out you know risking their lives
35:21 what they believed in
35:23 if any of you've ever watched a Civil
35:26 War
35:28 documentary that includes those letters
35:31 being spoken being read by actors you
35:35 soon realize that vocabularies were
35:37 massive you soon realized their
35:40 intellectual prowess at 18 years old
35:44 eclipses virtually every version of
35:47 adult today save a professor a poet
35:52 I saw another documentary that dealt
35:56 with this issue and it said the average
36:00 vocabulary of
36:01 a United States citizen in the 1860s was
36:08 around 10,000 words 10,000 unique words
36:11 they knew they knew the definitions they
36:14 knew how to spell it then you had a
36:16 right and beautiful cursive like like
36:19 ink pen cursive today the average
36:23 vocabulary of a kid coming out of high
36:26 school is between a thousand and 1200
36:30 ghetto schools 500 we don't know a spell
36:35 anymore we don't know how to pronounce
36:37 our words properly so the dictionaries
36:39 are caving in to a bunch of illiteracy
36:41 the dictionary is supposed to be the
36:44 rulebook of how to do something correct
36:46 and they're caving okay college graduate
36:54 has between 2000 and 2500 words if they
37:00 are majoring in some form of linguistics
37:02 or English so that takes a PhD level
37:07 professor of English to translate an
37:11 average letter from a soldier that they
37:14 wrote home during the Civil War so when
37:18 you think about how bad the education
37:19 system is today keep that little tidbit
37:22 in your mind we have gone backwards
37:26 almost forever just as soon as the
37:28 bankers infiltrated this country it
37:30 started going backwards there's another
37:33 little one I like to mention because my
37:35 writing teacher taught me this and he
37:37 taught me this without really realizing
37:41 the impact of what he was saying in my
37:43 opinion which is at the movie Casablanca
37:46 is a believe 176 pages and in Hollywood
37:52 a page is one minute of time on camera
37:54 and yet Casablanca was acted in under a
37:58 hundred and ten minutes because we spoke
38:02 faster back in those days and people
38:06 went to movie theaters to see this it
38:07 wasn't like it was a you know marathon
38:10 speaking contest and it was only for a
38:12 small collection of people in the world
38:14 know Casablanca super famous movie okay
38:18 just go watch it it's one of most
38:21 brilliant movies ever made but you'll
38:22 need to see something else to really
38:24 appreciate that
38:25 look at Robert Mickey's analysis we
38:28 cover the sciences all the time in this
38:30 show
38:32 Eric dollar all hell Eric dollar drin
38:38 this dude you know comes out of thin air
38:42 and and just he study electronics by
38:46 going backwards and looking at the
38:47 Masters consequently a strange thing
38:50 happened to me when I first moved to
38:52 California and started working for the
38:54 TurboTax people what he used to be
38:55 called Mac in tax there's almost it was
39:00 like six of us coding the thing great I
39:03 got into a startup with a couple guys at
39:06 work and the product this guy wasn't my
39:09 design I was gonna be the engineer that
39:10 was gonna write it was that they wanted
39:14 to create a simulation product that kids
39:17 can learn electronics by Rhee creating
39:21 all the experiments from Faraday to
39:23 Tesla and I was gonna draw the interface
39:26 and I was going to program an AI so the
39:28 kids could talk to the interface and we
39:30 can generally find out through keywords
39:32 what they were trying to do and get to
39:33 the next stage really bizarre came and
39:36 it went because there's some weird stuff
39:39 with these guys but anyway
39:41 Eric dullard did exactly that for
39:44 himself and now he runs around teaching
39:46 people
39:47 he's a very eccentric guy but he's a
39:50 gift to this world because now if he
39:52 were to pass away tomorrow I hope he
39:55 lives to be 200 but if he passes away
39:57 tomorrow he will have done his job on
39:59 earth which is to wake up tens of
40:04 thousands of people around the world who
40:06 watches videos as lectures which aren't
40:09 the easiest things to watch but you if
40:11 you have a desire to learn about the
40:14 true nature of electricity and the true
40:17 nature of the cosmos he's your man okay
40:22 well we talked about NASA a lot don't we
40:24 talk about what we can do what we can't
40:27 do
40:28 okay when you study electronics they
40:33 don't tell you about ether and they also
40:36 teach you methodology of how electricity
40:39 moves between components which is the
40:42 exact opposite direction that it moves
40:44 what do they tell you it's how you moves
40:47 from positive to negative which is an
40:48 android technology than a node theory
40:51 now very quickly if you get advanced
40:54 they'll teach you cathode technology
40:55 which is our cathode theory which is the
40:57 opposite in the true nature which is
40:59 negative to positive
41:00 but isn't interesting how there's all
41:03 these dogma theories which means a
41:04 theory that is exactly the opposite of
41:06 the way it works throw you off they keep
41:12 you in the dark feeding you [ __ ] and how
41:16 are you supposed to wake up you have to
41:18 have almost a serendipitous moment in
41:20 your life some random event where
41:22 someone comes up to you and says hey you
41:25 know you've ever talked about this I
41:27 ever thought about that well it's that
41:28 and they you know you pull this thread
41:31 out of the sweater and boom your mind is
41:33 blown and then you got to go off and do
41:35 you know a thousand hours of research to
41:37 wake up your brain you know as a parent
41:42 and even if you're not a parent you just
41:44 look at kids and you've had that feeling
41:46 of maternal instinct you want these
41:49 little kids to be happy you don't want
41:51 them to be racist you don't want them to
41:54 hate you don't want them to be
41:55 upside-down in their gender simply
41:57 because the school said something weird
41:59 to your kid and if your kid chooses that
42:01 well that's that's the way it should
42:03 work we have to accept their choices but
42:07 you don't want your kid all doctrine
42:08 aided with crap right the worst thing
42:11 you could do is teach a bunch of kids a
42:13 lie and then they go and you know
42:15 Massacre the adults and then they find
42:17 themselves dead because they were
42:20 worshiping their own demise such as
42:23 climate change right now right now we
42:25 have a corona virus that has blown up in
42:28 China someone asked me to completely
42:31 covered as an episode and I wouldn't
42:33 have enough information to go a complete
42:35 hour on it when the Ebola thing came out
42:39 in Africa I fell for that one hardcore
42:42 and was embarrassed to find out it was a
42:44 complete sham to punish some diamond
42:47 miners who were on strike I watched all
42:51 these videos after I made my little
42:52 episode where it showed a bunch of
42:54 people faking being ill on camera and
42:56 then someone else is filming from
42:58 another angle and you watch the actor
43:00 get up it's the citizen or I get up
43:02 smile at the camera walk off complete
43:05 hoax with coronavirus it seems like it's
43:10 an extremely real thing that coronavirus
43:11 has been around for god knows how many
43:14 years it was discovered I believe in the
43:18 40s or something but it's been on Lysol
43:19 cans for 50 60 70 years okay
43:24 so what happened well I have been
43:27 scouring the internet using the brave
43:31 browser as a matter of fact which will
43:32 actually show you independent sources
43:37 Vimeo videos where you can actually see
43:42 things that you do to wouldn't allow and
43:44 you can also see YouTube videos that
43:45 aren't promoted in a stream so you can
43:47 search on coronavirus secrets or
43:49 whatever hidden footage and YouTube's
43:51 trying to hide the [ __ ] out of it right
43:53 put the brave browser with the
43:55 DuckDuckGo search engine finds it and
43:58 gives it to you so it's cool
44:00 so the coronavirus has been out for a
44:02 long time and I want to say it's the
44:07 it's a Institute it starts with Roth
44:10 it's I can't remember but I want to say
44:13 it Ron's like Rothberg or something like
44:15 that anyway the Gates Foundation
44:18 specifically funded a I think it's
44:21 called BSL for laboratory research which
44:24 is a bio weapon research lab a BSL for a
44:27 laboratory I believe I have that acronym
44:29 correct it is a laboratory that creates
44:33 like you know killer viruses to wipe out
44:37 the world something that Gates would
44:39 love to have happen right he thinks he's
44:42 on a list whatever his foundation
44:47 directly funded within this other
44:49 Institute this coronavirus augmentation
44:56 because you can have a fairly decent
44:59 strand of the flu again there's over 360
45:03 strands of the flu but you can incubate
45:07 it up to the point it's very aggressive
45:11 it can't be killed which is that's what
45:14 aggressive means it's methodology of
45:17 showing its symptoms you want that to be
45:20 as long as possible if you want to kill
45:21 a bunch of people Crona virus the one
45:24 that's in China is a two week gestation
45:27 period 14 days before you start to show
45:29 signs that means you can run around for
45:32 two weeks and you can even you know say
45:35 you're trying to be careful and you're
45:36 looking around the public and you're
45:37 like oh there's somebody over the other
45:39 think you might have it and you look at
45:41 them and they look healthy you know they
45:43 come off a plane from China and you're
45:44 like oh yeah they seem really helped the
45:46 oh yeah I'll totally hug them in
45:47 whatever they sneeze the coughed in my
45:49 direction and I'm not worried because
45:51 they don't show any signs oh but a week
45:55 later they start showing signs and in
45:59 you're screwed right I believe the SARS
46:02 virus from 2003 had a fatality rate of
46:06 3%
46:08 initially the krona virus was estimated
46:11 around 2.5%
46:13 but that has now been raised risen that
46:16 has risen to fifteen percent that's a
46:20 bad problem supposedly it affects men
46:24 more than women we don't know if that's
46:28 true we don't know anything about what's
46:30 actually true but what we think has
46:35 occurred is that the United States and a
46:41 bunch of other organizations were
46:43 selling out to China anything that they
46:46 wanted Obama gave them our launch codes
46:51 virtually right he gave them codes to
46:54 break our radio signals between us and
46:56 our aircraft us and our naval ships and
46:59 he gave away all kinds of [ __ ] why do
47:02 you think their new fighter jet looks
47:04 just like the one lockheed made they
47:06 gave it to him well this Institute is in
47:10 Canada
47:10 this has incubated this up in their
47:12 bsl-4 lab my source is the old man that
47:16 wrote all of the bsl-4 regulations for
47:19 the United States of America Knight 289
47:21 which was all signed into law so it's a
47:25 pretty heavy hitter I'm repeating his
47:26 information according to this guy he
47:30 said he has no doubt that either Canada
47:34 gave them this virus or through
47:36 espionage which the Chinese are
47:38 extremely well known for they stole it I
47:42 would just think they got it they were
47:45 given this the other one is that they
47:48 don't know if there's a genetic marker
47:52 and it for a particular race that was
47:54 another rumor that was started that
47:56 perhaps it is more targeted towards
47:58 Asians well if that's the case if that
48:01 indeed would be the case I would
48:03 wondered if I was President Xi of China
48:06 because I'd want to create an antidote
48:07 to make sure if this craps ever dropped
48:09 in my country we could you know solve
48:12 the problem but there's a VSO for lab
48:15 ten kilometers outside of Wuhan China
48:19 okay
48:21 what is interesting about one I think
48:25 Wuhan province is about 11 million
48:27 people but they have something called
48:31 wet markets and what markets is sort of
48:35 an old tradition in China where they
48:38 believe in eating things extremely fresh
48:41 which technically speaking that is the
48:44 best way to eat any meat keep it alive
48:46 at the last second then kill it then eat
48:49 it now China also has a China and Japan
48:52 both have this perverted thing where
48:54 they love to torture an animal while
48:55 they're eating it right they like it to
48:57 be alive while they're carving it out
48:58 it's just disgusting but that's our
49:01 cultural difference to us it's super
49:05 inhumane to keep an octopus alive while
49:07 you're cutting it into pieces and eating
49:09 it and a lot of octopuses will octopi
49:13 will still move after you kill it
49:15 but they don't make sure they get the
49:16 little brain pop you know but anyway
49:19 that's their method of doing it January
49:23 26th of this year 2020 I watched a
49:26 documentary of a guy are not documented
49:27 what ever video of a guy was an American
49:30 you walking around the Wuhan province
49:32 filming the wet markets still
49:34 operational
49:35 they were banned in China in 2013 but
49:39 they looked the other way because of
49:40 this tradition so what's just what's
49:45 wrong with keeping a bunch of live
49:46 animals in a particular location well
49:51 unlike other communities like the North
49:55 Koreans keep their their towns
49:57 [ __ ] and span for the most part right in
50:00 China hygiene is marginal
50:04 depending on where you are it just is
50:06 okay this dude filmed blood just all
50:11 over the ground and and people just
50:13 sitting there eating lunch next to big
50:14 pools of blood no one had a hose washing
50:18 into a dream making sure that you know
50:20 we don't let this stuff pile up but one
50:23 of the grossest things he filmed was he
50:25 and they're not even learning the
50:27 slightest bit concerned this guy's
50:28 filming this it's an illegal operation
50:30 in Wuhan he's walking around the video
50:32 camera filming himself and he turned the
50:34 camera but he points it at a wall
50:37 it was probably about 10 to 15 feet
50:40 indent in this building and they had
50:43 stacked up cages like bird cages it's
50:46 very dark in this wall even though it's
50:48 daytime it's in the shadow of the
50:50 building what you could see with the
50:54 little bit of light wood that was there
50:56 is that the first two layers of the
50:58 cages were chickens but you could hear
51:03 down below the dogs down below and these
51:06 are all dogs right I got a friend of
51:08 mine who's from Taiwan and he always
51:14 says oh no they don't eat dogs and the
51:16 only one species of dog and that is
51:19 categorically not true
51:21 just go look at the web market specific
51:24 videos it's every species of every
51:27 animal every dog that's there now we
51:30 domesticate animals they don't at least
51:34 they'll eat anything right but they will
51:37 in Provence what markets also have like
51:39 rats on a stick cooked very common food
51:44 but the chickens are crapping down this
51:47 cage onto these poor animals and so the
51:50 amount of unsanitary conditions that
51:54 these animals are in prior to killing
51:57 them and eating them is that all these
52:00 animals are full of all kinds of
52:02 influenza and viruses and God knows what
52:06 I mean you know rabies can be carried in
52:09 a dog okay so what we know and I watched
52:15 I watched a bunch of things bunch of
52:17 journalists some Chinese I had to watch
52:19 everything in Chinese and watch the
52:21 subtitles some of them were European
52:23 journalists happen to live there summer
52:25 citizens and then this virologist guy he
52:27 lives in America the other thing I found
52:30 out was that they were working on this
52:32 virus by late November
52:36 so we'd make this false calculation in
52:39 our mind that oh well then you know
52:41 we'll repeat it to some well they had it
52:42 in November Oh November okay the truth
52:45 of the matter is before you would start
52:47 a dedicated program to to kick a viruses
52:50 but you
52:51 have to see a bunch of cases come in
52:53 because a couple cases of you're not
52:55 gonna do anything special even if it was
52:57 coronavirus so all indications were that
53:01 they had a an epidemic small one by at
53:06 least the first of November or even
53:08 October and they weren't saying anything
53:10 to anyone they were working on it the
53:15 Chinese kid who knows the people that
53:18 work at the hospitals he says look the
53:20 doctors and this was repeated by a
53:22 European journalist these two guys are
53:24 not in the same room they don't know
53:25 each other the kid said I talked to my
53:29 family members who work at these
53:30 hospitals and this is what they told me
53:32 and then the other guy said the exact
53:33 same thing that by December they told
53:38 all the doctors and the nurses not to
53:39 say a word about this but they were
53:42 gonna somehow you know solve the problem
53:44 in a communist country that's what super
53:46 dangerous you don't have freedom of
53:47 speech so this thing is spreading the
53:51 country is not telling anyone to stay
53:53 home
53:54 the country is not telling anyone to
53:56 wear masks and so it is and it's kind of
54:00 two weeks gestation period whoa so they
54:06 start working on this thing by the end
54:08 of November they're starting to tell the
54:11 City Council of who Hahn that this is a
54:14 Kurt the Chinese New Year's is about to
54:17 come on where there's a huge tradition
54:19 of going to these wet markets grabbing a
54:22 bunch of these animals I don't know if
54:24 they keep them alive or not but then
54:26 they distribute them all around the
54:27 country as hey I brought some this stuff
54:29 you can't have because we were running
54:30 illegal markets yay so listen just
54:34 infected infested animals tortured
54:38 utterly tortured animals right where all
54:41 the animal activists in this world
54:43 seriously stop lecturing first world
54:45 countries about this stuff right so I
54:51 guess I think the dates are the
54:53 following because this kid was pissed
54:55 this Chinese kid was just pissed he's
54:57 wearing a mask and he's got a little
54:58 microphone up to his mouth and he said
55:01 that what infuriated him and this was
55:04 echoed by this year peeing guy was that
55:08 in fact the European guy really talked
55:09 about what happened he said that on the
55:12 25th of January the the City Council
55:18 people were throwing a big celebration
55:19 for the New Year's all knowing very well
55:23 that this epidemic is spreading all over
55:25 their city it's probably being
55:29 distributed all around the country
55:30 because no one has warned anyone yet
55:32 right
55:32 the kid was said on the 25th we were all
55:36 walking around without masks on and in
55:38 the 26 we've got the first quarantine
55:40 zone and now we have to wear masks so he
55:44 said they knew they knew a long time ago
55:47 that this stuff was spreading and they
55:49 didn't tell us and so he's like he's so
55:51 I don't know how much he's a doctor here
55:53 by the communists thing but he mentioned
55:55 his country he mentioned his form of
55:56 government that he has so much pride in
55:59 he says they're failing us they are the
56:01 reason why this is happening so then the
56:04 mutation occurs what does a mutation
56:08 really mean let's talk about what a
56:09 virus is so we can have this
56:11 conversation it's all part of the big
56:13 picture man because dropping a
56:15 potentially death deadly global epidemic
56:18 thing which I don't think it's going to
56:20 go that way is part of their plan so
56:23 this might happen again and I want you
56:24 to have this empirical data so you know
56:26 what you're talking about
56:27 what's a virus versus a bacterial
56:30 infection well bacterias a little
56:32 culture bacteria that grows in a petri
56:34 dish and it grows up in your nose you
56:36 know if you want to keep healthy you got
56:38 to keep your nose dry gonna keep your
56:40 vitamin C up you got to get your ass out
56:42 there and get some vitamin D might not
56:45 be too bad of an idea to take some Zeke
56:47 copper pills the ones that are combined
56:50 and then you dry yourself out and the
56:53 bacteria is nowhere to go nowhere no
56:56 additional bacteria you shouldn't have I
56:58 take a decongestant like claritin-d if
57:01 my nose starts running because it dries
57:04 up my nose passage and I got a big ass
57:06 nose and so then the bacteria can't grow
57:08 and then I put C in my body just to kill
57:10 it in some b-17 as well
57:13 all year round everyday just a little
57:16 bit hundred milligrams would be 17 a
57:17 thousand eight hour time release of
57:20 vitamin C Solera brand or solo solar a
57:24 brand excuse me
57:25 and I specifically get the capsules and
57:28 not the tablets
57:29 I believe in powder versus a heart pill
57:33 having been in the pharmaceutical
57:35 industry for two years working for the
57:38 chief scientists okay
57:40 so mutation is related to how a virus
57:46 works so you've seen the double helix in
57:48 your lifetime right it's a nucleic acid
57:51 chain which has four letters AC T just
57:54 remember act like a movie or a play act
57:57 and then G those year letters well the
58:02 beautiful thing about our double helix
58:04 is that when it breaks it usually
58:06 reforms and because certain nucleic
58:09 acids are only compatible with others it
58:12 tends to just naturally repair itself
58:14 but when it pro creates the double helix
58:19 will split down the center one half of a
58:22 DNA is called an Arnie okay what it's
58:27 trying to do is as it breaks off because
58:28 this ACTG rule of nucleic acids it
58:32 naturally forms the other half of the
58:35 RNA strand so a virus is an RNA strand
58:40 that's foreign and it floats around in
58:43 your blood and as soon as your double
58:45 helix splits the RNA attaches it's got a
58:49 compatibility okay
58:51 well I don't have to tell you that if
58:54 you had a zipper running down the center
58:56 of your clothing and you take it off and
59:00 unzip it you know that the left and
59:02 right are compatible so you zip it back
59:04 up again and it works right well the
59:06 analogy of a virus is that as soon as
59:08 you unzip it I come up like a jerk and I
59:11 put an extra zipper right in the middle
59:13 it's only like three inches tall well
59:17 now you try to zip it back up again and
59:19 you hit this blocker this alien invader
59:22 that's attached itself somewhere on this
59:24 strand of your RNA he'll
59:26 the RNA that kills the DNA that kills
59:32 your cell your chromosome VIN your cell
59:35 and you start to get sick and even if
59:38 your immune system is doing what it's
59:40 supposed to do and kicking everything
59:41 that's worn out it's kind of radiation
59:43 poisoning
59:44 you can have your immune system kicking
59:46 so much out that your body starts to
59:48 fail well as soon as you have an
59:53 infection your body starts to fight it
59:54 off heat is a big thing that fights off
59:58 viruses so you get a fever your body is
60:01 fighting this thing off it tries to heat
60:03 your blood up to kill things I mean
60:04 we're so amazingly designed it's crazy
60:07 well a mutation is typically referred to
60:11 as when we take I'll put it this way if
60:16 you were a billionaire and you're not
60:19 too close to death any virus you have
60:23 can be absolutely cured in your body as
60:26 long as it isn't mutate during the
60:27 curing process but they get to extract
60:30 your blood find the RNA invader and we
60:33 could take a machine and and
60:35 specifically make the other half of the
60:38 invaders RNA inject it back in your
60:41 blood it'll swim around and attach
60:43 itself to all these crazy viruses that
60:46 shouldn't be all these RNA strands that
60:47 shouldn't be there thus killing them
60:49 before they kill you so even if you had
60:53 you know some t-cell creating thing
60:55 right they always talk about this AIDS
60:57 HIV thing again the two have never been
60:59 associated with each other
61:00 AIDS is not a thing it's a
61:02 classification right you died of T cell
61:05 deaths but if you had something like
61:09 that a fatal virus you could make the
61:13 blocker you can okay the problem is is
61:16 if it starts to mutate all the time all
61:18 over the place then you're gonna hat you
61:21 don't have enough time and money to find
61:23 all the variations right but let's say
61:26 you had a ABC configuration there's you
61:28 either have a B or C maybe you have a
61:30 and B well as long as we can make that
61:33 in a machine in bulk and put it in
61:35 animals to just take the crap up and
61:37 then put it in you
61:39 we get you solved it's usually too
61:42 expensive to do it too time-consuming
61:45 but what happened to this according to
61:47 this virologists okay not some Schmo but
61:51 a guy who's in a world expert on this
61:53 might be one of the most senior
61:59 virologists in the world he said that
62:02 the mutation had to do with the
62:03 contagion classification now most the
62:09 time and this is actually the case so
62:11 just rest assured I'm about to tell you
62:13 is sort of a soothing reality but I'll
62:16 tell you the catch okay
62:17 RNA material cannot exist outside of a
62:22 living being for very long I mean it's
62:24 seconds before it dies and it just dries
62:27 up it just loses cohesion it just can't
62:30 live outside the human body now the
62:33 other thing is that a lot of viruses are
62:35 very sparse in the blood supply so you
62:39 could have HIV for instance what's not
62:42 that dense in the blood but you could
62:44 have the flu and it's super dense in
62:46 your blood
62:46 well it's travelling through all of your
62:49 stuff all of your mucus and all the
62:51 stuff you have in your body it's
62:52 everywhere because it can live in your
62:55 mucus okay now when it becomes more
63:02 rugged because of a mutation you can
63:05 sneeze this crap out of your body and
63:07 it's travelling in this little pustules
63:10 of the sneeze if you COFF you tend to
63:13 eject a little bit of material right if
63:16 you're eating from a fork and you pass
63:18 it to a friend or you take a sip from a
63:20 drink and you buddy drinks it the same
63:22 thing and touches your lip mark it's all
63:24 in that saliva right and then you have a
63:27 low but a chance of catching it it
63:31 depends on the density of the virus
63:33 within your blood supply and within your
63:35 body in general so this thing turned
63:38 into an airborne virus meaning the guy
63:45 estimated it as a safe zone is a six
63:48 foot radius around anyone who actually
63:50 has this stuff so they're sneezing in
63:52 there
63:52 coughing and there's a six-foot radius
63:55 of how far you can blast a sneeze
63:57 essentially the wrist is all pulled down
63:59 on the ground right and then it's out of
64:02 your way but you know how that works men
64:04 you're on a plane what are you gonna do
64:06 look at these poor flight attendants the
64:08 buddies will flatten he's kind of
64:10 freaked down he's like Jesus Christ in
64:11 this someone could sneeze the cruise
64:15 ships which have to use just like planes
64:17 these HEPA filters and just like a
64:20 filter on your oil it's dead almost
64:22 instantaneously right so it's mutated
64:27 now they got everyone quarantined 60
64:30 million people quarantine right at 50 to
64:33 60 I got family members that live over
64:36 there at least one and he says like the
64:39 place is just deserted he's in a safe
64:41 zone shinjin believe it or not but by
64:44 them lying
64:45 they caused a huge problem now well then
64:48 it was dropped on them whether they lost
64:50 control of it mmm we may never know the
64:53 34 year old doctor that first reported
64:55 it who's now dead of it was probably
64:57 murdered for embarrassing the state
64:59 because a 34 year old would not die of
65:02 this stuff unless he was at a
65:04 pre-existing condition he was a doctor
65:05 or a nurse or something right the
65:09 quarantine is a problem because people
65:11 don't have any food coming to their
65:13 house how could you possibly bring
65:15 enough food like 12 million people is
65:18 New York and Chicago combined so how do
65:21 you go to every single house and give
65:22 them enough food to live you can't
65:25 they're running out of masks and just
65:29 for those of you in different countries
65:32 like mine where we don't wear masks just
65:34 because we get a cough these doctors and
65:37 nurses put the masks on in the morning
65:39 at their houses and it's sealed really
65:41 tight to their face it's not some painte
65:43 mask right the cloth kind rate so if
65:48 they take it off at the hospital they
65:50 can't put it back on because now they've
65:52 exposed it to the outside world so
65:56 they're not eating doctors and nurses
65:58 are going you know 12 14 hours with this
66:00 incredible overload in their hospitals
66:02 and they can't take their masks off so
66:04 they're becoming
66:06 starved which means your immune systems
66:08 are dying off which means their exposure
66:10 rates and their vulnerability to death
66:12 from the front of the virus itself has
66:15 accelerated so the big picture element
66:18 of that has to do with the fact that we
66:20 gotta brace ourselves for these
66:22 individuals who are losing for now the
66:26 deep state and make sure that they don't
66:29 they never gain a foothold but they have
66:34 complete meathooks
66:35 into Europe and Europe is twice the size
66:38 of the United States they own Australia
66:41 they own New Zealand they own these
66:45 places but China's not helping because
66:47 they're a communistic state that's just
66:49 out of control I mean hopefully this
66:52 whole thing resolves itself they're
66:54 saying it probably will be resolved by
66:56 April there's two ways to resolve the
66:59 issue deal with it and cure everybody
67:01 and fix everybody which is a huge order
67:04 or let everyone die don't let anyone
67:07 leave your country let them all die it's
67:09 too bad really sorry we'll put a plaque
67:11 up in your name and then you've carried
67:15 it through just your elimination the
67:19 biggest thing that America has to do
67:20 with the big picture 2020 and it's
67:23 happening is pulling out of all these
67:25 wars apologizing for a lot of the
67:30 destruction that the bankers caused us
67:33 with Schilly presidents and it's pin
67:35 chilly for a really long time okay make
67:40 sure these people understand who we are
67:42 you know we don't like a lot of
67:45 methodologies around the world Sharia
67:47 law will never be acceptable in the
67:49 modern world anywhere on planet Earth
67:51 now Europe is making a bunch of
67:53 provisions to make sure Sharia law not
67:55 only has a foothold in Europe but it is
67:57 the way as soon as anyone says that that
68:02 they believe in it and I'll give you a
68:04 morbid example which this may have
68:09 already happened or may be on its way by
68:13 Europe endorsing Sharia law which is
68:17 just a
68:17 brutal method of living right it's Allah
68:20 or death that's the first rule second is
68:23 women are castrated so they don't have
68:26 anymore excitement for sex there's just
68:29 literally sex objects I mean like
68:31 literally sex objects okay takes two
68:35 woman's opinion
68:35 to match a man's opinion in court and
68:39 there's all these provisions that you
68:41 can kill your wife all these provisions
68:44 where you can kill her you have to
68:45 accuse her something but if she's dead
68:47 and the only witness is one woman and
68:50 your opinions twice of what hers is
68:52 worth in a Sharia law court you're gonna
68:53 win every single time if you're a dude
68:55 if you're gay you were dead
69:00 that's it you're dead you're
69:02 exterminated
69:03 so all these LGBTQ czar like I mean Arab
69:06 invasions great saying mmm-hmm
69:09 you will cease to exist but imagine a
69:13 guy who say a Christian let's just say
69:16 just for the random choice of religion
69:18 it's not Sharia law bound he doesn't
69:25 like his wife anymore he doesn't like
69:28 his wife anymore so what he does is he
69:31 converts to some form of Islam he starts
69:36 going to mosque it's just this is all
69:38 cover for this dude he starts to preach
69:42 Sharia law in his house he dresses how
69:46 her Sharia law says to dress he hates
69:48 the things that Sharia law says date and
69:50 he makes a big makes a big social media
69:53 splash for this whole conversion he's
69:57 not dumb so he does it for like six
70:00 months maybe a year and then he kills
70:04 his wife he wants to get away with it
70:07 because he wants to go get some strange
70:08 he wants to get something new but he
70:10 kills his wife well as soon as the
70:15 authorities show up pick up her dead
70:17 body and take her to the morgue to bury
70:19 her he just claims Sharia law in one of
70:22 these European countries which allows
70:24 Sharia law courts to exist now he says I
70:27 am a Muslim Islamic
70:30 guy I worship sure
70:32 I follow the code of Shri law and I am
70:34 acting in my religions province to get
70:38 rid of my wife she cheated on me with
70:41 the mailman with a pizza-guy with a
70:43 random stranger which you'll never know
70:45 who that person was because I don't know
70:47 who that person was but I just know she
70:48 did it goes to court but doesn't go to a
70:52 normal court he goes to street la corte
70:53 they swing the gavel your innocent
70:56 go on and live your life he's like yeah
70:59 this is awesome
71:02 maybe he sort of hangs on to shrill on
71:06 the side he doesn't really care so he
71:08 goes off and gets another woman until
71:11 he's bored of her boom it was back in
71:17 the court same [ __ ] this is why you
71:21 can't allow certain things to occur it
71:23 depends on what kind of world you want
71:25 to live in if you want men to absolutely
71:27 run this planet and women will become
71:29 the the gagged they're not allowed to be
71:33 seen in public they have to wear burkas
71:36 little viewports because Sharia
71:38 you can't show anything you you even
71:40 have to wear a veil inside of your eye
71:42 socket slit if you really want to do it
71:45 right all right take your pick Europe
71:49 what world you want to live in for any
71:52 of you in Europe listening to me they
71:53 have children where you plan on having
71:55 some kids okay so your daughter falls in
72:00 love with one of these dudes all right
72:03 does she only spunk does she stand it
72:06 for herself wouldn't you want your
72:09 daughter to be like that a strong woman
72:11 still feminine whatever but strong all
72:15 right now you have to do a little math
72:17 in your brain and go my lineage might
72:19 just stop if she happens to fall in love
72:22 with the guy that kills her if you let
72:25 it fester in Europe and become this
72:28 totally protected thing right Merkel
72:31 commanded all the countries in Europe to
72:34 cover up all the crimes of these
72:35 [ __ ] right okay so now your kid
72:39 chooses to be gay it's a guy you have a
72:42 boy he's gay
72:44 all right well you're all into this
72:47 thing and you're upright it's cool and
72:49 doctor nature kids they can be
72:50 transgender by [ __ ] five have all
72:52 their [ __ ] junk cut off now they're
72:55 gonna be killed walking down the street
72:57 because you like this other faction grow
73:00 in your neighborhood it's not fiction
73:03 I watched again I've said this a couple
73:05 times one evening I caught a video I was
73:09 on a weird website and it was a it was a
73:12 compilation of gays that have been
73:15 murdered by Muslims on video and on
73:18 surveillance cameras at night there's
73:21 one nightclub it was like three people
73:22 they just followed them home I just
73:24 followed them to their cars and killed
73:25 him following the cars and killeth all
73:27 the cars and killed them
73:28 that was like 2013 yay it's technically
73:34 before the invasion occurred big picture
73:39 again we are the engineers of this
73:43 planet we decide what laws are passed so
73:46 we decide how we're gonna behave and so
73:49 all this liberal agenda crap is is like
73:51 I think the analogy I can probably give
73:54 you is your forefathers and your four
73:57 mothers they saw chaos from previous
74:03 generations handed down through probably
74:05 verbal storytelling but that is the
74:09 reason why things got better because
74:11 they saw heretics crazy people running
74:15 the world and they fought they fought
74:17 wars they lobbed heads off of monarchs
74:19 right not enough of course but they then
74:24 they then they like in England you you
74:26 allow the the Queen of England to still
74:28 exist in this powerful powerful position
74:31 with this massive ownership of world
74:32 real estate I'm not saying you hurt
74:35 these people
74:35 necessarily if the commander's crying
74:37 then whatever go through the process but
74:39 it's illegal everywhere in the world to
74:42 press charges against royalty now we do
74:46 that for our president while he's in
74:48 office you can't charge him with a crime
74:49 but the second the dude leaves office
74:51 you can tie him up and do whatever you
74:53 want to do if he committed a crime
74:55 all right now you can impeach him for a
74:59 crime right we have processes to keep
75:03 everything balanced when the well you
75:07 know it's I have to say it's like it's
75:09 sort of this weird thing like I
75:11 personally have heard every horrible
75:13 rumor you could possibly hear about the
75:16 British well family
75:17 I do think you know princess died was
75:19 murdered you know Charles married
75:22 Camilla like in two seconds after her
75:24 death right relatively speaking however
75:27 when this whole thing happened with its
75:31 Harry Wright the youngest son of Charles
75:34 which isn't his kid but whatever and
75:37 he's seceding and he's going off with
75:39 the actress and and they're gonna live a
75:42 life in Canada and you know it's their
75:44 life man
75:45 it's none of my business but then I saw
75:48 some YouTube thing it was played in my
75:51 lounge well they were asking you know
75:54 they're having like talk show things
75:56 about whether our hit Prince Harry is
75:58 just destroying the the royal family and
76:01 all this other crap and these pundits
76:04 come on these people who have dedicated
76:07 their entire life's to following royalty
76:10 as some you know downtown Judy Brown and
76:12 she's cool but people like that but just
76:14 they're following the royalty and it's
76:16 like they're expressing their opinions
76:18 you can tell the about it like an email
76:19 telling them what to say and it's this
76:23 perpetual ass kissing contest on TV as
76:27 if any of this [ __ ] matters in the
76:29 world
76:30 do whatever you want why is it any of
76:32 our business because they're royalty the
76:35 Lady of the lake give one of their
76:37 uncle's a [ __ ] sword is that out all
76:38 work throughout you know it's like this
76:40 divine providence thing has just got to
76:42 disappear on the planet education
76:45 paradigm-shifting I can't one of my
76:49 really good friends in the UK who's
76:52 extremely intelligent he told me goes
76:54 look he is because I said what what is
76:56 this whole thing with the royalty I
76:57 asked him like probably fifteen years
76:58 ago and he goes because well you know I
77:01 hate to say it but it's and I don't mean
77:03 notice all anyone watching this is what
77:06 he said he goes look it's really for
77:09 you're sort of dumb citizens they get
77:13 into all this [ __ ] they buy all the
77:14 plates and all their stuff but he says
77:15 at the general level of IQ in in England
77:19 they don't give a [ __ ] right now having
77:21 said that my take on it is well if you
77:25 got invited to Buckingham Palace to meet
77:28 the Queen you mean to tell me you
77:30 wouldn't feel special right I've thought
77:33 about this myself it's like it'll never
77:35 happen in my lifetime but I think it
77:38 would be biologically impossible for you
77:43 to claim a high IQ and go to Buckingham
77:47 Palace as a guest of the Queen she is a
77:50 real person it's like we don't take crap
77:52 on a human being but this is a family
77:56 that has lived an absolutely bizarre
78:00 history for hundreds of years the
78:04 building is legendary the prot that the
78:07 traditions are legendary how could you
78:10 not at least appreciate on the face
78:12 value of like Jesus look at this place
78:14 man there's a gold-plated [ __ ]
78:16 carriage over there you know it's worth
78:18 more than the whole town of New York you
78:19 know you know it's it's not I think it's
78:24 a little we're a little quick to to
78:28 assume things but again I just think
78:31 just like Downton Abbey where the rich
78:34 people were letting go of all their
78:36 wealth and getting rid of the big house
78:38 and all the staff eventually at the end
78:41 it's what we got to do hey if you got
78:44 money in the bank
78:46 after the redistribution of your wealth
78:48 because you got it because of people
78:50 dying to give you all this stuff it's
78:52 different than me having some stuff in
78:55 my house and the Socialists coming and
78:56 saying you have all that stuff away it's
78:58 like now I personally [ __ ] earn
79:00 everything that's in my home I didn't
79:02 have my neighbours fight a war and then
79:05 give me all their money you know so I
79:06 have a treasure now when they don't have
79:08 [ __ ] right that's the basis of a
79:10 monarchy rate you know some churches in
79:14 Italy the other big one that sort of
79:18 this weird story that broken is part of
79:20 the big picture it's part of agenda 21
79:21 it's part of
79:22 climate change which is Kim trills it
79:27 was part of a queue post where they were
79:30 talking about a guy that was arrested on
79:32 Air Force Base after seeing what he
79:34 described as something he had never seen
79:37 in his life he said the operation was
79:39 like nothing you'd ever seen his life he
79:41 said that these pilots were bragging
79:42 that they had developed a a passenger
79:45 jet plane that could hold 20,000 gallons
79:48 of whatever the hell they wanted which
79:50 is obviously barium and aluminum why
79:54 barium well it might be that when a
79:57 spray happens the barium electrifies the
80:00 region and you hit it with an antenna
80:03 and you distribute it just makes it poof
80:06 out this infrasonic undulation as Judy
80:10 would would say chemtrails are huge
80:13 they're very very real they sprayed
80:15 today in yesterday and they were
80:17 spraying hardcore man just they sprayed
80:21 markers they sprayed all kinds of [ __ ]
80:23 and again Southern California has barely
80:26 any clouds barely any clubs unless it's
80:30 raining we don't have clouds
80:31 nothing it's depressing almost so now
80:35 kids think that planes make [ __ ]
80:37 clouds
80:38 so these climatologist they're reporting
80:41 you know a little anomaly here and there
80:42 well it's like hey if they could get rid
80:45 of all the [ __ ] in the sky
80:46 globally let it settle down for five
80:50 years let the jet stream pop back in
80:52 place and if you can do such a thing
80:55 I mean I would I would almost suggest if
80:58 they screwed up the jet stream which
80:59 looks like it happened up in northern
81:00 Alaska and if it doesn't automatically
81:02 correct we got to spray to correct put
81:06 it back where it usually is because
81:07 they've created this whipping curve
81:09 which puts 34 degrees where it should be
81:13 you know 20 which for you Celsius folks
81:17 it would be above zero needs to be below
81:20 zero but it's a huge deal
81:23 you need to talk to all your family and
81:26 friends first research the crap out of
81:27 it I wrote some really powerful articles
81:30 on one page news calm it's all control
81:32 section there get through the articles
81:34 take the photographs down put them on
81:36 your
81:36 elephone there's a major gallery up
81:38 there which is contributed by everyone
81:40 in the world I track no one's
81:45 information right who you are whatever
81:47 it's it's I'm not tracking it whatsoever
81:49 so they submit a photograph they just
81:51 tell me what time of day and where they
81:53 were and what date and I publish it and
81:58 some people don't realize that it's a
81:59 it's a moderated process so they'll
82:01 sometimes put up multiple photographs if
82:03 you're doing that just understand if you
82:05 submit I got it it's just I get little
82:08 notices here and there and I sometimes
82:09 forget to go moderate it up there but
82:12 anyway there's plenty up there to prove
82:13 the case right but I have you know that
82:16 was the top 12 things that they can't
82:18 even knock typical that they're not
82:23 contrails right you know consequently
82:27 the funny thing is is uh the ridiculous
82:31 theory that an iceberg can melt and make
82:34 the sea level go up is is tent amount to
82:39 filling a glass full of water with ice
82:41 in it and if the ice melts the glass
82:45 overflows all of a sudden you know if
82:47 that's not the way it works right
82:49 so just whatever's above water is what
82:52 melts down and can raise the ocean
82:54 levels right but again for all those
82:56 glacier all those you know slices of is
82:59 you see falling off on one side of the
83:04 Antarctica it's freezing on the other
83:06 side so they never they can't what are
83:07 you gonna film freezing how do you film
83:09 freezing it takes a while okay I mean
83:12 it's boring it's like watching toast
83:15 Brown and a toaster so another scanner
83:20 broke but I mentioned once before and it
83:22 was a guy on Twitter that totally broke
83:24 this thing he must have posted 50
83:26 consecutive tweets us which is weird
83:29 because it's like why I use that forum
83:30 link somewhere else and just tell a
83:32 story one big shot but he proved that
83:35 the United States government under trump
83:36 has figured out that a bunch of
83:38 journalists of taking illegal money to
83:40 launder articles from China into our
83:43 newspapers and a bunch of other places
83:45 bunch from a bunch of other places but
83:47 mostly China
83:48 so China is controlling the narrative of
83:51 our press to an alarming extent it's
83:55 illegal to do so without telling the
83:56 State Department that you've done it but
83:59 you can't take money for it either I
84:01 think is the way it works but it's
84:03 horrific that needs to stop
84:06 so the fake news you know Trump
84:08 constantly saying they're fake news fake
84:09 news it's so massive that he's branding
84:12 them that way and some giant newspaper
84:15 organization just filed for bankruptcy
84:16 today and it was like array now how to
84:20 replace it I don't know you know I used
84:23 to think that the BBC was nuts as an
84:25 organization because I think one of our
84:28 listeners said that you have to pay over
84:30 200 pounds a year in taxes to the BBC
84:35 you know it sounds just crazy at first
84:39 then you think okay remember in that
84:41 other episode I said what if you ran the
84:43 world suddenly and what would you do to
84:47 fix a bunch of problems okay let's say
84:49 you wanted to clean up the press you
84:52 want truthful press constantly and and
84:56 have literally federal laws that say if
84:58 you lie in the press you go down your
85:02 organization gets completely shut down
85:04 think about the approval process on an
85:07 article if that ever came down right
85:10 again in America we've had
85:12 anti-propaganda federal laws passed
85:15 after the game show clue blew it in the
85:19 50s they were giving away the answers to
85:22 this one guy I'm making him a superstar
85:24 and then it broke that he was getting
85:26 the answers and people were so pissed
85:28 that he passed legislation to make that
85:30 illegal but then it got revoked there
85:34 was a rumor it got put back in place but
85:35 obviously they get put back in place
85:36 because liberal news is all super
85:39 SuperDuper concentrated propaganda and
85:42 your conservative ones are moderately
85:45 propaganda at this point in time right
85:48 no one's the hero okay but the BBC for a
85:55 long time was a state-funded
85:56 organization I don't know if every
85:58 single wing of it is funded like that I
86:00 work with my buddy in England
86:02 but several shows and I work with it was
86:07 one entertainment to produce my
86:11 production company and one entertainment
86:13 got together on a project together which
86:16 was super cool to see my logo go up
86:17 there and then their logo go up there
86:20 but if if a news organization has to
86:25 make profit to exist that's where you
86:28 get compromised because if you don't
86:31 have profit coming in because the news
86:33 isn't exciting enough that anyone goes
86:34 and watches your articles then you're
86:37 gonna go out of business so state-funded
86:41 news is a solution it's a theory of a
86:46 solution but because we have the Army
86:48 Corps psyops get paid over a billion
86:51 five every year to exist to inject
86:54 propaganda to us okay and the project
86:58 Mockingbird which was a CIA project
87:01 which is still in full effect right the
87:05 government is untrusted we know that the
87:09 government spin [ __ ] constantly so who
87:12 the [ __ ] you gonna trust that's why when
87:14 Q said you're the news there's probably
87:17 the best statement of his entire
87:19 existence something that you can agree
87:22 to without having to buy all those other
87:24 stuff now hopefully the guy was telling
87:27 the truth about most things and I think
87:29 we are seeing a lot of amazing proofs
87:31 now but again it's one thing to say oh
87:34 arrests are gonna happen and then hey
87:36 anyone gets arrested any one week he's
87:38 like you see that was it that was me you
87:39 know again I'll remind you of the little
87:43 story I've told two or three times kid
87:45 my home town worshiped the devil for a
87:47 very short period I don't even know how
87:49 many months but he he was trying to make
87:54 people fear Him of course and it's
87:58 really strange he's not I don't know
88:00 he's just not the kind of guy that would
88:02 do it but he did and he was reborn
88:04 afterwards so he doesn't do this anymore
88:06 of course it was just some stupid error
88:07 in his life but he used to go around
88:09 saying any bad news that occurred he did
88:12 it
88:12 and that's how he was trying to build
88:14 his portfolio of being this
88:16 all-controlling Satan is string so you
88:21 know the other thing that news does is
88:24 they spin things so that you'll have to
88:27 click into the clickbait and and fox is
88:29 starting to do this a lot now where
88:31 they'll say this state thinks that you
88:34 are a dick you know and you're like what
88:35 what state thinks I'm a dick click it
88:37 you know and it's like they won't tell
88:38 you you know it'll be something
88:41 ridiculous like if you live in this
88:44 county you're gonna be dead by 2:00 p.m.
88:46 you know okay why just tell me because
88:49 you know no more news at 11 crap right
88:51 the little bumper to get you to watch
88:53 the news on TV all that's dead and so
88:56 they're starting to pull those numbers
88:58 on online news so how do we say we're
89:02 the press without having dedicated souls
89:06 to do it and then those dedicated souls
89:08 can be co-opted by anybody who gives
89:11 them money so it is like trust is like
89:16 this really tough algorithm when the
89:19 world has been so introduced to greed
89:24 you know I'll tell you a funny little
89:27 thing that happened in the last three
89:28 days here in my house
89:31 I typically watched a little bit of
89:34 something on TV while I'm consuming food
89:36 which is about a 20 minute thing and I I
89:39 was bopping around YouTube just trying
89:41 to find something interesting and and
89:43 milli vanilli interview came up with fab
89:47 the one that's still alive right and if
89:50 you haven't seen this you interested in
89:51 this story I would totally suggest you
89:53 watch this this fab guy tried to find
89:56 the one two hour and 30 minutes because
89:58 that we don't go through like the five
89:59 different cut ups of the same thing but
90:03 it was a Vlad TV that's the channel VL
90:05 ad TV try to find the one hour 30 minute
90:09 one but anyway he explains he gets
90:10 interviewed about the whole process of
90:12 how they were suckered into this
90:15 lip-syncing thing they didn't they never
90:17 wanted a lip-sync they thought they're
90:19 gonna make albums but they signed this
90:20 half inch contract in German Vlad
90:23 they're fab excuse me didn't speak any
90:25 German at all Rob spoke German but he's
90:27 not a you know legalese guys they just
90:30 signed it
90:30 and they just trusted this Frank guy he
90:32 was the producer and then he tells him
90:36 one day that though four weeks later
90:40 they said okay here's your new song and
90:43 it's this amazing girl you know it's
90:47 true I think that song right
90:49 their first single and all of a sudden
90:50 the first time he played it for them it
90:52 just was the music and they're like oh
90:53 my god so dope on it's gonna be amazing
90:56 then they came back four weeks later and
90:58 the lyrics are on the track and he goes
90:59 well here's the deal you're gonna front
91:01 this thing your English isn't that good
91:03 we want to make you blow up don't you
91:05 like the song and they walked out of the
91:07 studio they argued walked out of the
91:09 studio went back to their hotel then
91:12 they got a phone call come on back we'll
91:14 talk it through figure something out but
91:17 they were fronted about $5,000 Deutsche
91:20 Mark to live in the hotel and whatever
91:24 pay rent and whatever and so the dude
91:27 said okay you don't have to do it but I
91:28 need my money back so the contract says
91:31 are they handing money and so they're
91:34 like [ __ ] he says or you could just do
91:36 this for me we're gonna a couple of
91:39 performances lined up we're gonna make a
91:40 little video at a local TV station and
91:44 then you'll you will be even and so they
91:47 go [ __ ] okay man but do it it blows up
91:51 it utterly blows up in Germany then they
91:55 go in and do a real video they put that
91:57 out bad gets picked up by MTV but then
92:00 they blow up all over Europe and
92:02 eventually hopscotch over to America and
92:05 Clive Davis signs them and they just
92:09 start exploding and so he said well then
92:11 the guy asked him said well you know
92:13 what what kept you on board for the
92:16 second and third and fourth single
92:18 apparently they they made one album and
92:21 four singles the album's love 14 million
92:24 copies and the singles sold 33 million
92:27 units major cash and the fab dude who's
92:33 one of the sweetest souls man he has a
92:36 very deep mind let me tell you if you
92:38 watch it all the way to the very end the
92:40 way he talks in the last five minutes
92:41 you guys are gonna see deep thoughts
92:42 come out of this guy it's real
92:44 cool he said you know what he said we
92:48 got the taste kinda guys it's just
92:52 waiting for him to kind of elaborate
92:53 writing it and he says we got the taste
92:55 of this amazing life we traveled the
92:59 world he goes we stayed in the finest
93:01 hotels he goes anything we wanted we
93:05 just had to ask for it and we got it
93:07 he said we hit we could throw a party we
93:10 look in the hotel fridge and it was
93:11 empty and so he make one phone call and
93:13 it's full
93:15 he said mayor's wanted to meet us shake
93:18 our hands everyone loved us and because
93:20 both well Rob the guy that's gone he you
93:24 know had a really rough life he was
93:25 adopted and there was a hole in his life
93:27 because of that adoption it's what fab
93:31 said and he said look the the love that
93:33 Rob got filled that void in his soul
93:36 that he was adopted he never met his his
93:40 biological parents ever and so when it
93:45 all crashed Rob lost that thing that was
93:49 filling that void in his life and so he
93:52 both of them were super addicted to
93:54 drugs and alcohol at the time that this
93:56 this crash happened they'd won three
93:58 American Music Awards and two Grammys
94:00 men so anytime a Grammys been rescinded
94:03 and he said that fab was smart and this
94:09 kind of relates to journalism which is
94:10 why I'm mentioning this whole thing but
94:12 he said as soon as it crashed he goes I
94:15 pulled out of all the drugs and alcohol
94:17 because he realized there's no way for
94:19 me to deal with this depression and
94:20 rebuilding my life and focusing while
94:23 I'm on all these drugs and so he begged
94:26 Rob to get off and Rob couldn't cuz Rob
94:28 was so devastated and so eventually like
94:31 five-year four years later he od'd at
94:36 this location one day before he was
94:38 supposed to fly to I believe India to go
94:40 to this beautiful resort to become detox
94:43 so they could rebuild their life and the
94:45 fab dude had just made their first song
94:47 and he sang the whole thing so the
94:50 rapper dude sing the single it's very
94:53 Milli Vanilli so I don't know if it was
94:55 still
94:57 popular at the time that genre me I
94:59 can't remember but they sign with a
95:01 record company they had no money who
95:03 thought they were going to get money
95:04 from a distributor to get distributed so
95:07 they couldn't pay for any promotion or
95:09 record manufacturing so the single came
95:12 out they made a video circulated that
95:15 got on Arsenio Hall performed it live it
95:19 sounded great I mean it was like you
95:20 know it was like Michael Jackson but it
95:23 was sounded like Milli Vanilli so and
95:25 then the Robbie I didn't perform in the
95:27 song at all he goes he didn't perform
95:28 the song because he was too high he's in
95:31 the video but he just didn't there's no
95:33 vocal from him at all nothing you just
95:35 danced so the tasting is what I why
95:41 mention that because once you have these
95:45 Mockingbird people the people that
95:47 signed up to lie to us in the news they
95:49 got the taste of the money Nancy Pelosi
95:53 got the taste of cheating you know she's
95:56 worth 200 million bucks but she's
95:58 letting her in eight because her and her
96:00 husband get involved with IPOs they
96:02 block legislation to help companies and
96:04 they get stocks they bought a visa IPO
96:07 at $14 and then within a week they were
96:10 able to sell it at 65 bucks all the
96:14 while blocking legislation that was
96:16 going to regulate visa in a way that was
96:18 gonna you know encumber their ability to
96:20 make profit okay you know Schiff and
96:26 those kind of folks well you're a
96:28 pedophile and you don't want to get
96:31 caught so they get you Podesta they got
96:34 you Joe Biden he should be in jail for
96:39 the stuff we've got on video from c-span
96:42 he has touched kids but you know again
96:46 the statute of limitations on pedophilia
96:48 is for years because pedophiles wrote it
96:52 right nuts you can get fingered for a
96:57 murder forty years in the past and go to
96:59 jail today
97:00 happens all the time happens all the
97:02 time such a kid
97:05 screw up their entire life kill them
97:06 whatever I guess if you kill them you
97:08 get into the murder side of it but you
97:09 can just screw up the kid's life rape
97:12 them whatever for years you better go to
97:14 file
97:15 you know 4-year old you better file with
97:17 an attorney in four years there's no
97:20 legal representation for kids so the
97:25 other thing is that during Trump's
97:26 administration we've had this massive
97:30 arrest level of human traffickers which
97:33 is another way of saying pedophiles sex
97:36 traffickers pedophiles going to jail at
97:40 record numbers and you know like
97:43 institutions you know lieutenant Walt
97:47 Disney executives have gone to jail for
97:49 pedophilia amazing right amazing so
97:57 again when you employ fifty thousand a
98:00 hundred thousand people shits gonna
98:02 happen I mean it's gonna happen we got
98:04 you know I always mentioned the that
98:07 show hoarders on TV where they go into
98:10 people's homes and clean them up and
98:11 they're just disgusting I mean just
98:13 beyond disgusting rate okay well you
98:17 they ask these people what they do and
98:18 they'll be nurses at hospitals they're
98:22 living in feces infested homes but dead
98:26 dead animals all kinds of stuff and
98:30 they're going into your hospital and and
98:32 touching your relatives which is why
98:33 your relatives die of staph infections
98:35 and hospitals [ __ ] happens right mental
98:40 illness is on the rise in this world
98:43 there was I just saw an article today it
98:46 was part of the pursuit of truth video
98:50 which I guess we February 13th video he
98:55 put out today we talked about a doctor
98:58 that committed suicide recently a
98:59 homeopathic doctor that shot himself in
99:01 the head because he felt so guilty for
99:03 falsifying vaccinations for parents that
99:06 didn't want their kids to be vaccinated
99:08 and he wrote this big apology letter
99:10 about how he felt so bad about not
99:12 vaccinating kids didn't say anything to
99:15 his wife and kids in this suicide letter
99:17 it was written by whoever
99:19 someone shot him in the head they just
99:22 blamed it on him so there's a
99:24 pharmaceutical hit squad out there
99:26 killing all these doctors that are
99:29 trying to say look man you don't need it
99:32 and if somebody wants to give it to
99:33 their kids and fine do it then you're
99:36 perfectly immune from everything where
99:37 you don't need to worry about anyone
99:38 else's kid we're up to 76 doctors I
99:43 think or something like that before this
99:45 dude took him took his own life
99:46 families being massacred and then find
99:49 him and I mean this is more of it where
99:50 I'm about to say it was this is the
99:51 truth like one of the families was cut
99:53 up into pieces and they found him in the
99:54 trunk of a car and we're all just like
99:58 whatever man there seems to be a
100:01 moratorium right now on school shootings
100:03 and and these big massacres in the
100:06 United States of Americans but in a
100:08 little while since this occurred which I
100:10 believe was last August the El Paso
100:13 shooting thing now as always somebody
100:15 pissed off goes to work kills people
100:18 sometimes it's a school but these
100:21 classic you know crisis actor situations
100:25 I made a video where I said look you
100:28 know why don't why doesn't the FBI in
100:31 the Trump administration find these kids
100:34 that constantly show up at all these
100:36 events and just survey them and a second
100:40 that they plan something arrest them
100:42 send them to Gitmo you don't have to
100:45 tell anybody just do it and then all
100:47 these things will dry up so let's hope
100:49 that something like that has occurred
100:51 that logical connection point has
100:53 occurred but here's the thing for the
100:55 big picture 2020 this year will be like
100:59 any unlike any year in American history
101:04 we have a president that is not a deep
101:07 state asset if you think he is
101:09 you lack research I don't mean to offend
101:12 you if you believe otherwise but you're
101:15 probably knee jerking your instincts and
101:19 your disgust for these [ __ ] who are
101:21 deep Staters and you lump Trump in and
101:24 you haven't done your research okay he
101:27 has been missing from all of their
101:29 gatherings he has never been Dean either
101:31 gatherings
101:32 again the the one thing I hear thrown at
101:34 me every once in a while is Trump's
101:35 association with Jeffrey Epstein when he
101:39 found out what Jeffrey was doing he
101:41 commissioned an interview and then said
101:44 in the interview that Jeffrey Epstein
101:45 likes him young and that he was using
101:47 his daughter to attract all east girls
101:49 to these parties he said look there it
101:53 is
101:53 any banned him from our logo for life so
101:57 that's what Trump did with Epstein he
101:59 [ __ ] said I don't mess with kids I
102:02 date supermodels no what the [ __ ]
102:05 wrong with you right then remember
102:08 Epstein's whole thing was to blackmail
102:09 people so had Trump gotten into that mix
102:14 Epstein would have had him by the balls
102:17 the AG bar walking around telling you
102:20 that Epstein killed himself you know
102:23 again lying your way into truth never
102:25 works right it doesn't work and so I
102:29 think he says that because it was his
102:31 responsibility to protect Epstein and he
102:34 utterly and completely failed the only
102:38 the only other scenario which is
102:40 extremely cynical for me to suggest and
102:42 I don't necessarily believe this
102:44 personally would be that they realized
102:48 he was never gonna talk they had
102:51 everything that he could possibly tell
102:53 them whether or not it's legal to put it
102:55 in the court of law or not doesn't
102:56 matter for them so they let him get
103:00 killed he was murdered right but 2020
103:08 you know it's February now and so before
103:13 the election in November I think we will
103:18 see and I hope this doesn't happen trust
103:22 me but the Secret Service is on it I
103:25 hope that as the year progresses they
103:28 start to nut up and go [ __ ] visit
103:30 these celebrities and people that
103:32 constantly incubate physical harm
103:36 against the president United States
103:38 right so dinero by talking about
103:41 punching the president of face
103:43 okay well that probably wouldn't kill
103:46 him but someone else will hear that go
103:49 for broke some [ __ ] just drove his
103:52 truck through a Republican recruitment
103:55 setup in some parking lot and he said
103:59 you know is his testimony was a you know
104:02 I just had enough and someone has to
104:04 take some action against these people so
104:06 the kid bought all the left left his
104:08 kool-aid I know he's gonna be in jail
104:10 thinking all about it right but someone
104:15 is going to try and most likely
104:17 assassinate the president of United
104:19 States Donald J Trump they're gonna try
104:22 as he gets more confident running around
104:26 to all these stomps and running around
104:27 at different countries and showing up
104:29 he's gonna go to India hear whether
104:32 they've had a lot of people run up and
104:34 shoot people in the head you know that
104:36 poor woman they got killed it was
104:39 probably gonna be their president that's
104:43 one part of it the if they don't
104:47 literally get rid of the super PAC out
104:49 of the house this democratic crazy
104:52 Pelosi Schumer Nadler shift PAC you're
104:57 gonna see more and more wasting of
105:00 American dollars that could be gifted to
105:03 students looking for relief for college
105:06 loans remember they've blown 150 million
105:10 between their Moeller and impeachment
105:14 stuff all right well it's every million
105:18 pays for ten college degrees great
105:24 that's gonna be a roller coaster
105:28 agenda21 is something that we need to
105:31 work as a community to understand if I
105:36 literally had all of you here that were
105:38 interested in doing this and getting
105:40 educated we would literally have to say
105:43 okay who wants to look at the
105:46 infiltration of politicians at the state
105:48 level for agenda 21 okay you guys went
105:51 off and do that who wants to do the
105:52 federal level you guys went off to do
105:54 that land control you
105:57 that business regulations you do that
106:00 you need to look into the EPA the FDA
106:02 and the CDC see who's being pushed in
106:05 from these we have to go up in all
106:06 directions so one of us needs to look at
106:09 how the books are being written for
106:10 students all these agendas coming in
106:14 from Europe from these loyalists who
106:19 think they're on the list and they're
106:21 not on the list okay you're gonna have
106:24 devious people who've got the taste
106:27 they've tasted the finer side of life
106:29 because these folks have been gifted
106:31 like Pelosi you're laundering guns
106:34 through North Korea with the CIA she
106:35 admits it on the week that Barbara Bush
106:38 died you know on TV on c-span awesome
106:41 best link you ever gave us right she
106:45 admits it unbelievable but if they don't
106:49 get cleared out expect another
106:51 impeachment a bunch of [ __ ] and it's
106:54 going to consume your life because what
106:58 they should be doing is legislators is
107:00 legislating laws and improvements
107:04 budgets to improve our roads our
107:07 airports I mean just everything building
107:10 up infrastructure helping to open
107:12 factories or whatever the government can
107:14 do to help give tax breaks to these
107:16 organizations coming back into the
107:18 country after NAFTA is finally had its
107:21 you know pissed ticket out of it right
107:23 but there you know for me the
107:26 coronavirus thing it's it's it's a taste
107:31 of the the most evil thing that they
107:36 would ever do which is to release
107:39 something like that it's got a backstory
107:42 that makes sense right so the backstory
107:45 cover story without these bsl-4 labs
107:48 moving the coronavirus around and maybe
107:50 losing it somehow or some dick just
107:53 drops it right my buddy who's Taiwanese
107:58 you said look I think that they dropped
107:59 it and so but they do it you know in the
108:06 wet market area they do during New
108:08 Year's this is just a just a festering
108:10 spot to open
108:11 and if China doesn't crack down on these
108:14 wet markets for real Wuhan needs to be
108:17 wet market free China has the wet market
108:19 free every single town across the entire
108:22 country it has to be like a penalty of
108:24 death if you open a wet market because
108:27 of this virus because it will continue
108:29 to be the place where viruses grow and
108:32 mutate right why don't they why don't
108:34 they want you to take antibiotics now
108:36 because most antibiotics you take pass
108:40 through your body and they go into the
108:42 sewer system well then it kills all the
108:44 bacteria in the sewer system except the
108:46 one that mutated that can get around
108:48 cipro or z-pak or whatever right if you
108:52 take vitamin C you probably would never
108:54 need another antibiotic in your life I
108:56 used to get any box twice a year I
108:59 haven't had antibiotics since I started
109:00 taking C every day and if I get sick I
109:04 never take it because they just use C
109:06 and B 17 and it might clear to D to get
109:09 rid of it whatever I have always get
109:11 bacterial infections so I get for a bit
109:13 of nose but the climate change thing you
109:18 know I just want to remind you of
109:19 analogy always give you that you need to
109:21 mention to other folks I think I just
109:23 said this in my Liars episode which has
109:25 an air yet but it has to do with if this
109:32 was truly the grete thumb burg world the
109:35 AOC world where the [ __ ] place is
109:37 going to end in eight years right I mean
109:39 may OC just keep subtracting numbers
109:41 right but if this is a true planet
109:45 killing problem then again America at
109:50 least America would do this but most
109:52 likely you would gather up all the
109:55 slaves over there the Britain we get on
109:57 board and we make a phone call to China
110:00 and make a phone call to India and we
110:02 say we're sending you over an email
110:03 that's got a list of all your factories
110:05 that need to be shut down for a retrofit
110:07 in addition PDFs of how to do that to
110:11 all the invention technology that you
110:12 need to do it is being given to you
110:14 public domain you know what to pay
110:16 anything to do it if you don't have the
110:18 engineers to read this [ __ ] and get it
110:20 done right away we got the folks and you
110:23 just pay him you got plenty of money to
110:24 pay him
110:25 german engineers american engineers will
110:27 go there make all your stacks clean
110:29 Beijing and Shanghai will be clear as
110:33 glass no problems but if you don't a
110:39 maybe even six months to year but if you
110:43 don't it's gonna happen at some point at
110:47 our choosing
110:48 after the deadlines passed and you
110:50 haven't met those requirements your
110:53 shit's going away not your people will
110:57 tell you get everyone out of those
110:59 factories cuz they're gonna be level to
111:01 the [ __ ] ground and this goes for
111:05 toxic spilling into the ocean
111:07 this goes for drag netting the the ocean
111:09 floor China is destroying the Pacific
111:12 Ocean floor put out these giant Nets and
111:15 just screams we're going on for two
111:16 decades they scraped the floor killing
111:19 all of the coral all of the natural sea
111:22 life down there and they don't give a
111:23 [ __ ] right well that's definitely
111:26 something that's affecting us today
111:27 because eventually when you kill the
111:29 bottom of the ocean you kill a bunch of
111:31 fish up above and so if you like to eat
111:34 fish mmm you know it could be an issue
111:39 but if they dumped a bunch of stuff in
111:40 the sea
111:41 remember a bluefin tuna migrates the
111:44 entire Pacific Rim tuna is pretty
111:48 popular the United States isn't it so
111:50 feed blue fish tuna from the Pacific
111:53 you're eating tons of mercury strontium
111:58 all this stuff Japan threw out into the
112:00 ocean because they eat the upper
112:03 crustaceans eat it on the ground it goes
112:05 up to the food chain and the tuna eats
112:08 that so if you get yellowfin tuna its
112:11 migratory only up against Mexico and
112:13 California it's not that our water is
112:16 perfect but it's a shitload better than
112:17 the toxic crap being dumped out of the
112:19 Asian communities over there you know
112:22 Japan because of their nuclear problem
112:25 as a contingency they're dealing with
112:27 they're not just doing it all the time
112:29 but remember the the movie The Cove if
112:32 you ever see the dolphin killing movie
112:34 The Cove
112:34 they on video went over and checked the
112:39 health of shark and dolphin meat just
112:43 right out of the market and the dudes
112:44 doing the mercury test in the freaking
112:47 hotel he's like this stuff's off the
112:49 chart man it's completely several orders
112:53 of magnitude over the lethal limit of
112:56 this stuff of the human body
112:57 many people are eating it mercury in the
113:02 brain say lovey men so it's most
113:06 important for you in my opinion is to
113:11 start having these conversations man and
113:15 maybe now social media you know whatever
113:17 yeah I know if you want to turn your
113:19 world into hey I'm I'm always talking
113:21 about dark stuff if you have that kind
113:24 of channel already with people not maybe
113:26 a YouTube channel but a channel of
113:27 communication with folks and they rely
113:29 on you for this information go balls-out
113:32 man but with your family and friends
113:36 gently start these conversations and I
113:39 think the very first thing for everyone
113:40 is to research agenda 21 used rows of
113:44 Corey she is fantastic
113:46 just look up Rosa agenda21 you know find
113:48 her she has big white hair or gray hair
113:52 she's massively articulate super duper
113:55 educated and she's an attorney so he
113:59 approaches it with proof
114:01 not with conjecture conjecture or
114:04 made-up stuff insinuation Zoar
114:06 inferences she's got the proof and it's
114:09 it's disturbing you'll see videos from
114:12 2012 that will just boil your blood and
114:15 then you realize this 20/20 and they
114:17 have had eight years of what she's
114:19 spewing in 2012 it's horrific men so get
114:26 educated on antenna 21 then start asking
114:29 people if they know what it is if you're
114:32 in America and people's are in Canada or
114:34 somewhere if anyone says to you it's a
114:35 conspiracy theory say no it's not the EU
114:38 meets on it every
114:39 a year it's an agenda go look up
114:43 Gorbachev's interview on what ABC in
114:45 1983 where he talked about it and he
114:47 said it's a population control except
114:50 its global it's a population control
114:52 mechanism as global I think you feel me
114:57 this episode is kind of all over the
114:59 place but I think it's it's all
115:02 extremely relevant and very very
115:03 important
115:04 just remember let's say you're close to
115:08 30 years old you will potentially have
115:12 easily another 50 years of life 50 years
115:17 if you don't put your you know your
115:21 voice in the game then you're gonna live
115:25 some of this crap I'm talking about
115:27 right there's a lot of weird paperwork
115:30 out there and I don't try to I I'm not
115:32 one to really spread this kind of crap
115:34 because it's I don't know if it's fully
115:37 substantiated but you know 2025 is a big
115:41 deadline for there depopulation
115:43 movements there's been some chatter and
115:47 some paperwork that's been moved around
115:48 where that's their deadline for the
115:51 depopulation so coronavirus that goes
115:53 full-blown epidemic pandemic and kills
115:58 off the planet to prepare it for the
116:01 movement of individuals into these
116:03 concentration camp cities where you'll
116:06 never live another free day of until you
116:08 [ __ ] pull a magic wand out of your
116:10 ass I mean at that point it would have
116:13 to be like a cataclysmic meteor that hit
116:15 certh that you know upsets the apple
116:19 cart so you could regain control of the
116:21 planet but you know I wouldn't want to
116:24 wait that long but yet hip to it you
116:27 know I'm hearing the Georgia Guidestones
116:28 mentioned all the time and and stuff I'm
116:31 watching for people that have done just
116:33 there's people out there dedicated their
116:35 entire life stooge into 21 and they're
116:37 mentioning the Georgia Guidestones is
116:39 like a you know a predictive programming
116:42 situation that first amendment of their
116:45 constitution which is to kill ninety six
116:47 point four percent of the world
116:49 and I just want to put a little note
116:51 here you know the the subject of
116:56 integrity and legitimacy on these kind
117:00 of free-flowing channels where you don't
117:01 know me you know Canada if you watch
117:04 every episode believe me you know me but
117:08 the one thing I can't personally
117:10 associate with our people that minimize
117:14 these massive agendas so you won't get
117:19 banned from the channel you won't get
117:21 banned from any of the social media I
117:23 won't ban you but I will absolutely
117:25 block your ass so that you will never be
117:28 able to communicate with me again
117:29 because I cannot be associating with
117:31 people that are advancing the agenda by
117:35 being dumb [ __ ] okay so you can
117:38 disagree with me on the moon missions
117:40 you can disagree with me on Jo keys a
117:41 session agent you disagree with me on
117:43 everything but a disagreement is
117:46 different than then being a shill
117:49 whether you're stupid and being a shield
117:51 or whether you're just a [ __ ] chill
117:53 getting into my channel and starting to
117:56 like poopoo [ __ ] that's on paper that's
118:00 happening it's [ __ ] up the world
118:03 I can't associate with you all right
118:05 I've had a guy do this recently I've had
118:09 him [ __ ] totally block him off he
118:11 will never be allowed back in until he
118:13 makes his case of why he was wrong not I
118:18 got my opinion man heating stuff that up
118:20 your ass dude you [ __ ] minimize
118:22 agenda21 you minimize the gore Georgia
118:25 Guidestones you're out forever man
118:27 I cannot be [ __ ] associated with
118:29 people like that so that's my little
118:32 dissertation on how I keep myself for
118:35 being shield to then infect you with
118:38 their crap so it's a very active process
118:41 I've never had to do it in the past but
118:44 I've started to see this crap it's like
118:46 you know if there was a lot of posts or
118:49 something where this person is really
118:50 lobbying to support the globalist and
118:53 support all this stuff I will totally
118:55 remove them from everything
118:57 so far so good anyway
