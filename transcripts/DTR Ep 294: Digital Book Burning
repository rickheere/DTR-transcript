00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:35 deep thoughts this is a result of a post
00:39 that someone made that recommended I see
00:42 Fahrenheit 451 very helpful because it
00:47 brought out something that I have been
00:48 thinking about for quite some time and
00:50 talking to friends about it has to do
00:53 with book burning if I told you hey you
00:57 know they're gonna burn books again you
00:59 just wait I say it's statement to you
01:02 you should automatically oh no they're
01:06 not what the [ __ ] you talking about
01:08 because in your brain you're thinking
01:10 well one society would be repulsed at
01:15 such a notion but to how many books are
01:18 there anymore
01:19 I did not get raised with an education
01:23 that forced me to read these classic
01:27 books virtually all of the classic books
01:31 I met to read oh sure I got the cliff
01:36 notes and all that good stuff but I have
01:38 not read Moby Dick Huckleberry Finn
01:44 Fahrenheit 451 I told you I couldn't
01:46 recut you in the Rye I tried - there was
01:51 no one paired - by the time I got the
01:52 school to read that kind of content I
01:54 went to college several times off and on
01:57 yet I wasn't taking any necessarily
02:00 literary courses that's probably where I
02:02 would have been forced to push through
02:03 some of these volumes and now my life
02:06 has such a velocity that
02:11 pausing to read anything fictional is it
02:17 just makes me feel like I'm I'm losing
02:21 out on something I would write that's
02:23 brand-new and fictional sort of naive in
02:27 a way but you got to go with your gut
02:30 right and my gut always says no no no
02:32 that's asked for people who read you're
02:36 a person who writes let us help you
02:39 write something new book burning if I
02:47 tell you like I started out with let's
02:49 you know let's do some predictions on
02:52 book burning and stuff we'd all come out
02:53 with probably zero right and yet I think
02:58 it's happening in an organic way right
03:02 in front of our face and we're not
03:04 paying attention and I have to say it's
03:08 one of these things that if the world
03:09 was run by good people it probably
03:13 wouldn't be happening but maybe it would
03:17 maybe it would organically occur when
03:19 I'm about to assert here it's very very
03:22 simple bookstores are going out of
03:25 business around the world the biggest
03:28 bookstore chains are struggling to keep
03:30 the doors open right where are all the
03:33 books going in school nowadays the
03:36 schools are rushing into these iPads
03:40 tablets telephones mostly tablets bigger
03:46 file format right a bigger screen for me
03:48 I should say if all kinds of really cool
03:51 reading tablets they look like paper and
03:54 that is getting rid of publishing books
03:56 and there may be nothing wrong
03:59 whatsoever with migrating out of cutting
04:01 down trees and turning them into pulp
04:03 and then making books out of them making
04:07 it all electronic there may not be
04:09 anything wrong with that technically
04:10 just like socialism if it could be ever
04:13 realized without oligarch oligarchs
04:17 above us you know being there's these
04:19 rich elite to control the socialism
04:22 experiment always putting in the
04:25 amount of material wealth into a
04:28 socialistic environment to make them
04:32 pacify right and to understand that
04:36 comment just before we get in this
04:38 because we're setting the scene in the
04:39 mind here why can't we go all electronic
04:43 without a problem
04:44 how many of you guys have bought a
04:47 product your whole life whatever that
04:50 might be a candy bar a computer piece of
04:54 equipment a blender a vacuum cleaner or
04:56 whatever and when you were a kid you
04:58 remembered that the product was made out
05:00 of really high-quality metal and plastic
05:02 and glass or whatever and now it's the
05:05 cheapest [ __ ] thing they could
05:08 possibly make right I was having a funny
05:12 conversation with my buddy at the smoke
05:14 lounge few hours ago and you know when
05:18 you mass-produced a product you want to
05:20 technically reduce all of its components
05:22 to make it as easy to make but also it's
05:24 affordable to make and we're talking
05:27 about routers you just asking me he has
05:29 a bunch of old routers you asked me if I
05:30 wanted them and I said yeah that's all
05:32 right
05:32 and then this kicked off this
05:33 conversation where because we both
05:36 finished Fahrenheit 451 and I said you
05:41 know isn't it funny that when you called
05:43 the phone company and you're reporting a
05:44 problem with your router one of the
05:47 first things they want you to do is to
05:49 turn it off for like eight to ten
05:50 seconds and then turn it back on but
05:54 they don't put an on switch on the
05:56 router even though that is the first
05:59 thing they want you to do is turn it off
06:03 and turn it on so you're pulling the
06:05 plug out of the back of a router holding
06:07 it in your hand and then you know if
06:10 it's dark or you know you've done what
06:13 most of us do you try to hide the power
06:15 lines behind your TV behind your
06:17 entertainment center wherever the hell
06:18 you keep your modem sometimes you might
06:20 drop it it goes way back behind a
06:22 counter you're like son of a [ __ ] and
06:24 then these things have like a around and
06:27 a like they have to two points of
06:29 contact ones round ones square so you
06:32 have to line that it's just ridiculous a
06:35 little tiny switch would put them out
06:39 maybe without a joke five to ten cents a
06:43 machine but they won't do it and that's
06:47 how corporations do it they put the
06:51 least amount of effort in to sell you a
06:53 product that's what governments do they
06:56 put the least amount of money in to make
06:59 the people happy the rest of the money
07:01 goes to their private foundations / you
07:06 know pork spending products that you
07:10 know their buddies who build bridges
07:12 give them a kickback on the side buy
07:13 them a house buy them about whatever
07:15 it's a gift it's or whatever printed
07:18 material is becoming unpopular
07:22 electronic material is becoming the way
07:25 to ingest material and I've said this a
07:28 couple times on the show I'm gonna say
07:31 it one more time because we're here
07:33 there's a group of gifted kids in Los
07:35 Angeles who have figured out that when
07:37 you read from an iPad or a tablet from a
07:40 strain that is flickering at 60 frames a
07:42 second your brain does not remember the
07:45 material that much but when you read it
07:50 from a book it's like a movie it becomes
07:53 a part of your life and you can't forget
07:56 it and so these kids are refusing to
08:00 read anything off tablets isn't it
08:05 interesting how the kids are the ones
08:07 that are going I don't think so in
08:12 America there's a book store car called
08:14 Barnes & Noble it is one of our popular
08:18 remaining book store chains all the rest
08:23 of you out of business that I know of
08:25 I don't even know of another one we said
08:28 be Dalton they're gone
08:29 you step borders they're gone so you
08:32 have private bookstores and Barnes &
08:33 Noble as far as I know and Barnes is
08:36 really struggling to stay in business
08:38 now if you're fond of books like I am I
08:41 will go in and buy a book on philosophy
08:43 a book on coding a book on science
08:46 something something to learn something
08:48 right unfortunately these publishers
08:51 have been
08:52 treated for you know at least a century
08:54 and so what you get and some of these
08:57 categories are you know just as bad as
09:00 not reading it probably you're better
09:02 off not reading some of this stuff but
09:04 there are certain things that are
09:05 mathematical that you could learn you
09:06 buy a book on chemistry well chemistry's
09:09 chemistry man if it didn't work it
09:11 wouldn't work and therefore the
09:13 knowledge would be worthless
09:14 buy a book on calculus right let's fast
09:17 forward ten years
09:18 it's twenty one eighteen or twenty eight
09:22 twenty twenty eight excuse me my math
09:25 tonight it's not that good but let's
09:28 just say barnes and noble completely
09:29 tanks no one comes to the rescue can you
09:34 still buy books oh probably from old
09:37 bookstores you can still buy books
09:39 online but what happens when you go
09:43 online to buy a book they recommend you
09:47 use a Kindle if you're on Amazon they
09:50 recommend use an iPad if you're on other
09:53 services like Apple stuff right I could
09:57 definitely tell you that electronic
09:58 books made me really really excited when
10:01 I first heard about them as an option
10:03 and then having purchased I don't know
10:07 20 of them from my career it you know
10:11 the best the best I've ever had is a
10:13 book and a PDF being able to scroll it
10:16 in a big on a big wide screen that has
10:20 been the best I've ever liked it but I
10:22 don't buy books on tape anymore or books
10:25 in electronic form anymore I haven't I
10:28 haven't gone into Barnes & Noble but
10:30 this used to go to Barnes Noble probably
10:32 two to three times a week for a really
10:36 long time and then the other stories
10:37 before they closed and I probably
10:40 haven't walked into a Barnes & Noble in
10:42 four or five years it's hard for me to
10:46 even conceive that in the movie
10:48 rollerball 1975 which again the reason
10:52 why I keep repeating certain things is
10:55 that it's real important and it's going
10:57 to tremendous amount of information and
10:59 not just one little lesson but one of
11:02 the things that happened in that film
11:03 was that the main character
11:05 was being forced out of his job as a
11:08 roller baller
11:08 a sports thing go see my episode on
11:11 rollerball 1975 if you want to hear all
11:14 about it but at one point he wants to
11:17 know who makes decisions in the world
11:19 who would ever decide that a guy in the
11:21 prime of his life he was the most
11:23 popular roller baller in the world
11:25 should stop and the way the script word
11:29 it was who makes executive decisions
11:31 because in the rollerball world the
11:34 corporations have saved us from all this
11:37 nationalism there's been a scandal in
11:42 May of 2018 right at the very end of May
11:45 of 2018 where a corporation censured an
11:49 actress and I have no opinion about that
11:55 personally it doesn't make any sense to
11:56 me at all what was going on in that
11:58 situation I don't follow either side of
12:01 the equation but I watched a very famous
12:03 actor I admire his acting skills he
12:07 posted in his Twitter and he said I'm so
12:10 glad that these corporations are taking
12:12 a stand to defend the people and I was
12:15 like oh really well that's interesting
12:18 you should go watch rollerball my
12:20 brother because you're retreating into
12:23 the bosom of a corporation scary scary
12:29 scary scary so the main character that
12:32 film he reserves some books on executive
12:34 management decision-making whatever he
12:36 goes to what's called a library he shows
12:38 up and this woman says well the those
12:43 books are no longer available you're
12:46 more than welcome to read the corporate
12:49 excerpts and summations of what the book
12:52 was about sort of the footnotes about
12:53 the book but you can't have the book and
12:55 so he stands there and he goes so you're
12:58 really not a library no and you're
13:02 really not a librarian uh-uh
13:04 sorry and so he leaves and he's like
13:07 holy [ __ ] I can't figure out how the
13:09 world works anymore because it's all
13:10 digital and I don't have access to it
13:12 and the corporation that is the part of
13:14 the world that he lives in the Houston
13:16 corporation has censored all the
13:18 material
13:19 so he takes it into his own accord and
13:23 he flies to Geneva I believe is where he
13:25 is and he lands in Geneva and he goes to
13:27 this big computer data center where
13:30 there's a big computer and where he's
13:34 gonna ask the question of who makes
13:36 executive decisions which isn't really
13:39 important to our story he meets this old
13:41 British gentleman and he's a kind of a
13:45 Fame he's sorry he's a big fan of
13:47 rollerball and so he knows Jonathan
13:49 he played by James Caan is the [ __ ] and
13:53 so he's willing to do anything for him
13:57 but on their journey from the office
13:59 that they met in to the computer they're
14:02 walking and they're talking and the old
14:06 man tells them that they somehow I think
14:09 it's they lost the 12th century that day
14:11 and he says what do you mean you lost
14:14 the 12th century it's as though it'll
14:17 probably turn up with someone misplaced
14:19 the hard drives or the drives are the
14:21 tapes or whatever it's 1975 right and in
14:28 that little moment you realize that when
14:30 everything goes electronic an entire
14:33 century can disappear from a
14:38 quote-unquote mishap just like NASA
14:41 loses all of the evidence we went to the
14:43 moon right it's funny if you know
14:46 anything about how schools get funded
14:48 for technological advancements then
14:51 you'll be well aware that they don't
14:53 usually have any money to do such things
14:56 in in rural America especially when I
15:03 was a kid I was I was known for being a
15:07 pretty good whiz kid with computers and
15:09 so at one point the the district
15:12 chairman or whatever the hell for I
15:15 guess the district for 13 is my district
15:18 in Kansas he had me evaluate a Macintosh
15:21 computer about 1985 and said you know
15:25 should we get some of these things
15:26 they're really expensive and you know
15:29 I'd already played with one a few months
15:31 earlier and I was like
15:32 well these things are amazing these
15:36 things have more memory they have 128 km
15:38 at Ram's and the ones in the lab of 32
15:40 km I think 64 the pluses says double the
15:44 RAM and I said I think this is where
15:47 it's all going you know look at this
15:49 interface I didn't realize was called a
15:51 GUI my shuttle menus and all our kind of
15:54 stuff and he had no idea that really how
15:56 to comprehend when I was telling him and
15:58 they never got him because it had any
16:00 money but now schools are finding pretty
16:06 much infinite money to buy every single
16:09 kid an iPad every single kid some
16:11 Android tablet mostly iPads which is
16:13 even more expensive right
16:16 apples brilliant with this get all the
16:19 kids hooked on a particular brand and
16:20 then as they get older they just stick
16:22 to the brand right it's what they know
16:24 there have been events in time for those
16:28 of you who own DVRs
16:29 I don't know if maybe they're called
16:32 something else around the world but DVRs
16:34 in America are the machines that record
16:36 programs when you're not there right
16:38 I've never owned one of these because I
16:40 never won't watch anything on TV but you
16:42 know my cigar lounge has and we record
16:44 f1 races but they've had conspiratorial
16:48 shows air or really odd things there you
16:52 can look this up where the programs were
16:56 erased off people's DVRs so if you were
17:00 trying to save it
17:01 the network or your cable provider was
17:05 told by some higher state being deep
17:08 state get that off everyone's Drive
17:10 because that was never to air it's
17:14 interesting in this film which is based
17:16 off the book which is actually pretty
17:19 handsomely updated I will say there are
17:23 there's a moment where things where
17:25 Dominus was spoken which on a story
17:28 level it's kind of silly this lady was
17:30 revealing their secret weapon I guess
17:34 she was going to burn herself alive so
17:35 why not but they said you know we're
17:38 trying to get this off everyone's
17:40 computers and wipe it off so people
17:42 don't talk about this anymore
17:44 we know that in Britain alone then
17:46 of censorship is off-the-chain you post
17:51 something the state doesn't like they
17:52 not only suspend your account but they
17:56 have police that show up and arrest you
17:58 the amount of serfdom that is in Europe
18:04 right now is really off the chain that
18:06 people would violate their own perceived
18:08 rights without contemplating for a
18:12 second what that means for their own
18:13 rights their own personal rights right
18:14 you're walking around I'll just do what
18:16 I'm told
18:17 watch the video by this whole thing
18:19 right so we know that right now in
18:23 Europe and Britain which I'm going to
18:27 lump them all together they are
18:31 institutionalizing censorship like
18:34 draconian old-school monarchy [ __ ] like
18:37 the old stamp tax for those of you don't
18:41 know what the stamp tax was in Europe
18:44 there was something called the stamp tax
18:46 and what that meant and your minds not
18:49 gonna get this initially and then you're
18:51 gonna get it you're gonna go holy [ __ ]
18:52 Wow
18:53 get ready here's the part you won't get
18:56 every piece of paper in the world had to
18:58 be stamped with the the royal crown
19:01 symbol you're gonna go what yeah I'm
19:05 gonna repeat that just so you don't
19:06 think I'm saying it incorrectly every
19:09 piece of paper in your house had to be
19:12 stamped and you're thinking well that's
19:16 just [ __ ] weird why the hell who
19:18 would do that blah blah blah okay
19:20 here's why this is brilliant in the name
19:23 of absolute pure [ __ ] disgusting evil
19:26 this is brilliant because they don't
19:29 have a constitution or didn't have a
19:31 constitution just recently five hundred
19:33 years ago right Magna Carta came and
19:36 [ __ ] went over there they invented it
19:38 and then they let it go and that's sadly
19:40 what we have to defend over here which
19:42 is why here the second amendment in
19:43 America soldiers could show up at your
19:47 house and raid your house to make sure
19:50 that all the paper in your house had a
19:54 stamp on it it's not like a postage
19:58 stamp it's a stamp stamp
19:59 well it's a [ __ ] excuse to raid your
20:03 house and their idea was well if
20:06 something's gonna plot against the
20:08 government they probably can't do it all
20:10 inside their head so someone's gonna
20:11 keep notes cryptic or otherwise they're
20:13 gonna write it down and we will be able
20:15 to find every piece of paper in this
20:19 country that we suspect might be owned
20:21 by someone who is disgruntled with the
20:24 government okay
20:27 let's fast-forward to post 9/11
20:32 President Bush signs inaction the
20:35 military commissions Act which violates
20:37 the Second Amendment forcing
20:38 communications companies to spy on you
20:41 the Internet's here all routers are
20:44 designed to steal your information any
20:46 of you think you have those security
20:47 apps on your phone and oh I'm just not
20:50 gonna let anybody get all my stuff like
20:51 you are kidding yourself and there's so
20:53 many truth or channels that are pumping
20:55 this [ __ ] and it's it's sad either
20:59 they're dumb and don't know how this
21:01 works or ignorant I should say and they
21:03 don't know how internet security
21:04 violations occur or they're just setting
21:08 you up to make yourself make you feel
21:10 comfortable what you donate money to
21:12 their channel but we don't really worry
21:15 about pieces of paper anymore in your
21:17 house I mean you got some paper in your
21:18 printer you've got a notepad some
21:20 post-its that's usually about most homes
21:22 old [ __ ] you had if you're over 40 what
21:26 do we have today we have digital bits
21:29 that are organized in streams of bits
21:32 that we refer to as files and they don't
21:38 need a stamp tax anymore they just need
21:40 a military commissions act and that
21:42 allows your files to be viewed and
21:46 stolen especially if you transmit it
21:48 over the web that's where you're giving
21:49 it away you ever transmitted anything
21:51 over the web you can convince yourself
21:53 you've got security and blah blah blah
21:55 they can't make an encryption key big
21:57 enough to stump big supercomputers
22:01 anymore
22:01 they just you can't they'll crack it in
22:03 seconds they'll crack it literally a
22:05 really giant key would take probably the
22:10 average supercomputer nowadays I don't
22:12 know
22:12 I'm gonna guess three
22:13 seconds to get through and that would be
22:16 an insanely large public/private key
22:17 that you used to encrypt the file but
22:19 now where are the other files stored
22:21 they're on your local hard drives
22:22 they're inside your house and you won't
22:25 necessarily transmit them over the
22:26 Internet
22:27 well that's what the operating systems
22:29 come in and they organize all of your
22:32 data to be searched really quickly
22:36 anybody wants to find a file and get rid
22:38 of it off your computer or put a file on
22:40 a computer to frame you they just walk
22:43 through the back doors the operating
22:44 systems as long as you're on the
22:45 internet and they put it there email
22:50 servers it's all just files big gigantic
22:53 bins of little tiny files with big giant
22:57 still numbers for names they go to your
22:59 mail bin in UNIX they can just insert an
23:03 email in your chain and say oh look at
23:06 you you you may meld all these people
23:08 look at you said all these things that
23:10 are really illegal we're putting in jail
23:12 we're gonna give you the death penalty
23:13 whatever very simple to do books that go
23:20 electronic could be revised just like a
23:24 videogame that updates itself or a piece
23:27 of hardware or sees a piece of software
23:29 you like so you take like a Microsoft
23:32 Word and you run it and it goes point
23:35 hey we got a new update what do you want
23:38 it
23:38 it means college new features you know
23:40 like oh yeah I want it I don't want to
23:41 crash on me this audio software I use
23:43 wavepad the second it crashed I went
23:46 online and found the update and
23:51 hopefully it doesn't crash books could
23:53 be updated at the distribution hub
23:57 anything you have on your computer well
23:59 as long as you power it on you've
24:02 answered so many questions about you
24:04 know you know is it Terms of Use
24:08 contracts you know it's like when you
24:10 launch i-tunes it would take an attorney
24:12 probably I don't know a solid month to
24:15 parse the contract you're signing but we
24:17 want to use our iTunes so we go yes I
24:19 agree there's been a flurry by the way
24:23 of privacy policy updates in the last 7
24:27 days and I mean
24:27 every single company that I'm a member
24:30 of including my Android phone in order
24:36 for me to continue using my [ __ ]
24:37 phone
24:38 I had to click through a new privacy
24:41 policy and new Terms of Use thing
24:43 otherwise my phone was going to be
24:45 locked out something I paid money for an
24:48 [ __ ] corporation can come and go oh
24:51 you know I know you own your TV but if
24:52 you want to actually get power on you're
24:54 gonna have to kiss our ass and sign this
24:56 thing and if you don't you won't be able
24:58 to use your device can you imagine that
25:01 you own your car you bought some
25:03 Mercedes you paid 80 grand for it you
25:05 walk outside and there's a dude standing
25:08 there with a clipboard and an attorney
25:09 and a cop and they say well you I know
25:13 you have to go to work but if you don't
25:14 sign away your life right now we're
25:16 going to keep your car disabled the
25:18 chips not going to work why why not we
25:23 do it everywhere else right we're
25:25 literally slowly putting chains on
25:27 ourselves or so slowly getting into the
25:30 straitjackets as the size of a
25:32 full-grown you know man's like a big
25:34 it's like a big hospital gown right with
25:37 all these shackles and stuff we're just
25:39 putting it on how do we protect
25:41 ourselves as citizens from losing
25:46 history losing all of our knowledge
25:49 having all those crazy theories which I
25:52 will not try to repeat on this episode
25:55 that we know are bunk totally fake
25:58 events in history and all this other
26:00 stuff how do we keep that from being
26:02 solidified as truth one of the great
26:06 moments in Fahrenheit 451 is that they
26:10 had retold well let me set the movie up
26:12 for those of you haven't seen it it's
26:16 near future
26:17 it appears that America and only America
26:20 has done this new thing where they go
26:22 into a true book book burning phase
26:24 where there's a bunch of these
26:27 firefighters that are firemen I should
26:32 say they're not firefighters they're
26:33 firemen they start fires they don't put
26:35 out fires and what they do is they have
26:37 100% authority bar none to raid your
26:41 house
26:41 like a stamp tag soldier go in your
26:44 house find anything that's written down
26:45 and I mean anything that's written down
26:47 and if you have a digital copy of a book
26:49 you're still in violation they'll
26:52 destroy your computers but if you find
26:54 you with any books they put the book
26:55 down and the press shows up because
26:57 they're called and it goes out over the
26:59 airwaves and you get this positive
27:00 negative thumbs up from social media and
27:03 this is the new twist on it
27:07 and they put the books in the pile and
27:09 then they bring the books in front of
27:10 you then they take your you're citizen
27:15 ID that's I guess stored in your hand
27:17 and they erased
27:18 I guess these your fingerprints or
27:19 something and then they erased your
27:20 identity from the computer and you're
27:22 kind of a complete nomad all of your
27:24 privileges are suspended and you get
27:25 like a sentence of 10 15 20 25 years
27:29 whatever and for those years you're just
27:31 cut out of the system which I assume
27:33 they didn't really give you an example
27:35 of what those are what that means but
27:38 everyone who isn't in the system is
27:40 called an eel like the fish poor yields
27:44 gets such a bad rep the these
27:47 firefighters eventually well one you
27:49 realize that they're they're kind of
27:52 worshipped like heroes in the populace
27:55 because they burn books right and so you
28:00 know one of these guys starts to wonder
28:05 if what they're doing is right that's
28:07 pretty much the setup but inside the
28:10 story they tell the story of Benjamin
28:12 Franklin who in real life was sort of a
28:15 double agent for Britain in the US but
28:17 you know he's pretty famous for helping
28:20 to found this country and what-have-you
28:22 but they've retold the story that
28:25 because in real life Benjamin Franklin
28:26 supposedly I mean they give away credit
28:28 to British [ __ ] [ __ ] all the time
28:30 and no offence against the Brits but
28:31 it's like it's just this trend that
28:34 we've had going for a thousand years
28:36 white people invented everything even
28:40 though cotton gin but the history is
28:44 that he formed the very first fire
28:46 brigade fire department to fight fires
28:50 but in this movie they've twisted the
28:52 truth in that
28:55 he was the first fireman that that
28:57 burned books and that they're just
28:59 simply following this past that has been
29:02 all revised to say that the world was
29:04 horrible when people used to read books
29:06 that it promotes individualism and thus
29:11 violence and thus unhappiness but the
29:15 whole world lives in this in this United
29:17 States of America and this movie lives
29:19 in this Inquisition phase of you know
29:22 report your neighbor if you see anything
29:25 suspicious one of those horrible
29:27 societies in the film which I'm sure is
29:30 in the book they were wise enough to say
29:33 to one of the readers one of the old
29:35 guys who was a reader and who knew
29:37 history because he read that as soon as
29:39 he's dead and his generation dies off no
29:43 one's gonna remember books ever existed
29:46 and because they're forbidden to exist
29:48 and because there's electronic
29:50 equivalents now of recording information
29:54 they never will exist now the good news
29:59 is you find out that it's only the
30:01 United States at the beginning you don't
30:02 know if the whole world is doing this or
30:04 whatever but the end you find out is
30:05 only United States that pull this off
30:06 and the funny thing is that the country
30:09 that is written into the end of this
30:10 film as the saving country would
30:12 probably be a country that would go way
30:13 before the United States so funny
30:16 how that works but one of the byproducts
30:19 of the truth movement is the revision of
30:20 history being revised back to probably a
30:24 slightly more if not profoundly more
30:26 accurate version of what really occurred
30:28 in certain points in time you know
30:30 massacres had never occurred and
30:32 massacres that occurred that were
30:33 overlooked we know that every single day
30:37 we fight fake news we do we fight it and
30:40 fight it and fight it well imagine if
30:44 there wasn't a resistance factor
30:47 it's just reported and that's it you
30:50 take it in you believe it you go on now
30:52 if the world was truly a euphoric set up
30:56 and not devolved into a thx 1-1 3-8
30:59 where it's horrific existence I mean
31:02 it's not horrific as maybe 1980 for
31:04 Brazil but it's you know it's a
31:07 clinically clean
31:08 but it is you know people are getting
31:10 beat on television as a form of
31:12 entertainment we may look the other way
31:15 the whole time if everything was great
31:19 and then they could simply do what I was
31:22 talking about the beginning of the
31:23 episode which is to degradation vestment
31:26 in mankind such that we get the scraps
31:31 we get the bare minimum to exist what's
31:34 interesting about mankind as far as I've
31:36 been able to deduce and my years of life
31:38 is that I believe that freedom is a
31:42 genetic quality and man and it's
31:45 overwhelmingly powerful the reason why
31:49 our children go through rites of passage
31:51 and start to reject their parents
31:53 especially in first of all countries
31:54 that have no formal right of passage
31:56 except for maybe the Jewish culture that
31:58 has the bar mitzvah which i think is
32:00 brilliant because you have to have a
32:01 moment when you tell your child you're
32:03 becoming a man you have to have that
32:05 christening moment if you don't have it
32:07 in your family and you're about to raise
32:08 kids you're gonna raise kids where kids
32:10 are getting close to that phase make one
32:12 up make one up before they fully rebel
32:16 because then you will hand them the
32:18 baton of responsibility and instead of
32:20 feeling like they have to tell you to go
32:22 [ __ ] yourself they will say oh my god
32:25 I've just inherited a bunch of
32:26 responsibility that now I need to become
32:29 more mature to handle and my parents
32:32 trusted me with this responsibility make
32:33 it a real responsibility you know a lot
32:37 of times what parents will do is say
32:38 okay 13 or 14 years old somewhere in
32:42 there you turn over the keys to when a
32:44 child has to go to bed maybe before it's
32:48 up to you man only you know but you tell
32:50 your kids okay look I'm gonna let you
32:52 stay up as long as you want but here's
32:53 the deal you got to get up and go to
32:55 school in the morning and you got to get
32:57 decent grades so if you stay up too long
32:59 and you're totally dragging ass in the
33:00 morning well that's your responsibility
33:02 you need to get to bed earlier if your
33:04 grades start to degrade you get to
33:06 school but you suck
33:07 well it's your responsibility you've got
33:09 to bring that up I'm entrusting you with
33:11 this this is what grown-ups do and
33:12 you've really turned out to be a great
33:14 kid and I'm interesting you with this
33:17 they love that [ __ ] and it's honestly
33:20 what they've probably earned
33:22 with their level of maturity in most
33:23 cases right so in the early phase of
33:26 life we see kids rebel and we have to do
33:28 whatever we can to wrangle that trans
33:31 transformation but what's interesting if
33:34 you want you needy shows on Netflix like
33:35 lockup where you've got a you know
33:37 prison shows you know technically
33:41 speaking we all know that the masses
33:45 rule when they want to and we've seen
33:47 mobs that do horrible things
33:49 the prisoners never have to obey they do
33:54 though they accept their fate they
33:57 accept their punishment in most cases
33:59 sure there's prison riots everyone's a
34:00 mob whatever what always happens in a
34:02 prison riot there's this envelope and
34:06 believe me I'm not trying to call us
34:07 prison riots or anything there's always
34:12 this sort of envelope of explosion they
34:15 explode within the compound borders and
34:19 they do usually in a lot of cases they
34:22 take over the prison a hundred percent
34:24 what they never try to really do it I've
34:26 never heard this maybe they have where's
34:28 the whole prison leaves or I think the
34:31 whole prison takes cars and keys and
34:35 they operate everything and they open up
34:36 all the doors and they just [ __ ] all
34:38 disperse and random directions 3,000
34:41 prisoners just running all over the
34:43 countryside because in their brain they
34:45 still adopt the border of the prison as
34:50 a restriction as a restriction of again
34:53 I just told the whole thing about the
34:54 spike in the elephant it's still the
34:56 spike in the ground and thank God that
34:59 they still recognize that a lot of them
35:02 will accept their punishment and realize
35:04 that well what'll happen is I'll run and
35:06 they'll catch me and they'll have more
35:08 charges on me which is probably the
35:11 smart thing right so on one level we see
35:15 society at least in America rebel
35:19 against overly strict regulations and
35:23 laws on the people we have the
35:26 Constitution United States and in this
35:28 country people will you know more often
35:31 now if they do not answer the question
35:34 that there are Stalin's Republic
35:36 staunch Democrat they'll say they're
35:38 constitutionalists that's cool that
35:41 means you have a set of rules that sort
35:44 of based on common law do no harm and
35:46 boom we know how to behave as a society
35:49 the reason why I mentioning this is I'm
35:51 trying to highlight your brain a little
35:52 bit to the malleable nature of man's
35:54 mind to accept both nature the natural
36:00 instinct for man to be free and the
36:03 ability for us to concede down to a
36:06 paradigm of law which may or may not be
36:10 fair just or do no harm for those of us
36:15 over 40 remember old America the
36:20 interesting thing about it is that we
36:21 almost can't conceive of the president
36:26 America the feminization of our men the
36:32 over masculine nature of the women and
36:36 it's not really equaling a lot of
36:39 happiness is the thing the reason why
36:42 these groups are so angry is because
36:45 that they don't like being in their own
36:47 skin you know there's that famous famous
36:50 super obese girl who was screaming at
36:52 some I think it was Milo event she
36:56 looked like the lady out of Monsters Inc
36:59 right I guarantee you being that
37:01 gigantic as much as they will try to
37:04 tell you that they feel fine with it
37:06 that girl was so absolutely obese she's
37:10 paying a lot of prices on a daily basis
37:13 you know trying to find clothing trying
37:16 to deal with joint pain I mean wait till
37:18 she gets older I mean there's all kinds
37:21 of minuscule things that she's gonna run
37:23 into she's out of control in her own
37:25 life so sure she shows up to a protest
37:28 at a rally I mean at a function that's
37:30 actually organized and paid for and
37:32 tries to deny the guy on stage his
37:35 ability to have his First Amendment it's
37:39 a rooted personal unhappiness being
37:43 projected out into whatever scapegoat
37:46 mechanism it can be projected into that
37:48 is not going to route
37:49 the anger back to themselves right the
37:54 big thing in America right now and
37:56 probably around the world so I should
37:58 just say it's it's a global thing
37:59 how foolish of me is the divide one of
38:05 the things that was in Fahrenheit 451
38:07 that's interesting as they said they
38:08 started really calling out some
38:12 legitimate things the books can be used
38:15 to do which is divide divide through
38:18 religious worship is one of the ones
38:20 that's brought up a couple times in the
38:21 film well we know that that happens we
38:25 do and sort of the theme that pops out
38:31 of the film at the end is that even
38:35 though it's not perfect when we're free
38:37 it's the way we want it to be in the end
38:41 haven't you ever had the thought of like
38:43 well it'll be interesting to see mankind
38:46 say in a hundred thousand years if we
38:49 don't become extinct or even fifty
38:53 thousand years I know it sounds like a
38:55 long ways out there but I'm pretty sure
38:57 man was around fifty thousand years ago
39:00 okay are we gonna shake this all out I
39:05 mean we have been around for probably a
39:09 hundred thousand years
39:10 it doesn't matter of God made us or was
39:11 evolution doesn't matter we've been
39:13 around that long as pretty hairless Homo
39:15 sapiens
39:18 we still have all the races don't we is
39:21 it because we didn't make boats and
39:24 planes and trains not really I mean how
39:28 do you think Hawaii got populated by
39:30 Polynesian people we did find pretty
39:33 much every continent with a sort of a
39:36 general mean of genetic qualities look
39:39 at the Native Americans they're much
39:40 much different than the Incans Incas who
39:44 knows what the pre Incas looked like I
39:47 think Australia was pretty much
39:50 Aborigine and that was it until Britain
39:53 started dropping off their citizens
39:54 there by the way I heard this
39:56 interesting story from an Australian
39:59 youtuber he was talking about the idea
40:02 that I'll straight
40:03 was a penal colony and he he wasn't
40:06 being percent serious but he called he
40:12 called it out his [ __ ] and he said
40:14 you know what's really true is that they
40:15 just threw all the dissidents from
40:18 Europe into the ocean I should say
40:21 Britain but they put you on a boat take
40:24 you out in the ocean and throw you in
40:25 the ocean and then came back and told
40:27 people that they took him to an island
40:29 and then eventually they did inhabit
40:31 Australia way past this phase of the
40:35 penal colony thing and then they said
40:36 yeah these are the people that came from
40:38 Australia that were put here during the
40:41 penal faced right a very interesting
40:43 idea because that could be very very
40:45 true I've never researched it just a
40:48 very interesting twist on the story but
40:51 there you have it how how I'm gonna get
40:55 the two other things here before we
40:56 close out but you know a lot of times
41:00 you think a book-burning you think of
41:02 huge changes to history don't just
41:06 blanking out history for one and the
41:09 funny thing in the film was that
41:10 everyone took these eye drops are full
41:11 of a chemical cocktail that which made
41:13 them forget their past everybody just
41:15 absolutely accepted the fact that they
41:16 couldn't remember their past you were
41:19 only ever living in the now that's just
41:21 interesting so you could never get
41:23 indoctrinated very much besides in
41:25 reinforcement of whatever's happening in
41:27 the now and that that world was all
41:29 about the now and the now rules you know
41:32 but maybe it's just little tiny changes
41:35 in history that could make all the
41:36 difference in the world right now back
41:39 in season one I maybe a little bit in
41:42 season two I talked about the obviously
41:47 the dumbing down of the world and one of
41:49 the big things is to remove language to
41:52 reduce the amount of words that we use
41:54 such that our ability to articulate and
41:56 express ourselves is gone as a missing
42:00 art now I've worked with several people
42:04 in academic institutions and I always
42:09 use the time I have with them which is
42:11 usually fairly rare and for me priceless
42:14 to ask them questions about
42:16 sort of where we are within celebrated
42:19 universities like big names that I've
42:22 spoken at and you know one of the most
42:25 educated people I've ever talked to told
42:28 me that the the average high school
42:31 student graduates with 1200 words in
42:34 their vocabulary which might sound like
42:36 a lot but wait for it and some of them
42:40 worth a four-year degree who takes a
42:42 literary track gains another thousand
42:47 words so an average for your graduate
42:51 with a literary degree has about 2200
42:54 words in their vocabulary that the books
42:57 today you're hitting your Harry Potter
42:59 books on all the books that become
43:00 famous use a very conservative word
43:03 supply of unique words now rewinding
43:11 back to Civil War soldiers in America
43:13 which is for those of you don't know
43:14 it's in the 1860s the average vocabulary
43:19 of a Civil War soldier as discovered by
43:21 historians who have been trying to
43:23 translate the letters home that these
43:25 people wrote each other thousands and
43:27 thousands of these letters well they
43:29 found out very quickly the college
43:32 professors could not translate these
43:35 letters in their entirety and the reason
43:38 why was the vocabulary was so absolutely
43:41 huge but they didn't know what these
43:44 guys were saying when totaled the
43:47 average vocabulary of a Civil War
43:52 soldier who's whose average education
43:55 was eighth grade was 12,000 words a
43:59 little bit of math that's 10 times the
44:02 amount of words that a high school
44:04 student gets in America today ten times
44:07 who knows when an academic in the 1860s
44:11 was coming out with you know I don't
44:14 know if 12,000 even demands anything
44:17 more than perhaps you know industry
44:19 terms for if you're getting into physics
44:21 you got a bunch of physics terms you're
44:22 going to medicine you a bunch of
44:23 medicine terms or whatever but I would
44:26 wager you do gain at least another
44:28 thousand words going through school in
44:29 the eighteen
44:30 right now America was much more meat and
44:34 potatoes back in those days so at eighth
44:35 grade you were considered pretty much an
44:37 academic but if you look back on their
44:38 vocabulary it's huge
44:40 there's a chart out there for those of
44:42 you who are interested you can look up
44:44 the there's a chart that tracks the
44:47 amount of words that a particular rapper
44:50 has used in it you know it's essentially
44:53 sort of like an inadvertent IQ register
44:57 to say okay Eminem the rapper's done
44:59 this many unique words and all of his
45:01 raps so they assume he's that you know
45:02 he's at this level on the bar on the
45:04 line graph and I read through this thing
45:09 and most of the rappers of today are way
45:12 back in the kind of preschool level of
45:16 words I mean some of these guys could
45:17 barely get out of the paper bag who are
45:20 so popular today right they've got about
45:21 100 words are using for all their raps
45:24 it's really funny and the one that
45:26 shocked me there was some super academic
45:28 rapper who was in number one place but
45:31 one of the second or third folks last
45:33 time I saw this diagram was LL Cool J I
45:36 couldn't believe it I was like because
45:38 his stuff is so beautiful and simple to
45:40 understand but you know yeah he's way up
45:43 there at the top it's amazing it's cool
45:45 right but removing our words it affects
45:50 your brain it affects how you
45:52 communicate it can sometimes if you go
45:55 way below a certain threshold you
45:56 immediately sound ignorant even though
45:59 you may not be ignorant one of the and I
46:03 mentioned this you know a year and a
46:04 half ago or whatever my marathon lock it
46:08 locked lock up so let's go lock up some
46:12 of the wisest souls I've ever seen in my
46:14 life for these old guys have been in
46:15 jail for 30 40 years they're gonna die
46:17 there and they are giving their advice
46:20 to the young folks or just giving it to
46:22 the camera during interviews and their
46:25 English is unfortunately atrocious I
46:30 mean it's just really bad you know
46:32 misconstrued double negatives almost up
46:34 but what's interesting about it is that
46:36 these guys have been in there so long I
46:37 don't have had so much time to think
46:40 that what they're saying pound-for-pound
46:43 in terms of value is off the scale like
46:47 super wisdom in and I find that
46:50 fascinating my hope is that the internet
46:54 might have a side effect and that people
46:56 I think on average read more than they
46:58 did perhaps fifteen years ago I've also
47:02 said on the show several times that
47:05 writing poetry is one of the best ways
47:07 to utterly supercharge your brain and
47:10 it's almost like a an alien machine you
47:13 hook up to your brain if your IQ was you
47:16 know 120 and you begin writing poetry
47:20 for let's say a minimum of two years
47:22 because you're gonna go through all
47:24 these phases of writing crap and they're
47:25 gonna write really good you're gonna add
47:29 10 to 20 points on your IQ and people
47:31 are gonna notice and it's you doing it
47:34 to yourself but eventually you know
47:36 you'll start writing poetry initially
47:37 and you want yo Lee you'll start rhyming
47:39 everything what you don't have to do if
47:41 you don't want to but you will run out
47:43 of you'll get so tired of using the same
47:45 words right those who write poems about
47:48 loving someone or having an amazing
47:51 loving experience the word ecstasy comes
47:53 out really really fast and then you
47:55 write ecstasy four times or four
47:56 different poems you realize I gotta find
47:58 different way to say this I kind of
48:00 parse the word parse the meaning parse
48:02 the feeling you know what what do we say
48:07 half the time when we talk about how we
48:10 could make the world a peaceful place if
48:12 some of us say everyone drops acid for a
48:16 week that might help but the other big
48:19 one is just simply getting one thought
48:22 in everyone's mind about peace and the
48:24 benefit of how much we love each other
48:26 or love our lives so we really don't
48:27 have any beef with anyone else
48:29 those who always are [ __ ] with other
48:31 people we educate them on hey we don't
48:34 want to be messed with and this is why
48:37 and so on and so forth but it's it's
48:40 always like a data pack of information
48:44 in the brain that is sort of the root of
48:47 all peacemaking magic wand solutions
48:53 well if we as human beings allow our
48:58 communication to be dumbed down we're
49:01 unable to articulate what we are
49:03 thinking in our minds that means that
49:06 you couldn't do a show like this right
49:08 be really tough there's so many nuances
49:11 of emotion you know so you know that
49:15 when you well let's just say you haven't
49:18 but let me just explain this for those
49:19 of you who have painted in your lifetime
49:21 even a house you just paint the side of
49:23 a house you know there's a big six inch
49:25 brush you can use if you're not using
49:27 the sprayer
49:28 let's use the sprayer first right
49:29 sprayers doing the big sections and then
49:32 you move to a six inch brush and then
49:34 you move to a curve like a you know a
49:37 wedge brush think it's gonna get in
49:39 there and then you can even you know
49:41 paint a model and it's paint a painting
49:43 and you just keeping your brush smaller
49:44 and smaller and what happens what is the
49:47 requirement to use a smaller brush it's
49:50 typically skill in talent okay when you
49:54 are communicating you have coarse words
49:56 that have big giant meanings like if I
49:59 ever say the f-bomb on this show the
50:01 funny thing is is I'm I don't know that
50:03 I've ever ever used it in the
50:06 traditional sense of its definition
50:07 which is copulation or intercourse I'm
50:10 saying it as a expletive to add some
50:15 sort of flavor and emphasis to something
50:17 I am about to say or that I've just said
50:19 you know the f-bomb is one of the words
50:21 that has the most definitions in the
50:23 world right
50:24 almost all dirty words have such a thing
50:28 it's like the funny one about the word
50:31 dude you know dude or dude alright just
50:35 me saying those two different ways
50:37 imagine coming to America and trying to
50:38 figure out the difference between those
50:39 two I mean those two emphasis and
50:42 fastest is you know it's it means
50:46 something complain everything like yeah
50:47 I'm sorry we're so weird but those are
50:52 the nuances of language what also starts
50:57 to happen is you will realize the more
50:59 vocabulary that you build and again
51:01 reading is real I'm really trying to
51:02 point this at reading helps you see
51:05 words spelled which helps you become a
51:08 better speller which helps you pronounce
51:10 words correctly because you will
51:11 understand that the word definitely does
51:14 not have an A in it okay all right
51:16 that's one of the most misspelled words
51:18 on the Internet
51:19 definitely right but the more words you
51:23 know the less you will ever be tied up
51:25 in your own gut saying I'm not able to
51:28 communicate what I am feeling and I am
51:30 feeling what the person I am talking to
51:32 because I can't get across what the hell
51:35 I'm trying to say and that's super
51:39 frustrating but the second you can
51:42 articulate like a ballet and I mean you
51:45 are hitting every bump and stop and jump
51:47 and whatever and people are watching you
51:50 which means listening to you and they're
51:52 like oh my god that sounded perfect you
51:55 said what was in my mind that I was not
51:57 able unable to put into words it's not
52:01 about showing off in the end it but it
52:03 will just make you live in your own skin
52:06 that much better and even if you want a
52:09 protest or debate someone you believe
52:12 something completely different than they
52:13 do the more you articulate the more that
52:16 you can get across your notion and
52:19 perhaps get someone to see your
52:21 perspective better right we have to be
52:24 careful with letting the entire world
52:28 become electronic you know a lot of you
52:31 will study the power of EMP waves right
52:34 electromagnetic pulse waves that are now
52:36 weaponized they're 100% weaponized
52:39 they've been weaponized for probably 40
52:41 years they can ignite a bomb electronic
52:44 burst and fry every single piece of
52:50 micro electronics around they can fry
52:53 your hard drives you know imagine they
52:56 blow out the controller in your hard
52:59 drive let's say the disk itself
53:01 for the most part is intact the date is
53:03 still on the disk have you ever paid to
53:05 recover data off of disk before you damn
53:09 near have to be a major corporation or a
53:12 millionaire to pay for [ __ ] to come off
53:14 a drive it's that expensive is really
53:18 and I've been to the laboratory down an
53:20 Irvine and I got a whole tour by the guy
53:23 that started the company and it is
53:27 unbelievably difficult to do this work I
53:30 mean it is a meticulous laboratory thing
53:33 it's painstaking it's almost so hard
53:37 that if you had the money to start that
53:38 company because you think there's a lot
53:39 of demand you will find it hard to have
53:43 employees have enough physical
53:45 Constitution to do the work that's how
53:47 hard it is and then of course you're
53:50 inadvertently giving all of your data to
53:53 somebody else
53:54 right those of you take photographs and
53:58 you can't imagine losing your
54:01 photographs that are on your hard drive
54:04 do me a favor get them printed into a
54:07 book
54:08 there's a million services out there you
54:10 upload your photos into a book and you
54:12 have them printed and it costs nothing
54:14 and they printed out not a city paper so
54:16 last forever do that for me
54:19 and send copies of it to your relatives
54:22 so if your house burns to the ground it
54:25 doesn't matter your memories are in on
54:27 bookshelves all around your family if
54:30 it's important enough that you would cry
54:32 your eyes out if it got burned up either
54:36 get it printed or take the printed ones
54:39 you have and are the ones you've already
54:40 you know Kodak tout back in the old days
54:42 get them scanned cleaned up put in a
54:45 book and sent out to people it's pennies
54:47 on the dollar for your tears let me tell
54:49 you if your house burned down give you
54:52 an example of how silly this is your
54:55 house burns down and you're looking at
54:57 your whole life disappear and I say to
55:00 you I walk up to you and I said would
55:02 you spend $500 to bring it all back and
55:06 you're just crying your eyes on you're
55:08 like well [ __ ] yeah if I said would you
55:10 pay five thousand dollars to bring our
55:11 memories back and you're like
55:13 yes I would pay $50,000 to bring all my
55:16 memories back to put that house right
55:17 back where it was without it being
55:19 burned down and then I turn to you like
55:22 an [ __ ] then I just say well for $250
55:27 you could have done it you could mail a
55:31 hard drive to a relative with all your
55:33 files on it yeah maybe it's locked
55:35 encrypted or whatever if you're really
55:37 worried about your secret stuff but you
55:39 could send a hard drive what's a hard
55:41 drive for terabyte hard drive you can
55:42 get for 90 bucks now four terabytes do
55:45 you really have four terabytes of life
55:46 probably not but there's there's one
55:48 more thing about the power of words I
55:50 mean there's a bunch of things about the
55:52 power of words it's also extremely
55:53 important and you know this isn't
55:57 necessarily directly related to the idea
55:59 of being electronic or being printed but
56:01 if printed paper which doesn't flicker
56:04 off and on is more memorable to your
56:06 mind then this is important which is
56:12 that it improves the frequency in your
56:14 brain to realize who you are as a human
56:16 being you look in the mirror and you
56:21 have thoughts that are constructed into
56:23 words I'll give you two halves of this
56:25 equation if you look in the mirror and
56:29 you like yourself completely and you're
56:33 not really worried about what words
56:35 describe that beautiful person in the
56:38 mirror and hopefully that's the way you
56:40 feel but if you ever proverbially or
56:43 symbolically look in the mirror and you
56:46 don't like something it doesn't have to
56:48 be your physical form okay
56:49 it can just be who you were last night
56:51 when you had too many drinks or when you
56:54 got a little argument with someone you
56:55 love
56:56 you need words in your brain to
57:00 condition yourself for change you need
57:04 to be able to take the cloud of a really
57:07 angry moment with someone that might
57:09 have lasted 10 30 - 10 20 30 minutes and
57:11 you need to be able to slow down time
57:13 get in there with a microscope and parse
57:16 everything that triggered the next thing
57:18 next thing next thing and say okay what
57:19 could I have done personally to not get
57:22 so agitated to not say the wrong thing
57:24 in a flippant way we've all been there
57:26 you say the thing you didn't you
57:28 probably shouldn't have said and then
57:30 you you know you blow it up you're not
57:34 gonna lose man that's part of why men do
57:37 it so these words are very very
57:39 important to you
57:40 okay now there's one of the compliments
57:46 I get on this channel okay and I'm gonna
57:48 tell you the reward I receive from your
57:52 comments and then I'm going to tell you
57:53 the Paul Harvey to the story which for
57:55 me is sort of funny which is that I get
57:59 a compliment on this show probably once
58:01 a week about on you know I've got 315
58:04 videos so I see compliment comments that
58:07 are compliments that you don't see
58:08 unless you're going back through all the
58:10 comments of every video I have a nice
58:12 aggregate so I'm lucky but someone will
58:14 say it's very articulated you put it
58:17 into words and I was struggling to put
58:19 this into words and so that's one the
58:21 compliments I get okay and thank you
58:24 very much trust me he loved it but when
58:29 I moved to California in 1987 I was
58:34 probably pretty good at speaking words
58:37 okay I'm not sure exactly why because
58:40 again it wasn't a big giant fictional
58:42 reader I mean I just paid attention but
58:45 I'd read tons and tons of technical
58:47 books and then sorted it out of my mind
58:50 and rheic splain dit to people such that
58:52 it was easy to understand maybe that's
58:53 what I did to get my vocabulary up but
58:56 here's what you need to know I was one
58:59 of the worst spellers the world has ever
59:02 created since man was invented horrible
59:07 and now I'm extremely good at it okay I
59:11 don't know how we're doing a spelling
59:13 bee with all that weird [ __ ] those kids
59:14 have to spell but I'm just talking about
59:16 everyday communications when I write I
59:18 write fluently it's just whatever I can
59:21 think of in my mind I can pull it out
59:23 you know orders of magnitude over even
59:26 my inner voice just when I start writing
59:27 it all starts flowing okay so how the
59:29 hell did I get from being essentially
59:33 illiterate when it came to writing like
59:35 I was really good in English class in
59:37 school don't get me wrong
59:39 it was never testing my vocabulary I
59:41 only had a couple creative writing
59:43 exercises but anytime I had to write
59:45 something out when I look back it's just
59:49 like my god I was transposing words
59:52 words that you know son s o n son s you
59:55 in I probably make a mistake with that
59:57 particular word but I was meshing
59:59 messing up a ton your and your like you
60:02 are abbreviated I would screw up that
60:04 consignee then and then just tons and
60:08 tons and tons of these works almost an
60:10 alarming rate of like geez this guy's
60:13 breaking world's records with
60:14 misspelling things and transposing words
60:17 now had I gone into some sort of clinic
60:19 today they would have said I was
60:20 dyslexic
60:21 I wasn't dyslexic I was ignorant I was
60:26 dumb okay but I had a guy pull me aside
60:29 in 1991 and he was a Norwegian guy
60:34 speaks perfect English right he's a
60:37 British English he was just an amazing
60:40 guy and he was my cube mate he was
60:43 always like on the other side of
60:44 partition and he said to me hey he goes
60:48 he was always copied on emails that I
60:50 was writing and he was so friendly okay
60:55 this is the other thing I always have to
60:56 try to remember to do and hopefully if
61:00 you have the same privilege of helping
61:02 someone out you can be like my buddy Ron
61:06 but he goes I noticed that when you
61:08 write you have a tremendous amount of
61:13 grammatical errors spelling errors and
61:15 transposing but because he sat next to
61:18 me and I was in a technical support
61:20 department he realized that I was saying
61:23 words incorrectly literally using again
61:26 the vowels that don't exist inserting
61:29 consonants that don't exist into the
61:31 words and so he made a deduction that to
61:34 this day I've never heard anyone say
61:35 ever ever not to someone else not to me
61:38 and it was just in my opinion it was at
61:42 the very he could have started a whole
61:44 new hooked on phonics class based off
61:48 what he was telling me it's not funny
61:50 space but it's a
61:52 it's the following he says look I think
61:56 I figured you out he says I don't think
61:58 you know how to spell anything do you
61:59 I'll look at your emails it's crazy we
62:02 didn't have spell checkers that
62:03 underlined everything in your in your
62:05 writing back in the day he says I don't
62:08 think you know anything spelled so one
62:11 you say words incorrectly because you
62:15 don't know how they're spelled your
62:16 spelling him some chaotic way in your
62:18 brain he says I think if you can learn
62:20 how to spell you're gonna pretty much
62:22 fix most of your words but you do need
62:24 to go and study words because you've got
62:26 a bunch of things mixed up you don't
62:28 know possess of your vs. you are about
62:31 to do something right so here's the
62:34 commitment I made to myself Microsoft
62:38 Word probably since 1987 when I first
62:40 started writing novels which I don't do
62:44 anymore it has a spell checker and at
62:48 first I would just go yes yes yes oh
62:50 gosh thank you for fixing all my
62:51 problems but now my transposing word
62:53 problem wasn't being corrected by the
62:56 grammar checkers that exist today like a
62:58 van and then right then being a
63:02 comparative between two things and then
63:04 being a reference in time right I fact
63:08 an effect it's the latest one I fixed so
63:12 before too long I would spellcheck and
63:15 because I was writing so much content so
63:17 much fictional content you know I'd sit
63:20 down and write eight pages dense pages
63:23 of novel stuff in one setting and then I
63:25 go back and spell checking so my
63:27 commitment I made to myself was before
63:28 allowing the spell checker to fix
63:30 anything
63:30 I would see what I had done wrong in the
63:34 spelling and see what they were doing
63:35 right in the correction and I'm gonna
63:38 tell you it was it was a super quick fix
63:43 to my spelling problems my brain was so
63:48 tired of spelling wrong because I think
63:50 I knew subconsciously I was just hurling
63:53 it out there now that way you get it so
63:54 there you go right within a couple years
63:57 my spelling had probably increased
63:59 eighty to ninety percent grammar that
64:03 took another ten years
64:05 now with today's grammar checkers is
64:07 phenomenal the one I use all the time is
64:11 grammarly you'll see these pre-rolls on
64:15 videos on YouTube for grammar early and
64:17 they say right inside there they go if
64:21 you write you need this plug-in it fits
64:23 in your web browser but you can have it
64:25 in all of your software on your computer
64:26 usually it's free I know they might have
64:31 some spy thing where they're you know
64:33 transmitting your word someplace to get
64:34 them checked out it doesn't matter let
64:36 me tell you man as long as you're not
64:37 you know colluding with the Russians
64:39 get the goddamn plug in if you have any
64:42 issues with your grammar you'll be
64:44 stunned how grammar rules evolve over
64:48 time and you will have adopted something
64:50 that is just wrong you know it's it's
64:55 not it's no longer accepted or you
64:57 didn't have to have to put a comma there
64:58 anymore that kind of stuff it's really
65:00 interesting it makes you amazing at
65:02 writing the other trick I use is that I
65:05 on my Macintosh
65:07 I used the text-to-speech feature which
65:10 in my computer it's option escape key
65:14 will read back to you in a voice that
65:16 you pick inside your control panel
65:18 and whatever speed you want have
65:20 beautiful voices I use a British Indian
65:25 woman and I it's like Senora or
65:29 something like that it's an s name it's
65:32 not that that's not the name but it's
65:33 something like that and she's just
65:34 beautiful and I have her speak it back
65:35 to me and then you'll find you have
65:37 plurals missing or plurals on there
65:40 because you revise the sentence you know
65:41 and you forgot to take out some of the
65:43 the the tensage Java was whether there
65:45 should be a word and is instead of an
65:48 are again grammar leo fix it a lot of
65:51 automated software on your computer will
65:52 fix it but if I'm writing at two o'clock
65:55 in the morning a really important email
65:57 to my boss I use that software to prove
66:01 and you just if you just relax your mind
66:03 and listen it's it hears mistakes it's
66:06 interesting because kids don't read
66:09 anymore
66:09 on average we are seeing like epidemics
66:15 in bad english at least
66:19 you know I'll be fascinated for any of
66:21 you who speak another language do me a
66:23 favor comment in the comment section
66:25 about the average vocabulary of a person
66:30 in your native language and whether or
66:32 not people speak correctly is it
66:36 degradation in French and German and all
66:39 these different languages I mean let me
66:40 know because that's a fascinating fact
66:42 I've never heard in America
66:44 it's a slippery slope but the one that's
66:47 really out there now is the difference
66:49 between seen and saw I have seen I have
66:56 I have seen I saw you know and I'll get
67:00 these comments all the time on YouTube
67:02 and no offense to you guys still
67:03 struggling to put this together as I
67:05 just said I've been there man trust me
67:07 but I will see all this - all the time
67:10 you know people saying I seen this movie
67:12 I seen the movie dead of done the
67:16 problem with some of these issues that
67:19 reading solves for you is that the job
67:24 interview ends very quickly when some of
67:27 these catastrophic problems happen you
67:30 want to do a follow-up email with the
67:32 people you just interviewed and you do a
67:34 definitely with an A I definitely like
67:37 the meaning definitely like meaning you
67:39 today I definitely want your job from
67:41 you and they're like oh my god
67:42 what else is wrong in this person's mind
67:45 and there may not be anything I was
67:46 wrong with that person's mind just that
67:48 one word that's misspelled and you know
67:53 in America what's happening is people
67:55 the teachers of schools usually K
67:58 through 12 is where it's really bad the
68:01 amount of teachers that speak in broken
68:04 English and I'm not talking about some
68:06 ghetto I'm talking about you know what
68:10 would be considered you know of your
68:11 middle class upper middle class schools
68:14 have these teachers that can't speak
68:17 English and these poor kids you want to
68:20 blame the kid you want to blame the kids
68:22 parents or whatever I mean you know your
68:23 parents you need to correct your kids
68:25 English but wow I mean we're not putting
68:30 our best foot forward in a lot of
68:32 industries right
68:33 but to finish up on the course subject
68:35 line the book burning
68:39 doesn't need to happen it's happening in
68:43 a digital way the only burned books back
68:47 in the day because the books were the
68:48 only thing that they had to store
68:49 information in now it's all digital
68:52 if books cease to exist and I'm pretty
68:55 sure they are going to cease to exist
68:57 unless there's some sort of like vinyl
68:59 LP you know Renaissance of printed
69:03 material everything's gonna go
69:05 electronic and just like the DVRs they
69:08 could go back and revise books in a case
69:11 in case of technical books that might be
69:13 absolutely fantastic in the case of you
69:16 know I helped publish a book with the
69:17 rock star and we had a we got to come
69:20 out with a second edition because
69:22 someone saw their name in the book and
69:24 threatened to sue us
69:25 after giving us permission to use their
69:27 name and we don't use last names
69:29 anything like that but they said
69:31 basically it was okay to talk about the
69:32 moment then they had a change of heart
69:34 we'd already published the first edition
69:36 so I had to go back and get get rid of
69:38 it
69:39 that would have been nice to say okay I
69:41 click this button and now this lady's
69:43 not mad at me anymore because she's a
69:46 part of this story she isn't gonna be a
69:47 part of and I can guarantee that the
69:49 only people that remember they will ever
69:51 know this of the people that read the
69:52 first edition and remembered in their
69:54 mind you know here's the rub though that
69:58 I want to absolutely close off with okay
69:59 if this is new concept to you at all
70:05 about everything going digital and then
70:07 they can lose history they can revise it
70:09 whatever you know how long do you keep
70:12 an iPad for not that long how long do
70:14 you keep a computer for not that long
70:16 well if the form of which we store
70:18 everything goes from local hard drives
70:20 to cloud technology and you can't afford
70:23 to pay your monthly fee to keep it in
70:24 the cloud then you're gonna have to
70:26 probably give up some data or have it on
70:28 a drive and you're never gonna see it
70:29 again right because the computers that
70:31 are able to read it expire you need to
70:37 understand this what I'm asserting in
70:41 this episode was a meeting that happened
70:43 a long time ago I'm going to CJ
70:47 the meeting about guys do you realize if
70:49 we make everything electronic for kids
70:52 and we get rid of all the books in the
70:54 world and everything goes electronic and
70:56 digital we can control the world man we
70:59 can absolutely erase the fact that
71:02 certain societies ever existed ever ever
71:07 existed
71:08 those pottery pieces from the Greeks
71:11 well that's all anyone known well well I
71:14 have a little fire and those will go
71:16 away right we'll just erase a whole race
71:18 you won't even know who the [ __ ] you are
71:21 right the people that control the planet
71:24 currently have had this conversation
71:27 they know what they're doing that's why
71:30 schools don't have any problem finding
71:31 funding to make this agenda move quickly
71:35 in some cases it is great that a kid
71:38 does not have to carry you know I used
71:41 to have to carry probably I don't know
71:44 eight to ten pounds of books between
71:47 class because I didn't want to go to my
71:48 locker every day now I could have just
71:52 carried a ten inch iPad the tech is
71:55 great I think it's wonderful I hope it
71:58 keeps going we just have to have some
72:01 sort of balance what if private colleges
72:04 have higher academic rates smarter kids
72:09 they get better jobs they seem to
72:11 understand the material better and the
72:13 only difference between that school and
72:14 some state-funded college is that the
72:20 state-funded college gives every kid a
72:21 tablet or says buy your own and then
72:24 this is how you download your book and
72:25 the Upper Ivy League school still has
72:28 printed books what if that was the
72:32 difference what would you do as a
72:38 student would you go get the book would
72:42 you try to really concentrate on your
72:44 iPad to make sure you get it better do
72:47 we pass some sort of policy about
72:51 archiving information in written form I
72:54 don't think you could convince anybody
72:55 to do that
72:58 those of you who love books love books
73:01 just like me you go to a bookstore and
73:03 the smell of all that printed paper it
73:07 brings back memories it you know the one
73:13 thing I get when I go into a bookstore
73:15 is I get this fantasy in my brain and
73:19 I've told my girlfriend this so many
73:20 times she laughs her head off and I say
73:23 wouldn't it be cool to have that
73:26 stopwatch from the Twilight Zone that
73:29 you click it and everything stops and
73:32 you don't age anymore and you can read
73:36 every single book that you want to read
73:39 in that bookstore maybe even the crap
73:40 you don't like just so you can make fun
73:42 of it like a bad movie but all that
73:44 knowledge that's good in there you get
73:47 it in your mind you understand finances
73:50 and law and the good science that's
73:53 undisputable science you get to read all
73:56 those fictional books get to read every
73:57 single book from your favorite author
73:59 all the new-age crap all the philosophy
74:03 that's a routine thought I have in the
74:07 first I don't know 60 seconds when I go
74:09 into really good bookstores just like
74:11 damn wouldn't it be awesome it sucks
74:15 that I only lived so many years right
74:17 for me I still find a book extremely
74:20 endearing and warm and comforting
74:24 there's nothing quite like just laying
74:27 in your bed you get the book on your
74:29 bookshelf or your nightstand or whatever
74:32 and you pick it up and you just get that
74:35 little that little routine where you you
74:37 hold up the page you're not reading with
74:39 your hand cuz you're on your back and
74:41 you read or you lay on your side and you
74:43 read it but your it's your light to look
74:45 at it properly you're trying to have
74:47 your low light in your room but you flip
74:49 through the pages and then you just find
74:50 yourself in a different world for a
74:52 little while doesn't matter what the
74:54 subject is you get tired
74:57 you've been the page over so you know
75:00 where you are and you put it back on
75:02 your nightstand you roll over in your
75:03 brains just like all charged up with
75:05 amazing visions of things maybe it's a
75:09 No Country for Old Men theory right
75:13 we're just gonna be old-fashioned folks
75:16 maybe the folks that used to make mud
75:19 tablets really hated papaya you know was
75:22 gonna go open in papaya you know you can
75:24 lose your old library with a fire there
75:25 Alexander he's like no you know that'll
75:29 never happen
75:30 meanwhile we're still reading Sumerian
75:32 texts and my tablets to this day we're
75:35 still reading hieroglyphs what are your
75:39 feelings about this whole thing
75:40 do you like books do you like electronic
75:43 stuff let me know if you've ever read
75:46 anything on electronic book and had a
75:49 problem remembering it later
75:51 versus picking up a piece of paper if
75:55 you have a solution that keeps both of
75:58 them alive let me know how many years do
76:03 you think it's going to take before we
76:04 lose all books in the world if you
76:07 haven't been go-to deep thoughts
76:08 radio.com for all the fees there's video
76:10 audio lock Facebook group patreon and a
76:13 little store take care of yourself and
76:16 someone else and I'll see in the next
76:18 deep thoughts over
