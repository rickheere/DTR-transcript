00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen this is supposed to be a
00:39 cohiba
00:41 we'll see if it smokes like one so far
00:43 so good
00:44 but it's an early early smoke alexa said
00:47 it was 42 out here
00:49 my phone says it's 46. somewhere in
00:52 there
00:53 today we're going to talk about the
00:54 hutchison effect
00:56 i've mentioned it several times in
00:57 episodes just mentioned it recently one
00:59 of listeners thankfully reminded me
01:01 hey dude you need to do an episode on
01:02 that i'm like oh yeah
01:04 uh cause my buddy bobby blaster says
01:08 idiot directed at me for not doing it
01:11 earlier
01:11 so thank you so much for the the
01:13 suggestion
01:15 so what's interesting about the
01:16 hutcheson effect is
01:18 obviously back in the 80s and 90s when
01:21 he was supposedly doing all these
01:22 experiments and and
01:24 videotaping them with what i guess might
01:27 be
01:27 some of the worst video cameras quality
01:29 on planet earth
01:31 i had no idea this guy existed the rags
01:34 that i read
01:35 i don't remember ever mentioning the guy
01:38 i was reading you know mass products
01:40 like scientific american
01:43 omni magazine that kind of thing
01:44 apparently they've done some specials on
01:46 the guy maybe that's where i saw it once
01:48 i don't remember but i remember seeing
01:50 the videos
01:52 a long time ago so i just did a huge
01:55 dive into this guy
01:58 and there's so much to talk about
02:01 hopefully
02:02 he's an eccentric guy john hutchison
02:07 he was i believe in the general ontario
02:09 area
02:10 initially i think one of the last videos
02:12 i saw where he's being interviewed he
02:14 was in
02:15 uh near the coast of oregon he reminds
02:18 me of like us
02:19 like a science stephen piercy from
02:23 rat and
02:26 because i was very close to that band
02:28 for many many years
02:30 and i know steven at least as an
02:32 acquaintance
02:33 they have very similar mannerisms when
02:35 they speak at least the way he is today
02:37 they kind of have that black hair
02:39 spanish conquistador look you know
02:42 slash maybe some native american blood
02:45 and at least
02:46 piercy it's kind of a gentle soul
02:50 would be interesting to do is get that
02:51 lady who does all the uh
02:53 the body language analysis to analyze
02:57 him during at least this three-part
02:58 interview
03:00 i saw on aag which is i think american
03:04 anti-gravity group or something like
03:05 that so i'm watching these videos and
03:07 then i'm watching i read all the
03:09 critiques about
03:11 what the skeptics think about his videos
03:14 and if you're not familiar with this
03:16 entire thing
03:18 i guess i should recap a man named john
03:22 hutchison
03:23 said that he had created in his little
03:27 laboratory with a bunch of old navy
03:29 equipment which looks great when you
03:31 film it you know if you don't know
03:32 anything about electronics boy it's just
03:34 like a
03:34 set from some sci-fi movie you know but
03:37 he has these videotapes of objects that
03:39 he made levitate
03:41 we're going to go into sort of the
03:44 objects that moved around how they moved
03:45 around
03:46 the skepticism of how he made that
03:48 happen
03:49 but then there's an entire second
03:52 wave of his accomplishments
03:56 if you will that i think is a little bit
03:59 more interesting
04:00 and it seems to gain or seems to hold
04:02 more credibility
04:03 he's got a bunch of hearing off the
04:05 front of my face here
04:07 but he was bending metal with
04:10 electromagnetic
04:11 waves uh to make it easy for everyone to
04:14 understand
04:14 and that's most likely a generalization
04:17 that is still accurate whether or not
04:19 you
04:20 think it's down to a piezo effect or
04:22 some other effect
04:23 the hutch is in effect and this metal
04:28 which i just saw a funny funny video
04:32 claiming to have a a solid iron
04:36 bar do this effect but he has all of
04:39 this
04:40 aluminum and various metals that he has
04:45 tormented with electricity in such a way
04:48 that it ruptured
04:49 it melted it twisted apart and i'm not
04:52 sure why everyone's so blown away by
04:54 this
04:55 but that has a whole separate wave of
04:58 pieces of evidence now
05:01 here's what you got to understand this
05:03 guy
05:05 supposedly calls a guy to help him film
05:07 things
05:08 while he's running the equipment you
05:09 know and supposedly that guy
05:11 has come out and said man if you don't
05:13 believe it's real then uh you're stupid
05:16 i was there and it was real okay
05:20 in terms of and this guy's supposed to
05:22 be a national geographic
05:24 uh like certified cameraman
05:28 and having filmed professionally myself
05:31 i've filmed like
05:33 sporting events i've filmed concerts
05:35 i've done
05:36 music videos where i'm the cameraman
05:40 if this guy was a professional cameraman
05:42 then he utterly and completely blew
05:46 anything and i think what's going on is
05:48 he's involved with the conspiracy on the
05:49 first
05:50 set of the videos and so he's defending
05:52 it with these
05:54 sort of statements of you know you're
05:56 dumb if you don't believe it
05:58 john hutchinson has never ever ever been
06:00 able to recreate
06:02 his levitation experiments which is the
06:04 first wave in the first claim
06:07 what you will see is
06:11 vice grips or not vice grips
06:14 like the adjustable wrench fly off this
06:18 wooden plank you will see
06:21 a saw like an old handsaw
06:24 you will see a cup of water you will see
06:28 plastic pieces of stuff i mean you know
06:30 it's just
06:32 later i believe in 1991
06:35 because he's been unable to ever
06:36 recreate this which we're going to go
06:38 back and analyze what that really means
06:41 because it makes no sense
06:44 makes no sense he
06:48 shot a video of a little round thing
06:49 looked like a flying saucer
06:51 like an old 50s flying saucer on his
06:52 desk
06:54 jumping up and down on the desk
06:57 apparently this is one he filmed by
06:58 himself
06:59 because everyone eventually said oh man
07:01 i can see the wires
07:03 at one point he lied about the wires and
07:05 then finally he came clean and said yeah
07:07 i faked that one i used wires
07:11 but the other ones are real and i can't
07:13 recreate it
07:15 okay when you look at his experiments
07:20 with all of the trickery we know now all
07:22 the special effects we know now
07:25 i'm going to tell you if you quickly pay
07:26 attention to a lot of these
07:28 situations it looks like in many cases
07:33 there's a single wire same technique
07:35 used on the ufo thing
07:37 that he is pulling objects up with the
07:40 wire
07:41 now he's been accused of attaching an
07:43 electromagnet
07:45 like the big kind that they used at
07:47 salvage yards to pick up cars and move
07:48 them around
07:49 but he's got a smaller one over his
07:52 experiment
07:53 area which is a wooden box and you have
07:54 to have a wooden box because that way
07:56 the box itself won't move when this
07:59 thing turns on
08:01 or at least it won't interfere and that
08:02 sort of thing but they think
08:05 some of the objects that flew up were
08:07 being yanked up by
08:08 a magnet now there i did see one
08:12 video where the adjustable wrench i
08:14 still need to slow it down but it looks
08:16 almost like it does some 360s
08:19 full 360s which would negate any type of
08:21 string
08:22 but most everything has the point where
08:24 the string is attached
08:26 or strings attached and you will see it
08:29 pull from the string now
08:34 if you had a hutchison effect i'm
08:36 assuming
08:37 and it's making something levitate
08:40 there's a whole bunch of requirements
08:42 with that
08:43 you could grab a piece of the steel with
08:45 this
08:46 pulse that you're generating and of
08:48 course he had to test the coils and
08:51 things that look amazing right it's just
08:53 like having a jacob's ladder and some
08:54 old
08:55 movie to look scientific in the
08:57 background
09:00 there's none of his lab equipment in
09:02 these videos while he's doing this stuff
09:05 god there's so much so many angles here
09:08 if the wave was big enough to grab the
09:10 adjustable wrench for instance it
09:12 wouldn't do any
09:13 flipping necessarily why would it flip i
09:15 mean it's sort of a strange thing
09:18 if it is losing its ethereal permea or
09:21 it's increasing it's ethereal perma
09:23 permeability ooh easy for me to say then
09:26 the ether goes through the wrench and
09:28 the ether that was pushing on it starts
09:30 to
09:32 relax and then it levitates it should
09:35 just levitate even if it's going to fly
09:37 off the screen
09:39 but the idea that it's flying off the
09:41 screen means that
09:43 as a cameraman especially oh how far did
09:45 it go up in the air this is like a
09:47 device that if i hit you on the hip with
09:48 it you're going to die
09:50 and there's someone filming it
09:51 supposedly and no one's like oh my god
09:53 it went through the roof or bumped the
09:55 ceiling let's take a picture of that
09:57 nope because there's either a magnet or
10:00 a marionette string system above it
10:02 they don't ever pan the camera up they
10:04 don't ever film the entire environment
10:07 and this guy can't recreate it since so
10:10 where do we have moments in life where
10:11 we
10:12 do something special and we can't
10:15 recreate it
10:16 because i want to annihilate that
10:18 sensibility right away
10:21 well a couple things that are
10:24 legit things that you accidentally do
10:26 that you can't do again
10:29 makes sense to me you are messing around
10:31 in the kitchen
10:33 you were not videotaping yourself you're
10:35 throwing a little bit of salt a little
10:36 bit of sugar a little bit of this a
10:37 little bit of that
10:39 and you're not remembering how much you
10:40 did but whatever you created is the best
10:42 casserole best
10:43 pastry in the world whatever it is and
10:46 the family goes oh my god please make
10:48 that again
10:48 and you're like oh gosh i'm gonna try
10:51 next time i'll start paying attention to
10:52 how much i threw in
10:54 your best bet even though you might be
10:56 full in your stomach
10:58 would be to go back in the kitchen
10:59 immediately and before you forget
11:01 and try to just say everybody go away go
11:03 away don't bother me don't talk to me in
11:05 fact leave the house if you can go to
11:06 your bedrooms
11:07 and then you try to recreate that thing
11:10 the other one might be a situation where
11:12 you're mixing
11:14 paint and again you the quantities are
11:17 a little bit of this a little bit of
11:18 that maybe if you're painting an oil
11:20 painting or acrylic painting
11:21 it can get you don't know what you did
11:24 that's why my buddy said me would always
11:26 mix all of his colors
11:28 to the quantity that he needed once he
11:30 determined
11:31 the colors that he wanted and he kept
11:34 him in these little
11:35 little sauce things you get at
11:37 restaurants
11:38 and he never had a mix again and that
11:41 way he knew the color he mixed was the
11:43 one you were going to see forever
11:45 good deal but now
11:49 we're at a scientific laboratory and
11:51 regardless if this guy
11:54 doesn't know mathematics at all which i
11:56 i
11:57 actually have no problem with that
11:58 whatsoever but he has somehow twisted
12:00 knobs
12:01 and and somehow directed an energy beam
12:04 at these objects and that's one thing i
12:06 didn't see filmed
12:08 what is creating this field you will
12:10 read stuff that
12:12 for people that apparently don't know
12:13 anything about science like he owns
12:15 tesla
12:16 so the testicles it's like okay film it
12:18 mr national geographic professional
12:20 photographer
12:22 film it don't just tell me i'm stupid
12:24 because i'm
12:25 looking at observable reality it looks
12:27 like a really bad
12:29 attempt at a magic trick by some you
12:31 know
12:32 middle school kid but once you get an
12:35 indication
12:36 and you get an effect to occur guess
12:39 what you do
12:40 especially if you don't know what the
12:41 hell you're doing you don't touch any of
12:43 the knobs after that
12:45 you stop if you don't have a camera
12:49 because everything was 35 millimeter
12:50 take it down a photo mat wait a week to
12:52 get it done
12:53 fine you should have that you should
12:56 just go and buy one if you have this
12:58 amazing never before seen thing
13:02 but at a minimum you get a pattern paper
13:05 out every single
13:06 knob that is participating in this event
13:09 if a machine has power and it's a part
13:11 of this effect
13:13 you transcribe button that's a three
13:16 this other button that's a four this
13:18 one's on 11 whatever it is and you write
13:20 it down so that you can do it again
13:23 you would not just well would so we're
13:26 done you know let's just
13:27 rewind all the buttons and mess
13:29 everything up and go to bed
13:32 i don't think anyone is that stupid
13:36 anyone and i don't think that john
13:39 hutchinson is that stupid
13:40 so i therefore think that at least in
13:42 this particular realm
13:44 of levitation it's a hoax
13:47 a hundred percent was it honda p
13:52 now what's interesting about the whole
13:53 thing is you might think i'm like i'm
13:55 ready to
13:57 dismiss this guy and uh call him a kook
14:00 and all that kind of stuff
14:02 he's a very eccentric guy he comes off
14:04 as a very gentle soul everybody's ever
14:06 talked to the guy who said he's just the
14:07 sweetest guy ever
14:09 and so we know charlatans charlatans uh
14:12 typically are people that are very
14:14 gregarious and very egotistical
14:17 this guy does not appear to me to be
14:20 like that i just watched a 2015
14:21 interview with the aeg
14:23 but i think when i look at his body
14:25 language in the aag
14:27 video the american anti-gravity group or
14:29 whatever it is
14:30 he's interested to tell his story but at
14:32 the same time there's pain on his face
14:35 of like oh crap i gotta lie again
14:38 but there's a second tier of it which is
14:40 this metal which is going to clean up
14:41 a little bit of his credibility in my
14:43 opinion
14:45 now the one of the claims is that people
14:48 who have visited him and this is on
14:49 video
14:50 he is rummaging through a box and
14:53 there's just a tremendous amount of
14:54 correspondence with
14:55 official groups like nasa the navy los
14:58 alamos labs
15:02 well you know if you created a fairly
15:04 convincing video in the 80s
15:05 and the early 90s monisher admitted fake
15:10 yeah you can get a lot of people talking
15:12 to you whether or not anything
15:13 materializes
15:14 is a completely different thing
15:18 but someone suggested if you think he's
15:20 a fake
15:21 then you haven't looked at his box of
15:23 correspondence with these
15:24 groups well if you know nothing about
15:26 mathematics how much could you
15:28 correspond with professionals that live
15:29 through mathematics to get these things
15:31 done
15:32 if you can't recreate it then wow
15:35 i mean there's a whole bunch of mental
15:38 issues with not being able to remotely
15:40 get close to what you did
15:41 means you had no clue what you were
15:43 doing it was just an accident
15:45 and so on and so forth there's this dude
15:48 hathaway who wrote a book on him
15:51 who apparently was really excited about
15:53 turning him into a profit margin
15:55 he has the hathaway research institute
15:57 which is very fascinating
15:58 claims he does work for nasa and darpa
16:02 and let me tell you if you do work for
16:03 darpa for real you're not just putting
16:05 the logo on your website
16:07 then you're no dummy he wrote the book
16:10 about
16:12 hutcheson and apparently didn't
16:15 dispute much of what he claimed but
16:18 today
16:19 he now says the guy is insane and a
16:22 quack and all that kind of stuff
16:24 strange how those those opinions change
16:28 there was a claim that hathaway actually
16:30 contacted john to work for his research
16:33 institute and he turned it down
16:35 and apparently the claim is that after
16:37 that
16:38 reluctance to work for the hathaway
16:40 research institute which i don't know if
16:41 any that's true okay
16:44 i can't see how john would resist a big
16:47 fat paycheck because he seems to live in
16:48 you know 500 square foot homes
16:51 apartments and
16:52 he likes to buy things and you know come
16:54 on let's document this
16:56 in the end if you wanted to recreate the
16:59 hutchison experiment
17:01 there's an interesting correlation here
17:04 i think i told you guys in a previous
17:05 episode about
17:06 a dude who faked the score on the
17:10 atari 2600 i think which is a drag race
17:13 game he lied about his score
17:15 and he got a job testing games running
17:18 around being a representative at
17:20 conferences at computer electronics
17:23 conferences and that kind of thing
17:25 all based on this lie but in the 21st
17:28 century
17:29 programmers got into the source code of
17:31 that video game
17:32 the drag race video game and made the
17:34 computer play a computer
17:37 at maximum efficiency with every
17:39 conceivable strategy to play the game
17:41 and they found out that that score he
17:43 claimed
17:44 like an 83 or something was impossible
17:47 to get
17:49 the dude still holds true to this day
17:51 and all he does is say well you weren't
17:52 there
17:54 okay with that line of thinking the
17:57 reason why i bring that up is
17:58 let's just say the government was
18:01 interested in this
18:02 and i said okay mr hutchinson please
18:05 tell me all of the equipment that you
18:06 had powered on during this experiment
18:09 what's the model number and year of all
18:11 the equipment that you have because
18:12 we'll go find copies or we'll buy your
18:14 equipment off of you
18:16 or we'll take it on loan or whatever but
18:17 believe me the government can get
18:18 anything they want
18:20 they then could write a piece of
18:23 software
18:24 to adjust every single conceivable dial
18:28 that was involved in this experiment
18:30 until one day
18:31 with the video camera on it or some
18:32 other ai detecting whether or not this
18:34 thing happened i mean if something
18:36 levitates well then you don't have a
18:37 contact point between its base and the
18:39 object itself
18:40 and he could just send somebody a text
18:43 message and go
18:44 got it come on back that's not occurring
18:49 so for him not to be able to recreate it
18:51 for me again is
18:53 a thousand percent proof he never did it
18:56 no one changes the variables on
18:58 something that just did
19:00 an ungodly thing an amazing thing and i
19:02 just mean as a figure of speech it's
19:04 probably very godly
19:06 i also read an article that
19:10 and i had forgotten this i had seen the
19:12 judy wood presentation about directed
19:14 energy weapons involved with that one
19:16 day
19:16 back 19 years ago this is 2020.
19:21 and she had i guess apparently they're
19:23 claiming that she referenced his
19:26 experiments i don't see how
19:30 the levitation experiments have anything
19:31 to do with it
19:33 but i do see how the metallurgy stuff
19:34 that he did later on
19:36 would definitely do it now the thing is
19:38 is he's being interviewed
19:40 he's showing off all these medals which
19:44 i'm going to reintroduce
19:45 that it undergone massive
19:47 transformations and apparently been said
19:49 all around the world
19:50 although he just says it was sent to
19:52 germany
19:54 okay where in germany man your buddy
19:57 hunter or auto or i mean like where is
20:00 it is it in some
20:02 you know well-established laboratory
20:04 that's known for doing like the other
20:06 nasa over there i mean
20:07 tell me where is this thing going don't
20:08 just say this is a product that he used
20:10 in europe that's why you should buy it
20:12 you know it's like
20:13 there's so much marketing if you're in
20:14 europe you understand there's so much
20:16 snake oil sold in the united states and
20:19 the marketing
20:20 is as used in europe
20:23 you know it's like whatever
20:27 so if you're not familiar with this
20:28 second half of what he
20:30 was able to accomplish it looks
20:34 he would take various metals
20:38 from copper to aluminum to iron steel
20:42 hot steel and he was able to
20:45 exert some force on it using electricity
20:48 apparently and as one might
20:52 assume especially if you're an ethereal
20:54 scientist
20:56 he disturbed the very molecular forces
20:58 within these
21:02 pieces of steel and got them to do all
21:05 kinds of wild random things almost like
21:07 a mandelbrot explosion
21:09 inside that one seems like it makes
21:14 a lot of sense and again i watched other
21:16 videos of other people doing it another
21:17 the funny one i watched was a guy that
21:20 supposedly
21:21 i mean you watch the video he's filming
21:23 a
21:24 black iron two by two square
21:28 and he gets it to eventually
21:31 start wiggling and torque and turn
21:36 and it's like a little smoke coming off
21:38 of it and then he gets in real close to
21:40 it
21:41 and he films it and it looks like it's
21:44 something else maybe painted black or
21:48 maybe some iron paint on it i don't know
21:49 what it is but the one thing the dude
21:51 never did was tap it with a hard object
21:53 so you could hear that it was actually
21:55 iron and not some other thing
21:58 very funny very funny do like a double
22:00 helix
22:01 spin on this thing could be real but
22:04 come on
22:05 tap it let me know this thing is really
22:08 at least a metal now
22:11 we talked about in many episodes
22:14 especially the coral castle episode
22:16 right
22:17 limestone could be made fairly
22:20 weightless
22:21 thus making building pyramids and the
22:23 coral castle
22:25 extremely possible and you have to
22:28 understand the coral
22:29 that's in coral castle is actually a
22:30 limestone derivative
22:32 so this works on both those types of
22:34 rocks
22:35 could also work on granite and the
22:39 theory i suggested in the video
22:41 is pretty much exactly what is being
22:44 inferred
22:46 with this hutchison metal
22:49 distortion algorithm that's being run on
22:52 the metal
22:54 which is the following if you can attach
22:58 an electrode to one end of a stone and
23:01 then electrode at the other end of the
23:03 stone
23:04 and then pump a sufficient amount of
23:06 electricity at a particular frequency
23:09 and i'm going to make it a little more
23:11 romantic and suggest that perhaps
23:13 they're using
23:15 a sacred geometry
23:18 type frequency very much like the
23:22 the cymatics stuff that you've seen with
23:25 sand on speakers
23:27 there's a gigantic series of
23:31 youtube videos on the
23:34 coral castle wheel
23:38 and the magnets that are all amazingly
23:41 create i mean this wheel that looks
23:43 awful and old and rusted
23:45 if you just study its composition and
23:47 it's in its
23:49 function and the crank wheel
23:53 there's a prime number
23:56 algorithm in that wheel that is
23:58 phenomenal
23:59 and this dude does this i mean it must
24:01 be 15 hours i had to watch it over
24:04 several days back in i think 2013
24:07 when i was coding a different project in
24:09 my house there's all kinds of masonic
24:13 relations to this prime number it's a
24:16 quadratic prime number
24:18 equation we get four prime numbers to go
24:20 in a row i mean it's just
24:22 it's a very amazing thing but if you
24:25 could resonate and what you're trying to
24:27 do is get an electromagnetic field to
24:29 crawl
24:30 within the fabric of whatever you're
24:32 working with to achieve the true
24:34 hutchinson effect
24:36 which is to then convince the atoms
24:39 within
24:41 the limestone which may be very
24:42 susceptible to this that other things
24:44 aren't
24:45 which is why we don't have potentially
24:47 basalt
24:49 pyramids you know i mean it may not be
24:52 capable of of having this issue work
24:55 but you're allowing again ethereal winds
24:57 which are
24:58 the true culprits of gravity pushing
25:01 down on us
25:02 to have much of it pass directly through
25:08 the stone itself by aligning the atoms
25:10 and keeping them from vibrating as much
25:12 by controlling them with other ethereal
25:14 winds
25:16 dictated by the electricity that's going
25:18 through it
25:19 for any of you are familiar with how an
25:20 led crystal
25:22 sorry liquid crystal display works
25:25 an lcd it's a bunch of swimming fibers
25:30 that when swimming around it's typically
25:33 the background
25:35 which is when you look at a digital
25:36 watch back from the 70s and 80s
25:38 you would have a non-black area that was
25:43 sort of them not elect not electrified
25:45 but when you electrified them
25:47 you take these little shards and you
25:49 line them up perfectly
25:51 up and down and so when you look down
25:53 into the watch the black that you're
25:55 seeing is actually
25:56 a black paint below the swimming
25:59 crystals so you're lining them up and
26:01 down
26:02 any of you studies semiconductors
26:06 and you guys have seen that mobius strip
26:08 with the quantum locking
26:10 where they put the little puck on a
26:11 mobius strip and then it
26:13 guy pushes it and it floats around the
26:15 mobius strip
26:16 and you know infinitely with almost you
26:18 know zero friction it goes forever
26:20 it goes a long time quantum locking is
26:24 another way of enforce
26:25 enforcing the matter
26:28 within this little region you have to
26:31 cool the conductor down
26:32 put some electricity on it and you get
26:34 this locking
26:36 these are all clues these are all
26:37 stepping stones into
26:40 anti-gravity which is why again
26:43 very high up government officials have
26:45 always told my buddy sid mead
26:47 that anti-gravity was completely
26:50 completely figured out in the mid 90s
26:53 and that uh today it's just very
26:57 simple to create don't know if that's
26:59 true
27:00 but these dudes were the guys running
27:02 the programs not just
27:04 workers inside and i don't know who
27:07 those people are to be honest but
27:09 still always very casually tell me about
27:10 the last visit and oh yeah well you know
27:12 they said they had this you know
27:13 spinning mercury was way back in the 60s
27:15 and
27:16 and various other techniques but never
27:19 the last time the dude visited said
27:21 whatever technique he explained to said
27:22 was so
27:25 uh i don't know abstract or what have
27:27 you said didn't follow it
27:28 very well so when he told me kind of
27:30 generally what the guy said
27:33 it didn't make any sense to me maybe it
27:35 totally made sense to what actually
27:37 happened i just lacked the
27:39 ability to understand it but that would
27:40 be a surprise to me
27:43 not to be arrogant but just it's
27:44 something i've looked into a lot
27:47 now what's interesting about the
27:48 metallurgy stuff the twisting of the
27:50 metal
27:52 is that you have at least the one i saw
27:56 and the in the way that he describes it
27:57 he doesn't describe
27:59 the setup of the experiment and maybe
28:02 this dude lacks
28:03 just the most fundamental understanding
28:07 of scientific principles
28:08 for conducting experiments having your
28:11 control
28:12 and other notation about what
28:15 instruments are involved
28:17 what's the setup get a pen and paper and
28:20 just draw little lines going this was
28:22 attached to this
28:24 and these buttons and knobs on my
28:26 equipment
28:28 were set to these things
28:32 it would seem that in every single video
28:34 i've ever seen with this guy interviewed
28:36 in the modern day
28:38 he does not do what every single
28:40 scientist i've ever seen
28:43 eric dollard for instance would never
28:46 let anyone contest
28:47 his i think it was uh badlands
28:52 videos in the 80s because the dude would
28:54 just say okay give me 10 grand and i'll
28:56 build that right in front of your face
28:58 and then we'll just get this over with
28:59 he would prove it to you right in your
29:00 face
29:03 now john hutchinson he seems to be
29:05 completely content with having all of
29:06 his
29:07 accomplishments done when no one else is
29:10 around
29:10 never remembers how it works and then
29:13 showing you
29:15 what he can show you in the modern day
29:18 seems really strange
29:20 but then i did an episode on directed
29:21 energy weapons
29:23 this not terribly difficult to believe
29:25 in directed energy weapons and again i
29:27 have a friend of mine
29:29 who i think i trust he was working for a
29:32 water purification company in arizona
29:34 and so he had a lot of hardware
29:36 available to him and he said that he was
29:38 able to use the uh
29:40 you know the pot steel that paperclips
29:41 were made out of
29:43 which isn't a tear it was it which is
29:45 not a terribly
29:46 you know stern metal and he was able to
29:51 put them on a some sort of oscillator or
29:54 something
29:55 that was projecting electricity into the
29:58 paper clip and he said he could get
30:00 get them to vaporize just out of sight
30:03 in a couple seconds
30:04 just it just kind of get hot and go go
30:06 away the
30:08 claim about this metallurgy experiment
30:11 phase of his discoveries
30:14 is that these metals do everything that
30:17 they do without ever getting hot
30:20 even the dude who supposedly
30:23 turned this this i guess wrought iron
30:26 two by two
30:27 dowel it's like square
30:31 even though it smoked a little bit he
30:33 said that
30:34 there was no heat and you don't see any
30:36 heat you don't see it
30:38 glow have any of you've ever taken a
30:40 piece of metal and you
30:42 it's kind of you know malleable you can
30:44 bend it and you've been a been a bit and
30:45 you touch the
30:46 bending point and it burns your finger
30:49 because the friction is there
30:50 same thing when you rub your hands
30:51 together when you're cold
30:53 i've just seen so many scientific
30:56 presentations and so many interviews
30:58 with individuals
31:01 who have figured out how to do something
31:03 especially when i did all my quantum
31:04 computing research for that episode i
31:06 did
31:07 i believe last season you would have
31:10 these guys in a laboratory showing you
31:12 how
31:13 i think like phosphorus and these other
31:16 elements were being stabilized you know
31:19 atoms being stabilized
31:21 to an extent they could make them into a
31:23 cubit
31:24 and there's plenty of experimentation
31:27 they'll show it to you
31:29 now i just want to mention this very
31:30 briefly i think it's part of the factor
31:34 in this sort of thing when you think
31:37 that you
31:37 are sensing a hoax
31:40 okay there is a certain type of
31:43 personality that wants to do a hoax
31:46 and there's different degrees of it
31:48 there's those that want to run around
31:50 and really be in the press they really
31:53 really want to
31:54 be interviewed a lot and what have you
31:56 even though john has done a lot of
31:58 interviews
31:59 it doesn't seem like that's his game it
32:02 could be
32:03 wow i faked a bunch of crap and look i
32:05 got a bunch of attention
32:06 so i don't really want to get caught up
32:08 in conversations i can't
32:11 articulate back never bothered einstein
32:14 he would just run out and
32:16 do conferences on his photoelectric
32:18 effect not knowing how it worked i mean
32:19 you know
32:20 so some dudes don't care i think this
32:22 guy is trying to protect himself but he
32:24 knows he has to make an income
32:26 now he has really long black hair last
32:29 interview i just saw with him
32:31 i saw a 2010 2015 one and then
32:35 we got a cap like mine on again he just
32:38 seems like a gentleman
32:39 so i don't mean to cast aspersions on
32:41 the guy whatsoever
32:43 other than maybe you know he was trying
32:46 to do something profound and found out
32:48 that hey trickery is probably
32:50 the easiest way he can validate himself
32:53 but he was wearing like a woman's wig
32:56 there's a lot of pictures of him wearing
32:58 wigs and at first i thought it was
32:59 someone that was messing with
33:01 thumbnail just to get you to click in
33:04 and then i just saw a whole interview
33:05 where he's sitting down and
33:07 he's in a big red shirt which i wasn't
33:09 sure if that was a dress or a shirt but
33:12 so there's something going on there
33:16 there's a vanity going on there's sort
33:19 of one of these things that
33:20 you know if you walk out in public as a
33:22 man wearing a
33:24 straight black or brown wig
33:27 on fashion like a woman
33:30 that if you aren't like wendy carlos it
33:32 may not make any sense you know
33:35 so god bless the guy he's doing what he
33:36 wants to do with his life and i support
33:38 him 100 percent
33:40 but there looks like there might be some
33:43 other factors
33:44 psychologically that might
33:47 play a role in this conversation i just
33:50 want to put that out there just in case
33:51 you know about that and you're like geez
33:53 i wonder why he's not talking about that
33:54 thing
33:55 because that's a blue for me you know
33:57 but the principle is
33:59 levitation i think is 100
34:02 capable with the technique
34:06 in general that he's talking about which
34:08 is to
34:09 infect anything
34:13 that can absorb electrons or at least
34:16 have electrons even pass through it
34:18 could be wood
34:19 wood's not a conductive material it's
34:21 very dense
34:23 but you can move electrons through wood
34:26 and so if you could just simply convince
34:28 the atoms in the wood
34:30 to stack up in a more aligned fashion
34:32 not cease to be but stack up an aligned
34:35 fashion
34:36 ether will start passing through it just
34:38 like
34:39 light passing through a liquid crystal
34:42 so you can see the background
34:44 instead of seeing the background what
34:46 ends up happening is the ether passes
34:47 through the object and hits the earth's
34:49 surface or whatever's below it
34:50 thus making it levitate the other thing
34:53 about the
34:54 objects flying up in his videos is i
34:57 never saw them come down
35:00 so that is just
35:03 categorically ridiculous he would have
35:05 to have
35:06 he mean two things would have one of two
35:08 things would have occurred
35:10 the objects would have gone through his
35:11 ceiling
35:13 literally like gaining almost infinite
35:15 velocity and just jamming through his
35:17 ceiling they could have vaporized
35:19 like his metals and plastics with water
35:22 in them and that kind of stuff
35:23 i mean you would have water splattering
35:25 all over the place wouldn't you
35:27 if the adjustable wrench is doing full
35:30 360s before it goes up
35:32 it could be the string is wrapped around
35:34 it or something oops you know
35:35 it looks great so let's just put it out
35:37 there but if the cup did a 360 then all
35:40 the water would have been on the
35:41 on the table top on the plywood
35:45 no such thing occurred and again the
35:48 guy's got a video camera
35:50 so i talked about the 35 millimeter
35:52 solution of just taking pictures of all
35:53 your equipment
35:55 any of you've ever taken apart a piece
35:57 of
35:58 electronics and you forgot to write down
36:01 what you were doing or take photographs
36:03 you know it's very difficult to put the
36:05 thing back together unless you have a
36:06 really good memory
36:07 but let me tell you when i took apart
36:10 the computer i'm looking at right now
36:11 with the sound wave going across
36:15 uh i i lost some screws
36:18 don't know where they are i also found
36:21 out a bunch of screws fell out of the
36:22 computer
36:23 over the time i was having it so that's
36:25 a bad thing so i need to get a little
36:27 five dollar pack of screws to fix it but
36:30 you should be taking pictures along the
36:32 way
36:33 he had a video camera there so after
36:36 it's all over
36:37 after the abysmal photography of these
36:39 events
36:40 zoom so far in that you don't have the
36:42 whole environment
36:44 documented which is part of the hoax i'm
36:46 just going to tell you
36:47 part of the hoax you'd pull back the
36:50 camera
36:51 show where everything went again it's
36:52 just vanishing up in the sky
36:54 it never comes back down what goes up
36:56 must come down you know
36:58 unless you're launching it into space
37:01 but you film all the equipment wouldn't
37:03 you go look at
37:04 eric dollars badlands 1986-87
37:09 videos and he is meticulously
37:12 documenting
37:13 almost to like an annoying level which
37:15 is me
37:16 being playful there all of the factors
37:19 when he was proving that a longitudinal
37:21 wave can move through electronic
37:23 circuits 11 times the speed of light
37:24 he's showing you all the measurement
37:26 equipment that he's using
37:27 proving that there's no hoax going on
37:29 here and he conducts the transverse wave
37:31 experiment first
37:32 which is 0.8 the speed of light
37:36 he shows it to you but now to his credit
37:39 he's on to something he may be a
37:42 complete hoax with this particular
37:45 result but his hunch
37:48 is obviously correct if one can
37:53 oscillate a particular object properly
37:56 or create a field
37:57 around it or above it that either
37:59 redirects ethereal winds that would
38:01 normally hit the object and you just put
38:02 a barrier over this pine box
38:06 everything that's down there is going to
38:07 fly up not just the one object unless
38:09 you're strategically moving it
38:11 over various objects making them fly now
38:13 they will
38:14 as soon as you reduce your wave they
38:15 will come back down and hit the board
38:18 another guy created a uh
38:21 a video claiming to have done this
38:23 hutchinson effect and again what's funny
38:25 about it is the whole world's waiting
38:26 for that effect to happen again this guy
38:28 put out like a minute 26 second video
38:31 where he's doing all kinds of things and
38:33 if you truly pay attention
38:35 he's cutting the camera because he is
38:39 dropping things on this piece of plywood
38:42 and then running the camera backwards
38:44 i'll see if i can't find it and then run
38:46 it the other way i think it'll be pretty
38:47 damn funny
38:49 so there's hoesters around the hosters
38:52 but now let's let's just say for a
38:53 second or two
38:56 this guy did this hoax and the
38:59 government
39:00 figured it out and they're like you know
39:03 what this is actually
39:04 uh it's either we can walk away from
39:07 this because it's completely harmless
39:09 and whatever
39:09 he's done he's dug his own grave and
39:11 we'll see if he buries himself in it or
39:13 whatever
39:15 but maybe i mean this is me being
39:16 cynical but geez
39:18 could you be too cynical about
39:19 government i don't think so
39:22 but you sensationalize the guy
39:26 you call the press you say get on this
39:28 dude run him all the way up the flagpole
39:31 oh oh really why should we do that i
39:33 mean is it real
39:34 no it's totally fake run up the flagpole
39:36 they don't have to even tell the press
39:38 that they can tell the press yeah we
39:39 think he might be onto something
39:40 okay and they want to do the story
39:44 what's that do it runs up a hoax
39:48 runs a hoax up the flagpole thus
39:52 further extinguishing the
39:56 entire avenue of research because
39:59 someone says hey dad let's get a bunch
40:01 of equipment and try the hutchinson
40:02 effect dad goes and that guy is a hoax
40:05 he talked about it when his fake ufo
40:07 thing and he's not been able to recreate
40:08 it so it's not even go down that
40:10 path now i think the opposites actually
40:14 occurred in terms of people
40:15 attempting it but you have no empirical
40:17 data
40:19 because the guy is not remotely
40:20 professional about any of his
40:22 experiments
40:23 i guess he just wakes up puts a
40:24 blindfold on and starts flipping knobs
40:26 and waiting for something to make a ding
40:27 on the ceiling
40:30 now the hathaway guy from hathaway
40:33 research
40:35 institute he recently
40:39 and part of his kind of reversal
40:42 and opinions he's now saying that he
40:45 thought that
40:48 this experiment was done with psychic
40:51 powers
40:52 and that john has a capability of
40:55 channeling
40:56 i guess the universe's fabric ethereal
40:58 winds with his mind
41:00 and that that's how these experiments
41:02 occurred i mean come on come on come on
41:06 now they're taking a big crap on your
41:08 ability to do that
41:09 and so people listen to that explanation
41:11 you're like
41:12 seriously in that interview
41:16 or in that admission on one of the
41:18 videos
41:19 which was the best one i ever saw in
41:21 terms of being well documented a guy
41:22 talking over what we're seeing
41:25 he said that other people were able to
41:28 recreate the metallurgy experiments
41:31 because apparently they're saying that
41:33 hathaway is saying that everything he
41:35 did from levitation to metallurgy
41:37 metallurgy uh twisting and turning and
41:40 and having basically the energy weapon
41:43 results on this thing was all telepathic
41:46 and so he said well if john wasn't there
41:48 then how did these other people recreate
41:52 this particular
41:53 part of his experiment well obviously
41:56 because that's not it
41:58 and what a weird thing to say without
42:01 some
42:02 sort of backup case studies
42:06 remember the skeptic society right if
42:08 you can do anything that's supernatural
42:10 anything that's got a paranormal
42:12 capability or anything reading someone's
42:14 mind anything
42:16 they're willing to give you a million
42:17 bucks
42:19 all right well go get yourself some
42:21 investment capital
42:23 if you're going to be able to do this
42:24 with psychic capabilities you know
42:27 now to loop back on judy wood
42:31 her contention and she has like three
42:33 phds in all relative sciences
42:36 she did a three and a half hour
42:37 presentation based on that day
42:40 in 2001 where she
42:44 uh asserts quite convincingly
42:48 that weapons from space or at least from
42:50 high-flying aircraft i think it would
42:52 have to be space
42:53 because it needs to be very stationary
42:56 unless it's
42:56 extremely instantaneous thing plus a
42:59 flying aircraft
43:00 coming up with that much power would be
43:02 tapping into something that we don't
43:04 know about in the
43:06 public sector which is not a big
43:08 surprise but
43:10 she demonstrated with with pictures of
43:12 ground zero
43:14 these round cookie cutter shapes that
43:17 were
43:18 pulverizing everything in that area of
43:20 course the towers are gone
43:22 but some of the other buildings down the
43:25 bottom had
43:26 impossible cuts with like a round cookie
43:29 cutter like three buildings together and
43:31 you know
43:32 the cookie cutter slices through all of
43:33 them in a perfect round circle
43:35 not to be confused with the
43:39 the little uh ground movers that work in
43:43 a circle
43:44 because those are starting to happen on
43:45 the outer edge as they're picking up all
43:47 the debris
43:47 that creates a circle deprivation of
43:49 debris has nothing to do with what she's
43:51 talking about
43:52 and she made that clear we know that
43:55 paradise california we saw
43:57 other events or other recreations of
44:01 events that happened on that day in 2001
44:05 where car parts were melting but other
44:07 car parts weren't melting
44:10 we saw again houses burned ash
44:13 we saw houses burned to ash that are out
44:16 in the woods
44:17 that have trees all around them and just
44:20 a little road going up to the house like
44:22 someone's got a real nice pad out in the
44:24 middle of nowhere
44:25 literally no neighbors no nothing it's
44:27 just a clearing in a circle and there's
44:29 a house in the center
44:30 and it was burned to ash but no flames
44:34 burned any of the trees around the
44:36 around the home i mean they're all lush
44:37 and green and perfect the road
44:40 how's the road going to carry a fire i
44:41 mean give me a break someone hit this
44:43 thing
44:44 with a beam and burned it to the ground
44:47 like to the ground
44:48 gone you have tons of homes that are
44:51 burned to ash but the
44:53 foliage around the the uh home is still
44:55 alive and well
44:57 and green the shrub the shrubbery right
45:01 maybe they chopped them down with a
45:02 herring i don't know
45:04 but donald rumsfeld said you know in the
45:07 weeks after
45:08 that event do we have directed energy
45:11 weapons and
45:12 he looks to the general and i i kind of
45:15 have a
45:16 suspicion the answer means one of two
45:17 things he said oh yeah we have them but
45:19 we're not going to use them until we
45:20 need them
45:22 now donald rumsfeld is a very very
45:24 brilliant human being
45:26 i'm not saying he's a good guy because
45:27 he's not but he's really smart
45:30 and he could play with the audience with
45:32 a straight face
45:34 with that general standing next to him
45:35 and it might have been just like
45:37 let's see if you laugh first and he goes
45:39 yeah sure we got those
45:41 uh we don't use them unless we need them
45:42 you know maybe they don't even have them
45:45 he's just playing with the press he's
45:46 playing with our enemies who perceive
45:48 us as having you know equipment we
45:52 haven't announced but he just he just
45:55 announced in a press conference that we
45:56 have a black ops project that created
45:58 this weapon
46:01 he released secret information in the
46:02 middle of a press conference
46:04 seems a little suspect doesn't it of
46:06 course uh about a week earlier was
46:08 talking about the pentagon lost 4.4
46:10 trillion dollars
46:11 it cooked the books down to 2.2 and gosh
46:15 dang it man that
46:16 all the paperwork was in the side of the
46:18 building in the pentagon that
46:20 had a missile hit it oh my gosh
46:24 investigation over let's start a war in
46:27 two years
46:29 the neon cons man they have a lot of fun
46:30 don't they
46:32 now i also saw this other there's
46:34 another channel out there i should say
46:35 that
46:38 does a bunch of uh videos on the
46:41 hutchison
46:42 metal metallurgy part of the game where
46:44 again
46:45 i'm going to show you the pictures of
46:46 all this during the video
46:49 and that's when i edit the video and i'm
46:50 like damn it you should have shut your
46:51 mouth and i gotta go
46:53 go get all these photos but they're
46:55 pretty easy to see
46:57 this guy is is fascinated with the
47:00 metals that
47:02 john made using this other effect
47:06 on the metal to get them to torque and
47:07 twist and un
47:09 unravel from each other i mean some are
47:11 very impressive very amazing one of them
47:13 is a copper
47:15 bar that's really long probably 18
47:18 inches or so
47:19 it looks like a two by two or something
47:20 like that and it actually ruptured from
47:22 the inside and created four corners that
47:25 kind of blew away from each other with
47:26 the center core
47:28 being vaporized i guess now the thing
47:31 that john
47:33 in the interview i saw where he was
47:34 reviewing all these pieces
47:37 and again why not show the guy why not
47:39 just start up all the equipment and do a
47:41 little piece right in front of him right
47:44 nope never made excuse why you couldn't
47:46 do it you could say yeah you know i just
47:48 moved in here my equipment's not quite
47:49 all
47:50 operational maybe later i'll do it for
47:53 you none of that talk
47:55 when i talk to you guys about the
47:57 depleted uranium
47:59 problem and the fact that it's not
48:00 depleted of
48:02 the radiation that it contains it's just
48:04 depleted of i believe 234 and 235
48:07 or five and six i think one of those two
48:11 which they use for plutonium it still is
48:15 massively radioactive when these things
48:17 go out of a gatling gun
48:18 inside an a-10 but metal has
48:21 a property that's called metal shielding
48:25 the reason why the pilots or the abrams
48:28 tank drivers who have these type of
48:30 ordnance
48:32 aren't going to immediately die from
48:34 having this type of ordinance in their
48:35 vehicle
48:36 is that if the the round is
48:40 dry it has what's called metal shielding
48:43 which is its very
48:44 composition fights
48:48 the radio radiation that comes out of
48:51 the bar itself
48:52 it is actually pushing as many shedding
48:55 electrons into the bars coming out
48:57 and so that cancels a lot of what it
48:59 actually escapes out of it until you
49:02 fire the round
49:03 which i believe the a10 round is about
49:05 14 inches long
49:08 and it turns into molten steel out of
49:11 the barrel
49:13 it even slows down the plane when they
49:15 pull the trigger man i mean it is the
49:16 most
49:18 gut-wrenching sound if you're
49:22 a victim of it you know but that's why
49:25 when it hits the
49:27 the armor on its target and
49:30 unless that armor is made of uranium as
49:32 well it just goes right through it like
49:34 butter and then it splatters inside
49:36 super duper hot and there's hundreds of
49:38 rounds coming in
49:39 and anyone burst and so
49:42 the ordinance inside the tank explodes
49:44 and you win
49:46 so when i see some of these pieces that
49:50 have kind of burst from within
49:53 my mind goes to metal shielding the very
49:56 composition
49:58 is one thing but the shape of the metal
50:00 is a different thing and how the
50:02 frequency is applied to the metal
50:04 is the third thing the copper piece
50:07 that popped from center and ejected the
50:09 four corners
50:10 the four sides at the center
50:15 it looks as if those electrodes
50:17 electrodes or whatever
50:19 means was used to exert energy on it
50:21 were attached to the bottom and the top
50:23 and so they collide in the center that
50:25 collision is probably going to look a
50:27 lot like
50:28 a an egg an elongated
50:31 elliptical egg shape in my opinion and
50:35 it's going to
50:37 convince those atoms to essentially
50:39 unwind
50:41 what's interesting about it is that it
50:44 he never taught he never talked john
50:46 never talked about whether or not these
50:47 things were accomplished without any
50:48 thermal radio thermal
50:50 radiation coming off of heat i would
50:53 have liked to have heard him say that
50:55 but he has another piece of what looks
50:59 like
51:00 aluminum and he had a kitchen knife in
51:04 bed inside of it
51:05 seems to have made a signature all the
51:07 way through the metal
51:08 even though the kitchen knife is only in
51:10 about you know a quarter inch at the top
51:13 it casts a shadow a molecular shadow on
51:15 the bottom of this
51:16 pretty much three quarter inch one inch
51:18 thick piece of aluminum
51:20 or cast alloys he calls it i think i
51:23 couldn't find any distinction
51:25 uh with cast alloys i mean alloys as
51:27 many things and whatever
51:29 there's aluminum alloys but that makes
51:31 sense to me because here comes a bunch
51:33 of energy that's going to
51:35 make the weakest metal turn into a
51:38 pudding
51:39 so the knife goes down inside of it then
51:41 you turn off the frequency
51:43 what's also happened is because the
51:44 knife has shielded because it perhaps is
51:47 a stronger nuclear bond
51:49 slash ethereal orbits it's creating an
51:51 echo of itself down below because the
51:53 rest of the bar is doing something more
51:55 random thus keeping it
51:56 looking like it did before the
51:58 experiment occurred
52:00 as a texture as a surface but it looks
52:03 as if the knife may have
52:05 straightened out the atoms underneath it
52:08 thus it looks more smooth and you have
52:10 this imprint on the other side
52:12 now there's one piece where the two kind
52:14 of
52:15 turn into almost like tentacles you know
52:18 a bunch of likes
52:19 like spaghetti and it happened directly
52:22 at the center of this beam
52:25 of aluminum or whatever castol alloy
52:28 and that one's very intriguing but this
52:30 dude did a video where he was likening
52:32 he was there was some gauge some like uh
52:36 metal gauge that was off some piece of
52:38 equipment that was cut and
52:40 cut at least a third off and it had some
52:43 ruptures in the metal
52:46 it honestly looked like the same exact
52:48 pattern that rust
52:49 does on something but it was pitted in
52:53 this particular pattern
52:54 and this guy takes a video of sunspots
52:58 and likens the sunspot
53:01 growth slash mechanism of which sunspots
53:03 occur
53:04 which is plasma driven and
53:08 says you know he shows the the sunspot
53:11 thing and he shows the gauge and he says
53:12 man if you don't believe this is real i
53:13 don't know what's wrong with you and
53:14 it's just like dude
53:17 and he never said a scientific thing in
53:20 his conversation
53:21 he just said look at these two shapes
53:23 they're the same boom
53:24 okay but now the one claim
53:28 that i haven't mentioned yet because
53:31 it's sort of the best
53:32 part of the weirdness is that when you
53:35 listen to john talk
53:37 uh one he he says he knows nothing about
53:40 mathematics at all and that he's more of
53:41 an intuitive
53:43 experimenter and i completely understand
53:45 that there is that
53:46 i mean i think that tesla was very
53:48 intuitive about what he did
53:50 but he was also very good at mathematics
53:52 and
53:54 could see electrons i mean you just see
53:56 them
53:57 most people are into deep electronic
54:00 inventions they have the same capability
54:02 nowadays because they stand on the
54:04 shoulders of giants
54:05 but it's a serious epiphany that you
54:07 have
54:08 like calculus will get you statistics
54:10 will get you until all of a sudden it
54:12 goes click
54:13 in your brain you're like oh my god i
54:14 totally see it and everything becomes
54:16 easy
54:17 there's all kinds of things like that
54:20 first time you look at a car engine you
54:22 probably don't understand the pieces and
54:23 parts once you get how it all works
54:25 you're intuitive about everything you
54:27 can just turn the engine on and listen
54:29 to it you're like oh yeah that's the
54:30 water pump
54:32 but john has two concepts he mixes
54:34 together
54:36 which because it sounds great and again
54:38 if you're kind of a faux
54:40 scientist this is where your
54:41 conversation will drift
54:43 without any true connection points to
54:46 the fancy words you're using
54:49 he will lament about a zero point energy
54:51 system being a part of his
54:54 accomplishments that without zero point
54:56 energy he wouldn't get his levitation
54:58 videos without zero point energy
55:00 he would not have been able to pulverize
55:02 the steel
55:05 i think there's no connection whatsoever
55:08 but it would be nice to have a zero
55:09 point energy system
55:11 but at after saying these words he never
55:15 connects it again it's just okay why
55:18 don't you say the word quantum while
55:20 you're at it because it sounds cool
55:21 right
55:22 the second half of the same statement he
55:25 will talk about
55:26 pulling that energy from another
55:28 dimension because that sounds cool and
55:30 scientific too doesn't it
55:32 another dimension well study eric
55:35 dollard
55:36 study all the og founders of electricity
55:41 and as soon as you understand that
55:44 there's ethereal winds
55:46 you don't have any more dimensions that
55:47 you need to pull in
55:50 you don't you just don't understand the
55:52 fabric of the universe
55:54 that's all and so it seems like magic to
55:56 you that
55:57 this kind of alteration in mass is
56:00 possible
56:02 i just watched the i posted this on the
56:04 facebook page
56:06 i just watched tonight a movie that i
56:10 i almost can't even believe it got made
56:13 which is pixar's soul
56:16 this movie is gorgeous it's well written
56:20 it's clever it's new and
56:23 many of their i mean the premise is not
56:27 going to ruin
56:27 a damn thing i could probably other than
56:30 telling you the ending
56:31 i could tell you almost half of the
56:32 movie and nothing
56:35 would be spoiled for you in one one
56:37 minute it's about a guy
56:38 who's a music teacher he's a pianist
56:42 but like all music teachers he knows all
56:44 instruments really well
56:46 his dream is to be a jazz musician
56:50 and what's strange is the credits don't
56:51 roll for a really long time i miss the
56:53 very first
56:53 two minutes of it but the credits roll
56:55 real deep in the movie it's really
56:56 strange
56:58 but he gets a gig finally
57:01 to be a jazz musician at some nightclub
57:03 in a really cool band
57:05 like a little three-piece you know and
57:07 he's so excited he's just walking home
57:09 and he's on
57:11 cloud nine man and he's not paying
57:12 attention and he falls into a manhole
57:15 and ends up in not exactly heaven
57:20 but this cooler place the existential
57:23 conversations they're having about
57:25 life is the best i've ever heard written
57:29 especially for a mass
57:30 product from pixar i mean you would
57:33 think that most people
57:34 reading that dialogue and some agency
57:36 would be like okay this is kind of heavy
57:38 man
57:38 but they let it all go through and it
57:41 was really well done
57:43 but there's a point in the film where a
57:46 little analogy comes out
57:49 and it's trying to get him to see his
57:52 perspective in the universe
57:55 and this woman tells him a story about a
57:59 fish
57:59 that goes up to another fish and somehow
58:02 a conversation starts where he says
58:04 you look like you're lost what's going
58:06 on and the fish that
58:08 is new to the area goes i'm looking for
58:10 the ocean
58:12 and the other fish says well you're in
58:15 it
58:15 you're in the ocean right now that's
58:16 where you are
58:18 and the fish says back now this is just
58:21 water i'm looking for the ocean
58:24 and i just thought about all of our
58:25 episodes we've ever done where i give
58:26 you the analogy that
58:29 ether is if you understand water
58:32 and the many methods that water moves
58:35 and the different names we give water
58:37 when it moves differently
58:39 then you will completely understand
58:41 ether and the whole universe becomes
58:44 child's play it becomes a finger
58:46 painting
58:47 you could teach children
58:51 with a modicum of awareness i guess
58:53 probably from the age of five to ten
58:56 but from nine to ten they completely
58:57 understand they can completely
58:59 understand how the whole universe is put
59:01 together
59:02 i just wanna go through the old analogy
59:04 one more time and apply it back to the
59:06 hutcheson thing
59:07 if you fill up a sink full of water we
59:10 all did it as kids
59:11 and you plug it up right and then you
59:14 want to see the tornado right you pull
59:16 the plug out and you watch the vortex of
59:18 water go down you just see it you put
59:19 your finger in it you're like oh my god
59:21 you put your finger in the center of the
59:22 tornado where it's still dry but you're
59:24 actually
59:24 two or three inches down below the
59:26 surface of the average mean of water
59:29 it's just a fun little thing you do you
59:30 you do it when you're draining the tub
59:32 when you're a little kid taking baths
59:34 right
59:35 i think adults still would do it but we
59:36 just don't expose ourselves to it
59:39 but we we stop that moment and take a
59:42 photograph of it
59:43 and then we show it to somebody and we
59:44 go what is that right there
59:46 i'm gonna show you a picture tell me
59:47 what it is and they go oh it's a vortex
59:49 it's a current it's uh whatever tornado
59:52 of water
59:54 and i say no it's just water
59:57 yeah okay jerk i understand that i see a
60:00 little trick you did there
60:02 i thought you were asking me about the
60:04 state of the water that it's in at that
60:06 point
60:07 we have no problem understanding that do
60:09 we
60:10 when water behaves a certain way we call
60:12 it a different thing
60:14 you could go to yellowstone and point at
60:15 old faithful right and when it starts
60:17 doing its little
60:18 geyser thing what's that it's a geyser
60:22 nope it's just water
60:24 what's steam oh it's steam you know it's
60:27 no it's just water
60:28 you get my point when ether behaves a
60:32 particular way
60:33 when it gets caught up in the currents
60:36 of its
60:37 incredibly dense presence in the
60:39 universe
60:40 we call that things we call them quarks
60:42 we call them
60:44 um electrons neutrons protons
60:47 neurons we call them everything and
60:50 that's the whole universe man
60:53 the reason why i'm reintroducing that at
60:55 the end of this episode is to remind you
60:58 that the concepts that surround all of
61:01 the hutcheson effects is based on this
61:03 principle one is the behavior of
61:06 ether creating gravity and one is
61:10 disrupting the nuclear bonds slash
61:12 currents
61:13 okay you could take your hand when that
61:15 thing is draining down the
61:16 sink you could take your hand and push
61:19 it in there and mix up all that water
61:20 and that current goes away for a little
61:22 while and then it
61:22 will reconstitute if there's enough
61:24 water and time to do so
61:27 the thing is is that we can't just wave
61:30 our hands and make this microphone
61:31 disappear
61:32 why because those currents are so tight
61:35 they're
61:36 as tight as the mass i would use to try
61:38 and disturb it
61:39 and so when i bump the mic during an
61:41 episode you hear this boom and i try to
61:42 get rid of them in editing but sometimes
61:44 they
61:44 go through that's why we can touch our
61:47 fingers together and
61:48 they don't pass through each other
61:50 that's why we have the reality that we
61:52 have right now whether it be a matrix or
61:54 not
61:55 so in summation i will say that i think
61:57 that all of his videos of levitation are
62:00 a hoax
62:01 i think they're probably more likely to
62:03 be strings than a magnet because they
62:05 did a plastic cup of water
62:07 i think that they move like old 50s
62:10 props
62:11 back in the day like an old thunderbirds
62:13 episode
62:14 just can't quite get it right you know
62:18 is there a benefit to creating a hoax
62:19 like this in this area of science
62:22 i think microscopically yes yes there is
62:27 a benefit to pointing people in this
62:30 direction
62:31 so that they will actually go out and do
62:32 it
62:34 because he can't recreate this and
62:36 because he did absolutely nothing to
62:37 document
62:39 a profound moment in in scientific
62:41 history supposedly
62:43 i think it's fake now about the metal
62:46 turning and twisting and all that kind
62:48 of stuff well
62:49 i think he figured out something he's
62:51 got tons of equipment
62:54 i think he worked with softer metals
62:55 which was smart i would use the weakest
62:57 metal out there
62:58 some hot steel or something to start
63:00 messing with that because i don't think
63:02 it's very
63:04 it's maybe even use gold use a piece of
63:06 jewelry something it's
63:07 really like 14 karat gold is so freaking
63:10 soft
63:11 you never ever want to buy high carrot
63:14 gold for anything you really want to
63:16 wear besides maybe around your neck
63:19 but you need to understand if somebody
63:21 crimps it with their hand or it gets
63:23 caught on itself and you pull too hard
63:25 you'll bend it up i designed a wedding
63:28 ring for a buddy of mine very complex
63:30 wedding ring it was a huge castle going
63:32 around his finger
63:34 and it was so soft when he got it back
63:36 from the jeweler that we had to mount
63:38 on it a 10-carat ring above and below
63:41 like a ring of
63:43 gold around it to hold it in place
63:45 lesson learned right
63:48 but i do think that can be done that's
63:50 which is why people do it
63:53 i do think it is a precursor to the
63:55 technology that would lead to
63:57 being able to completely obliterate
64:00 something
64:01 like a building like a car
64:04 that happens to be collateral damage
64:05 when you're trying to take down the
64:06 buildings
64:08 i think this is uh
64:11 you know lock and step with everything
64:14 that
64:16 our government in a military capacity
64:18 would never want us to
64:20 figure out because
64:24 you know i'll just give you a few a few
64:26 uh examples
64:27 that would go on potentially in a
64:29 military think tank
64:31 so you got a military think tank and as
64:32 part of that think tank you have
64:34 individuals who know
64:35 exactly how this works 100
64:38 and so you have generals that aren't
64:40 technical but they're
64:41 strategic in their thinking and they ask
64:44 the table
64:45 all right tell us what the threat is
64:48 with this hutchison effect coming out
64:49 and inspiring people to go off and do
64:51 this
64:53 and they say well a couple things
64:56 you know those boston dynamic robots
64:58 that we eventually plan
65:01 to take over the world well they could
65:03 just develop
65:04 pretty pretty easy off-the-shelf
65:06 methodologies one they would be able to
65:08 find zero-point energy by taking
65:10 tesla's technology and harvesting
65:12 ethereal winds coiling them down into
65:14 the
65:15 earth's crust and yanking out infinite
65:17 power like you did in colorado springs
65:19 hence the photograph and they'd be able
65:22 to utterly obliterate
65:24 turn into mist and non-existent
65:28 thermal energy all the stuff that we
65:31 throw at them
65:32 in addition they could knock helicopters
65:35 out of the sky
65:36 and with enough power they could knock
65:39 bombers out of the sky they could
65:40 melt our tanks melt bullets before they
65:43 ever get hit by them
65:44 it could get to that extreme so
65:46 therefore we must engage in a psyop
65:49 to make sure that none of this
65:50 information ever gets
65:53 any traction to mislead everyone to
65:56 push them towards the hosters and make
65:58 sure they don't look at people like eric
65:59 dollar they might be able to do
66:00 something real
66:02 you know the big the big thing is that
66:05 there was an old strategy and it still
66:06 exists where if you were doing
66:08 you know horrendous electrical
66:10 experiments well one your fireball is
66:12 going to be through the roof but two
66:13 that spike in power use
66:15 might set off some bells you might have
66:17 some people visiting your house
66:20 but if you get into i wouldn't
66:23 necessarily say zero point energy but
66:24 free energy
66:25 technology that tesla was working on
66:27 with his warden cliff tower
66:29 there's no one who knows that you've
66:31 created a source of power that is
66:33 pretty much inexhaustible therefore your
66:35 inventions could
66:37 harness inventions that aren't possible
66:41 without that kind of power supply
66:44 the sad reality of the world is that the
66:46 most technically minded people that
66:48 could probably
66:50 execute a creative idea typically have
66:53 very dysfunctional right brains
66:56 and that's not a complete slam on them
66:58 we need people that are very
67:00 astute left brain people but they're
67:03 just not that creative
67:05 in the military in the intelligence
67:06 community they test you for months and
67:08 months and months before you get to join
67:10 the organization
67:11 and they try to ensure that you actually
67:13 do not have
67:14 the growth capability to gain a right
67:17 brain
67:18 they check your loyalties they check how
67:19 much mass media that you willing to
67:21 ingest is 100 truth until the day you
67:23 die
67:26 then they reward you handsomely
67:29 both with status and money and power
67:32 perhaps
67:34 to solidify that you are right and your
67:36 way of thinking thus you will not change
67:38 the way you think
67:40 anyone who's uh trying to be brought
67:42 into you know like an area 51 or an s4
67:45 if that exists those would be
67:50 solicited for the opposite capability
67:53 or i should say probably both sides of
67:55 their brain super technically brilliant
67:57 but very creative as well
68:01 tesla was one of those he was a left and
68:03 a right brainer
68:04 extremely creative don't forget he
68:07 created a
68:08 remote control boat that he demonstrated
68:11 in front of the public in i think
68:12 1898. seriously
68:15 we don't have protocols traveling over
68:20 invisible frequencies at that age
68:23 and he created a protocol of control not
68:25 only did he create a transmitter and
68:27 receiver and a power supply in that boat
68:29 so it would be able to do whatever it's
68:30 supposed to do he was able to say when
68:33 you get this stream of data i want you
68:35 to turn the rudder right
68:36 left i'm assuming he had some propulsion
68:39 system that would either turn on or off
68:42 that is so utterly and incredibly
68:45 brilliant for his era
68:47 i don't know that i can easily match
68:49 that one little thing at that time in
68:51 history
68:53 i'm sure the government has things of
68:55 that creative level
68:57 anyway i hope you uh enjoyed this this
68:59 is one i
69:00 honestly been wanting to do forever but
69:02 i i'm not even sure if i have it in my
69:03 list
69:04 so again to listener who pushed me thank
69:06 you so much hopefully you appreciate
69:08 it's the very next video you see
69:11 and uh you know i am always interested
69:12 in your ideas i have gotten a lot of new
69:15 leads
69:16 with names i will just
69:20 restate because i haven't stated it for
69:22 probably a hundred episodes
69:24 if you have a suggestion where it's just
69:26 like a name i'd love for you to talk
69:28 about this guy
69:29 and please put a little bit of a
69:31 descriptor in there as to
69:33 what it is that this person's into and
69:36 sort of any questions you might have
69:37 that you want me to answer with my
69:39 opinion
69:40 because that way you're infecting the
69:42 episode with your dna
69:44 you're saying he answered that question
69:45 because i asked him to answer that
69:47 question
69:48 let's make it fun let's make it
69:49 interactive i absolutely
69:51 love that that format but anyway if you
69:55 haven't been to deepthoughtsradio.com
69:56 please go there and just bookmark it
69:57 it's got everything up there
69:59 i've been telling you guys are asking
70:01 you
70:02 to please go over to bid shoot and
70:04 create an account and subscribe over
70:05 there
70:06 that is truly the leading youtube
70:08 replacement
70:10 they are 100 no popularity
70:13 contest to get it going a brand new tube
70:16 seems to be a completely abandoned
70:18 website
70:20 they've got a 404 error on their gopro
70:23 option but they stop you 150 videos and
70:25 say you got to go pro
70:26 if you want to put any new videos up
70:28 there and you click it it goes to 404
70:30 you communicate with your support team
70:32 nothing comes back
70:35 again brighton is a joke lbry is pretty
70:38 cool that tv
70:40 they've also pulled over gosh 280
70:43 episodes so they had a limit to what
70:45 they were gonna
70:46 allow me to pull over but that's fine
70:48 that's a lot of videos
70:50 i can't track whether or not anyone's
70:51 ever watched them unless i click on
70:52 every single video
70:54 i don't think they're getting any play
70:55 over there but whatever it's over there
70:58 but anyway we have our social media
71:00 audio
71:01 we have uh ways to contribute through
71:04 patreon
71:05 for those of you coming on board got a
71:07 few new folks thank you so much you're
71:08 in the credits forever unless you ask
71:10 not to be and we have a store with a
71:12 couple new
71:13 chat skis for season six anyway take
71:16 care of yourself and someone else and
71:18 i'll see you in the next deep thoughts
71:23 [Music]
71:24 over
71:28 [Music]
71:38 so
71:46 [Applause]
71:52 [Music]
71:57 you
