00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 good evening good afternoon good morning
00:37 ladies and gentlemen and welcome back to
00:39 deep thoughts today we are going to
00:42 discuss the Battle of realities because
00:49 something really cool has been going on
00:51 for last two or three years on YouTube
00:53 I know it's technically been going on
00:55 probably since we've all been born and I
00:59 want to first start off by saying we are
01:02 all the winners before we debate
01:05 anything before we get anyone to see our
01:07 side we have won as the community of
01:11 this planet and how did we win
01:15 what finish line did we cross that we
01:20 have reached a point where we all had
01:23 our you know minds close which is in the
01:26 past and then recently and I mean
01:30 recently in perspective to man's history
01:31 we have open to back up again for debate
01:35 I take notes
01:37 little tiny notes and like phone between
01:40 episodes that are just basically topic
01:44 lines that's it no facts or anything
01:48 like that typically but I had two
01:51 entries which was where are we and the
01:56 other one was battle of the realities so
02:02 I thought hey let's mix them all
02:03 together I can check off two off my list
02:07 so what are the different realities that
02:11 we typically talk about now of course
02:14 there are a million impressions of each
02:16 one of these there's a lot of different
02:19 motives for each one of the observations
02:23 or beliefs about where we are the most
02:27 popular being heliocentric ball in space
02:31 infinitely small infinitely
02:33 insignificant to the rest of the
02:35 universe and it is suggested that only
02:38 man's ego makes us believe anything
02:40 otherwise there is the Pangaea drift
02:43 which has been again shoved down the
02:46 brains of
02:48 even when I was a kid which is that the
02:50 whole continent system was all together
02:52 in the ocean was here in that geology
02:56 and physics and reality have been
02:58 completely [ __ ] suspended and they've
03:00 ripped apart and they float on the water
03:04 so to speak with no evidence of that the
03:10 other theory that was taught up to about
03:11 1965 is expanding Earth theory which
03:16 completely matches the plate growth that
03:18 we see in the Pacific and the Atlantic
03:19 and accounts for pretty much everything
03:23 that we see in terms of mountainscapes
03:25 why inland plains of the United States
03:28 have tons of sea shells and that sort of
03:31 thing but no large sea creatures so as
03:36 long as you've got a globe in your house
03:37 regardless if you secretly believe in
03:40 expanding earth or Pangaea drift the
03:43 community at large will come into your
03:45 home and oh that's a pretty glove
03:47 where'd you get that Papa Papa Papa and
03:49 you're in the end crowd you feel better
03:52 about yourself maybe what is the
03:55 in-crowd
03:55 just the digress and take a pause for a
03:57 second the in-crowd is sort of like
04:00 someone throwing your life preserver
04:01 when you thought you were going to
04:03 drowned and you know you know that
04:06 everyone who's cool is not going to
04:08 drowned so now you're not going to
04:09 drowned and you feel hell of a lot
04:11 better sort of the way it works because
04:14 it's usually an act of desperation to be
04:17 in the end crowd simply for the sake of
04:19 being the in-crowd not because you
04:21 coincidentally might believe that you're
04:22 correct
04:22 scientifically but then again if you've
04:26 just adopted other people's theories for
04:27 your theory then even if you're right
04:32 you don't actually believe that you're
04:34 as right as you could be if you would
04:35 venture out and research things for
04:37 yourself a little bit of math a little
04:39 bit logic of course with heliocentric
04:44 beliefs we have the predominant 99.9% in
04:49 crowd which believes in the Big Bang a
04:52 completely absurd theory for the
04:55 cowardice at heart
04:57 they have taken a fictional story of the
05:01 beginning of the universe as told by
05:03 folks more than 60,000 years ago and
05:06 turned it into a scientific theory it's
05:10 just oh wow the whole universe is in a
05:12 nutshell that makes me feel good don't
05:14 want to be up at night thinking about
05:16 how this thing could just simply have
05:17 existed we'll get into that too what's
05:23 the next alternate theory because we're
05:24 gonna do three the next is the five
05:30 hundred plus year ago theory that the
05:33 world is a flat plane I think most
05:37 models and I didn't know this until
05:39 recently which is sort of shocking to me
05:41 is that the Flat Earth thing has
05:45 portrayed to me as a child maybe it's
05:46 the Kansas rock albums or whatever was
05:49 always a square and that you just fall
05:53 off the edge that water's just being
05:55 held which is why when I was a kid and I
05:57 saw the ocean analogy falling off the
06:00 edge of the of the plane it was like
06:02 well of course it can't be flat because
06:03 the oceans would drain not realizing
06:07 that for several thousand years starting
06:11 about 500 years ago that it was a disc
06:14 encapsulated by ice and I think that
06:18 that is pretty amazing for multiple
06:22 reasons one it you know I wasn't with
06:26 Captain Cook I don't know if the guy
06:27 truly traveled 60,000 miles around the
06:30 Antarctica if he did and then it may be
06:32 it is a disc that's enclosing us and
06:35 again we've just been duped to believe
06:37 that it it looks like a globe right that
06:43 it's meant to look like a globe and that
06:46 way again we're in the container that
06:47 makes sense to us but it's a facsimile
06:49 of what we see when we look into space
06:51 you know even if that exists okay but I
06:55 think that until we started sailing the
06:59 oceans in a deep-sea manner
07:01 which in modern history times meaning
07:04 the books that have survived the last
07:05 massacre of history it seems like we
07:08 just started doing that
07:10 when we look at old maps that seem to be
07:12 dated in the 1300s they claim to be
07:14 copied from previous maps we actually go
07:17 back way further than that because they
07:20 had longitude latitude '''l correct map
07:22 of Antarctica without snow on it unless
07:26 that's a forgery the Graham Hancock has
07:28 that in a couple of his books it has a
07:30 name and I can't remember what it is
07:32 right now I think it's like 1392 or
07:35 something like that is the is the year
07:38 but I might be wrong on that but it's a
07:40 fascinating notion that someone would
07:43 conceive of how to keep the water in
07:45 through a barrier and then make the
07:47 barrier an ice barrier because until we
07:50 start traveling the Seas and flying
07:53 planes in the sky we don't really know
07:56 about these structures unless perhaps
07:59 man lived here one point in time right
08:01 which you very very well probably did if
08:04 there was a point when it didn't have
08:05 ice on now the flatter thing is very
08:09 interesting because when it started out
08:11 for me a couple of years ago maybe even
08:13 three years ago it was all due to Eric
08:16 Dubay hats off to that guy regardless of
08:20 whether or not he's completely right
08:22 about what he says he does an immaculate
08:24 job of presenting his case he's a great
08:27 debater and you know I think that
08:31 probably one of his biggest
08:32 contributions is shining light on
08:34 paleontology like that's been a real
08:37 epiphany that these things simply don't
08:39 exist dinosaurs yeah we'll do a deficit
08:43 on that this year for sure one of the
08:47 unsung heroes that two-base put together
08:48 is one regarding Christmas which you
08:52 just absolutely have to watch although
08:54 his channel keeps getting taken down and
08:55 put back up so I think you can find him
09:00 but the Flat Earth was either people
09:03 like myself just going oh my god could
09:05 it be could it be flat and I'm just
09:07 being deceived into thinking it's round
09:09 and then you have the second group which
09:12 says that they have my feelings but they
09:14 also have this incredible emphasis on
09:18 God and that God has got us in a snow
09:22 globe
09:22 and that God is on the other side of
09:25 some firmer mat dome that there's water
09:27 out there because the the Bible spoke of
09:30 a layer of water over us as well as a
09:33 layer of water under us as it is above
09:35 so too is below that might have been
09:37 misunderstood them or that might be
09:39 literally true there's a lot of footage
09:42 out there that is misconstrued as being
09:46 down footage there's a rocket that went
09:47 really high and then it all of a sudden
09:50 stops spinning a lot of folks that
09:52 didn't look up rocketry and these the
09:55 the actual schematic for that particular
09:57 experiment they didn't realize that the
10:00 rocket actually throws out of sling and
10:04 it stops it from turning and this allows
10:07 parachutes and things to work properly
10:09 because if you had so if you have the
10:12 rocket and it's spinning it's some
10:14 incredible rate and you try to put on a
10:16 parachute
10:17 obviously it's going to tangle that
10:18 thing up in a split second so you must
10:21 stop the spinning
10:22 plus you can't get good photographs and
10:24 all that kind of stuff so that was not a
10:26 rocket hitting some water dome okay if
10:29 you hit a dome of water and you're in an
10:32 atmospheric container you're going to
10:35 pierce oxygen into water and there would
10:38 be bubbles and all kinds of stuff and so
10:40 everyone can relax on this so you do
10:43 have a lot of folks with I would say
10:47 strong biblical knowledge but sort of
10:50 lacks scientific knowledge now they're
10:52 coming up to speed really quickly which
10:54 is nice you know we as humans don't
10:56 typically research something until we
10:58 need to know it right but for some the
11:01 the flatter thing means firmament dome
11:04 it doesn't mean aliens created it or
11:06 other humanoids created it it means God
11:08 created it and that's it it's just human
11:11 beings and God and obviously that makes
11:13 us
11:14 the center of the spotlight thus the
11:16 most important thing in the universe now
11:19 when you think about that for one second
11:21 if you've ever raised children or been
11:25 around children and I mean really young
11:26 young kids you know how they love to be
11:29 the center of attention that there's
11:31 some kids that need that their little
11:33 princesses
11:34 let's if they're boys or girls they need
11:36 to be the center of attention they've
11:39 got other way to put their hand on the
11:43 face of the other kids and push them
11:44 down steal their toys whatever they got
11:46 to do to be front and center for you
11:48 right this helicopter wants to be front
11:51 and center for me there's a little bit
11:54 of that feeling with the religious side
11:57 of the firmament dome and that we
11:59 supposedly have to be the center of
12:02 attention you know we can't just be an
12:03 equally important being in the universe
12:06 we have to be the most important being
12:08 and maybe we are you know hell I don't
12:11 know but it's good that we're talking
12:14 about it
12:15 so what's the third and final one we're
12:18 going to talk about today well it's the
12:21 one that cuts through all the others is
12:24 the trump card of all trump cards if it
12:27 is truly the way that this works and
12:29 that is called the matrix the matrix is
12:33 very interesting because it is the most
12:35 malleable theory that could control the
12:39 entire universe because it can be
12:41 anything that it wants to be right you
12:44 could have unicorn head Minotaur Center
12:50 body and you know pig tail at the end
12:53 all colored and rainbows and stripes and
12:55 it tastes like a red hot candy with
12:58 sweet and sour in it right if any of you
13:01 younger folks that have seen Minecraft
13:03 the video game it's sort of like that
13:05 little kids building things and so some
13:08 things make no sense on things they're
13:10 beautiful castles sometimes you can run
13:12 through one sometimes others are just
13:14 nonsense the matrix is the notion that
13:18 we're inside of a computer of some sort
13:20 whether we have a human body and we're
13:24 looking at some
13:26 vr goggles with their eyeballs which may
13:28 be why we always say the eyes are the
13:30 windows to the soul
13:31 maybe eyes are are the only part of our
13:36 body that actually punched through to
13:38 this reality which is why if you go back
13:41 to my season one exercises if you are
13:45 with another human being that you feel
13:49 very special with whether it be a family
13:51 member or a loved one it's like a spouse
13:53 or a partner staying in front of them
13:57 feel their amazement make sure they're
14:00 feeling your amazement right and then do
14:03 an experiment for me hold your two
14:06 fingers together if you're watching the
14:08 videos that's how it work just touch
14:09 your fingertips together such that you
14:12 block the eye socket of the other person
14:14 and tell me
14:16 once you cognitively can feel how
14:22 wonderful they feel to you block their
14:24 eyes and tell me the percentage of drop
14:27 that you feel in terms of a loss of
14:31 connection I did this at a party once to
14:35 a professor at a film school and she had
14:37 me teaching at the school about a month
14:40 later because it blew her mind how much
14:43 how powerful this this example is she
14:47 said where did you get that and I said I
14:48 made it up and she goes wow so our eyes
14:52 are something extremely special if
14:56 you're really good at reading human
14:57 beings it's because you typically look
15:00 people in the eye people who are nervous
15:03 and look away they're typically the
15:05 weirdos of the world they feel awkward
15:07 to you because they're never really
15:09 making an established connection with
15:11 you I don't mean they're bad people by
15:13 any means and as soon as they learn how
15:15 to stare into someone's eyes during a
15:17 conversation I mean you know it to be
15:19 kooky about it they start to plug in a
15:21 little bit better with the matrix comes
15:26 some very interesting concepts that
15:27 we've covered on the show one we have
15:31 this interesting dual meaning phenomenon
15:36 I completely took it a different way
15:37 there's the MPC thing
15:39 is flying all over the internet the
15:41 little grayface thing and you're not
15:42 allowed to show that great face icon
15:44 otherwise they will D monetize your
15:46 video the most popular definition of an
15:50 NPC is someone who is a press puppet
15:54 that just simply says what their little
15:56 teleprompter tells them to say they
15:58 can't think for themselves so their
16:00 non-player character in the video game
16:01 of life
16:03 then there's my definition which takes
16:05 it much further than that which is we
16:08 seem to have folks they're completely
16:12 disgusting the evil running this planet
16:14 in every corner of this planet it is
16:17 very difficult for us to point in a
16:19 direction and say that person is good
16:21 and for the people of this planet I
16:23 think in the last two years five years
16:26 we've identified some folks that are
16:28 trying to push their way in and get us
16:31 to a good state but then again we
16:33 haven't seen the whole game play out so
16:35 we don't know if there's someone that
16:37 they're unaware of the tiding behind the
16:39 fence that's evil and waiting to take
16:42 over as soon as they get done with their
16:44 job but isn't it strange that we have
16:48 pedophiles and murderers and all this
16:50 other stuff running the world and they
16:53 get away scot-free
16:54 right the Podesta brothers murdered a
16:55 girl in Portugal at the Freud house they
17:02 were identified positively through
17:04 sketches but no one's willing to try and
17:08 extradite them and detain them it's
17:11 horrible
17:12 we have Joe Biden pension little girls
17:15 at the White House pitching their
17:16 boobies on camera
17:18 go look it up Joe Biden pedophile we
17:22 have Robert De Niro hanging out with a
17:24 spirit cooking woman well she's a
17:26 complete Saint Anne worshipper she is
17:28 literally the grand master of Satan
17:30 worshipping in this world Lady gaga
17:32 hangs out with her too Katy Perry is in
17:36 a contest to be the best Luciferian st.
17:39 and worshiper on this planet
17:41 hey I'm not into this stuff I'm not
17:43 sitting around thinking I don't read my
17:45 Bible every day to figure out where my
17:47 life's going or where your life's going
17:48 I don't believe Jesus ever existed but
17:50 I'm telling you these people do
17:52 these things and they're getting away
17:55 scot-free I think it feels a bit like
17:59 the villains in the show West world
18:04 literally created to see if the species
18:07 that is real in this world will rise up
18:11 and defend themselves which is us right
18:14 nobody likes it to happen on their watch
18:16 of course that's why a lot of people
18:18 deny conspiracies because they don't
18:21 want to wake up the next day with the
18:22 obligation to do anything different they
18:25 want the world to be wonderful and so
18:27 they tend to adopt a reality that best
18:31 fits their Constitution and their
18:34 willingness to have an open mind might
18:36 and willingness to be wrong that's the
18:39 other thing I just mentioned three
18:40 realities unless it's the matrix then
18:46 the other two whether two of these are
18:48 wrong right
18:50 you're then a round ball flat disc or
18:52 feeder matrix it could be anything now
18:56 before we go any further let's just say
18:57 this we are the folks that can have an
19:01 open conversation we are the folks that
19:04 can sit on this patio and completely
19:08 disagree about what we see and how we
19:11 interpret the I don't know I don't want
19:14 to say facts of the world but what we
19:16 particularly see with our eyeballs and
19:18 our brains right because we see things
19:19 differently we taste things different
19:21 than we smell things differently you
19:24 feel things differently both physical
19:27 and emotional right but let's make sure
19:30 we're that group of folks we're
19:32 open-minded we're not gonna get angry
19:34 we're not gonna shut off the video and
19:36 start typing about how stupid everyone
19:39 is who doesn't believe what you believe
19:41 it's very important these are the kind
19:43 of people that we need to be if we're
19:45 gonna rebuild this world and do it right
19:48 isn't it interesting how flat and round
19:53 actually have physical models that
19:56 explain a lot of the belief system of
20:00 either system the way the Sun comes up
20:02 and goes down the way the moon comes up
20:04 and goes down
20:05 hmm both sides have an explanation for
20:09 how that behaves now it is obviously a
20:13 fact that most people that are very that
20:17 shunned Flat Earth instantaneously are
20:19 folks that haven't researched it more
20:21 than a few minutes right people give me
20:24 [ __ ] all the time for supporting both
20:26 sides of the argument and again in the
20:29 background I'm thinking matrix matrix
20:30 right the give me [ __ ] for being an
20:34 equal opportunity open-minded person
20:36 who's not going to get all butthurt that
20:38 someone believes something different
20:39 than I believe it's because that's who I
20:41 think I need to be as a human being for
20:44 the rest of my life not just for now but
20:46 for the rest of my life now if there
20:49 were little tourist trips where I could
20:51 take a get in a rocket and go way up and
20:54 see the whole earth rotate right in
20:58 front of my very eyes then yes I would
21:00 completely relinquish any thought
21:03 process that it's at least a flat disk
21:06 we still could be in a matrix but then
21:09 again matrix is one of those advanced
21:11 theories that you'd be very careful with
21:12 because you can jump into the matrix
21:15 theory and then you can completely just
21:18 dissing dissing file everything now even
21:21 if you're in a matrix
21:22 the idea is you need to understand why
21:24 the programmers of the matrix made the
21:28 world the way that it is we're still in
21:30 a pretty much cause-and-effect system
21:32 right if you don't eat you starve to
21:34 death if you're hit by lightning you
21:36 usually die you know so there are there
21:39 are hard core rules and regulations and
21:42 algorithms that are going on every
21:44 single split second of the day that
21:47 holds you together so you have the added
21:52 extra burden of understanding the second
21:54 level of it all now which side of the
21:58 flat or round earth and I don't want to
22:00 create a competition here but I think
22:02 this is a fairly valuable exercise to
22:06 keep in mind as you debate these other
22:08 realities which one has explained more
22:12 of what we observe the Flat Earth model
22:18 they're round heliocentric Earth model
22:20 regardless of the earth grew and
22:22 expanding earth or weather and I was
22:24 always this shape I mean it's just I
22:26 think it's pretty insane to think that
22:27 things are just the shape they are and
22:29 and that's it you know they don't grow
22:30 or anything but maybe it does we see
22:33 what when we look out at night we see
22:37 the Sun the moon we see planets again
22:40 you can use a ten thousand power
22:43 reflector telescope that you can buy at
22:46 an astronomy catalog somewhere you will
22:49 see the dot on Jupiter in your backyard
22:51 you will see the rings of Saturn you
22:53 will okay but you see stars and you see
22:57 the Milky Way now one of the things that
23:00 I want to remind the listeners is that
23:02 those images of you know hundreds of
23:06 spinning galaxies that you see those I
23:09 believe are only obtainable through
23:10 massive telescopes that either NASA
23:14 controls or governments control and I
23:16 personally have never heard anyone say
23:19 they've looked through and they can see
23:20 those in fact I've had someone that was
23:24 fairly deep into that sort of research
23:26 that said I've never seen those but I've
23:28 gotten those photographs given to me so
23:29 I'm not sure if they're real or not it
23:32 does seem strange to me that we're in
23:33 this gigantic galaxy and we could just
23:36 have no problem staring out of it but I
23:39 think that the the folks that have
23:44 developed and believed in the
23:46 heliocentric ground ball earth again
23:50 being a part of a universe and we are in
23:52 significantly small and what-have-you
23:54 and in terms of size it doesn't mean
23:57 that God thinks that we're in
23:58 significantly small and that's something
23:59 to remember right I think that they have
24:02 the most palatable explanations of
24:06 everything that observes that is
24:08 observed in the universe meaning when
24:10 they say their stars just like the one
24:11 that we have but they're way for our
24:13 waste the little dots and this idea of a
24:15 galaxy on it's on a particular axis
24:18 which represents the Milky Way
24:22 regardless of whether or not that's true
24:25 or not and again we have we have a Space
24:30 Agency's now if it'd have
24:32 essentially theorized a black hole in
24:34 the center of our galaxy and they've got
24:36 a number for it and a name for it but
24:39 they can't see it I mean it's just
24:40 sometimes it is just phenomenally
24:44 ignorant with what we have pitch to us
24:46 but save those strange little anomalies
24:50 that I don't know fund some branch of
24:52 some university they do have a pretty
24:55 simple program okay those of you believe
24:59 in Flat Earth some of you will have
25:02 researched it so much like if Eric Dubay
25:04 watch this he would probably argue well
25:07 and the Flat Earth model if you really
25:09 educate yourself and you go down all the
25:11 avenues of everything their system is
25:15 just as easy to adopt as the
25:17 heliocentric system I would wager it's
25:21 not quite as easy and it's just maybe
25:24 that's the way to say it for instance
25:26 the theories of how I think it's mark
25:29 Sargent that did the the model of how
25:31 the stars spin and the reason why the
25:34 North Star for the Northern Hemisphere
25:36 folks is at the center of our spinning
25:38 star map we take you know bulb exposures
25:41 over eight hours at night any reason why
25:44 the Southern Cross is down there in the
25:46 center of their southern hemisphere and
25:48 they spent how can these two things
25:49 merge in the middle and they've done
25:51 this magnifying glass thing to explain
25:55 exactly how that happens because it's
25:57 all a matter of perspective of staring
25:59 up at stars because you're standing
26:01 across you're staying to the middle and
26:02 they actually have explained it I think
26:05 that that is a lot harder for the
26:07 average human being to understand
26:09 whether it be correct or not so we have
26:12 to understand that if it is flat I think
26:15 it's a lot more difficult for folks to
26:17 absorb some of the philosophies okay now
26:22 a flat earth person might look at the
26:24 heliocentric thing and say but there are
26:25 so many contradictions about it being
26:27 round whereby one of these things if you
26:31 took it off take off in a helicopter and
26:33 let's say you're at the equator which is
26:35 supposed to be going a thousand miles an
26:36 hour and you just lift off and
26:39 regardless of the fact that the
26:41 helicopter if attached to the world
26:43 through gravitational forces
26:45 push is technically going a thousand
26:48 miles an hour as well with the soil
26:49 underneath it but as it rises up it
26:52 starts to lose its relationship with the
26:54 ground and therefore if it just to hold
26:57 still as some slowly accelerating curve
27:03 the earth would probably start moving
27:05 away from the helicopter without doing
27:07 anything but just lifting straight up
27:09 because the winds are on their own plane
27:12 of speed obviously the winds are moving
27:14 if it's a heliocentric ball the winds
27:17 would have to be moving a thousand miles
27:18 an hour at the equator 500 miles an hour
27:22 halfway to the North Pole and at the
27:25 North Pole they would be still that's
27:29 very hard to believe once you start
27:31 thinking about the thermodynamics of an
27:34 atmosphere attached to a ball it seems
27:37 strange what a jet flies from Mexico
27:41 City to somewhere you know and the
27:43 vector of the North Pole or just falling
27:45 straight up well they're not attached to
27:47 the ground anymore and the earth is
27:49 supposedly spinning underneath them and
27:51 it's spinning faster to Equator absolute
27:55 zero at the North Pole are close to and
27:59 it's diminishing as you go up so the
28:02 plane should have to correct for the
28:05 spinning of the earth as it goes
28:07 straight up but no such thing occurs and
28:12 so the flatterers people might go yeah
28:13 but that round thing doesn't make any
28:14 goddamn sense at all so both sides are
28:18 plagued with technical issues depending
28:20 on how you want to approach the problem
28:22 one of the biggest ones that I had to
28:24 get over myself was the fact that the
28:27 Sun sets I live in Huntington Beach
28:30 California so when I look at the sunset
28:34 as I do I see the Sun set you know just
28:41 going away and starts going really fast
28:43 I thought well there's the proof that
28:45 it's a ball one the sun's a ball right
28:47 and then this guy did a refracting lens
28:51 experiment with an iphone a lens and a
28:55 picture of the Sun a little l-shaped
28:57 piece of paper
28:59 and he pulls that piece of paper back
29:01 from the lens and the earth are sorry
29:04 that the Sun stayed pretty much the same
29:06 exact size in fact you got just a tad
29:08 bit bigger like a percent bigger and
29:09 it's set on a table through a lens but
29:13 it wasn't setting at all was on a flat
29:15 plane with just a tiny bit of refraction
29:17 which is what our solar or our excuse me
29:20 our atmosphere does naturally and this
29:22 lens was supposedly the exact same
29:24 amount of refraction as the atmosphere
29:26 which can be increased or decreased
29:28 based on whether or not you're in a
29:29 desert or whether or not you're in a
29:31 boughten extra body of water the Sun
29:33 sets with just a little bit of
29:34 refraction on a flat plane at that point
29:37 your mind is blown if you're remotely
29:40 conscious and now the sudden this thing
29:44 that you're so sure of is now up for
29:47 debate where the hell are we now a lot
29:51 of NASA fanboys come into the equation
29:54 and they're usually again they sweat a
29:58 lot they eat too much food I don't know
30:02 what the deal is but they come in and
30:04 they don't want to hear anything and
30:06 they have been told by their mommy and
30:07 their daddies and other fanboys that
30:10 they're completely right about
30:11 everything they've read they've read
30:12 every coffee book about science that
30:14 could possibly get their hands on
30:15 they've never entertained anything other
30:17 than official stories their entire
30:19 life's and I mean every avenue of
30:21 everything aspartame is good for them
30:23 they brush with extra intense fluoride
30:26 toothpaste and so they're just docile to
30:29 the system right but they come in and
30:32 claim that NASA has proven that the
30:35 world is round we've been to the moon we
30:38 are currently on Mars with several
30:40 devices reconnaissance satellites two
30:43 Rovers and they're bullies their big fat
30:47 bullies that haven't been punched in the
30:49 chin and knocked the [ __ ] out right and
30:50 as soon as that happens they'll calm the
30:53 [ __ ] down but it will never happen for
30:54 most of them it's only something bullies
30:57 you know deserve once in their lifetime
31:01 but then you start going oh go on Google
31:04 and look at all of the pictures of Earth
31:07 just bring them all up and tell me what
31:12 do you see you see a bunch of goddamn
31:15 fakery there's at least eight shots that
31:19 they have submitted over the years of
31:21 Earth and it is utterly laughable these
31:25 shots in North America covers two-thirds
31:28 of the Earth's surface in one case super
31:31 green super blue weather systems are
31:34 duplicated like photoshop brushes the
31:37 Apollo 17 Blue Marble shot as a screwed
31:40 up red see depending on what year you
31:41 get the photograph the last super clean
31:44 shot of the earth was a composite and
31:46 they admitted it these ridiculous
31:50 time-lapse gifs that went out with the
31:53 the moon crossing in front of a
31:55 satellite I mean just pathetic
31:57 pathetic attempts to convince the masses
32:00 that they have a full grasp of deep
32:02 orbit which they don't the Petersons was
32:06 a peter projection map
32:07 no one's accounted for the fact that the
32:09 continents are all different shapes than
32:11 the globe's
32:11 represent than Google Earth represents
32:13 and that NASA represents and their
32:15 photographs how's that possible
32:19 so we have our own sort of like and Tifa
32:23 within the organization what about the
32:26 matrix what evidence do we have that we
32:28 live in one because it's an alluring
32:31 thought because if you understand what a
32:35 matrix could be I mean you could watch
32:36 the movie matrix and say it's just like
32:39 that well what is that that is a human
32:42 body stuck in some particular plane we
32:44 just talked about this and they've
32:47 jacked into the consciousness of that
32:49 being to give that being the reality
32:52 that we see all five senses plus all the
32:55 other ones that we don't recognize right
32:57 but what are some of the potential
33:00 places where the matrix has been
33:02 revealed
33:02 I think the matrix is something that we
33:06 see predominantly on the personal level
33:09 maybe a ghost is a sign of a matrix
33:14 maybe the Mandela effect is a sign of a
33:18 matrix if it is not truly an organic
33:21 thing if there's not a result of group
33:27 consciousness a consensus reality as my
33:30 other episode entitled the same thing
33:33 suggests which is that we all sort of
33:36 regionally come up with our realities as
33:38 human beings were hive minding our
33:40 reality which is slightly different than
33:42 a hive mind in a different area because
33:45 as the mediums of communication increase
33:49 we get on the same page and then go back
33:52 and you have books that go overseas
33:54 between two countries between two
33:56 regions and as they learn to speak their
33:57 respective languages they're adjusting
34:00 their perception based on what the book
34:02 says
34:02 Europe looks like but so you haven't
34:04 been to Europe let's say your new Europe
34:06 and you haven't been to North America so
34:08 if you read a bunch of books and look at
34:10 a bunch of photographs that have been
34:11 sent to you you're crafting the reality
34:13 of what it is and then when you come
34:15 over then you join the high of mind you
34:17 already have the training wheels on that
34:19 someone has given you in the form of
34:21 documentation of what you're about to
34:23 experience and so you have mine easily
34:26 but everyone else is believing but now
34:29 we have the internet right it went from
34:31 books to newspapers to radio to
34:33 television to movies at now the internet
34:36 which it can come encapsulate all media
34:38 right written pictorial and movies and
34:42 audio as a matter of fact great so then
34:46 we have some fine-tuning adjustments
34:47 that have to be made you like Whitney's
34:50 a white guy from Yale and not a black
34:51 guy who picked cotton which is the way I
34:53 remember it we have Luke I'm your father
34:56 versus no I'm your father again James
35:00 Earl Jones is taking an interview after
35:02 interview for 30 years straight that was
35:03 Luke I'm your father
35:04 there's plenty of interviews with Mark
35:06 Hamill Sonya and Luke I'm your father
35:08 they're told hey do that line at a
35:11 conference like a cosplay or a Star Wars
35:14 convention
35:14 and they say Luke I'm your father but in
35:17 the script today and the world that I am
35:19 recording in right now it is know I'm
35:21 your father
35:23 right how these things would get off
35:26 ever I don't
35:28 but if we are in a consensus reality
35:31 then I believe the matrix has a lot more
35:34 pull than either of the other two
35:37 realities but it's interesting that
35:40 perhaps the effect of a consensus
35:44 reality is where we have the other two
35:47 theories you're in a matrix it is very
35:51 malleable the gods meaning us probably
35:54 who designed it have put in all kinds of
35:57 safeguards you know and for all the
36:02 years up until five hundred years ago we
36:04 believed it was a round disk four
36:07 corners of the world with the discs in
36:10 the Centers on my right is what the
36:11 picture is always saying but as science
36:13 and different paradigms of thinking
36:15 start to emerge well we start looking at
36:19 the fact that the continents look like
36:21 they fit together
36:23 maybe the continents fitting together in
36:26 a matrix is simply man's way of piecing
36:30 things together we think in puzzles and
36:32 so we made the whole world look like a
36:34 big puzzle piece right yeah well once
36:37 you research expanding earth and look at
36:38 some of the 3-hour lectures online it's
36:41 pretty much in my opinion an undeniable
36:45 either reality of how the world has
36:48 expanded due to being you know injected
36:51 with plasma energy from the plasma ball
36:54 that we call the Sun or for some reason
36:59 it has to do with the way that a disk
37:02 would be created right it's almost like
37:05 a piece of pizza dough right it's the
37:07 Continental stuffs put down on some
37:09 spinning disk or whatever and it's not
37:12 supposed to be spending of course but it
37:14 grows you know it's like sometimes you
37:17 put stuff in a petri dish and it kind of
37:18 solidifies out and breaks and separates
37:21 it would have to have something like
37:23 that but again there's a gentleman who
37:25 has been tracking plates emerging out of
37:28 the Pacific ocean floor for and his
37:32 three-hour lecture he has online which
37:34 I've had a major difficulty finding it
37:36 I'm sure it's not pulled I think it's
37:37 just I it's
37:39 not easily keyword but he says in his 25
37:44 years he has tracked at least two or
37:46 three layers of plates that have come
37:48 out of the bottom of the ocean using
37:49 satellite photographs photographs which
37:52 adds a little bit of credibility to
37:54 satellites because who would go to all
37:57 the trouble of faking these plates
37:59 coming out of the tear down the center
38:01 of the Pacific he's claiming the same
38:04 thing happens in Atlantic but it's so
38:05 much slower which is why the Atlantic is
38:07 much more narrow between Europe and
38:09 America whereas the gap between Asia and
38:12 America is gigantic right because it's a
38:14 weaker crack down the center so it's
38:16 ejecting more new you know more landmass
38:19 which creates the Earth's expansion
38:21 right now what do we gain by figuring
38:25 out as a community right we all come in
38:28 with these three things and I think it's
38:30 important for us just to keep an open
38:33 mind and say well we are trying to
38:36 figure out which one of these is the one
38:39 we really are yeah and if you have a
38:42 very intense disposition to believe one
38:44 or the other that is what I think you
38:47 you communicate to the group and but to
38:50 yourself you go okay I am pretty
38:54 convinced it's one of these three and
38:56 you should tell yourself whichever one
38:58 you believe the most in and then you go
39:00 but if I'm believing it around
39:03 heliocentric ball nASA has completely
39:07 lied about every picture of Earth so I
39:09 really don't have the proof I really
39:11 don't have the proof but I really do
39:12 believe it because it makes a lot of
39:14 sense to my brain I just have a hunch in
39:16 my chest right then you have the flatter
39:20 disk thing and you may feel like you've
39:22 had all the a lot more proof now we've
39:25 got these lakes in Russia that freeze
39:28 over that I think there's one that's 104
39:32 miles long and they've been able to
39:33 shoot a laser down the lake and it still
39:36 hits the target and a straight line they
39:39 can look in a telescope and see the
39:43 other side which you're not supposed to
39:45 be able to see I live in Huntington
39:46 Beach the Catalina Island island is
39:48 straight off the coast from where I am
39:51 you can see the docs from here with a
39:54 zoom camera you can't and you're not
39:56 supposed to be able to it supposed to be
39:58 wait I should be able to see just the
40:00 tips of this place I can see the whole
40:02 thing it's 25 miles out there and yeah
40:05 that's standing at sea level that's
40:07 standing in we have a place called
40:11 Crystal Cove you can look it up on the
40:13 map
40:13 it's right down if you go down to the
40:15 beach it's right down on the water okay
40:19 but you've got a Huntington Beach and
40:21 just stand on the sand down there and
40:24 you can still see it the Bay Area San
40:27 Francisco they have three gigantic
40:31 bridges and in fact I think I have four
40:35 Embarcadero San Mateo the Bay Bridge in
40:38 San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge and
40:42 people have gone back far enough such
40:44 that the pylons that hold up the bridge
40:47 are supposed to be over the curve and
40:49 when they zoom in and zoom in and zoom
40:51 in there's the bottom of the pylon
40:53 it's crazy there is a video where
40:55 someone was at some tropical resort and
40:58 they shot their camera across the
41:00 tropical resort and you cannot see the
41:01 bottom of the hotel's it's still not as
41:07 curved as it's supposed to be but it's
41:08 definitely curved maybe because of the
41:12 water the lens effect that we saw with
41:14 the Sun pulling back is what's causing
41:16 us to not be able to see the bottom
41:18 because it's refracting the light and
41:20 the matrix there was an amazing thing
41:22 that they put in the movie that which
41:24 asked your brothers did an amazing job
41:26 with this which is deja vu deja vu
41:32 what is deja vu you have a premonition
41:35 of what is about to occur in your near
41:37 future now there are false deja Vu's
41:41 that will occur I give you one of the
41:43 examples I've given over the last three
41:45 years which is when I was a kid and you
41:47 had a telephone you did how many cell
41:51 phones you would be like I would be
41:54 reading a book and this is when it
41:57 usually happened and I would go oh my
41:58 god the phone's gonna ring and then it
42:00 would ring I thought oh my god I've had
42:02 a deja vu
42:03 and I have felt the future what I now
42:07 believe had occurred was that I was so
42:09 in deep concentration into my book that
42:12 the first ring went into my head
42:14 I didn't consciously realize it but I
42:16 subconsciously realized it then my brain
42:19 floats the information up to my
42:21 consciousness and I go oh my god the
42:23 phone is ringing not it's going to ring
42:25 right but I've had a true deja vu where
42:32 I predicted the future and it occurred
42:33 and it stunned an adult in the room okay
42:36 so if you've heard this if your og
42:38 listeners there's a prize for you guys I
42:41 was about that goes 11 years old I just
42:45 moved to Massachusetts I was upstairs
42:48 unpacking my stuff it's broad daylight
42:49 I'm in a house it's a duplex but the
42:52 same family owns both sides as a
42:53 business on the left and house on the
42:55 right the mother was downstairs cooking
42:59 macaroni and cheese the young five year
43:01 old was outside playing in the yard and
43:04 that was it it was the three of us so I
43:06 got done pushing my stuff in these
43:09 cardboard boxes and which is my
43:12 makeshift dresser when I was first there
43:13 and I get up and I go downstairs and I
43:16 turned the corner and I'm going into the
43:19 kitchen now I walk into the kitchen and
43:22 I have a head rush now technically
43:25 speaking could have been a legitimate
43:27 head rush I was hunched down putting
43:29 stuff in a box I'm a small person you
43:31 know actually about 11:00 I was a little
43:34 over five feet but I get up turn the
43:37 corner and I go down the stairs and I
43:38 turned the corner now I'm not having any
43:40 deja vu or excuse me I'm not having you
43:42 lightheadedness as I'm going down the
43:43 stairs which usually in my experience
43:45 with lightheadedness like if I pop out
43:47 of bed too soon and rush into the
43:49 bathroom in the morning sometimes I'm
43:50 like whoa you were just down for eight
43:52 hours chill out you know but I had
43:55 distinctly the super purple vision you
43:59 should get this all the time as a kid
44:00 and I do not have it as an adult which
44:02 is very strange but I no sooner walk in
44:05 this kitchen which is a big barn looking
44:07 kitchen and the mother is straight ahead
44:11 of me in the corner of the kitchen area
44:14 with the stove is and she is mixing that
44:16 last
44:17 now putting the cheese in the macaroni
44:19 and she's looking at me and she goes
44:21 would you like some macaroni and cheese
44:23 of course the answer is yes but I start
44:26 blacking out hardcore I black out and I
44:31 put my right hand on my I put my left
44:33 hand on my head and she's like are you
44:35 okay and I point to the door which is to
44:40 my right and I said someone's gonna be
44:42 at that door and they're gonna be hurt
44:45 no sooner did I finish boom boom boom
44:48 boom boom and the kid starts crying
44:50 outside she's looking at me the mother
44:53 of that child which is always that you
44:54 know there's always a maternal
44:55 protection thing going on and she's just
44:58 stunned just looking at me sure enough
45:00 the dog bit the kid on the stomach so
45:02 bad he had to be rushed to the hospital
45:04 to get stitches she never came back and
45:07 talked to me about it but I totally
45:09 predicted it right in front of her face
45:11 that's a real deja vu people that's a
45:14 real one feels like the matrix doesn't
45:17 it somehow I got the script ahead of
45:21 time you know somehow and I didn't have
45:25 the feeling of the event outside then I
45:28 was predicting it coming inside
45:30 I had only the vision and the feeling of
45:33 it right where it occurred the door the
45:36 banging and the someone being hurt I
45:38 didn't predict anyone would be crying I
45:40 certainly didn't think the dog but the
45:43 kid on the stomach I mean that's a weird
45:44 thing to happen I was some beagle dog -
45:46 it wasn't like some German Shepherd or
45:48 some Doberman pincer who has a habit of
45:51 doing more aggressive things if you're a
45:53 jerk-off kid punching the kid punching
45:55 the dog in the face right the entire
45:57 thing about Walt Disney that I mentioned
46:00 in the episode 314 and many episodes
46:04 back right how did I know that Bob Kerr
46:06 was in the park how did I see you know
46:10 wall doesn't he come up to me and say
46:11 Bob burrs over there while Disney's been
46:13 dead since 1965
46:15 you know Bob used to work for Walt you
46:19 know these guys are buddies and he's
46:20 there and it's Imagineering day how does
46:24 that happen it feels like the matrix
46:27 doesn't it
46:28 how many of you since you would say your
46:32 awoke or woke which I love by the way
46:37 think that you see more now you see more
46:41 everywhere you go you see more in your
46:43 family more in yourself you look in the
46:45 mirror and you see different things and
46:47 you're not so sure about the fabric of
46:50 the universe anymore you think about
46:53 Roswell crash and the fact that these
46:55 people who gave first first-hand
46:59 testimony
47:01 seem to be telling the truth so it looks
47:04 like we got visited by something else is
47:08 that the dome owners of those aliens
47:12 from another planet and it's
47:14 heliocentric is it the programmers of
47:17 the matrix or maybe they are utility
47:22 BOTS that come down to help us out well
47:24 they haven't really made any contact
47:26 with mankind I mean they had this little
47:27 accident and Roswell looks like and for
47:31 those of you who are new to this show I
47:33 went in to disprove Roswell a hundred
47:37 percent I'd written articles on the
47:39 power of the myth of Roswell and how it
47:41 empowers the military to look like they
47:43 have more technology than they have
47:45 it's a feeble way to say that man
47:47 couldn't have ended velcro which is a
47:49 natural occurrence and plants we
47:52 couldn't invent fiber optics but we knew
47:55 that glass has moved light
47:57 instantaneously for thousands of years
47:59 and we extrude every every single
48:02 substance that we have through holes we
48:06 do it we do it with eye beams we do with
48:08 everything so making glass lines or
48:11 glass pipes little tubes is something
48:14 that was naturally occurring anyway now
48:17 the silicon chip is definitely a stroke
48:20 of massive genius
48:21 I don't offhand remember the gentleman
48:24 or the women that contributed to that
48:28 but that is unbelievably amazing but so
48:30 is an automatic transmission block and a
48:33 car it's just as equally amazing and I
48:37 don't believe anyone's claimed that the
48:38 UFOs came down with automatic
48:40 transmissions at Lee
48:42 use fluids to change gears right to pull
48:44 a clutch off and go to the next year the
48:46 next year unbelievably brilliant
48:48 technology if you've ever seen one now
48:51 I'm in a very unique position with this
48:54 show because I do read your comments I
48:58 don't get into every single debate
49:03 that's out there because you know when
49:04 you guys reply to each other I'm
49:06 starting to get notifications of those
49:10 as well it's hard to follow all the sub
49:13 conversations I listen to all the sub
49:16 conversations and I am not seeing
49:19 anything conclusive in any one of these
49:22 realms
49:22 I see great evidence for all of the
49:26 realms of our reality do I wish that one
49:32 would take the lead over another hmm I'm
49:37 not convinced I do I should right I
49:39 should want to know exactly where we are
49:41 and that's it because I believe we are a
49:44 symbiotic being I think that regardless
49:49 of where we are there's a lot more to
49:51 this game than just any one of those
49:54 three realities they always tell you
49:57 especially if you read Kurt's Wells
49:58 garbage out of the singularity project
50:02 and I mean garbage man he is so positive
50:06 that he understands human consciousness
50:10 he is so positive that we are controlled
50:13 by our brain as in the gray matter and
50:17 the synapse that are in our brain and
50:19 you hear me talk about increasing your
50:21 synapse by using your mind and that kind
50:23 of stuff I do think that we are a
50:25 vehicle that taps into the soul energy
50:29 that is part of the entire universe the
50:32 stream of consciousness or the river of
50:34 consciousness that philip k dick talked
50:36 about when he wrote it is another way of
50:39 describing the river of consciousness
50:42 that supposedly Nostradamus would see
50:44 when he looked into the flame of a
50:45 candle now well then that guy was real
50:48 or not I don't know but Phil ok dick was
50:49 very real Phil ok dick had massive
50:52 predictions in his lifetime
50:55 okay and one of the reasons why I'm so
50:58 flippin about the fact that I don't
51:01 believe the brain is all of our
51:03 consciousness is that the some of you
51:08 have seen that the gentleman and there's
51:09 several of these people in the world but
51:12 there was a gentleman I think here in
51:13 Los Angeles but I could be wrong about
51:16 the city he was a victim of a shotgun
51:19 blast to the head and you can look at
51:22 I'll probably try to find this
51:24 photograph for you guys it's pretty he's
51:26 all healed up like he's got his skin
51:28 back on his head but he lost at least a
51:31 third of his skull third of his front of
51:35 his head there various illnesses and I
51:38 can't remember the exact illness that
51:40 causes this but there's a surgery where
51:41 they remove one half of your brain I
51:44 mean the top half of your brain one left
51:47 side of your brain or right side of your
51:49 brain and you're paralyzed in the
51:51 opposite hemisphere of your body for a
51:53 little while until your other half takes
51:55 over the part that's paralyzed again
51:59 according to all of the curt's what kind
52:01 of people you would be permanently
52:02 damaged and there wouldn't be any way to
52:04 recover for the individual that lost the
52:06 top front half of his head
52:10 he would have lost his frontal lobes
52:12 well that is 10th amount to a shotgun
52:16 lobotomy but he's fine he's in videos
52:20 I've told this story a couple times and
52:22 I wish it was 1985 again I could get
52:25 this a gentleman's name and have a
52:27 sit-down conversation with the guy but
52:29 my grandmother was a one of my
52:31 grandmother's was a teacher for fifth
52:33 grade for 36 years absolutely loved by
52:36 her students and one summer afternoon I
52:40 came over or maybe was like dinnertime
52:42 to my grandmother and she always had
52:45 students that would come by her house
52:46 and visit her and this kid comes over
52:50 and I can't remember how old he said he
52:52 was but he was a Top Gun pilot but he
52:55 had recently had a medical condition
52:57 that he had checked out and he said he
53:01 was getting headaches and he couldn't
53:03 get rid of the headaches and they're
53:04 getting worse and worse and so he got
53:06 pulled out a flying which is his whole
53:08 life
53:09 and he got his head scans and he had to
53:13 tell my grandmother that his brain was
53:17 about the size of a lime or a small
53:22 lemon inside of his head it was a
53:25 miniature brain on the tip of his brain
53:28 stem well she said he was a glowing
53:33 student all the way through graduation
53:34 everybody in town said you know this kid
53:36 was really smart obviously became a top
53:38 gun pilot so he was mechanically super
53:41 inclined right but he didn't have the
53:43 big cerebellum that human beings have he
53:46 didn't have big frontal lobes in anyone
53:48 had he didn't have a brain as big as the
53:50 rest of us I don't know if he died I
53:53 don't know what happened to this guy it
53:55 would seem that he would have
53:56 increasingly bad medical problems when
53:59 the brain gets a lot of water on it and
54:00 you see hydrocephalic children the brain
54:02 you know their whole skull gets gigantic
54:05 and they usually have tremendous
54:07 problems functioning and so they
54:10 typically are categorized into a some
54:14 level of mental retardation right I've
54:17 had two family two families that I've
54:19 known over my lifetime with a child
54:21 suffering from this and it's a it's a
54:23 hell of a thing let me tell you but this
54:25 guy was fine so according to Kurt's well
54:29 he doesn't have the hardware the
54:31 physical hardware to be a human being to
54:34 be conscious the second that child was
54:36 born with a small brain inside of his
54:38 skull according to Kurt's will he be
54:41 done he wouldn't have he wouldn't have
54:43 ever achieved consciousness like the
54:45 rest of us I had an uncle who died leave
54:53 at the age of 26 he was a married in
54:56 uncle married my aunt and he had a car
55:00 accident and he broke his brainstem he
55:03 fell out of a car but went off the side
55:06 of a hill his body was fine he bumped
55:09 the side of his head on a rock because
55:11 he wasn't wearing a seat belt
55:12 it was just prior to that becoming sort
55:14 of a natural thing for everyone too
55:16 attached you know when you get in a car
55:17 so in the mid 80s and he died but his
55:21 body continued living
55:23 and I've heard this several times once
55:27 you break your brainstem you are brain
55:30 dead gone
55:32 your body can continue going the
55:34 autonomic system keeps running but it
55:37 seems that tampering with a brainstem is
55:40 the most deadly thing that can occur to
55:42 a human being so when you just look at
55:47 it for the base foundational facts that
55:50 you get from this sort of experience it
55:53 would seem that that might be the place
55:55 where our consciousness attaches to the
56:00 human being what's interesting about
56:02 that theory is that Hollywood has
56:07 portrayed that at least in one Star Trek
56:10 episode where something crawls into the
56:12 back of the neck of folks and it takes
56:16 over the brain of a human being you have
56:18 black mirrors where they put a little
56:19 mushroom on the back of the brainstem
56:21 and control a virtual reality /
56:23 augmented reality experience for the
56:25 human being and you have dark City which
56:29 is a very similar thing so it would seem
56:32 that there's a stream of consciousness
56:33 within writers who have to find special
56:37 stories that they have kind of come to
56:39 the same conclusion the base of the
56:41 brain the brainstem which attaches to
56:45 your nervous system is this critical
56:47 critical point
56:48 those who study the pineal gland
56:49 understand that the pineal gland sits
56:51 right on top of the brainstem but those
56:55 of you have recently discovered that the
56:57 pineal gland under certain angles looks
56:59 very much like the the decorative eye
57:04 that is the Egyptian eye with the makeup
57:09 and all that as if they realized and
57:12 they always did they always knew that
57:13 there was this inner eye which is what
57:15 the Cobra right in front of your your
57:17 third eye of your forehead right the
57:20 gurus of India believed in a third eye
57:22 right here in the center of your
57:24 forehead that he goes right back into
57:26 the pineal gland and gives you extra
57:28 sight more of the spiritual realm right
57:32 so I believe that there's Clues all over
57:35 the place
57:36 that sort of I don't know maybe makes
57:41 the Battle of realities moot until we
57:43 can figure out what's right here inside
57:46 the human vessel I just found a video of
57:50 a little girl talking to someone on the
57:52 telephone I mean this little girl is
57:54 maybe a year and a half she has full
57:56 speech capabilities and I mean she was
58:00 speaking like she was 30 years old and
58:02 that's no exaggeration I put it in here
58:07 but it was probably copyrighted at some
58:08 point but this little girl is having a
58:12 conversation and she is imitating she's
58:15 only not only speaking beautifully about
58:18 where she went today and where she's
58:19 going but she's imitating some people
58:22 that she had actually spoken to earlier
58:24 in that day and she is mocking you know
58:28 someone who uses the word like a lot
58:30 right like this like that like this and
58:33 it was brilliant and so I sent this
58:36 around a few of my friends just because
58:37 it's cute as can be and what-what
58:40 unanimous thing that I get back in
58:42 return that is a very very old soul
58:46 isn't it reincarnation like on an
58:50 episode on it if you're interested in it
58:52 the idea is that the Christians will say
58:56 that reincarnation doesn't happen
58:57 because that's a violation against God
58:59 well again what do Christians try to
59:02 sell you salvation how do they do it
59:04 they take your money especially the
59:07 Catholic Church so if you think you're
59:09 coming back why do you have to pay for
59:11 salvation you're coming back God
59:15 supposedly spends a lot of time creating
59:17 this universe as a big amusement park
59:19 ride but it's it's heinous to write it
59:21 twice in China you have to get
59:24 permission to be reincarnated in the
59:28 Hindu world you get reincarnated in the
59:30 Tibetan world you get reincarnated
59:33 people who try to control your brain
59:36 don't want you to have these thoughts
59:39 now one of the toughest things that I'm
59:41 going to close on is this I always tell
59:44 you to go with your you know your gut
59:45 instinct about truth that you have a
59:48 feeling when you believe something
59:50 is true and you have another feeling
59:51 when you believe something that has been
59:53 portrayed to you is true but it's false
59:56 I'm always telling you that you're made
59:58 of complete truth you are if you weren't
60:02 made of truth and you'd have an
60:03 algorithm inside yourself that is false
60:05 and then that would not operate properly
60:07 and you would unravel as a human being
60:11 you'd unravel physically because the
60:13 laws of physics the whole the universe
60:14 together wouldn't work right and you
60:16 would unravel
60:17 maybe spiritually it doesn't happen that
60:21 way
60:21 you're fine when I see someone all
60:24 butthurt about anything that has been
60:27 claimed as true but to be the moon
60:29 missions around earth flat disk or a
60:32 matrix or other theories
60:34 I think I'm smelling fear now if I came
60:39 up to you and I said what's your name
60:42 and you told me your name and I said no
60:44 it's not you'd look at me and go the
60:48 Attis I know my name i've been called
60:50 this my entire life i know it's not I
60:53 start pounding you and pounding you and
60:55 pounding you you're gonna get you're
60:57 gonna think I'm nuts now if I continue
61:00 to follow you around like the Cable Guy
61:02 you're gonna go get the hell away from
61:04 me and you'll get angry but up until
61:05 that point if we're just sitting in a
61:07 room you just gonna think man this guy
61:08 is crazy he's trying to tell me I'm not
61:10 who I am I think the way that we view
61:13 people that disagree with us about
61:14 things very vehement Lee is that we have
61:17 to kind of pull back and go hmm maybe
61:20 this person is afraid that that it's
61:24 true we didn't go the moon you know now
61:28 you will hear me be very flippant about
61:33 folks that believe in the Big Bang so
61:37 I'm not very friendly with folks that
61:39 toss that in my face and say you just
61:42 totally don't understand things for me
61:45 that's very similar to someone saying
61:47 that Jesus existed because they read the
61:49 Bible well let me read the Bible to you
61:52 and prove to you that this is real they
61:56 jump into their paradigm of belief of
61:59 indoctrination and try to speak from
62:03 that point
62:03 instead of speak from the outside and
62:05 put some logic into its entire formation
62:08 and existence if your big break Big Bang
62:12 fan the thing I would suggest that you
62:15 do is look up on YouTube every single
62:18 lecture of Joseph Campbell and
62:21 especially his lectures on the myths of
62:25 the creation of the universe because of
62:29 all the people I've seen debate these
62:32 things or speak on it he has one of the
62:36 most gentle souls of any person I think
62:38 he's ever lived who had to refute common
62:43 belief systems within the world he was
62:46 very kind very generous with the way
62:49 that he chose his words he was able to
62:52 speak to an entire class that most
62:54 likely believed different than him upon
62:56 entering his class that maybe they had
62:58 different beliefs when they left but he
63:01 didn't make anyone feel uncomfortable in
63:04 hearing the old myths of man and again
63:08 that one lecture I saw I studied him
63:10 like crazy when I was getting into
63:11 screenwriting because people pointed me
63:13 in his direction
63:14 it's just important to note where we've
63:16 been to know where we're going if you're
63:19 gonna write screenplays that deal with
63:21 such matters you need to have a good
63:23 foundation and he is one of the most
63:26 ultimate sources of this of his
63:28 knowledge but he tells the story of
63:31 creation and what's interesting was he
63:34 never mentioned the Big Bang that I can
63:36 remember but what he was explaining was
63:38 the Big Bang God woke up God was a
63:41 sleeping creature and he woke up and
63:42 when he woke up he exploded and his
63:45 explosion of his body showed all the
63:47 particles into the universe and the
63:49 first part of the first version of the
63:50 story was that it landed on the planets
63:52 and we are his pieces and parts but the
63:55 planet was already here and it
63:57 eventually someone challenged whoever
63:59 was passing on that story orally with
64:01 well where did the Sun and the earth
64:02 come from and they retold the story well
64:05 that came from God as well that was his
64:08 belt buckle or something I think most of
64:11 you know who were hardcore listeners
64:13 that science has become a religion
64:15 big capitalists you are evil if you
64:21 don't believe what the scientists say
64:23 the scientists science in general as the
64:26 religion has completely stagnated right
64:29 again when I was researching things as a
64:31 kid you would read that every 30 years
64:34 or so the entire paradigm of mathematics
64:37 of physics of cosmology
64:39 all changed in fact medical science
64:43 psychological science at all changed the
64:45 philosophies of how to deal with the
64:47 incoming data changed right in
64:50 psychology in the last 10 years we've
64:52 had super epiphanies about PTSD we
64:58 finally understand how it occurs and now
65:00 we're able to come up with therapies
65:02 that have over 80 percent success rates
65:05 we know what TMS is back pain and body
65:08 pain that is created through psychosis
65:11 through feelings that are very repressed
65:14 inside of our of our minds some people
65:17 were abused as children some people just
65:19 had traumatic PTSD type moments and when
65:22 the when that hard memory comes back to
65:25 the conscious mind the mind starves
65:28 muscle tissue of oxygen creating pain to
65:32 them fort your mind excuse me from
65:35 having that emotion and so through
65:39 psychotherapy they have over an 80%
65:41 success rate of getting rid of all back
65:43 pain and muscle pain that is created
65:47 through your brain but how brilliant is
65:49 the brain to do that
65:50 it's phenomenal right I just watched an
65:53 episode of Frasier where he had back
65:55 pain he got up on his birthday and his
65:58 birthday was racking his consciousness
66:00 he was realizing he's alone he doesn't
66:03 have a female companion and he had
66:05 massive back pain they never mentioned
66:08 TMS but it was in the mid 90s when they
66:10 these clinics were starting to open so
66:11 whoever wrote that episode understood
66:13 the science that was coming around
66:15 around that time I think the year was
66:18 1999 actually one of the analogies I
66:22 like to think about when I think about
66:23 man's open-mindedness and the rewards
66:26 for having an open mind
66:28 for me relate to the settlers of America
66:32 especially in the 1700s and beyond what
66:39 happened a bunch of Europeans came over
66:41 and obviously unfortunately massacred
66:44 the indigenous Native Americans that
66:47 lived here once you can get past that
66:50 history they started migrating West not
66:54 knowing how far it's gonna be before
66:55 they hit ocean now my family started in
66:59 Virginia in the 1630s and managed to
67:02 make it to Kansas one wing I guess went
67:07 up to Seattle but that was much later in
67:09 the 20th century but they went to Kansas
67:13 they were farmers and so they found a
67:18 place that was completely like their
67:19 homeland which was Germany and I guess
67:22 one place in England we're not sure if
67:24 they ever spent much time anyway but
67:26 some people kept going didn't they they
67:29 looked at Kansas and now I guess is okay
67:31 but you know I'm looking for a bigger
67:33 brand of macaroni let's keep going now
67:36 the Donner Party paid a heavy price for
67:39 for doing what they did but people kept
67:43 going and eventually got to the coast
67:46 what did they find a beautiful coastline
67:50 where I am I think it's one of the best
67:52 places I've ever been in the on the
67:54 planet where it has heavy industry and
67:57 beautiful coastlines you can get
67:59 employed and enjoy a nice life it's
68:02 tough California's tough but when I meet
68:06 folks in here having originated from the
68:08 Midwest and I've been in California for
68:09 over 30 years I now see and meet people
68:15 whose families go back a hundred years
68:17 or more and there's an interesting thing
68:21 about them there's a ruggedness about
68:23 them there's a beauty about them too
68:25 which is interesting their family had
68:29 the insight to keep going for something
68:33 better when they reached the coast well
68:35 you know what you do go across the ocean
68:36 yeah why this is beautiful and I'm gonna
68:40 stay here I'm gonna build here
68:42 what's great about Orange County is that
68:44 it encapsulate some of the best city's
68:46 most beautiful cities that California
68:48 has to offer
68:50 Malibu is off obviously very pretty as
68:52 well god bless them you know and the
68:54 fires up there but it's fascinating
68:57 their families got in here early their
69:00 families bought a little plot of land
69:01 for nothing there's the amount of
69:03 stories I have of family members or
69:06 sorry family members that I know in this
69:07 area not of mine that bought an
69:10 applauded land for $35,000 put a house
69:13 on it down a Balboa Island before anyone
69:16 really realized that you could actually
69:17 live there and now that piece of
69:19 property is worth anywhere from two to
69:22 five million dollars depending on where
69:24 it is exactly that's phenomenal
69:27 they gave their family a real estate
69:31 empire just with a single piece of
69:33 property and some of them were smart
69:34 enough to buy a lot of property they
69:37 also lived in a beautiful area where the
69:39 weather is great average temperature 73
69:41 degrees I'm sitting in 73 degree
69:45 temperatures while the East Coast is
69:47 canceling all of their flights Houston
69:49 just got snow today
69:51 interesting right I think that's how we
69:55 need to be with our perception of
69:58 reality keep your mind open
70:01 keep searching one we want a very
70:04 thorough understanding of what could be
70:06 before we decide what is how long will
70:10 it take before the average human being
70:12 can prove to themself whether or not
70:13 this is a flat disc a round ball or a
70:16 matrix well whether or not we can prove
70:19 it's a matrix that's a tough one that's
70:21 the toughest one of them all because it
70:23 would be a simulation that is designed
70:25 to simulate whatever reality the
70:28 designers have come up with so maybe not
70:30 I'm not sure maybe a Hadron Collider
70:34 could prove it I don't know I hate to
70:36 have someone push control delete on the
70:38 whole thing right and we're both in it
70:40 right but I think within the next 50
70:42 years or so probably definitely within a
70:45 hundred years the average human being
70:47 will gain the access to look at the
70:49 world from at least 10,000 miles away
70:54 whether it be through
70:56 buttocks where we can't actually live in
70:58 the Van Allen belts but we can put a
70:59 robot up there that we all trust the
71:02 space agencies that exist today are
71:04 dissolved through their exposure of
71:07 fraud and a new space agency exists
71:11 where we put a camera on a vehicle built
71:14 by the people for the people and it
71:16 launches and it goes into orbit and the
71:18 camera never turns off there's no silent
71:21 phase [ __ ] and then eventually it
71:24 creates enough distance an orbital
71:26 pattern that you get the the view of
71:31 Earth right but if we close our minds
71:34 and we adopt one of these paradigms and
71:38 we don't push everything that we can
71:40 push forward what's going to happen to
71:42 mankind we might live for thousands and
71:45 thousands of years in a complete
71:49 make-believe universe never
71:52 understanding where we are never getting
71:56 the answers to these questions now
71:59 there's some people that believe in the
72:01 either either of the universes and they
72:04 believe that of the flat or the round
72:05 and they believe that God is going to
72:08 return in their lifetime it's one of the
72:09 classic things that you'll hear from
72:11 every Christian that's ever born the
72:14 Second Coming is right around the corner
72:16 right we're in the end times they always
72:19 think it's the end times but it never
72:21 seems to end does it if there's an
72:25 omnipotent being that is the universe
72:29 that we refer to as God most often then
72:35 you can assume I think that that being
72:38 would have complete mathematical
72:40 understanding of the universe but
72:43 creating a temporary instance of a life
72:45 force in a container on a ball inside of
72:48 a bigger container called the universe
72:51 that he-she it could before creating it
72:58 deduce where it would end up in a final
73:00 state it's similar for man it would be
73:04 if you could hit a cue ball and give it
73:07 infinite
73:09 ability to maintain a certain speed on
73:13 the plane of a pool table you know
73:17 eventually it will go into a pocket it
73:19 just will and we understand that is
73:21 human beings that's a simple one for us
73:24 for some omnipotent being with infinite
73:27 supercomputer power even though we can't
73:31 conceive of where every air molecule is
73:33 and every grain of sand and every star
73:35 and all those other elements that we
73:37 deal with the human consciousness and
73:39 it's very varied thoughts that might go
73:41 through I'm assuming that this being if
73:44 it existed has the full grasp of all
73:46 those things and why because they exist
73:49 that's why so turning it off at some
73:52 future point in time I'm not sure what
73:55 the value would be why do it if you're
73:58 not going to let it go we as human
74:01 beings have a beginning a middle and an
74:04 end and so we imposed that paradigm on
74:06 everything around us don't we well
74:10 everything has a beginning and middle
74:11 end the Sun has a beginning a middle and
74:13 end maybe it does but does energy have a
74:16 beginning in the middle and an end
74:18 does ether simply cease to exist at some
74:21 point I don't think so as I've said and
74:25 my reincarnation episode you can't hide
74:28 energy in the universe you can't make it
74:30 disappear you might be able to make it
74:32 form into something different but that's
74:35 the maximum that you can do you have to
74:37 deal with the fact that there's an is a
74:40 man isn't prepared to deal with it is
74:42 that's why people lean so hard on Big
74:44 Bang because it makes them one with the
74:46 universe well even the universe has a
74:48 Big Bang and I know that so I dia that
74:51 it keeps going back and forth back and
74:52 forth
74:53 but even if you study Hawking stuff
74:55 you'll say look if that's even true then
74:58 this is pretty deterministic because
75:02 it's going to be unified as it explodes
75:04 and unified as it expands and unified as
75:06 it contracts and it goes back and forth
75:08 technically speaking when he thought it
75:12 through he said well everything's going
75:13 to happen in reverse when it starts to
75:17 collapse we're gonna start going back in
75:19 the womb of our of our mothers we're
75:22 gonna literally
75:22 we're all out of the ground we're gonna
75:24 crawl to the grave into a living body as
75:26 an old person or to get younger and
75:27 younger and hurt until we crawl into our
75:29 mother's sick as that man I'll just
75:32 remind you that the imaginary number in
75:35 mathematics is an AI how do we pull all
75:40 things in English at least we put an s
75:42 on the end don't we so it is is the
75:47 maximum plural of the infinite imaginary
75:52 number of I I hope you feel me on this
75:55 one interested in your comments again we
76:00 need to be in a constant debate until we
76:03 can come up with
76:05 conclusive proof of one or the other one
76:09 of the three I think the stages would
76:12 have to go round or disk we figure that
76:15 out first and then we figure out in
76:18 addition to one of those two shapes is
76:21 this a matrix we see right away right
76:25 now that reality always seems to parrot
76:32 and mimic man's capability to conceive
76:36 in every step that we increase our
76:38 conceptual ability of the universe we
76:41 simply say that is what it is don't tell
76:44 me any different the second that the
76:46 entire world can conceive of something
76:48 new what we change our paradigm right it
76:53 took a long time to get round to
76:55 circumvent and Trump flat because
76:58 everyone had to understand and expand
77:00 their mind I mean I think of think of a
77:04 average adult 2,000 years ago in average
77:08 Europe at least it was flat they lived
77:12 in a tiny community they didn't travel
77:14 they didn't have cars trains or planes
77:16 or automobiles or anything right now we
77:19 can travel now we can go to Europe and
77:23 Australia and Asia and Russia and India
77:26 and all these different locations South
77:28 America North America Africa so we know
77:30 there's other places that exist and that
77:32 helped us expand our minds
77:34 is that the pin tulta meant experience
77:38 for mankind I don't think so
77:42 those that have died and seen something
77:44 else and come back to life they have a
77:47 different belief as well now there are
77:49 folks that I do want to touch on this
77:51 first one second there are folks that
77:53 have even reported in the comments that
77:56 they have friends that have passed away
77:57 that saw nothing and so and I had a
78:00 friend of mine that had the same thing
78:01 in the bel-air Country Club he had a
78:03 heart attack and essentially his heart
78:07 wasn't pumping his brain was still
78:09 working but he was revived through a
78:12 defibrillator they had on the wall and
78:14 he lived to see another day had some
78:17 heart surgery and I talked to him about
78:20 he says man I saw nothing he goes I just
78:21 went to sleep and I saw blackness and
78:24 then I woke back up again but he goes it
78:25 really felt like nothing had occurred so
78:28 some people will be concerned about that
78:30 who previously believed there's
78:32 something out afterwards or they were
78:33 keeping their mind open and they heard a
78:35 friend of theirs say man there was
78:37 nothing my only caution to you about
78:39 writing off the afterlife after having
78:42 that conversation is that maybe they
78:45 weren't as dead as you thought they were
78:46 and just because the doctor pronounces
78:48 you dead
78:49 doesn't mean they have a full grasp on
78:51 where your consciousness is and where
78:53 your brains functioning is and all that
78:55 kind of stuff I think there have been
78:58 enough people that have documented
79:00 especially recently the last 10 years
79:03 their experiences from decades ago to
79:06 just recently and again I had in the
79:09 last year of mine I've I've had second
79:13 hand knowledge of a very close friend of
79:16 mine was telling me about two of their
79:18 friends that had accidents had passed
79:22 away had floated away from their body
79:24 and started going towards some sinner
79:26 consciousness there was no Jesus there
79:28 was no religious paradigm to speak of
79:30 any kind and they came back to life and
79:34 they this person told me that these are
79:37 two close friends of her and she told me
79:40 she goes you know they were angry that
79:43 they came back to their bodies and I
79:45 said whoa that's that's a new one right
79:47 I said why were they angry and she said
79:50 because they said that the other side
79:52 was painless and beautiful and perfect
79:55 and they never felt more content in
79:58 their entire existence than when they
79:59 were drifting away from their body they
80:01 could see it and they went off into the
80:03 universe
80:05 that's a first for me to hear that but
80:08 that actually has more validity to me
80:10 than someone saying they see the
80:13 stairway to heaven sort of thing right
80:16 even that beam of light story that you
80:18 hear a lot doesn't have any religious
80:20 connotations believing in a central
80:23 consciousness well once you understand
80:26 that everything that's alive is
80:27 absolutely gorgeous you start to realize
80:30 we have designers right I saw this funny
80:34 spoof there's the guy online that does
80:37 the spoof on documenting various
80:39 creatures of the world he's a brilliant
80:41 brilliant dude it was on the Dragonfly
80:44 and once you start seeing the you know
80:46 designs of insects it's just phenomenal
80:48 but everything he's ever covered has
80:50 been gorgeous all the animals he's ever
80:52 covered have just been brilliantly
80:54 designed with paint jobs and color
80:56 schemes and you know I saw one on a
80:58 pigeon the other day and I always
81:00 thought pigeons were like you know rats
81:02 with wings because they're annoying [ __ ]
81:04 on everything but this pigeon had the
81:07 most beautiful feathers that had like a
81:09 purple knack that turned into green and
81:11 turned into gray it was just
81:12 unbelievably gorgeous bird once you pull
81:15 it away from the New York setting of
81:17 crapping on your black car right so
81:20 there's a lot for us to learn the key is
81:23 to keep the open mind the key is to
81:25 regulate your anger you don't need to go
81:28 through the kubler-ross thing yet you
81:30 don't when we think we've got absolute
81:33 bona fide proof from an agency that we
81:35 recognize this truth-telling
81:37 organization maybe then if we had a
81:40 thought that was different than the
81:42 information coming in we have to divorce
81:44 ourselves from our previous paradigms
81:46 right I think that's it
81:49 if you haven't been to deep thoughts
81:51 radio Calm that's a jump off point
81:52 there's audio video a locked Facebook
81:55 group and a patreon page for those of
81:57 you support the page in any way shape or
81:59 form I appreciate you very much
82:01 please come back for more there are
82:03 another 80 some episodes to do this the
82:06 season we'll get to it I'm in a good
82:09 phase where I can crank these things out
82:11 and get my work done at the same time so
82:13 we'll be steady for a few months here
82:16 anyway take care of yourself and someone
82:18 else and I'll see in the next deep
82:19 thoughts over now
82:21 [Music]
82:36 tube of a jet I mean it's our a [ __ ]
82:39 that we did
