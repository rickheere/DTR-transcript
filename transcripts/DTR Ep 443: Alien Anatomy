00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts today we're doing another
00:36 garage episode which I haven't done in a
00:39 really long time I there's a huge storm
00:43 coming but the weather is good and I
00:46 feel like recording so this would be a
00:49 first a nighttime garage shot still
00:52 working on the lighting here hopefully
00:54 it looks okay so you know I love talking
00:57 about aliens and anything anything out
01:01 there that's sort of space sort of alien
01:04 sort of something to do with our reality
01:08 and so but you know I've also chewed up
01:11 a lot of topics and some sitting there
01:13 going damn like there's got to be like
01:17 an infinite amount of subjects but I
01:20 just haven't found them all yet and you
01:23 know it what's interesting is full
01:25 disclosure you know every once in a
01:27 while when I completely bottomed out on
01:29 you know the easier episodes that I can
01:32 do by myself it has to do with you know
01:36 trying to think up everything on my own
01:38 but then I'll go out and try to search
01:40 on conspiracies just to see what's out
01:42 there you know my my cigar lounge is
01:45 pretty good about finding the latest and
01:47 greatest but you know what I go out
01:49 there and look for them what's
01:50 fascinating to me is that man they're
01:53 you know they're so on top of
01:55 conspiracies now because it's a bad word
01:57 right there trying to make woke a bad
01:59 word and you know it's Touche you're
02:02 fighting the deep stage so whatever but
02:05 the stuff I've been finding is so dark
02:08 and so you know I don't know I found one
02:12 that was all related to Epstein kind of
02:15 stuff and I was just like man I'm I'm
02:17 not interested in covering that kind of
02:19 stuff it's just all negative there's a
02:21 billion videos out for that kind of
02:23 stuff so we're gonna stick with aliens
02:24 it's gonna be fun so one of the things
02:27 that a lot of us hear about a lot but we
02:30 don't again pull it out isolated and
02:33 talk about it is the anatomy of an alien
02:36 but you know often you
02:38 here about Roswell and the autopsies
02:41 course the most infamous autopsies been
02:43 completely faked and the guy who did it
02:45 it's like I'm really sorry and then
02:48 there's you know there's reptilian
02:50 aliens there's insectoid aliens but
02:53 here's what I've discovered in all my
02:54 particular research so I thought what we
02:57 would do as a format for this particular
02:58 shows kind of review the chronology of a
03:02 lot of these theories and then go off on
03:06 our own and imagine you're our own
03:09 thought process in fact it's so warm I
03:13 gotta take this other jacket off usually
03:14 it's so cold
03:15 I think it's upper 60s right now which
03:17 is incredible they're looked on the
03:19 radar spot to set up outside and I was
03:22 like oh and I saw a little wetness out
03:23 there because it rained earlier today
03:24 and I was like oh crap I better check
03:26 because sometimes I'll do a show and
03:28 just try to beat the storm you know a
03:31 lot of times I'm pretty successful at
03:33 that but there's a huge one coming so
03:35 during this episode most likely we're
03:37 gonna get some really cool rain noise
03:38 which in California is a priceless sound
03:41 okay all right much better so what's
03:45 interesting about this is that you know
03:48 in the subject of aliens there's a lot
03:49 of people making money off of it and you
03:52 know it's entertainment man so I support
03:55 it 100% they're just trying to you know
03:57 think some possibilities through I mean
04:00 think about if you had an unknown that
04:02 ever reached your planet okay it's
04:06 probably good that we imagine here
04:08 everything that we could possibly think
04:10 of as to what they might be like such
04:13 that you know when they arrive we're not
04:16 completely in a state of shock or we
04:18 even know what we're looking at but the
04:20 stories of Martians and aliens and that
04:22 kind of stuffs been around for hundreds
04:24 of years
04:25 you know HG Wells that dude was around
04:29 the era that it really just started to
04:31 take shape but in my personal travels
04:36 the meaning the stuff I've read the
04:38 stuff I've seen on television like every
04:40 single one of you theories of alien
04:42 Anatomy tend to be how do I put this
04:47 as sophisticated as we believe the
04:50 problems that they have to solve
04:52 are and I'll explain that in one second
04:56 here for instance once we really started
05:00 to conceive and again this is all
05:02 heliocentric space exists talk initially
05:07 we have a long journey to travel you
05:12 know if we give the aliens credit for
05:16 hyperspace which is obviously just a
05:18 theory because black holes don't exist
05:21 the entire theory of wormholes and you
05:26 know bent space and time and all that
05:28 stuff it's romantic but most likely if
05:31 space exists you know that doesn't exist
05:36 do you have areas in the universe where
05:39 the ether o fabric is potentially wound
05:43 up in some certain shapes that are
05:46 anything but normal
05:47 no maybe and you know could you could
05:51 you travel through space where if
05:53 someone observed you the light would
05:55 look like you in a you know the crazy
05:59 house at a carnival where it's a bunch
06:02 of Miss shaped pieces of metal or mirror
06:07 or whatever and you're being all
06:08 distorted yeah it might be like that and
06:10 you might actually be completely fine
06:12 going through that area of space even
06:15 though you're wobbling in your shape you
06:17 know you might see what your ass looks
06:20 like but you know it's it's conceivable
06:23 it's it reminds me of just a beautiful
06:26 phrase in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the
06:28 galaxy when Ford Prefect is trying to
06:32 tell Arthur Dent what it's going to be
06:33 like to go through hyperspace and he
06:35 says well it's very much like being
06:37 drunk and Arthur goes well I rather like
06:41 being drunk and he goes are you no he
06:44 says no he says what's so wrong with
06:46 being drunk is what he says and the the
06:48 hyperspace starts to happen to them and
06:51 he goes I don't know ask a glass of
06:54 water and it starts to happen and then
06:56 Arthur dents phrases his voice wanders
06:59 off in the distances I'll never be
07:00 caught with a gin and tonic again so
07:03 when we perceived and because initially
07:06 it was just Martians and we could
07:08 conceive of a fairly decent you know
07:12 journey from them to us to give them
07:15 quick engines okay let's just keep it
07:18 primitive yeah maybe they're out a few
07:21 days or whatever say bring ham sandwich
07:23 and the coke and some water you're good
07:25 but once we started to think about Oh
07:28 what if they're coming from another
07:29 solar system another part of the galaxy
07:31 or another galaxy now we're talking
07:35 about even traveling the speed of light
07:37 you know hundreds and millions of years
07:41 technically for them to travel and then
07:44 we have to give them something faster
07:46 than light because doesn't matter who
07:48 you are they would have to have some
07:50 sort of stasis thing for their bodies to
07:53 stay the same we can you imagine that
07:56 you you understand ether so much that
08:00 you build a craft that's using these
08:01 ether ol engines pulling you through
08:04 space and then inside you freeze the
08:08 joint because you understand ether so
08:10 much that you just pause everything
08:12 inside and I don't think that's possible
08:14 because I think ether has to constantly
08:16 travel but let's say they could do it
08:17 they could somehow get a loop to happen
08:21 so the constantly refreshing ether that
08:23 you are stays in a perfect loop and so
08:27 you could sit there for millions of
08:31 years just frozen imagine that right but
08:34 no one's ever theorized that as far as I
08:35 know so what they started to do was to
08:39 come up with all kinds of interesting
08:42 things whit least Reavers whole thing
08:44 which I I'm sure he lifted off someone
08:46 else for the great aliens was that they
08:47 photosynthesize that way if they just
08:50 have solar radiation they can make their
08:52 own oxygen and you're good to go which
08:54 is really you know much more net co2
08:56 based thing but they would take you know
09:00 just pure sunlight and create this
09:02 metabolism that needs to occur now it's
09:05 important to know that remind ourselves
09:08 the anything that's alive has got an
09:10 ecosystem that's moving you're
09:13 constantly refreshing right even a
09:15 computer has to constantly refresh its
09:18 source of electrons in order to have any
09:20 thing resembling a heartbeat o'clock
09:22 speed and that is the bass anatomy of
09:25 anything that we consider to be alive
09:28 now if you take my theories of ether
09:31 even a stationary object like a piece of
09:34 lead is constantly being created while
09:38 it's in well it's in existence right so
09:41 what it is is it's the collection of
09:42 currents that make lead and then it's
09:44 been crafted and melted with chemistry
09:47 in a way that these orbital you know
09:49 currents are the shape of a brick or
09:52 whatever it is right a gold ring but
09:55 let's just establish that as a constant
09:59 and we know that for the ecosystem of a
10:03 living intelligent being we have a brain
10:05 we have various organs that perform
10:07 duties for digestion etc etc so the
10:15 theory then you know would move around
10:17 where they said that because ships move
10:20 really fast and they stop and then they
10:22 move really fast someone came up with
10:24 this theory that the greys were
10:27 insect-like that they had hard
10:30 exoskeletons and the reason why they
10:32 theorized that was because they hadn't
10:35 really conceived of inertial dampers you
10:37 always hear this in Star Trek the
10:39 International dampers are out for those
10:41 of you don't know what inertial dampers
10:43 are is the ability to take the interior
10:47 of a ship or a region and quarantine it
10:52 from the actual relative movement of
10:56 ether on the outside of the vehicle so
10:58 you could take a vehicle moving
10:59 Lightspeed stop it on a dime and
11:02 everyone inside doesn't feel it they
11:05 just feel like they just look out the
11:07 window and they see stars moving and
11:08 then poof they stop right and so in Star
11:12 Trek what's beautiful is the initial
11:13 damper is about as complex as a gas tank
11:16 you know everyone has one no big deal
11:18 yeah I can get messed up but what is
11:21 kind of interesting isn't even in the
11:24 Star Trek episode that I've seen you
11:27 know the inertial dampers have never
11:30 failed in a way that everyone's getting
11:33 suddenly tossed around
11:34 inside the vehicle because that would
11:36 you know you have to be extremely
11:37 careful there's a relative movement of
11:40 things inside but you know you couldn't
11:41 do a lot of things that they end up
11:43 doing nor have I ever seen an episode
11:46 where gravity plating fails I think that
11:49 would be kind of funny at least one
11:51 episode the bridge goes zero gravity you
11:54 know there has been that episode where
11:57 there's this they find a sweet spot
11:59 inside the ship where because of the
12:02 although relative gravity moving in
12:04 different vectors you just float and
12:07 it's you can sit on the ceiling that was
12:09 one of the one of the things that they
12:11 dramatized which is interesting
12:13 so the insectoid alien anatomy theory
12:17 was based on not having any type of
12:19 inertial damping well if UFOs are the
12:22 things we think we're seeing that
12:24 actually have occupants in them and
12:26 knots just like probes of some sort then
12:29 that moving wouldn't be an issue but I
12:33 would think too that the sudden stop and
12:36 start of a vehicle at the level they're
12:39 doing or the claims have been you would
12:43 have machinery inside that would just
12:45 get tossed tossed around really badly
12:47 but you know those maybe they figured
12:49 out how to get it regulated but if you
12:51 do have antimatter engines like Bob
12:52 Lazar said they can do etheral
12:55 directional voids in space then I'm very
12:59 confident that the internals of this
13:01 vehicle would also have some sort of
13:03 relative ether or quarantine up to a
13:07 point
13:07 now the other anomaly with the
13:10 photosynthesizing skin of a gray was
13:13 that they Grey's are always known for
13:15 wearing spacesuits and again this is
13:20 where the theory came that we discovered
13:23 velcro from the greys space ships during
13:26 Roswell and that's how we have velcro
13:28 today the real source of velcro is a
13:31 flower there's a flower out there that
13:33 has a little dangling hook and then the
13:37 other part of the flower has a loop and
13:39 the loop and bezels you know hangs on
13:41 the hook and you got it so there's that
13:44 as well
13:46 but then we get this reptilian thing
13:49 which you know when you're if you hear
13:52 like David Icke say everyone's you know
13:54 everyone runs the world or Tilian the
13:56 queen of England's reptilian you know if
14:00 that's the first time you've ever heard
14:01 the theory then you're kind of like
14:03 where the hell you come up with this
14:05 stuff yeah I mean that's like wow super
14:07 duper stretch right but ten years before
14:11 he came up with that on the 1989
14:13 interview there was the show v on TV and
14:16 so you get reptilians in that realm too
14:20 before V you had a show the kids watched
14:23 now this is what's crazy the show called
14:27 land of the lost for those of you who
14:31 may not have had it in your country it's
14:33 about a family of it through some weird
14:36 anomaly I can't remember what the hell
14:37 did it to them but they got taken back
14:40 to the dinosaur age there's more
14:42 dinosaur indoctrination right but they
14:45 had this these pits it was actually
14:49 pretty terrifying if you really put it
14:51 together for a child but the floor was
14:54 just this sort of smoky substance and
14:59 he's fully reptilian like almond eye
15:02 kind of reptilian alligator lizard face
15:05 things more lizard would come out and
15:09 they're called the sleestaks and they
15:12 would come out and terrorize them and
15:13 then crawl back into the ground now
15:16 what's really wild about that is the the
15:19 dude in the 90s and I never can reverse
15:22 name him he's kind of like a bell Cooper
15:23 but he's not bo Cooper he said and maybe
15:29 I'll flash his name or something but
15:30 some of you know this guy he said that
15:33 he was working on a government program
15:34 to build the network of tunnels all over
15:39 the United States for the contingency of
15:40 government plans where you could
15:41 technically move troops and you have the
15:44 backup but they talk about having mach3
15:46 trains down there and that the tunnel
15:50 from England to France was actually
15:52 pioneered in America which is probably
15:57 severely insulting to British people
15:59 fringe people who toiled their own
16:01 solutions together but anyway that they
16:04 build these tunnels and that on one of
16:08 the expeditions I can't remember the guy
16:10 said he was he was in South West America
16:14 but they had halted the production
16:16 because they found a chamber underground
16:19 with I think the dude was really saying
16:23 they were grace but the he said that
16:26 they took an elevator shaft down like a
16:29 mining shaft down
16:30 he had a dude with him that had a
16:32 machine gun submachine gun he had a 45
16:36 on him his right hand when he gave this
16:38 presentation about 1995 was all mangled
16:41 and he had burns he had a bunch of scars
16:43 on his body plus a bullet hole from
16:45 someone trying to kill him he's kind of
16:48 a big oaf a nerdy guy which adds
16:50 credibility to his story because he's
16:52 not like a brawler
16:54 that might have got himself in a weird
16:55 circle of life and then he's just
16:58 claiming a bullet hole was something
16:59 different you know but it what it was
17:01 but he said that he is a situation was
17:05 the government knew for a very long time
17:07 that aliens live underneath us and they
17:10 lived sort of like insects in these it
17:14 looks like an ant an ant chamber right
17:16 when they put the little microscopic
17:18 cameras down to look at termites or ants
17:20 except it's a you know people level but
17:23 he said the elevator went down and they
17:26 immediately saw a whole bunch of these
17:28 things and he said it was it stunk it
17:31 you know had feces in there and stuff
17:33 now the big question is what the hell do
17:35 they eat if they're down there right you
17:36 know I mean a creature would take food
17:39 to eat and the more you have the more
17:41 food you need and what the hell is down
17:42 there in any ample supply right you
17:44 can't just live on a few earthworms but
17:47 he said that this dude next to him
17:49 panicked and started firing on them
17:52 killing some of them but one of them
17:54 walked up and put a hand over his chest
17:57 and it sent out this beam which I don't
17:59 know you put it over your chest
18:00 where does the beam come from right
18:02 through your hand I don't know if he
18:04 thought his story through properly but
18:05 he said it fried their fried to do next
18:07 to him and the arc of electricity came
18:09 across onto him which is why his right
18:11 hand was all messed up
18:13 he said he drew is 45 and believes he
18:16 killed one at least or whatever but he
18:18 had all kinds of other weird claims at
18:20 that event that didn't really make much
18:23 of us much much sense but he claims you
18:26 know you got all this stuff and what's
18:28 interesting about it is again he didn't
18:31 say they're reptilians but if you think
18:32 about the sleestaks from land of the
18:34 loss coming out of the ground these
18:36 stories may be getting you know
18:39 recirculated regurgitated redone and so
18:42 we just you know I gotta think of
18:44 something cool I know sleestaks right
18:47 but they're gonna be grazed instead of
18:49 set of reptiles right now I'm gonna tell
18:52 you one of the reasons why I have a big
18:56 problem believing in the reptilians
18:58 because their Anatomy is obviously going
19:02 to be some sort of bipedal reptilian and
19:04 you know you can cut open any reptilian
19:08 on earth and they generally have all the
19:09 same organs that we have they're just in
19:11 different shapes just like everything
19:13 else that's out there it's only when you
19:15 really get into insects do you start
19:17 having different things other than
19:18 breathing lungs you have lung bladders
19:22 that are inside with perforated holes on
19:25 their sides instead of you know pumping
19:28 air which you know artists don't really
19:32 pump air either but it just it's a
19:35 similar chamber little pads inside their
19:38 bodies metabolize the oxygen and there
19:40 you go more oxygen the bigger the
19:42 insects hence why you have one foot
19:45 spiders and in the rainforests because
19:48 they're able to breathe more and
19:49 probably live longer not have predators
19:52 of any kind but if you ever watch Star
19:55 Trek one of the most sort of oxymoron
19:59 things with Star Trek which is very
20:01 important when you think about aliens in
20:02 general is the notion that you're going
20:05 to have a super violent race but you're
20:10 also going to have like a Klingon
20:12 Klingons for me never work because one
20:16 like Worf works because he's he's been
20:19 raised by human beings and so he's got
20:22 that you know refinement to him but when
20:25 you have
20:26 you know we and we've known that you
20:28 know there's human hordes that have done
20:31 what they've done get a little bit of
20:33 technology at Genghis Khan you know he
20:35 was able to figure out how to build
20:36 armor and weapons and then treena's men
20:39 and have tactics and of course they're
20:40 rolling over these villages that have
20:42 just primitives and them you know trying
20:45 to figure out how to irrigate a field or
20:47 something maybe they can fight you with
20:50 a backhoe but that's about it so that
20:51 kind of stuff does take place but when
20:54 you hear a Klingon talk you can watch
20:57 every single episode of Star Trek every
21:00 movie of Star Trek when a Klingon speaks
21:03 they seem to lack any refinement of
21:07 logic and intelligence they really
21:11 really do but the show obviously is
21:14 trying to create an enemy and antagonist
21:16 never really dealt with that and if you
21:20 watch Planet of the Apes the first two
21:22 movies in the 60s you have obviously
21:25 your barbaric stupid soldier archetype
21:28 where they just don't know what they're
21:30 doing certainly now like our soldiers
21:32 today right but then you have the
21:34 orangutan kind of descendants which are
21:37 the lighter skinned because they're like
21:41 red hair you know bringing things are
21:43 mostly red hair and they became the wise
21:45 men that created everything and so the
21:49 enforcers like an ant colony right so
21:53 with the Klingons you never really have
21:54 that sophisticated Klingon there's I
21:58 mean there's a sophisticated Ferengi who
22:00 comes on board and it had developed a
22:03 shield that could survive the sun's the
22:08 surface of the Sun basically so you
22:09 could park a ship right over the Sun
22:11 surface and and withstand coronal mass
22:14 ejections and stuff so you got that
22:15 dimension out of them right so when
22:19 someone starts talking about a reptilian
22:21 alien race the obvious goal of that is
22:25 to talk about a race that is formidable
22:27 it's scary right it's there imagine
22:30 imagine [ __ ] man just imagine a race
22:33 that are made out of gorillas holy crap
22:35 you know smart gorilla race they could
22:37 just pull you apart with their hands to
22:39 your face off on one bite
22:41 okay but the reptilians you know their
22:47 garb their entire body every time you've
22:51 ever seen them drawn
22:52 it's very Klingon like you know they
22:55 have the heavier looking you know armor
22:58 on their bodies because they're just
23:00 supposedly this non apathetic race of
23:04 aliens that are just you know I guess
23:09 aimlessly conquering but the problem is
23:12 is a primitive mind usually lacks any
23:14 sort of strategy and strategy would be
23:18 Keystone to creating anything a strategy
23:22 to create a weapon well you know let's
23:25 say you create a BB gun well that takes
23:28 a lot of calm relaxing relaxing
23:31 scientific thought process to create
23:33 that sure barbarians can buy it and use
23:37 it but where would these you know
23:39 reptilians be able to let's say that
23:41 reptilians were invaded by a race that
23:45 wasn't as physically formidable and they
23:48 take over the ship and it's got like
23:50 really easy buttons on it right well
23:53 once the ship breaks down needs to be
23:54 refueled the guns stopped working
23:56 because the ammo is out the energy is
23:57 out you have a race that can't refill
24:00 the equipment they have no idea how it
24:02 was made and so the more primitive a
24:05 race gets in the archetypes of people
24:07 telling stories the less I worry about
24:09 it even an insectoid race its insects on
24:14 earth although brilliance and their
24:17 capability of building homes and
24:20 protecting themselves and surviving
24:22 you're still orders of magnitude away
24:26 from science of true
24:30 verbal communication with another race I
24:33 mean do you realize Star Trek I think
24:35 did a beautiful job running into weird
24:37 races in the in the galaxy and at least
24:41 being able to communicate in some binary
24:43 fashion you know sending prime numbers
24:45 or something like that so you know that
24:47 someone's thinking through what they're
24:48 sending you right the whole basis of the
24:53 SETI /
24:54 Graham was to look for intelligent
24:58 transmissions you know a Tesla was
25:01 fairly certain that in Springfield
25:03 Colorado he found an alien race that was
25:07 communicating with the surface and they
25:09 blew it off later and said it was just a
25:12 pulsar and the Pulsar theory is that you
25:15 have and it's it's pulsar theory is
25:19 really it's a stretch man
25:22 what they say is that there's a spinning
25:24 pulsar body in space and it's so
25:28 condensed that the atoms are I forgot
25:30 which atom is supposed to be it's sort
25:32 of basic but they like they'll talk
25:33 about like an a starts all the way down
25:35 to a proton you know they're so
25:37 condensed down that it's it's rotating
25:40 and as it rotates it spits it's spitting
25:42 out on one side of it this emission and
25:46 because it's spinning so fast it goes
25:48 beep beep beep beep as we see it so I
25:52 think that's [ __ ] and I think that
25:55 Tesla you know he seemed to abandon the
25:59 research which is you know I'm hoping
26:01 this book I'm putting together or
26:02 reading you know getting through has
26:05 that in it because this book would have
26:08 been its 1919 since a couple years after
26:10 he came back from Springfield Colorado
26:13 so the reptilian thing yeah I I have my
26:16 doubts that would be an intelligent race
26:19 and if they did get here their
26:23 intelligence you know once you get
26:25 intelligent you tend to get peaceful
26:27 when you get intelligent you tend not to
26:29 want to destroy life because you do
26:31 eventually come up with some sort of
26:33 first contact policy maybe even the
26:36 prime directive where it's like we're
26:38 not to interfere with these people's
26:39 lives because this is their world and
26:42 it's like there's not a shortage of
26:44 planets out there you could play with
26:45 but there's obviously all of the stories
26:48 of invasion and that sort of thing now
26:51 the whole thing about Martians you know
26:54 of course someone did something about
26:56 the little green men saying I think they
26:59 even they had a little saying for Tesla
27:02 to try to ridicule him and you know
27:04 could you imagine that we've made
27:05 contact with them
27:07 and these people are just trying to dis
27:09 simple the thing but man that would have
27:11 been 1916 1917 it would have been pretty
27:15 early in the game for anyone to know
27:17 about these these beings unless they're
27:19 already here
27:20 but now let's let's think through the
27:23 overall physical anatomy of any being in
27:26 the universe now when I did my first
27:31 episode or my second episode of
27:32 evolution I started to notice in a lot
27:36 of you have there seems to be like a
27:38 biological constant in our planet and
27:41 because we have those rules that apply
27:43 everywhere in the universe not just in
27:46 our planet regardless if we breathe
27:48 oxygen and something else breathes
27:49 sulfur or any of that kind of stuff
27:52 I actually have my doubts I actually
27:55 have my doubts that the universe has
27:56 come up with a whole spectrum of you
28:01 know things that things breathe you know
28:03 plants are the opposite of us we're the
28:05 opposite of plants that's cool they're a
28:07 little bit different than us but if you
28:10 really look at the anatomy of all things
28:11 you have a node of life be it a segment
28:18 on a a crab a spider a centipede a human
28:24 being a animal of any kind we have this
28:31 round sphere which is like again as my
28:34 friend said the default shape in a
28:37 liquid environment initially you would
28:40 have this thing floating around doing
28:42 its thing single-cell being and then
28:43 eventually it can duplicate itself and
28:46 have a two cell thing and maybe once it
28:48 duplicates and figures I'd do that you
28:49 have a multi cell amoeba like thing but
28:54 once you have a node the node would
28:57 eventually start getting heavier and
29:00 drift to the bottom of wherever it is as
29:04 it's on the bottom depending on its
29:06 environment if it starts getting into
29:08 more hostile environments with like
29:10 rocks in rough terrain if there's any
29:15 rupture as is bumping the ground
29:18 inner cells and a multi-cell being would
29:21 start to slip out the hole and it's
29:24 gonna slip out the hole and probably
29:26 maintain its life connection to the
29:28 inside of this the sphere for a while
29:30 but as it grows a certain length it is
29:33 going to start to die because it's gonna
29:36 taper off and taper off to the point it
29:38 can't grow anything else and it's
29:39 probably gonna close up its epidermis of
29:41 some sort and you have a limb as there
29:45 is a nervous system growing into that
29:47 new region it might be able to get some
29:50 muscle tissue in there and just through
29:51 inadvertent movement it starts to live a
29:55 better life it starts to be able to move
29:56 around its environment and perhaps run
29:59 out of food in one area of the pond
30:00 because it has these little legs
30:03 it just Wiggles a little bit little hair
30:05 follicles and it gets to the next area
30:07 and we know we have multi-celled you
30:10 know creatures and petri dishes with
30:13 little little hair follicles all around
30:16 now I think hair is a byproduct of the
30:20 same system that ended up making our
30:21 limbs but through a huge number of years
30:25 or processes again even if we have
30:27 intelligent designers that work on us
30:29 the node has seemed to be the default
30:32 thing that occurs for every node you can
30:34 get two legs and their symmetrically
30:36 just distributed so my left leg is on
30:39 the opposite side of my hip node and my
30:42 right legs you know opposite of my left
30:44 right my upper torso node is managed to
30:48 create two limbs which are my arms look
30:51 at every creature even though they
30:53 haven't worked out how to walk upright
30:54 in most cases they still have that
30:57 frontal torso node and then the back hip
30:59 node on a centipede well we've got
31:03 hundreds of nodes the little legs and
31:05 their nervous system has figured out how
31:06 to coordinate all that it's really
31:09 fascinating well why do we walk upright
31:14 that's a big question the I think
31:18 obvious low-hanging fruit answer is that
31:21 all of our brain powers up here in the
31:24 top node our head the head doesn't grow
31:28 legs or arms because it is preoccupy
31:31 with other symmetrical dual entities
31:35 left brain right brain left ear right
31:38 ear left eye right eye left nostril
31:41 right nostril and down the center we've
31:44 actually been able to merge a whole we
31:46 have left teeth and right teeth some of
31:49 us have that little groove down the
31:50 center of our tongue so you the left and
31:52 the right so it seems to have managed to
31:55 pace itself
31:56 evenly look at your vertebrae every
31:59 vertebrae has the left side and right
32:00 side down the center is the cone nervous
32:03 excuse me the hole that carries our
32:05 nervous system and so there's a
32:08 beautiful symmetry now what's
32:09 interesting about the gut sac of a human
32:11 being is once you get past the left and
32:13 right lungs you start to have a lot of
32:17 asymmetry you know we have one heart but
32:20 it has all these different chambers
32:22 they're not it's not like a heart that
32:24 you draw and you give to your loved one
32:27 on Valentine's Day right your pancreas
32:30 your spleen your liver your gallbladder
32:33 your intestines are a mess and they're
32:35 just all over the place
32:37 we are distributed evenly in terms of
32:40 weight your stomachs on one side so it's
32:43 amazing that we you know we're
32:47 definitely not going to want to weigh 10
32:49 pounds more on the right side than the
32:51 left side at any point in time and our
32:52 food in gestation but technically you
32:56 know we don't eat 10 pounds worth of
32:58 food but we are balanced because gravity
33:02 is always you know ether Oh Windsor I
33:04 was going through us and just kind of
33:07 keeping an equal force on our insides as
33:09 well as our outsides so the reason why I
33:13 mention that is that I think that you
33:16 know we've seen Starship Troopers
33:18 you know the alien insectoid thing well
33:22 I guess but to the degree that the limbs
33:26 are not sophisticated how could they
33:29 create intricate pieces of electronics
33:32 to get anywhere now being dropped off
33:35 like the alien predator thing where the
33:38 theory is this backstory is that the
33:40 Predators created the aliens to have
33:42 something to hunt that was really you
33:43 know for
33:44 all right maybe that sort of scenario
33:46 works you know someone creating an alien
33:51 race dropping it off on a planet letting
33:54 that you know look the let the Lambs eat
33:57 all the grass sort of thing or worth of
33:59 grass right and then exterminate that
34:01 group or pick them back up and put them
34:03 in the cage they belong in and they come
34:05 in and you know terraform the place do
34:08 whatever you want to do maybe right but
34:12 why do we go up right we go up right
34:14 because we want this sensor box that's
34:16 our head to have the greatest vantage
34:19 point for survival you know our eyeballs
34:23 are divided into two key areas outside
34:27 of left and right I think I've told you
34:29 guys several times your peripheral
34:31 vision has a much faster frame rate than
34:33 your vision right in front of your face
34:35 and again the really easy test is to
34:39 turn on a ceiling fan get in your bed
34:41 look directly at the fan blades and
34:44 they're pretty blurred then turn right
34:46 or left and let your peripheral vision
34:48 see the fan blades and you'll
34:49 immediately see them stop animating in a
34:51 weird way they'll start doing sputter
34:54 smooth turns because there's no frames
34:56 missing from your peripheral vision well
35:00 that's a huge defense mechanism that you
35:03 use to survive predators coming around
35:07 your back your ears are amazing to hear
35:10 behind you but you also have that
35:13 peripheral vision to help we don't need
35:16 to turn our heads 360 like an owl
35:18 because we just turn you know 90 degrees
35:22 in any direction our peripheral vision
35:23 wraps all the way back to see what's
35:26 behind us not complete 360 but it's good
35:29 enough right you're already hearing you
35:31 know the Sun grass crunch on one side of
35:34 your head so you're gonna turn to see
35:36 what's coming up what predators on you
35:38 and it's because of these basic laws of
35:41 survival that would be the truth and
35:44 whatever planet we're talking about here
35:46 again doesn't matter what someone
35:48 breathes they still I think we'll have a
35:51 node-based body I think because we are
35:55 controlled by the same physics the
35:57 until the rest of the universe as far as
35:59 we know at least in this realm of
36:02 existence where we are matter based
36:03 beings slow ether or I would say dense
36:07 ether occurrence right that's makes
36:09 things appear to be solid they do too
36:12 and so I don't think we're going to have
36:15 aliens ever show up with a tremendously
36:18 different configuration of limbs
36:21 you know sci-fi movies love to create
36:24 you know lobster people and all kinds of
36:27 other weird fleshy things you know it it
36:32 doesn't really pan out in the end think
36:35 about how we have been able to use the
36:38 five fingers and the opposing thumb four
36:40 fingers and opposing thumb excuse me
36:42 some people have five fingers but to
36:46 have this hand right here is a big deal
36:49 it allowed us to start becoming much
36:51 more meticulous with our tool making
36:54 capabilities just look at a gorilla
36:57 where you have or at various monkey
37:00 species some of them really only have
37:01 three fingers
37:02 was it the Koala has three fingers and
37:04 two thumbs monkeys you know they get to
37:09 a certain point but they have small
37:11 brain cavities and so they can't get to
37:12 our level by the way I saw this video
37:17 somebody on my Facebook feed posted this
37:19 video where they are now starting to
37:21 embed what they call spy BOTS into
37:27 wildlife situations and so they made
37:30 this extremely realistic looking monkey
37:33 baby and they propped it up in a tree
37:36 and I mean that it looks like Hollywood
37:40 did it it's an amazing little thing
37:41 doesn't look like the species of monkeys
37:43 that found it and I don't know if
37:47 they're rhesus or not but they're like
37:49 they're the ones that are white and they
37:50 have a little raccoon mask but they
37:53 ended up finding this baby you know
37:56 Spybot which has obviously got video
38:00 cameras for eyes and it's showing
38:01 someone back at some observer Tori but
38:04 the eyes were totally real looking man
38:06 it convinced these monkeys that this
38:09 thing was real
38:10 well they saw a baby up in the tree
38:12 without any parents and so they went to
38:15 obviously tend to the child and they
38:18 knocked it out of the tree and it hits
38:20 the ground of course it looks dead as a
38:22 doorknob because it's just sitting there
38:23 and you know they can mess with editing
38:28 to make it have a narrative that's not
38:31 actually occurring
38:31 if the narrative is truly organic and
38:34 not orchestrated these monkeys went
38:39 through an amazing beautiful moment of
38:44 trying to revive the baby and then
38:48 mourning the child and they they grouped
38:53 together around the baby and you had you
38:57 know monkeys that seemed to be you know
38:59 more like lovers that there are they're
39:01 of age to do whatever they need to do
39:03 and then mothers with their young and
39:07 they all took a moment to appreciate
39:10 life they would grab each other and hug
39:13 each other and and it was just it was
39:15 such a passionate petting that they were
39:18 doing it wasn't the normal let me pick
39:20 you clean sort of thing it was like you
39:22 know it was like making eye contact with
39:24 each other and they would they would
39:26 confirm you know I love you
39:28 you know I'm so glad you're safe and
39:31 then they would turn and look at the the
39:34 little Spybot on the ground that looked
39:36 like just a horribly dead baby monkey so
39:40 I just love those things because it
39:42 really shows that you know love exists
39:46 if nothing else right it's a real force
39:48 in the universe that pulls everything
39:50 together
39:50 I mentioned that little digression
39:53 because I think that one of our greatest
39:57 fears that has been really exacerbated
40:01 by writers like Whitley Strieber who's a
40:05 he's a writer he's a professional writer
40:07 he's extremely good you know his one of
40:10 his books turned into cat people back in
40:11 the 80s he's trying to stay employed
40:14 right he's trying to stay relevant he's
40:16 trying to sell books but when he went
40:19 through his communion transformation
40:21 breakthrough series
40:23 he really emphasized this sentiment that
40:31 great aliens had developed to a point
40:34 where they treated us like like Lab Rats
40:37 and of course that would be the terror
40:39 of any human to be treated like a lab
40:41 rat which is why a lot of people break
40:43 lab rats out of facilities when I worked
40:45 at the pharmaceutical company I worked
40:46 for we had someone raid the place one
40:50 night and break out a bunch of the dogs
40:51 that just had a few days to live let me
40:54 tell you but there are other very
40:58 beautiful stories about greys where
41:00 people claim they've been abducted
41:02 abducted one of them I've mentioned
41:04 probably once before and I'm mentioning
41:07 this to give us a little bit of
41:08 dimension into sort of the anatomy that
41:12 that would be present in a being that is
41:15 intelligent right and again I don't
41:18 personally believe what I'm about to say
41:20 is true I'm just passing this story on
41:23 because I want you to hear the fiction
41:24 on both sides of the fence right
41:27 do I believe Whitley Strieber you know
41:30 at best again the most I would ever
41:33 believe is that that guy was abducted
41:35 once wants it to happen and so he's
41:38 dialing into the frequency of it all but
41:40 I think he might just be a really clever
41:42 opportunist and he's an entertainer
41:44 again I was extremely entertained by his
41:46 books so you know I don't I don't put
41:50 any big moral burden on him to tell the
41:52 truth necessarily if he were to create
41:54 panic with his stories then that's
41:57 another thing but to my knowledge it's
41:59 never occurred but this other story was
42:02 that someone was getting routinely
42:04 abducted and that they were Grace and
42:07 that they were on a table inside of a
42:09 room and the video on YouTube some of
42:11 you may have seen this that someone
42:13 Illustrated it just sort of in black and
42:15 white and it was actually really well
42:17 done but what they claimed was that it
42:22 was a woman I believe and she was I
42:27 think being impregnated by them but in
42:31 addition to being pregnant pregnant by
42:33 them there was a point in the ceremony
42:35 where you had some
42:37 cult sized grace and there was no
42:40 distinction like really makes which is
42:42 the females or six-foot and gray six to
42:45 seven foot and their tan sorry not
42:47 they're not grade they're tan and the
42:49 men were blue to gray kind of colors but
42:53 the the story goes on that they went
42:57 around the corner and then a beam of
42:59 like a ball of light came and they were
43:02 I don't think that they were necessarily
43:04 carrying it it was like he could fly
43:06 through the room on its own but they
43:08 would go get this ball of light and they
43:11 put the ball of light I believe the way
43:14 the story went into the woman but what
43:16 they said was this is the soul of your
43:20 baby and we don't control this
43:23 necessarily but this is part of the
43:25 process you get impregnated with the
43:27 biological matter and here comes the
43:29 soul that connects with your baby and
43:31 you know you're gonna you have now met
43:34 your child before you've met your child
43:36 so you're gonna you're you're
43:38 experiencing this very special thing I
43:40 thought if nothing else that to my
43:44 knowledge has never been in a sci-fi
43:45 movie I think that's brilliant I think
43:48 that's absolutely endearing that they
43:51 and they were all happy and you know it
43:53 was like a very beautiful ceremony that
43:56 was going on you know
43:57 now there's the there's the alien you
44:01 know theory that from the was at the
44:05 ralien guy from from paris from france
44:08 his whole thing was that the aliens were
44:11 absolutely gorgeous beautiful sort of
44:14 norwegian tall perfect humans brunette
44:20 blonde and so that makes it pretty easy
44:24 right and the thing is is like if I did
44:29 this alien drop-off this alien
44:31 gene-splicing episode which I'll have
44:33 probably out before this one
44:34 deliberately but you know I think it
44:37 would make sense especially if we were
44:40 dropped off that they look just like us
44:43 within reason to the degree we have
44:47 varying races here on earth they would
44:50 probably have varying races on there
44:51 world the theory that somehow they're
44:56 all ground down to one type and then
44:59 we're still varying seems a little bit
45:03 hard to believe but what I think is
45:05 interesting that even with you know the
45:08 the technical you could maybe call it
45:10 inbreeding of white people because you
45:13 know Asians all have dark hair black
45:16 folks all have dark hair usually Indian
45:20 all have black hair Native Americans had
45:23 blacker and real black eyes in some
45:25 cases which i think is just cool but
45:27 white people no matter how much we in
45:29 breed and you know there's definite
45:31 visions that happen that makes
45:32 everything up we can create a fairly
45:36 large group of folks that look similar
45:39 like I can see an Irish girl a mile away
45:41 but we still have you know three major
45:45 hair colors you know we have blonde
45:47 brunette and red hair no matter how much
45:49 we you know do our thing we still have
45:52 these three popping up in your family
45:54 right so what I've covered so far is
46:00 again nowtell body construction they do
46:04 probably have to metabolize some sort of
46:07 energy source in order to keep a
46:10 metabolism of life not only their food
46:12 but you know think about it we eat but
46:15 that doesn't take care of our day-to-day
46:16 breathing it is a very interesting
46:19 constant in the universe that something
46:21 is alive has some sort of ecosystem even
46:24 a plant must drink water must you know
46:27 photosynthesize and absorb the co2 to
46:31 make oxygen it puts off what we breathe
46:34 how amazing that we have an opposite
46:37 correlation a yin and a yang with plant
46:39 life I mean it's a beautiful thing right
46:41 that's why we have to take care of our
46:43 plants that's why you can't demonize the
46:45 very thing that they breathe it's a
46:47 bunch of stupid children named Greta
46:50 but now the the Hollywood world when we
46:55 start to let's say we we take alien life
46:58 and we bring it up to the anatomy of a
47:01 human being
47:02 we have hearing and sight
47:04 speech which again Gray's are always
47:07 accused of having telepathy yeah you
47:10 know it depends you know I often wonder
47:13 if human beings were to be able to
47:15 survive the next million years of life
47:18 what do we get to a point where we would
47:20 be able to speak to Lepus telepathically
47:24 again I've said the study million times
47:26 Stanford has proven that children are
47:28 very telepathic up to about the age of
47:30 four and then all kind of balls away as
47:32 language spoken language replaces their
47:35 inability to speak and communicate they
47:38 have to communicate before they speak
47:43 and so they're telepathic with the
47:45 mother with the father right so that's
47:47 why your emotions are very very
47:50 important around a child so if you have
47:52 a very tumultuous personal life and you
47:55 had a child you have to find a way to
47:57 make that child boil away all your
48:00 problems and you're like ah at least I'm
48:02 with my son or my daughter right but now
48:05 where might we go beyond the the average
48:11 to of this to that to this thing you
48:14 know what would be likely to go over the
48:16 top now we know that human beings from
48:20 time to time are born with tails we do
48:23 have a tailbone it looks as if at some
48:26 point someone might have experimented
48:28 with the tail I think that what's
48:31 interesting is uh whether we be
48:34 engineered by God engineered by an alien
48:37 race or engineered by evolution what is
48:42 probably the true constant of our design
48:46 is that we have what we need it's like
48:49 the guy said in the twilight zone right
48:51 you have what you need and so the idea
48:54 would be we don't have tails cuz we
48:57 don't need them we don't have an extra
48:59 set of arms because we don't need them
49:01 we don't have a third leg insert joke
49:06 there so I think what we have is a
49:10 beautiful machine that is our body to
49:14 assume that a race that has been around
49:18 long and
49:18 in the universe to be able to get to us
49:22 having more than we do would probably
49:25 require some epigenetic theories that
49:29 basically say that that being said man
49:33 if I just had eyes in the back of my
49:36 head this would solve itself and they
49:39 would have to be a profound need for
49:41 that being to have that thought to
49:43 potentially create the giraffe neck you
49:46 know fruit is up high you know the
49:49 theory with you know eating fruit that's
49:51 high obviously giraffes exist they're
49:53 one of the most alien looking things on
49:56 planet Earth besides like a squid or
49:58 octopus or the Mantis look at everything
50:03 out there they everything that's out
50:06 there besides a spider
50:07 I think a spider is a phenomenal thing
50:09 with eight eyes on average they were
50:12 able to create a brain that were that
50:15 was able to deal with eight legs and a
50:18 tie so there's eight little nervous
50:20 system nodes inside their little
50:21 configuration that lets them be very
50:24 different than everything else
50:26 obviously insects have you know tons of
50:29 legs in crabs have tons of legs so we
50:32 have that neural pattern in a lot of
50:33 different things but it's because in my
50:38 opinion they live in a hostile world
50:40 the spiders you know even the ones that
50:42 are a foot in diameter they came from
50:46 obviously spiders that were
50:48 infinitesimally small that eventually
50:51 evolved into that big giant spider
50:54 that's in the rainforest because they're
50:57 living in a non sophisticated world they
50:59 need these things so there's a part of
51:03 me that thinks okay I'm willing to bet
51:06 that whatever alien race we would at we
51:08 were to ever meet is going to have the
51:11 bare essentials that we have and then
51:13 further optimize which is what a lot of
51:15 almost all the theories of alien Anatomy
51:18 address that issue the gray
51:23 the great there's two there's two
51:26 distinct gray illustrations again I'll
51:32 tell the story again when I found the
51:35 book communion it was a profound thing
51:39 for me because I had grown up with Star
51:45 Trek with all the shows with Leonard
51:47 Nimoy show the mysteries mysteries of
51:49 whatever it was and other alien shows
51:52 and when people would draw the gray sort
51:57 of triangle front skull but when they
52:00 would add this gigantic brain cavity in
52:02 the back with you know some new veiny
52:04 heads there's a funny episode in Star
52:07 Trek in the 60s and 66 one of the very
52:11 first ones yes was 67 well the very
52:14 first one's ever done they have this
52:15 brainy guy because they're using a human
52:17 being to play the role and I had this
52:21 weird anger that would pop up and I
52:28 could never explain it and I would just
52:31 get angry why the hell am I getting
52:32 angry at some some drawing that someone
52:35 has made of this alien when I saw the
52:38 cover of Communion at Abby Dalton's book
52:40 and a [ __ ] bargain been on the side
52:42 now by the floor
52:43 I had this religious experience man I
52:46 was like that's what they look like
52:49 someone finally got it right
52:51 and that's one reason why it's not
52:53 Whitley Strieber drawing it but whoever
52:54 the hell that person was that painted it
52:56 and Whitley actually was able to create
52:58 I believe a movie for that book I've
53:00 seen it and someone you know moved it
53:03 around but of course I think oh they
53:04 used a model instead of like a physical
53:06 model instead of a 3d thing but its head
53:09 is very flat that relative to these big
53:13 giant cranium firsts everyone creates
53:15 the big brain because they're trying to
53:17 insinuate that that's how come they're
53:20 so smart hey maybe we have some little
53:24 kids with little tiny brains that are
53:25 pretty damn smart it's all about the
53:28 configuration in my opinion so but the
53:31 greys have giant almond eyes is how they
53:36 are always drawn and of course that
53:39 insinuates a a low light condition
53:42 wherever they live or that would have to
53:45 be because you wouldn't need gigantic
53:47 ice if you were in a world that's as
53:49 bright as Earth but what if you took
53:52 earth and you moved it out there by
53:54 Neptune okay Suns a lot smaller the
53:58 amount of sunlight she gets a lot less
53:59 and you know just like any sort of
54:01 creature trying to be a predator in a
54:04 world as very little light all the
54:07 animals that we know they can see in the
54:08 dark really well it's sort of like that
54:11 theory love to have that further
54:13 explained by some one meaning of them
54:16 the ears don't exist in terms of the
54:19 actual outer cartilage it is a tiny port
54:22 in the side of their heads okay you
54:25 don't need it so just you have better
54:28 radar interpretation of your audio
54:32 sensors okay good the nose is typically
54:35 portrayed as being very flat and just
54:39 really has the nostril slits okay makes
54:43 sense to me there also you know again
54:47 it's supposed to be pretty short again
54:50 the one I saw in Oxnard California and
54:56 which might have been a dream you know I
54:58 was sitting just like I am right now in
55:00 the little dudes head he was standing
55:02 straight up it was pretty much about you
55:05 know right here to me and it's just it's
55:08 a little bit maybe about us tall as I am
55:11 sitting and you know this little hand
55:14 touch my shoulder on my left side which
55:17 I remember feeling which is another
55:19 thing that's very interesting in terms
55:22 of a mouth they have a slit for a mouth
55:24 but they're always remembered as not no
55:27 longer using it and they also have this
55:29 tapered chin this kind of like you know
55:33 it doesn't look like here's what's
55:35 interesting
55:36 it imagined we cease using our mouth
55:40 because we go through we evolved to a
55:43 telepathic realm okay well then we
55:48 wouldn't use our mouth
55:50 that often unless we had to eat now it's
55:54 never again photosynthesizing okay
55:57 whatever you know what are they gonna do
55:59 I guess I have like a little tanning
56:00 lamp inside the inside the vehicle you
56:03 know but they're covered in a silver
56:05 suit so how does that work you know in
56:08 terms of maintaining life it just
56:10 depends on the overall biomechanics of
56:13 their aging process you know it could be
56:16 that they don't need to eat very often
56:18 there's quite a few creatures on earth
56:20 that can go very distance without eating
56:24 but it seems to be a constant on earth
56:26 anything that doesn't eat does die and
56:28 so it would seem that we have to sort of
56:31 sur plant that but here's what's
56:33 interesting to me someone let's just say
56:36 someone completely thought up at some
56:38 point that we don't know this gray alien
56:41 theory I don't know honestly you know
56:47 the Roswell crash let's say that did
56:49 occur and there's one recovered that's
56:51 fairly decent and the other two were
56:55 mangled right once horribly mangled and
56:58 we don't know how bad the second one was
57:00 mangled who was dying someone comes up
57:03 with this gray alien refinement of the
57:07 idea of an alien first time I ever saw
57:11 anything remotely like a gray was in
57:13 Close Encounters of the Third Kind but I
57:16 definitely seen shows on TV prior to
57:19 that movie where it did have sort of the
57:23 same exact looking thing now the one in
57:25 the movie is very interesting because it
57:28 was infant-like which it appeals to the
57:32 human mind on a level of maternal
57:35 instincts and paternal instincts right
57:37 here you're trying to create an alien
57:42 that looks fragile and so the mind wants
57:44 to reach out like a puppy dog or like a
57:46 kitten and you immediately side with it
57:49 because you're like ooh you know you
57:51 know you're you okay you know that kind
57:53 of thing right but for those of you
57:55 remember the movie really well one of
57:58 the aspects of that scene when the door
58:02 opens
58:03 and because the door opens twice first
58:06 time it opens everyone who's been lost
58:09 in the Bermuda Triangle and other
58:12 anomalies in the world starts to file
58:14 out so all the pilots you know to them
58:17 it was only a few minutes sort of thing
58:20 but had been 40 years or 30 years or
58:22 whatever then it closes back up and then
58:26 it opens again and when it opens the
58:28 second time the original cut of the film
58:31 if I'm right shows a it's much better in
58:35 the second cut as I remember it may be I
58:38 have that ROM you I just didn't remember
58:39 it as well I still remember seeing that
58:42 movie one time in the theater and I
58:44 remember walking out of the theater
58:45 going that was a great film I was like
58:48 eight years old it was the first time I
58:50 really thought about I mean I'd seen
58:52 Star Wars at your previous and just was
58:55 so blown away I didn't think about
58:56 production value or anything like that
58:58 but this big sort of motherly spider leg
59:03 thing it still had two legs of two arms
59:06 but it was this armature puppet that was
59:09 very tall you couldn't really get the
59:11 scale of it that well it was like the
59:15 mother came out first checked the place
59:17 out and then the kids came out and of
59:20 course in real life it was a bunch of
59:22 kids dressed in alien outfits and hats
59:24 off to these kids man they did a great
59:26 job kind of bouncing around a little bit
59:28 in these crazy outfits of course Richard
59:31 Dreyfuss walks out in his red suit to
59:33 take off with them they're all circling
59:36 him and touching him which was just
59:38 brilliant because it's kind of like it
59:40 well you know it one realm it's like
59:42 they had already seen human beings
59:44 obviously a bunch of them just came out
59:46 of his mother ship but it was like it
59:48 was their way of greeting him and making
59:50 him feel comfortable you know we're
59:52 gonna touch you so you're familiar with
59:53 us and I just thought it was great right
59:56 but think about it once the theory at
59:59 some point turned into the book cover of
60:02 communion even if this whole thing's
60:04 fictional it's just man trying to
60:06 explain something that may end up
60:09 occurring or so alone in the universe
60:11 that we're doing this because we have to
60:15 they they did all these interesting
60:18 refinements to the aliens makeup meaning
60:22 thereby a lot biology and it tends to be
60:25 it tends to make sense you would shrink
60:29 the jaw because the jaw doesn't have the
60:32 use that our jaw does we have to crunch
60:34 stuff and make it prepare you know
60:36 prepare for the stomach so don't choke
60:38 to death
60:39 get down our esophagus and so we have
60:42 you know big mandibles and you know
60:44 we're canine teeth and we can flat mike
60:48 tyson's [ __ ] down our throat right the
60:51 ear refinement I think is interesting
60:53 because instead of making smaller ears
60:55 for a smaller being they just got rid of
60:58 them and you know suppose it was like a
61:00 little Ridge or something but a pretty
61:03 interesting little thing there now the
61:05 almond eyes again I don't know it can't
61:09 just be because the spaceship is dark
61:11 inside right because you know you could
61:14 evolve your whole world into a a weird
61:18 eye looking thing the some other fringy
61:23 theories about alien gray aliens is that
61:25 the whole thing is a suit I've never
61:29 heard that really asserted by many the
61:32 other one is that of course they are
61:33 nothing more than robots being sent here
61:36 by like kind of biological robots sort
61:39 of like a replicant in Blade Runner so
61:42 they have fleshy sort of things but when
61:45 you really hear about the Roswell crash
61:47 and get into it these were very sentient
61:51 beings that got here and they're their
61:54 dead bodies because the thing is is like
61:56 come on I hate to go into Roswell again
61:58 but we're here
62:00 the coroner who served the Air Force
62:04 Base got the call for two child caskets
62:07 now I've heard it up greeted you know
62:10 recently that they wanted hermetically
62:12 sealed caskets but that's absurd you
62:15 know I mean I don't I don't think those
62:16 were something you just buy I think
62:17 either it seals or doesn't seal but
62:20 hermetic sealing is a very certified
62:23 process you know if you were medically
62:26 seal windows for your house
62:28 pay extra right so I'm not sure I would
62:31 imagine that caskets are pretty damn
62:33 tight and hermetically sealed anyway so
62:36 making that distinction if it's a
62:38 standard feature seems a little bit
62:39 absurd but anyway he was contacted for
62:42 two child caskets that's a matter of
62:44 fact okay well the the other cover story
62:48 for the Roswell crash was that about
62:52 week or two before the Roswell incident
62:55 there was a an accident where a one or
63:01 two aircraft crashed just doing some
63:04 some regular flight test now remember
63:07 this is 1947 so I can't remember I mean
63:11 you have the Mustang and you have a few
63:13 like the the copy of the zero and but
63:16 you don't have f-15s and f-16s any of
63:18 that kind of stuff
63:20 I you know Yeager hadn't broken the
63:22 sound barrier yet see what they had said
63:24 was no what they actually found out in
63:27 the desert was the crashed pilots and
63:30 they had been mangled by animals so
63:33 people got out they couldn't recognize
63:34 what they were looking at come on if
63:37 that was the case then they would know
63:39 it's human beings because you're gonna
63:40 look at a femur bone in a skull and
63:42 whatever you're gonna know it's a human
63:44 being even if it's picked pick dry and
63:47 it's never gonna fit inside of a child
63:50 casket and you don't get caskets you get
63:52 body bags right and you don't have to do
63:55 much of a you know an autopsy on these
63:59 folks because they're just simply
64:03 collateral damage and military testing
64:06 so I think some of that's a bunch of
64:07 crap but anyway so you have the coroner
64:10 who was the one that got involved and
64:12 ended up going to the after getting the
64:15 call selling the caskets he end up going
64:17 to the hospital meets his friend is a
64:20 nurse and she's part of the three-man
64:23 crew that's doing the autopsy on the
64:24 other two and because the bodies were
64:27 supposedly full of sulfur a part of her
64:31 Anatomy conversation here that they were
64:33 getting sick and throwing up not sick
64:36 and throwing up because they were
64:37 disgusted by what they saw well because
64:39 they were physically getting
64:41 nauseous from ingesting this non oxygen
64:44 particulate now what's interesting to me
64:48 is that out of all of the aliens that
64:51 we've ever had
64:52 prophesized to us or Illustrated outside
64:57 of Hollywood okay the greys have been
65:00 the most sustained alien race that I
65:04 have ever heard mentioned the the
65:07 reptilian thing okay is typically
65:10 associated with shape-shifting alright
65:13 and you know the whole thing about
65:16 shape-shifting since it does demand
65:18 eight Anatomy explanation would be you
65:24 know a part of it's one of these things
65:25 of like okay yeah the Royal Family's got
65:27 frickin reptilian statues Buckingham
65:31 Palace man with like melded with
65:34 humanoid females you know so I mean
65:37 there's something going on there or
65:39 something they believe because why the
65:41 hell would you put that crap there you
65:44 need to just just make you know it's
65:46 it's the royal family of Windsor the
65:47 saxe-coburg family you've got infinite
65:50 relatives that you could turn into
65:52 statuettes or you could just do the
65:54 standard gargoyle or lion or something
65:57 whatever you know the unicorn dragon
65:59 what they're family crest is made out of
66:02 so creating these things that's really
66:04 strange but shape-shifting let's think
66:06 about it you know David Icke and his
66:09 theory launched in 1989 is that the
66:13 royal family of Windsor is are really
66:17 reptilians and you know anytime someone
66:21 watches an interview through a low
66:23 bandwidth compression on YouTube and the
66:26 face starts doing you know guessing game
66:29 of the pixels because you don't have all
66:30 the pixels coming through the pipeline
66:32 they say that people are transforming
66:34 into reptiles please don't follow that
66:36 crap right the reason why an eye goes
66:39 from circular to slit is because they
66:41 don't have all the pixels to make up to
66:43 pupil correctly in the eye and so it
66:45 guesses the next pixel and one of the
66:47 things that we'll do is just average a
66:49 scan on the eye
66:51 to make the upper and lower part of the
66:54 eye which didn't come through takes the
66:56 center of the eye and repeats it above
66:57 and below but it also will squish it
67:00 taper it above and below because you
67:03 actually have the flesh color of the
67:05 eyelids and so it's something that I've
67:07 seen a thousand times in compression
67:08 software that I was involved in in the
67:10 90s and we were trying to figure out
67:11 JPEG compression so again for those of
67:15 you who want to know the details you
67:17 have you know your jiff and your ping
67:21 store pixel data with RGB values the
67:25 ping is where it went up to you know
67:27 billions of colors you could put a
67:29 24-bit pain together and it's you know
67:31 we don't even have eyeballs that can see
67:33 that stuff when you're dealing with JPEG
67:35 and then you deal with lossless JPEG
67:40 2000 video encoding technology which
67:43 everything else borrows from you're
67:45 dealing with light wave information CMYK
67:47 data that then it does exactly what CD
67:52 players used to do which is fuzzy logic
67:54 to say if your CD back in the 80s and it
67:58 does it today too if you have a scratch
68:00 on it
68:00 what it would do is skip the scratch and
68:03 then average the tone of music between
68:05 the last two bits that it knew and it
68:09 started to create some really where it
68:11 sounds so they ended up blocking out the
68:14 sound instead of playing guessing same
68:17 thing was happening inside VHS tapes
68:19 where the when it lost the data on the
68:23 tape because it started wearing off they
68:26 would put a white pixel in its place and
68:28 so then you would have white streaks all
68:30 over your old videos and then they
68:32 realized that really makes everything
68:34 look like crap when they switched it to
68:36 black and then all of a sudden you
68:38 barely noticed ah that's it you know so
68:42 don't get caught up in that particular
68:44 part of the reptilian theory but
68:47 shape-shifting well I've seen some
68:50 pretty HD photographs especially
68:52 recently with press Andrews issues of
68:54 the Queen and you know these are super
68:57 high definition images of all her you
69:01 know facial features and what have you
69:02 and you get movies of the whole family
69:04 getting together
69:05 doing their thing I mean imagine
69:08 according to david icke it's some the
69:11 windsor family has the reptilian thing
69:13 going on shape-shifting Princess Di's
69:15 family does not so when Princess Di's
69:18 sleeps with Charles to have her first
69:21 husband her first excuse me first child
69:24 he would be half reptilian half human so
69:26 would that mess up his shape-shifting
69:28 capabilities and all the other families
69:31 that marry into the British family would
69:33 also be creating hybrids so the theory
69:36 breaks down there and then of course was
69:39 at Prince Henry or Prince Harry remember
69:41 that the redheaded kid his father is
69:44 actually the security detail guy that
69:46 took care of princess die so his he's
69:49 not a Windsor at all
69:51 he is half of his mother and half of
69:53 this other dude who's sort of vanished
69:55 out of the limelight so he wouldn't be
69:59 shape-shifting at all so the whole
70:02 theory is pretty bad okay but okay so
70:07 forever the big question is your
70:10 reptilian how are you a five foot woman
70:12 and then how are you a six foot two man
70:15 how does that happen because there's
70:17 always this volumetric issue of how what
70:20 a spoon turned into a car and now what a
70:22 car turn into a golf ball right you've
70:25 got to figure out where to put all your
70:26 all of your organized currents which
70:29 make you who you are and then of course
70:32 they're trying to tie it back to a
70:35 physical race which is the reptilian
70:38 race okay well the second you commit to
70:42 being something in this universe a
70:45 reptilian and insect were alien a grey
70:48 or something then you're committed to
70:50 the currents that are who you are
70:52 all right you own the currents for the
70:56 time being that make you who you are no
70:58 matter if you live a thousand years or a
70:59 hundred years or 50 years that's your
71:01 game so I would say the only theory I
71:04 can possibly come up with
71:06 is mixing a couple things together and
71:10 there's a fourth well there's a third
71:11 excuse me that is even more intense but
71:13 we know that in the atomic world there's
71:17 more space
71:18 then there are forces okay so in terms
71:23 of volumetrically shrinking you know
71:26 it's like the old theory of the string a
71:27 credible shrinking woman with Lily
71:29 Tomlin back in the day
71:30 you're just condensing this space down
71:33 to a tighter pattern but then you still
71:36 are who you are sort of thing all right
71:39 you can accomplish that if you can alter
71:42 I think the overall orbit of your
71:46 currents that make you who you are okay
71:49 you're still gonna get a lot of more
71:51 banging and interruptions the smaller
71:53 that you get now the other theory would
71:57 be that there are female reptilians that
72:00 are small and female reptilians that are
72:02 huge you know like like normal human
72:04 like normal six-foot man kind of thing
72:06 right shouldn't say huge but bigger then
72:09 the third thing is you would have to
72:13 have okay this amazing mind to to
72:20 synthesize and control the emulation of
72:25 someone you know you'd have to you know
72:29 if you're gonna think it up all by
72:30 yourself it's and I'll give you a little
72:33 analogy here that if you Nev you have
72:35 been an artist in your lifetime you'll
72:38 know exactly what I'm saying here the
72:41 difference between having a real-life
72:45 person in an art studio posing in front
72:47 of you or having a photograph of someone
72:49 and then merely mimicking that onto the
72:52 canvas or a piece of paper through
72:54 illustration is much easier in most
72:59 cases then completely creating a
73:02 fictitious person with all the same
73:05 nuances and details of a real living
73:08 being
73:09 for instance drawing a fake face well
73:13 I've done in a million times however
73:15 what I've never done is drawing a photo
73:17 real face with all the little cracks and
73:20 nuances of age that these people being
73:24 photographed a million times have been
73:28 able to successfully accomplish
73:31 the other thing that's interesting about
73:35 the whole theory is if you have to
73:38 consciously exert any energy or mental
73:42 capacity to achieve this illusion to
73:45 change your shape you would have to
73:48 concede that it's something that is like
73:52 it's something that you would commit to
73:54 and be able to forget so that you would
73:57 never have to think about it again until
73:59 you need to switch back to whatever the
74:01 hell you're supposedly really are which
74:03 is some lizard thing right now for me I
74:07 think that the reptilian mind and the
74:11 rumor that Princess Di called them the
74:15 lizard people is because here's the
74:18 thing if they were lizard people
74:20 princess died was not bashful about
74:23 telling the truth she was in so many
74:26 places in the world where even though
74:28 she had her arm guard which worked for
74:30 the Queen and they have a secrecy act
74:31 and all this other stuff that you have
74:32 to abide by I think she would have
74:36 dropped the hammer way before she died
74:38 a for sure so if she so I don't think
74:43 she ever saw them switch you know if
74:45 that if that rumor is even true right
74:47 it's really easy to make rumors about
74:49 people when they're dead you know but I
74:52 think the reptilian thing comes from the
74:53 fact that reptilian mind as defined by
74:56 Carl Sagan was that you have a human
75:00 being with no empathy and we know for a
75:03 fact that that's how they raised their
75:04 kids that's how that show the crown on
75:08 TV which there's a fictional thing and
75:11 they get all the scripts I think vetted
75:14 by the Queen you know the Queen's men
75:16 that take care of the scripts right
75:18 Charles's whole upbringing was sending
75:22 him off to a boarding school where he's
75:24 going to learn his manners and learn all
75:25 of his royal you know etiquette and
75:29 you're taking your child away from its
75:31 parental unit the parent is a king and a
75:34 well not really a king but a prince and
75:36 a queen and so their duties are
75:39 all-encompassing so they can't be with
75:41 their children so they can't care about
75:43 their children
75:44 and their children can't really care
75:46 about their parents they are servants to
75:49 their regime servants to the people if
75:54 it's convenient yes right we know what
75:57 kings and queens do they they pay as
76:00 much attention to the people as they
76:02 need to and then all the rest the time
76:04 has been doing whatever they want to do
76:06 some are more active than others but
76:09 they all end up with you know Jimmy
76:12 Savile is in their back pockets and
76:14 Epstein's in their closets right so I
76:17 think we do have reptilian people but
76:20 it's not physical right now the thing
76:24 with David Icke isn't really
76:26 tremendously related to our conversation
76:28 but when questioned especially about
76:32 Jesse Ventura who I think was extremely
76:33 rude to David you know why take a great
76:36 mind like David and be rude to the guide
76:38 I just I don't get it
76:40 you know you don't have to believe what
76:42 someone else believes to have a great
76:45 relationship friendship conversation
76:48 acquaintance it's just for me it just is
76:49 such a waste of a human interaction you
76:51 know but of course you know
76:53 Jesse's producers thought he was an
76:55 [ __ ] too but they asked him you know
77:00 if he's been asked several times about
77:01 it you know have you seen a reptilian
77:03 and he's think about how easy it would
77:06 be for him to lie yes and he comes up
77:09 with some elaborate story but every
77:10 single time he's asked that I've ever
77:12 heard him answer
77:13 he always says no but that he says that
77:16 after revealing that these beings exist
77:22 that people come up to him and tell him
77:24 that you know I think the famous one was
77:27 the one I've heard a lot at least two or
77:29 three times from him which is a lot was
77:31 that a woman was being pulled over by a
77:32 police officer for some traffic stop and
77:36 she was being a little ornery with the
77:39 guy and he got mad and yelled at her and
77:42 that when he did he lost his shape for a
77:45 split second in that according to David
77:47 after one of his shows or during a break
77:49 or something that this woman came up to
77:51 him and said oh my god you know I'm so
77:53 glad you're talking about this because I
77:54 had the most horrifically
77:57 we're a cop yelled at me and his his
78:00 whole face went to a different shape and
78:03 I get the sense that she didn't really
78:05 have it linked to reptilian but says she
78:08 saw a shape change and she was like oh
78:10 my god you know and then when he
78:13 explained his theory she jumped on board
78:15 and again to his to his credit we are
78:20 obsessed with dragons again that shaman
78:23 in in Africa and in was in Bob way I
78:29 don't know Zulu nation guy he had the
78:33 you know the trinket with the reptilian
78:36 male with the phallus in you know stuck
78:40 through the general region reproductive
78:43 region of a girl a woman figure on this
78:47 necklace and in the necklace was
78:48 supposedly over 700 years old they're
78:52 not quite sure how old it is and so you
78:56 know we have artifacts where there seems
79:00 to be someone capable of rendering what
79:02 they see and they're doing a reptilian
79:05 lizard headed humans with these were
79:08 with these almond eyes essentially
79:10 embossed in the head head region there
79:14 here's what's fascinating for me
79:15 the Egyptians which again they had I
79:19 forgot what it's called it's a really
79:22 weird word but the word when you create
79:24 a humanoid body with a animal head
79:28 there's a name for that and that's
79:31 obviously the anatomy of most of their
79:33 gods if not all of their gods right so
79:37 Anubis is an anteater and raw was a like
79:42 a falcon head sort of thing
79:44 they have no reptilian heads as far as I
79:49 can remember and if I'm wrong I'm sorry
79:52 but I don't remember any reptilian heads
79:54 and they lived in sort of a lush area at
79:57 the time but you know he had deserts on
79:59 both sides so you think they would have
80:00 run into that that idea hey we haven't
80:03 used this one yet oh yeah
80:04 put together a reptilian head so some
80:07 part of me thinks they would have done
80:10 it how
80:11 ever what they did do was they have the
80:16 whole theory of the third eye and right
80:20 over the third eye of a pharaoh only a
80:22 furrow what's up there it's a Cobra
80:26 okay snake reptilian cold-blooded
80:31 creature interesting the gateway to the
80:35 mind was through a snake there are is at
80:40 least one hieroglyph out there and
80:42 there's several hieroglyphs where they
80:43 show the pyramid beaming light that
80:48 seems like rays of light off the pyramid
80:51 now if they were truly red black and or
80:54 red
80:55 I'm sorry white red and black then the
80:57 white one would have been really hard to
81:00 look at because you would just be
81:02 blinded looking at this thing so maybe
81:06 that's what they were symbolizing but
81:08 they want there is one that seems like
81:10 it goes straight down into the para
81:12 Meridian stone and then straight at the
81:13 Pharaohs head as if it is receiving
81:16 information from outer space
81:18 very fascinating again the the what is
81:24 it the Mayan illustrations and the Aztec
81:29 stuff you have these incredible
81:33 illustrations that look like guys are in
81:35 spaceships hmm maybe it's a spaceship
81:38 maybe it's not it's definitely some
81:39 weird machine that's that's really
81:41 strange it looks like they got one of
81:43 them looks like they have little engines
81:44 blowing fire below so let's talk first
81:48 what second before I finish this stick
81:50 here
81:51 so there's interdimensional alien
81:53 theories which remove a tremendous
81:56 amount of the burden of any of this
82:00 stuff let's training survived long space
82:02 flight that's where you might get your
82:04 grey with the almond eyes the dimension
82:09 they live in could be dark as compared
82:13 to ours imagine you just wiggle a few
82:16 dimensions over and the photon energy
82:20 the verb that comes from the Sun
82:23 isn't penetrating their dimensions
82:27 slightly off from ours and so they they
82:33 need it right then there's people who
82:35 take DMT they get approached by grace
82:37 almost unanimously and you know it's
82:42 like we're wiggling our mind our
82:43 consciousness into their realm it's just
82:47 a drug trip for us but then we start to
82:50 astral project into their world go to
82:52 the center of the universe see all kinds
82:54 of wild you know spiritual beings out
82:58 there so I mean you know I got a buddy
83:00 of mine it's again it's been on so many
83:02 trips he's not going to go on any more
83:03 trips and I think there's also a
83:07 question here that is about the sort of
83:13 estimation of how many years does a an
83:17 intelligent life like us again all
83:21 things are intelligent of course but
83:23 where you start to develop you know
83:26 burial rituals and technology you really
83:31 start creating tools that not only aid
83:35 survival but make it more luxurious and
83:38 you take away problems and I'll give an
83:41 example here on earth the very first
83:44 time that man stopped living on
83:48 Riverside's they had created the bucket
83:51 the bucket allowed them to carry water
83:53 because they saw their hands do it you
83:55 know hand to mouth hand and they said
83:58 well if we can just kind of start making
84:00 some of these things we could drag water
84:01 in places that we don't have a stream
84:04 and we could live away from the stream
84:06 maybe predators who go there to drink
84:08 start to eating them up and they realize
84:10 that's go a little bit in let's go
84:11 uphill we have a vantage point of being
84:13 higher than them we started developing
84:16 shelters the shelters were on the ground
84:18 initially and all kinds of weird
84:20 configurations and then we realized that
84:22 if you just lift it up you know a few
84:26 feet then when it rains you're not
84:29 living in the river that's underneath
84:31 you plus a predator has to get come up
84:34 to you and stabbing the thing in the
84:36 face
84:37 a hell of a lot better than stabbing it
84:38 in the stomach rate I also want to say
84:41 about the the theory of the the nodes
84:43 just because I missed it think about a
84:46 node in a world with a Sun the Sun is
84:49 beating down on its back the environment
84:51 and the wind is always beating down the
84:52 back so you would start to develop your
84:56 your protective system on your back and
84:59 your stomach which is always guarded by
85:02 the ground can be very malleable and
85:05 vulnerable which is why the stomach is
85:07 usually a very you know vulnerable place
85:11 for all creatures an alligator it's on
85:14 its stomach will look at its back of its
85:16 body it's an armored plate you know so
85:20 there's got to be a point and you know
85:23 there's been several scientists and I
85:25 guess anthropologists that have tried to
85:27 take a stab at this and I think they've
85:28 done a beautiful job at trying to figure
85:30 out what would we consider to be the
85:32 minimum invention of an intelligent race
85:34 Ceti it went on the theory that radio
85:39 waves are of any kind of any frequency
85:44 would be a really good sign of
85:46 intelligent life they're broadcasting to
85:48 each other but because stuff can escape
85:52 into space they think they can find
85:53 those frequencies and especially that is
85:55 space travel and space communication
85:58 between ships some of that would drift
86:00 towards earth and not get frayed by the
86:03 fabric of the universe which is ether
86:05 winds I have my doubts it's finally
86:09 starting to rain here with Star Trek
86:11 obviously the the pinnacle moment was
86:14 man inventing warp drive and what's
86:19 amazing about that story for me is that
86:21 it is not only a technology that is
86:24 being discovered it is the fact that now
86:26 you're going to be traveling potentially
86:28 in backyards of folks that have been
86:31 there before you and you have to join
86:32 some sort of Alliance because there's
86:35 rules they have the problem in Peru
86:38 where the sort of indigenous tribes that
86:43 haven't really developed any technology
86:44 are starting to procreate and they get
86:47 too big and they get into the
86:49 sophisticated world
86:50 of normal neighborhoods and so they have
86:52 to chase him back you know I hate to
86:55 think that they actually hunting them
86:58 back in their population the other one
87:01 that's sort of between radio waves and
87:03 light speed is atomic weapons so once
87:07 you're capable of splitting an atom and
87:12 creating a gigantic explosion imagine
87:14 splitting a what was it a gram of
87:17 antimatter turning to a bomb is like 50
87:21 megatons 43 to 50 megatons yeah you can
87:25 start disrupting their world there are
87:28 all these stories about missile silos
87:32 having their missiles disabled after
87:36 seeing a UFO overhead very interesting
87:41 for me that would speak to either
87:45 intimate interdimensional reality where
87:49 can you imagine like in Nevada where you
87:52 have groom like area 51 prior to 51
87:55 turning into what it is today they're
87:57 just blowing up stop blowing up stuff
87:58 out there in Utah blow it up stop
88:02 blowing up stuff
88:03 well imagine any other dimension there's
88:05 a city there there's aliens there they
88:09 don't bump into us we don't bump into
88:10 them because they're on a different
88:11 plane of existence but all the sudden we
88:15 split an atom and their world blows up
88:19 just like ours and they suffer we're
88:23 just blowing up dirt but they're losing
88:25 life and so they end up spending some
88:29 time and figuring out what the [ __ ] just
88:31 happened
88:31 and they're like oh it's this group of
88:35 primitives in the other dimension we got
88:38 to get in there slow this stuff down
88:40 well the first let's say that these
88:43 things are real I know some of you don't
88:45 think atom bombs are real and I think
88:47 there are some definite questions there
88:50 once you study the bikini island
88:52 catastrophe I think you'll realize that
88:56 TNT would not have had the problem that
88:59 they had in bikini island
89:01 in bikini island for those of you don't
89:03 know they used a fuel and I used to know
89:08 all this data I've forgotten because I
89:10 don't care but one of the one of the
89:12 fuels that was supposed to remain inert
89:14 went active because during the explosion
89:18 it moved some of the orbital patterns of
89:21 the atoms around and it turned into a an
89:23 atomic fuel and the thing blew up way
89:26 bigger they don't even know what
89:28 magnitude it ended up but it ended up
89:29 traveling clear over to the actual
89:33 station where they were monitoring it
89:34 and they had to get the hell out of
89:35 Dodge because it was really bad so it's
89:39 TNT that would have never happened so go
89:43 look that one up but imagine that this
89:47 atomic bomb thing occurs and you know we
89:51 dropped two these things before we had
89:52 done that much testing cuz we're in such
89:54 a freaking hurry to do it right but now
89:57 we start but you know above-ground
89:59 testing from 45 to 73 before we put a
90:02 moratorium on above-ground testing
90:04 that's a very long time but what if you
90:09 were the aliens getting hurt by this and
90:12 some other dimension then you're gonna
90:15 have two options maybe 3 3 is extinction
90:18 of us but 2 would be turn them all off
90:22 then you find out that we've got russia
90:24 in the united states cranking these
90:25 babies out by the hundreds and so your
90:29 only bet at that point is to contact the
90:31 governments quite literally landing on
90:35 their back yard okay and here's the deal
90:37 every time you blow in these things up
90:39 you're hurting our people or we don't
90:41 like this in our dome that we built for
90:44 you so you're gonna have to stop this
90:48 you can go ahead and play your people
90:50 with atomic weapons you can tell them
90:52 you've got them you can tell them you're
90:54 doing you know but you know below ground
90:56 testing or whatever but you can't do
90:58 atomic anymore and so it all gets shut
91:00 down whatever you see is an illusion
91:02 after that point you know again
91:04 continuing to say that North Korea has
91:07 won is just so painful to my brain they
91:10 do not have nukes okay and I'm not
91:12 convinced any other country has and
91:14 besides
91:15 the United States and Russia countries
91:20 say they have them because it makes you
91:21 fear them right so just name every other
91:25 country I'm not convinced are they
91:28 invited to watch can we give them
91:30 partial credit for a particularly
91:32 detonation so they can go back home ago
91:34 France hasn't it
91:36 you know Great Britain has them okay
91:38 well where's your tests
91:39 oh well France did a bunch of tests in
91:42 the ocean is stuff maybe maybe so we'll
91:45 see
91:46 so it seems like there's there's a
91:49 decent theory in connection between us
91:51 being able to blow up the universe and
91:53 because I mean you know we just keep
91:55 tapping into bigger and bigger bombs
91:56 bigger and bigger cause and effect
91:58 models of chemistry and eventually you
92:02 could go to their peaceful planet it's
92:04 all utopian and start blowing the place
92:07 up just to take it over and so they
92:08 they're like look you know we did what
92:11 Tesla said which was we created plenty
92:14 of things to stop you if you get this
92:16 technology let's hope but if they exist
92:20 that is their their their track record
92:24 with us already just to keep that from
92:26 ever happening
92:27 so to surmise this whole thing my belief
92:32 system is fairly firm they're going to
92:35 be very much like us because of the
92:37 rules of the universe based on where
92:41 they live obviously some things are
92:43 going to be more developed than others
92:44 they may have gone through the same
92:48 evolutionary development that we've gone
92:50 through imagine and this has been
92:55 theorized before all right what hasn't
92:57 been theorized before you know we look
93:00 at all of us here on planet earth and
93:02 we're all different shapes and sizes and
93:04 colors and what-have-you but we know
93:06 that if we survive a million years we
93:10 will inbred
93:11 and breed so much that eventually we
93:16 turn into grey we turn into whatever the
93:20 amalgamation is of all of our skins
93:21 together unless you know people live in
93:26 Africa simply get thicker darker skin
93:28 because of the exposure to the Sun
93:30 there's plenty of white people live in
93:32 South Africa and jungles and stuff or
93:34 sorry yet deserts and you know
93:36 Australians haven't turned black just
93:38 because they lived there for several
93:39 hundred years so this process takes
93:42 place it takes a really long time let's
93:44 just say we do get to the point where
93:47 hair it's just a pain in the ass so we
93:50 don't grow it anymore our mouse well we
93:56 figured out ways of eating without
93:57 consuming food make all the vegetarians
94:01 and vegans happy in the world
94:03 so our jaw line gets a little smaller
94:05 you know you see someone who's lost
94:07 their teeth
94:07 you know the bone density
94:11 you know calms down a little bit and you
94:12 get that different shaped jaw it makes
94:15 sense in terms of our eyes well we
94:18 probably wouldn't develop almond eyes
94:20 unless for some weird reason we have to
94:22 live underground for an extremely long
94:24 time let's hope that doesn't happen
94:26 as far as our overall size hmm what
94:30 determines the size of a human being on
94:32 earth well I think it's very fascinating
94:35 it's still on earth we've got gigantic
94:37 Norwegian people and really tiny tiny
94:40 led Latin folks probably not technically
94:43 Latin folks but the more indigenous
94:45 races of South America some areas of
94:49 China do have smaller people some areas
94:52 of Japan have smaller people but they
94:55 still have folks the same size as
94:58 everybody else and of course they have
95:00 some little world-record tall people as
95:02 well but they're usually related to an
95:05 organ not performing properly which is
95:07 why we have giants humans as well
95:08 sometimes I think that in the overall
95:11 spectrum of time the only thing that
95:14 makes us tall or short is the gravity of
95:18 where you live I know some of you think
95:22 the world's a different shape than round
95:24 I don't know what we would do with that
95:26 particular theory in this thinking but
95:29 if the world is truly expanding 19
95:32 centimeters a year as tracked by Geneva
95:34 until I found out that that was
95:35 revealing the oil is not a fossil fuel
95:38 and that's what fuels the world's
95:40 economy and they erased the 19
95:43 meters which is insane because it does
95:46 do it you know a ball
95:49 there's 24,000 miles around 79 hundred
95:52 miles diameter growing 19 centimeters
95:55 you realize how much new material is
95:58 being introduced to the core of the
96:00 Earth from the Sun to do that I mean
96:01 it's a tremendous amount you know if
96:04 dinosaurs really existed okay and you
96:09 should go look up Neil Adams expanding
96:11 earth little three and a half a minute
96:13 thing on YouTube just look up Neil Adams
96:17 expanding earth he rolls back the age of
96:21 the earth and it's 100% perfect all the
96:24 continents connect on all sides and it's
96:26 about 25% the size of the earth today
96:29 well that would mean 25% of the gravity
96:33 then you theoretically could have
96:37 gigantic insects gigantic beings because
96:40 they don't weigh as much as they would
96:42 today if that's true which I don't think
96:46 dinosaurs existed because the other
96:47 thing that goes away and back in their
96:49 time frame is the lush vegetation was
96:53 it's even theorized that less of it lush
96:55 vegetation was something after them
96:57 which is why when Disney made the movie
96:59 dinosaurs it's a desert world it's funny
97:02 for the most part and it was it was even
97:05 publicized that this was so accurate you
97:08 know it was like well what the hell is a
97:09 brontosaurus eating right it's got to
97:11 eat like two truckloads of greens every
97:13 day and it's gonna die these things
97:15 can't exist but anyway smaller world
97:18 bigger people bigger world smaller
97:21 people for those of you who have studied
97:24 the Giants I will do an episode this
97:27 season about the Giants you know up to
97:30 25 foot giant skeletons that the Native
97:33 Americans show the Europeans who then
97:35 took the bones to the Smithsonian wrote
97:38 a bunch of papers and books on them and
97:39 then lost them it lost all those bones
97:43 okay what's the big threat man they're
97:46 already gone it's not like I mean I you
97:49 know and the funny thing is is it it it
97:52 probably jostles a little bit of their
97:54 evolutionary theory but
97:56 when I just folded into evolution and go
97:58 okay well these evolve too big and they
98:01 didn't survive see being smaller is
98:02 better
98:03 yay for humidity by the way I just saw a
98:07 movie tonight that was Brad Pitt and
98:11 Tommy Lee Jones in the movie ad astra
98:14 and i have to say it's it's about space
98:19 travel I can't really talk about the
98:23 overall ending arc of the movie because
98:27 it's a spoiler but if you like this kind
98:29 of conversation there is a tiny slice of
98:31 what they were driving towards in terms
98:36 of the theme of the entire movie that
98:39 does kind of belong in this conversation
98:41 maybe next season I'll talk about or
98:43 maybe before the end of this season I'll
98:45 spoil that that one out but I want to
98:48 say just as a total digression I think
98:51 Brad Pitt has finally become an actor I
98:54 when I saw him in Once Upon a Time in
98:58 Hollywood I thought for the very first
99:00 time I've seen him act pretty perfectly
99:04 from start to finish and really act and
99:07 this film he really acts I thought he
99:09 was pretty good in twelve Monkeys but
99:11 then he was kind of a it was kind of a
99:14 caricature of a human being so you got a
99:15 lot of leeway with that sort of thing
99:17 but now he's playing more literal
99:19 characters that have to have a certain
99:21 disposition of course Tarantino allows
99:23 some some craziness to occur but his
99:27 role in that movie was even very
99:28 tempered and I think very professional I
99:30 did not like him in Inglourious Basterds
99:33 but that's because I grew up around the
99:36 people he was trying to imitate I think
99:39 he did too I think he grew up in
99:40 Missouri I thought but I thought it was
99:43 such a bad impersonation it just every
99:45 time you talked it just made me realize
99:47 was watching a movie which is not what I
99:49 ever want to think I'm doing I
99:51 definitely be interested in any of the
99:53 research you guys have done most
99:56 specifically if there's any theory that
99:59 sticks in your head right the ones that
100:01 stick in your head are the ones that
100:03 have some sort of unresolved logic or
100:05 complete logic that I haven't mentioned
100:08 already
100:09 and drop that in the comments any videos
100:12 that you like drop them in by the way I
100:14 want to thank a lot of you for doing
100:16 exactly what I'm asking you to do I've
100:18 got probably a dozen videos to click
100:20 through and watch just from the last
100:23 several episodes I put out I'd like to
100:26 know if you guys think that they would
100:28 be like us
100:30 bipedal two arms two legs pretty much
100:33 the same configuration and skull and if
100:37 you have any theories beyond that I'd be
100:40 interested in hearing it explained as to
100:43 why because design that's intelligent or
100:48 evolution which is also the brute force
100:51 design of intelligence it's going to
100:54 weed out anything unnecessary so you
100:58 know what's what's really fascinating to
101:00 me is it
101:02 no bipedal well nothing big besides the
101:07 fake pterodactyl and what a joke that
101:09 thing is right other than the fake
101:11 pterodactyl we don't have any you know I
101:15 guess we have some theories of the big
101:17 Thunderbirds which we're suppose is a
101:19 lot of birds that are massive right so
101:21 you got birds that are like ten foot
101:22 wingspans but they have feathers they're
101:24 a bird right so they're the only thing
101:27 that gets the privilege of flight a bat
101:29 is kind of weird and that's I think a
101:31 lot people get the pterodactyl theory
101:33 well look at this thing it's hairless
101:34 its its its its featherless and it flies
101:37 so why can't I turn actual fly it's like
101:39 well the wings aren't big enough and all
101:41 this other stuff but we don't have like
101:43 flying bears we're not flying
101:45 Pegasus we don't have anything that's
101:47 flying so it's as if the engineering of
101:51 a wing was one of the most specific
101:53 things that happened and by our Eloi our
101:56 designers or evolution because we have
101:59 insects and birds that fly and nothing
102:03 else found it interesting to fly and I
102:06 think it has to do with the perhaps the
102:11 engineering of a wing but when I see an
102:14 eagle grab a dog and fly off right well
102:19 the dog weighs a dog weight you know
102:21 they're not grabbing like
102:23 you know Great Danes but they're
102:24 definitely grabbing dogs that are
102:25 between 30 and 50 pounds and no problem
102:28 at all flying off with the dog so it
102:32 seems as if you know if the wings are
102:35 that strong for pickups like that then
102:38 you know I'm a little shocked that we
102:40 don't have winged animals that are just
102:44 you know like I said you know anything
102:46 that's out there a cat a dog perfect
102:49 size to fly right smaller than a big
102:51 bird right and a part of that just you
102:54 know my mind
102:55 loosely links back to the idea of
102:57 intelligent design you know and that
103:01 word is that phrase and that category
103:04 has been largely likened to God and only
103:08 God intelligent design
103:10 you know for me I have a definite
103:14 believe in God belief in God I think
103:16 that for me it could be as simple as the
103:20 organized energy of the universe itself
103:22 maintaining all the physics and laws
103:24 that we live by which makes it possible
103:26 for me to communicate with you right now
103:28 you know an alien designing us some
103:31 people go well that's that's stupid
103:33 because God designed us ins like okay
103:35 well my mind it's just a food chain God
103:37 designs the alien and the alien gets to
103:40 design us we are frankensteining craft
103:42 together all the time on planet earth so
103:44 we do it you know again people forget
103:48 what we do and what we would do if we
103:50 could do it and what we're probably
103:51 going to be doing if the current
103:52 technology we're working on continues to
103:54 move in a particular direction it's
103:58 really strange I don't get it we again I
104:02 just want to emphasize as I'm finishing
104:05 out the last half inch of the cigar as
104:07 we learn in this world unfortunately
104:09 everything is sort of taught to us in a
104:13 closed paradigm I'm giving you the
104:16 answer the teacher says and it's this
104:19 and at no point are you to question what
104:22 I say you're not to research anything
104:25 else outside of what I say so everything
104:27 that we're saying to our kids have it's
104:31 largely just boxing in their brains
104:36 and obviously that's something that
104:38 people who control us love so I think
104:42 that on one level as a parent especially
104:45 we have to make sure our children when
104:48 they come home from school imagine this
104:51 you're you know when you're a parent you
104:54 get into loops min with your kids it's
104:57 just something that happens no one needs
104:58 to feel bad we get into loops okay but
105:02 imagine you're asking your child what
105:04 they learn today and if you set them up
105:07 before they go to school and I'm not
105:09 sure exactly what words to use I've been
105:12 at a young one in a long time but making
105:15 sure that you send them to school going
105:16 okay
105:17 here's what's about to happen they're
105:19 gonna teach you a bunch of things that
105:20 you need to know reading writing and
105:22 arithmetic those things are just cut and
105:25 dry but when they get into Sciences
105:28 they're gonna teach you things and in
105:31 their mind they're right and that
105:35 there's only one way to do everything
105:36 that they teach you however every day
105:40 you come home from school you can come
105:43 to me and ask me a question but I'm also
105:44 gonna ask you what you learned today and
105:46 after you tell me there might be some
105:49 categories might be some things they
105:50 teach you where I'm gonna give you other
105:53 possibilities and that way you keep the
105:57 gate the gates open your kid knows all
106:00 right this little ritual has happened a
106:02 few times I went and learned something
106:04 from school and my mom and my dad took
106:07 me aside and gave me some other ideas
106:10 maybe even prep them because I mean
106:12 believe me man the best thing you can do
106:15 is talk to your child like they're an
106:16 adult and I don't mean mean or you know
106:20 Stern or weird just treat them like
106:23 they're super intelligent because they
106:25 are and they will become more
106:27 intelligent as you treat them like an
106:30 adult because the other thing is you're
106:31 showing them respect even though you're
106:34 new to this world and you have an
106:36 experience everything your mom and dad
106:37 have experienced you can go research
106:40 things you can learn how to read a lot
106:42 faster than the other kids you can get
106:44 deeper into mathematics than kids you
106:46 know my dad started teaching me algebra
106:49 in third grade and you know the equal
106:52 sign and whatever is on one side has got
106:53 to match the thing on the other side but
106:55 it's two different equations and you
106:56 just got to simplify them down I went to
106:59 school and started it was just easy it
107:01 was strange it was never hard cuz my dad
107:03 didn't say okay this is really hard and
107:06 I'm gonna show it to you first because
107:08 it's really hard no he just showed it to
107:10 me and he showed it to me I think he was
107:12 saying it was easy yeah it was like okay
107:14 it became easy in my brain so you have
107:16 that power for your kids it's very
107:18 dramatic and if your grandparent then
107:20 just pass down your grandkids but the
107:23 other thing that we have to do as adults
107:25 is go back and audit everything that we
107:28 were taught that we were you know it's
107:31 one way and that's the way it is you
107:34 know as well as I do doctors are being
107:36 taught Dogma about how the human body
107:40 works why haven't we got curious to
107:42 cancer that's just you go to the store
107:44 where you buy mouthwash there's the cure
107:46 to cancer right next to it because
107:48 they've turned it into a business and
107:50 that there's two factors to this there's
107:52 the corporation that runs oncology
107:54 clinics doing it it's always
107:57 chemotherapy right get more cancer to
108:00 solve cancers so stupid right the other
108:03 one is they don't teach the doctor how
108:05 to think for themselves there's so much
108:08 to learn to be a doctor when do you have
108:11 time to think for yourself you're just
108:13 trying to pass the next test until you
108:15 get out to do your internship and then
108:17 you're with a bunch of closed mind
108:18 people that are being interns where is
108:22 medical science still very innovative
108:26 surgeries reconstructive surgeries you
108:30 know where you're you've got someone
108:32 who's been shot in the face with a
108:34 shotgun you got to rebuild their whole
108:36 face everything is a unique game on how
108:38 it's gonna work
108:39 you know a brain surgeons they're always
108:42 thinking up new things if you go watch
108:43 that show the knick which stands for
108:48 Nickelodeon that the hospital in New
108:50 York it's the turn of the century 1900
108:53 and they're trying to pioneer surgeries
108:55 and you see these guys whether it's
108:57 fictional not this is what was going on
108:59 they would have conferences where these
109:01 doctors had
109:02 how to perform surgeries that no one had
109:05 ever performed in history and they were
109:09 having to create their own medical
109:12 instruments to accomplish a lot of these
109:14 tasks so they would go one thing we
109:16 can't do is take two arteries and and
109:19 you know cut it and then make them go
109:21 back together so they developed a tool
109:22 to do that you know so just as a little
109:27 shots key in your brain you know again
109:31 what is it a sufficiently advanced
109:34 technology looks like magic yeah it does
109:38 doesn't it look at Star Trek all of the
109:42 medical lab stuff where they're just you
109:45 know waving this little thing over you
109:47 and it's it's reading out on the
109:49 tricorder as to what's wrong with you
109:51 and this just a probe that's hitting you
109:53 with a beam that's obviously not doing
109:56 you any harm but it's it's bouncing off
109:58 of the tissue subdermal external
110:01 whatever and they're going oh my gosh
110:03 yeah you got this problem I should just
110:05 take a couple of these in that little
110:07 shot here a little this than that and
110:08 heal bones right just everyone's
110:11 breaking their arms on enterprise
110:15 playing that game I can't was like Tom
110:18 jaunt or John Todd or whatever the hell
110:20 it is right it's like racquetball game
110:22 whatever people breaking their elbows
110:24 and their arms and they just come in
110:26 there and she just dr. Beverly Crusher
110:29 she puts this thing on him fixes their
110:32 bone she says she'll be sore for a
110:34 couple days but you'll be fine after
110:36 that thanks doc see you later magic
110:39 we've lost the entire initiative in
110:43 several areas of science and because you
110:46 have to get grants the people who hold
110:48 the purse strings there are controllers
110:49 they won't grant anyone to go find
110:52 solutions how many diseases have we been
110:54 chasing forever
110:56 that we don't have any solutions for
111:00 it's like the old saying you know the
111:03 definition of insanity is doing the same
111:04 thing expecting a change I will say that
111:09 it really looks like Alzheimer's which
111:11 is now called diabetes type 3 is it's
111:15 being figured out
111:16 they're figuring out what's causing it
111:18 and it really has to do with your food
111:19 supply kit creating the amyloid plaque
111:22 in your brain and they're finding out
111:25 what the brain likes to run on the
111:26 ketones that your brain likes to run on
111:29 and you know if you want to up your
111:30 ketone brain functionality which makes
111:33 you remember things better you keep your
111:36 carbs super low and I eat almost no
111:39 carbs they said you have to keep your
111:43 carbs under 50 grams but the average
111:45 human being eats 300 grams of carbs
111:47 which is all your breads all your pastas
111:50 so if you can drive all that down then
111:52 your key stones to come out of your fats
111:54 and sugars starts to surge and your
111:56 brain works really really well
111:58 hence doing shows like this I hope you
112:02 can hear that ring because it sounds
112:03 really awesome I know some of you live
112:06 in rainy world's but for me it's like
112:08 heaven to hear this so I hope you liked
112:11 this episode I've got quite a few in the
112:15 queue I think right now I've got four or
112:18 five in the queue for those of you know
112:20 this exact moment it's December 3rd
112:25 actually it's December 4th now the
112:27 morning of 3 o'clock in the morning I'm
112:31 dropping lots of episodes so I will tell
112:34 you that I'll probably get this one out
112:39 before I put the the other one I found
112:41 an episode from 2017 and it's on
112:45 forgiveness I don't know if it's any
112:47 good I tend to feel like it was pretty
112:49 good but I felt like I delayed its
112:51 release because I thought you know it's
112:55 one of those self-help things we're
112:56 gonna pan it's hopefully it's good but I
113:01 also thought I lost the audio file on
113:03 that particular one it's because I was
113:04 using logic to record my videos on my
113:07 Mac which ceremoniously died and so I
113:14 found it so I'm going to be pushing that
113:18 one out but I'm gonna put a date on the
113:20 front of that because it's so it's so
113:21 freakin old it's two years old can you
113:24 believe that
113:25 Peck's is a little over two years old
113:27 now
113:28 but I'm gonna gonna be pumping stuff out
113:30 I'm getting a little bit of a break here
113:32 in December my projects went on hold so
113:35 I'm starting a new film on my own and
113:39 just doing some other work so I've got
113:43 some got some more time to dedicate to
113:44 the show so you should be getting quite
113:46 a few episodes here again the season is
113:49 100 episodes so at the current click I'm
113:53 going at I'm gonna be at 50 into this
113:58 season a 450 here before the end of the
114:00 year most likely so they'll be have to
114:03 show over within approximately 4 months
114:07 so I may end up if I continue with this
114:09 pace I might end up completing this show
114:13 very early this this following year here
114:16 so we'll do the same thing we did last
114:17 time we just put our episodes during the
114:20 off season as well so won't go dead but
114:23 if you haven't been to deep thoughts
114:24 radio.com
114:25 please go that's where all the videos
114:26 are there's two video
114:29 get yourself a bit shoot account please
114:31 subscribe again we never know what's
114:33 gonna happen with YouTube and the
114:34 censoring thing there are all the links
114:37 for the audio podcast if you like to
114:39 listen to it in your car just get your
114:41 device that you listen to it on visit
114:43 the website and Kapow you're all setup
114:45 which is what most like your telephone
114:47 there are three social media there's
114:49 locked Facebook group a Twitter page and
114:52 the competitor to face book called
114:53 mine's calm I had quite a bit of traffic
114:56 when someone recommended it to me I
114:59 don't think anyone's seen the page in a
115:01 really long time but it's a beautiful
115:03 site and it is a free speech zone I
115:06 would say that you know we've been
115:09 threatened by Facebook a couple times
115:11 with posts and you know they put the
115:13 little bumper in there and we could take
115:14 down your whole page not sure if I do if
115:19 that ever gets taken down I'm gonna
115:20 create a another page for it and I'm
115:22 just gonna put a post that says get over
115:24 to mines calm hopefully you don't go out
115:26 of business but with the lack of traffic
115:28 I'm seeing I'm a little freaked out that
115:30 might actually happen over there which
115:32 would be a shame there are a couple of
115:34 ways to donate to the page patreon is
115:36 the primary one PayPal is another way
115:38 you can just send little donation
115:41 your money goes towards paying $4,000
115:44 cameras and hundreds of dollars in
115:47 software plus smokes which is all good
115:50 for me my goal would be you know in some
115:53 fantasy world that this show blows up in
115:55 such a way that just everyone thrown in
115:58 a Bock I can do this full-time
115:59 it could be fantastic because I would
116:02 definitely bump up the format quality
116:04 and and obviously the density of the
116:07 episodes and they're in the amount of
116:09 research so put it this way if you like
116:12 if you ever learn anything from the
116:14 shows that's valuable to you that's the
116:17 model that will increase that
116:19 tremendously but what you get from
116:20 patreon is you get the episodes ahead of
116:22 time and I'm really gonna I've just made
116:26 sort of a philosophical change recently
116:29 to make sure that they're up there for a
116:30 couple days and just editing very
116:32 quickly it'll it'll rubberband a little
116:35 bit sometimes I'll be so late on Episode
116:37 I I do always post it on patreon usually
116:40 but it someone might go straight to
116:42 straight to YouTube when I'm running
116:44 really late on on a deployment the other
116:47 thing is that there are no season 1
116:48 episodes on this channel so I have
116:51 remastered them all put them on their
116:52 own channel so get over there and
116:54 subscribe just to have it in your queue
116:56 there's a little over 100 episodes over
116:58 there it's slightly different show it's
117:00 you know it's it's just my format was a
117:02 little rough I put the mic right against
117:04 my mouth which was unnecessary but I was
117:07 still figuring out how to do everything
117:08 but I think the subject matter is really
117:11 good I mean I was very proud when I went
117:13 back and watched it there's some very
117:16 important episodes that I refer to a lot
117:17 and it's getting it's getting views it
117:21 doesn't have enough views to monetize so
117:22 there's no ads at all on season 1
117:24 anymore the old episodes from this
117:27 channel there are season 1 do work but
117:29 they're unlisted so if you have them
117:30 embedded in a web page they're obviously
117:32 going to continue to work and they are
117:33 embedded all over the web so they still
117:35 get hit every single day ok well then
117:38 that thanks for joining me in this
117:40 really strange environment in my garage
117:42 with this really bizarre light that's
117:43 making me look really weird but until
117:46 next time take care of yourself and
117:47 someone else and I'll see you in the
117:49 next deep thoughts over now
