00:00 [Music]
00:34 good evening ladies and gentlemen
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts today's
00:39 episode is based on my comment that a
00:43 close friend of mine made and as well as
00:45 comments that you want to pay a lot
00:46 attention to because it was one it comes
00:50 from a friend of mine who was extremely
00:52 informed but more than that he he
00:58 watches politics from all sides all day
01:02 long you knows everything about Q knows
01:05 everything about what every mass media
01:07 outlets saying Twitter's Twitter
01:11 accounts I should say from both the left
01:14 and the right and he just looked at me
01:16 and he said you know he was talking
01:20 about you know he said a flow of
01:21 consciousness but then his last
01:22 statement was well you know this thing's
01:26 gonna be over soon and I said why is
01:28 that and he goes but how many war how
01:30 many more wars can they have and I was
01:34 like hold that thought dip dip dip put
01:37 it in my phone like that's gonna be an
01:39 episode let me hook you real quick if I
01:42 said war it never changes but I said
01:47 what do you think about when I say the
01:49 word war I did a whole episode on it
01:51 I believe in season 1 we opened it up
01:53 with Black Sabbath it was awesome
01:56 if I say war you probably see some stock
02:01 news footage in your brain if you're a
02:03 normal citizen if you're an ex-soldier
02:06 acting active-duty soldier you're seeing
02:09 your own personal experience but let me
02:13 highlight something and bring a bunch of
02:16 other stuff into this category that we
02:18 call war most of us have had a some form
02:22 of a war online in a comment section on
02:26 a post could be something stupid about
02:29 your favorite movie or your favorite
02:32 kool-aid you know flavor or it could be
02:34 something really serious we've had wars
02:38 between family members we've had wars
02:42 between friends we have Wars in our
02:45 minds that were scared to even
02:47 acknowledged I give you some examples
02:52 one of the things that the instigators
02:56 of war which is what this whole thing is
02:57 going to be about you can think of as
03:00 part to to war the war episode they love
03:05 finding a subject matter that is not
03:07 something that we all agree on
03:09 they love subject matters where they
03:12 polarized a particular region of the
03:14 population if not the entire planet in a
03:17 50/50 or very close approximation of
03:20 that and they just keep jabbing it right
03:25 when I was a kid I used to have two
03:29 friends that were brothers and for
03:31 whatever reason they like to fight it's
03:33 almost like they like to fight and I
03:36 remember being able to say something to
03:39 one of them and because one of them was
03:42 more dominant the younger one was more
03:44 dominant than the older one and you know
03:47 I don't have any brothers and sisters so
03:49 I would watch him hit each other or
03:53 whatever and it's lightweight stuff
03:54 nothing big no teeth are coming out no
03:56 wise are getting poked up and I just go
03:58 you gonna let him do that to you you
04:00 know gotta fight back man and boy keep
04:03 going and keep going yeah I only did it
04:05 with them so shame on me but anyway I
04:08 was a little [ __ ] starter those two
04:10 people but there are controversies like
04:14 do you believe that abortion should be
04:16 used as a casual form of contraceptive
04:20 there's the huge debate which is is it a
04:27 mental illness to look at your gender
04:30 and find yourself outside of the normal
04:33 sort of LGBT community
04:37 you know tea is where you start getting
04:40 into that kind of gray area for most
04:42 people right because they're straight
04:43 people and you're gay people oh they
04:47 like who they are I mean they look at
04:48 the mirror and they go I am my gender I
04:50 dig that part and I just like my own
04:53 gender there's no debate as to what they
04:55 are but now there's like
04:59 sixty plus more almost seventy more
05:03 genders because someone wants a dress up
05:05 like a a furry someone wants to crap in
05:07 their diapers until they die and some
05:09 family wants to take care of the old guy
05:11 in diapers because they lost their
05:13 child's to college in life and they want
05:15 that responsibility again you know I
05:17 mean there's a billion combinations if
05:20 someone put a gun to my head and I had
05:22 to make up 15 genders I would be a dead
05:25 man before it ever got to 10 because I
05:26 can't conceive of that many genders and
05:30 yet there's some drop-down list in the
05:32 EU with all those genders there are
05:34 people that have never started
05:36 businesses who have all these opinions
05:37 about capitalism and the people that
05:40 have started businesses and benefited
05:42 from it there's a war between those two
05:45 people because one knows about what
05:46 they're talking about and one doesn't
05:50 you see it I'm saying war is everywhere
05:53 it's on every single level and believe
05:55 me of tomorrow they could think up
05:57 another reason out of thin air for us to
06:00 hate each other and to war they would
06:03 and they figure out formulas right they
06:06 figure out formulas that play on fear
06:11 right so he might go to the deep south
06:15 you might find a community that's fairly
06:17 corn teams from any other race and they
06:21 just wiggle a few guys into the bars or
06:23 into like Masonic clubs or whatever
06:26 maybe some of those clubs that burn
06:28 crosses all those from my perspective my
06:31 information that stuff is next to
06:33 nothing in population but they start
06:38 telling stories about how those races do
06:40 all these things around the world and
06:42 you know maybe some of them are true
06:43 they're not likely to happen in that
06:45 area of the world but they freaked them
06:47 out and then all the sudden they get him
06:49 to double down and then they start
06:51 seating them with the resolution well
06:54 you know what you got to do don't you
06:56 they're fearful the answer you know
06:59 because the answer is gonna be risk well
07:01 you got to get rid of them all like oh
07:04 my god but I'm afraid of them I'm
07:07 literally afraid of fighting one well
07:09 we'll all get together and in numbers
07:11 we'll get rid of them right
07:14 but you have your psycho version of that
07:17 whether trying to get rid of someone
07:19 who's just a little bit different than
07:20 them I mean can you imagine in New York
07:23 City it was kind of portrayed in gangs
07:27 in New York the movie but there's a lot
07:28 of truth to it
07:30 you have the British disliking the Irish
07:33 Scottish the Germans the Spanish here
07:36 they are all from the same region but
07:39 they find a way to carry their prejudice
07:41 across the river to America and they
07:46 fought like cats and dogs why don't--why
07:48 crime right he is get a bit of an olive
07:51 skin thing in Spain but they found a way
07:54 to fight and then when that all calmed
07:57 down
07:58 then it was any race that look different
08:02 than them and of course the Native
08:03 Americans were savagely murdered in
08:06 between all that stuff right when they
08:08 started moving west but again they had
08:11 to sell the savage word savagery they're
08:14 savages they had to sell that word to
08:17 the white man so that as they move west
08:20 that's what they said those are animals
08:23 but the little kid said why dad why are
08:26 they animals we'll see they haven't even
08:28 discovered the wheel yet oh yeah I mean
08:32 the wheel kid that's how primitive they
08:36 are and therefore they're evil and
08:38 they're savage right and you know James
08:40 Cameron did a good job
08:42 stealing again the Doctor Who script
08:45 called Kenda I believe 1981 or 82 there
08:51 was literally a mere copy his movie
08:52 avatar back in the day where they were
08:55 calling all these indigenous tribal
08:57 people played by white people but they
08:59 had tribal makeup on they were calling
09:01 them savages so they could steal all
09:03 their land same thing to happen in
09:05 Avatar
09:06 I had to upload that photo tonight for
09:08 you guys I made a composite photo that
09:10 proves that the two are the same but
09:14 anyway what's really frustrating is that
09:19 you do have well you have this old
09:23 playbook
09:24 it's a joke it is like oh well we don't
09:29 need to worry about the baby boomers
09:30 getting convinced and again it's just
09:31 talking about that age range
09:33 the 50s and overs or the 40s and overage
09:35 because they're not going to fight our
09:36 Wars right we need 18 to 23 to enlist
09:41 they're so impressionable it's
09:43 ridiculous you know they want to be a
09:45 part of something big and so hey they
09:47 come in and there's legitimate military
09:48 training it's great for you it organizes
09:51 your life gives you a sense of purpose
09:53 and camaraderie awesome but they'll be
09:56 hopefully this has changed for America
09:58 but you know we're all going to breathe
10:00 deeply in the meantime and the more only
10:01 one little tiny 5% of the world
10:03 population but everybody else can get
10:09 these old play books and start telling
10:11 you who he has the boogeyman over there
10:12 and that's the boogeyman over there
10:13 you got a fight you got a fight and when
10:17 I was a kid it was almost completely
10:19 fictional sure part of the world's doing
10:23 something that I wouldn't do there's
10:25 laws that we wouldn't dare follow in
10:27 America but they weren't going anywhere
10:29 they weren't migrating to him to Europe
10:32 today you have a George Soros putting
10:35 billions of dollars into the migration
10:38 of immigrants from one place the world
10:40 to the other part but prior to him
10:43 putting in the billions of dollars there
10:45 was nearly a trillion dollars invested
10:47 in that region of the world to teach
10:48 them all to regress their religious
10:51 beliefs back to infidel passages that
10:53 have been largely erased and then
10:56 resurrected and empowered the Sharia law
10:59 sects of the Middle East again it was
11:02 largely erased by 1960 again Iran was
11:06 like this totally hip cat place to be
11:07 man the Rat Pack would have gone to
11:09 perform there and then all sudden to
11:12 turn back into like the stone Age's now
11:15 again I think the majority everybody in
11:17 the Middle East just wants a peaceful
11:19 life they want to live in their own
11:20 region they don't wanna get bombed they
11:21 don't wanna be invaded they don't want
11:24 to do any shady deals with anyone just
11:25 wanna live a normal life but you don't
11:30 need that many do you to fall for this
11:32 other game 10 to 50 million people which
11:36 is nothing in the world population
11:39 just need that mini to kind of believe
11:41 all this stuff you tseng chien their
11:43 education you promote schools that you
11:47 pay for and subsidized and mosques that
11:48 you subsidize you find a couple radical
11:51 people that were beat up when they were
11:52 young or perhaps now we've been at war
11:54 in that region for over twenty years
11:56 roughly it really it's kind of 30-plus
12:00 years because of Desert Storm so you had
12:05 some poor you know guy that's lost his
12:07 whole family to some bomb that we
12:08 dropped over there is United States
12:10 citizens and of course we are the evil
12:14 we removed his family members so they
12:19 instantly find that guy and they
12:20 instigate up all of his beliefs well my
12:23 friend was alluding to was that the
12:25 world is getting fatigue fatigue on many
12:30 levels we're getting fatigue on social
12:32 media we're definitely getting fatigue
12:34 on fake news we're getting fatigue on
12:36 technology yeah you know a lot of us
12:40 live in our cell phones cuz yeah you got
12:42 to eat a meal by yourself why not
12:44 you know you get only people watch so
12:47 much in a particular venue if you've go
12:49 into a place at a weird time of day
12:50 there's nobody there we're going to
12:51 stare at the clock watch some shitty
12:53 television somewhere now you get a crawl
12:56 into your own world but cell phone sales
13:00 are down all over the place technology
13:04 itself is the salvation for all boredom
13:06 starting to go away well usually okay
13:11 usually if you set out a goal it has a
13:15 deadline and there's some result you're
13:19 trying to get as Tony Rockefeller told
13:23 Aaron Rizzo they were gonna start a
13:25 hundred year war with no enemy meaning
13:29 you couldn't find them they didn't
13:30 belong to a country they're nomadic
13:33 killers I'm sure enough we got LCI ada
13:39 all right the CIA database of all these
13:42 warlords all these Taliban guys and had
13:45 a bunch of other mercenary folks a bunch
13:48 of people that were duped and so they
13:50 started the
13:51 the war for about 15 years and then they
13:54 had major fatigue we weren't beating
13:57 them and then all of a sudden they said
13:58 up we beat them oh but now there's Isis
14:00 Oh which I don't know why then be Arab
14:03 cause an ISIL I don't know what the L
14:05 stands for they rebranded the same old
14:08 thing but then they had to fund them
14:10 they had to arm them and that's Regan
14:12 the Clintons and the Obamas and the
14:15 McCain's and the Pelosi is all working
14:17 together to have guns made shipped
14:19 around the world give it to Benghazi
14:22 Benghazi gets fry they sent a bunch of
14:25 them up somehow they got a bunch of BMWs
14:27 and Mercedes to drive around in they had
14:31 a bunch of American m16s bunch of Verna
14:34 coughs and so they started back up again
14:41 but then he got really tired you know
14:45 every country that wasn't a part of the
14:47 World Bank is under attack
14:48 especially Syria and Iran they just kept
14:52 playing the same game in the same
14:53 playbook constantly constantly
14:55 constantly they're telling themselves
14:59 that they can you know it's just almost
15:02 like a tenacious business right you can
15:05 just keep pushing and pushing and
15:07 pushing on a business to accomplish a
15:09 goal it's over like that scene in Willy
15:11 Wonka's chocolate factory where the the
15:14 brouk assaults father he used to be in
15:20 the he's in the nut business and so he
15:22 took all of his ladies that pack up the
15:23 nuts and he had them unpack bars of
15:26 chocolate because he promised his
15:27 daughter she'd be the first one to get a
15:29 ticket and she was only the second or
15:32 something like that but anyway you can
15:35 push and push and push in a business and
15:37 that's usually what these bankers are
15:39 used to getting which is essentially
15:42 anything that they want they just hire
15:45 people to do it what do you need what do
15:47 you need it's not bothering me give me
15:49 one list of everything you need give me
15:51 a deadline when you could be done and
15:52 they're like Darth Vader if they don't
15:53 [ __ ] deliver squeeze the neck they're
15:55 gone bring in the next dude let's go
15:57 well when the elements of accomplishment
16:00 involves the human consciousness and the
16:02 human DNA
16:04 that is free from you know microchip
16:07 placements when we have largely a freer
16:12 world than they want us to have because
16:14 we can get on a plane and get someplace
16:15 else in the world and we can talk to
16:17 each other online well they can't force
16:21 us like slaves and so they pushed and
16:25 they push and we get tired and we get
16:28 tired and the whole rationale for why
16:30 you're doing what you're doing
16:31 starts to end right how many of you been
16:34 in a bad relationship that you stayed in
16:36 simply because you got addicted to the
16:37 process of the relationship but then
16:40 eventually over time hopefully before
16:43 it's too late to find somebody else you
16:45 realize you know what the hell am I
16:47 doing here this person is absolutely
16:49 horrible for me maybe they're a horrible
16:51 person as is maybe they're just a fine
16:54 person but they just don't want what I
16:56 want and so you just kind of walk away a
16:59 lot of job to do that you're in a job
17:02 you have a philosophy about the job and
17:05 then you kind of just go you know what
17:07 am i doing I don't want to do this I'd
17:09 rather be homeless than do this and you
17:11 walk away and to your miraculous
17:13 surprise you find the person that loves
17:15 you more and you get a better job
17:17 hmm how many will more wars can they
17:20 start well what's interesting is that I
17:23 would normally have maybe two years ago
17:25 said well Jesus infinite they can just
17:28 keep going and going and going I might
17:31 have been skeptical about physical wars
17:33 between two countries but now I think
17:36 it's a little bit different I think
17:38 people are starting to wake up big time
17:40 it's obviously not my Epiphany we're
17:42 calling it the Great Awakening for a
17:43 reason I think that they played so many
17:46 cards in 2016 and the Democrats in the
17:50 United States have played so many cars
17:52 in 17 and 18 none of which are called
17:56 progress that we're now done Candice
18:00 Owens a brilliant woman who is leading
18:04 the march for the I think she's calling
18:07 it black sit something like that she is
18:10 trying to get the black community in
18:14 America I'm not gonna call him
18:16 african-american
18:17 sorry I'll do that every once in a while
18:19 but we've had black people in this
18:22 country for 400 years and they have
18:25 earned the right to be called Americans
18:28 they're not black I understand I was
18:30 friends with Michael Collins from Venice
18:32 Beach and he made a great point he goes
18:34 because we only have a couple colors you
18:36 white people have a thousand colors
18:37 you're colored her brown or black at
18:39 best rate we're not even black but
18:42 anyway she's trying to teach the
18:45 communities in the United States both
18:48 those that are prosperous those are
18:50 stuck in you know CIA oppressed ghettos
18:55 that they've been had by the Democratic
18:59 Party absolutely had now is there a
19:01 couple contingencies on the right sure I
19:04 guess you know there's some racist
19:05 groups in the world but I tell you what
19:07 you know we're all waking up to the
19:10 point that we're realizing oh wait a
19:11 minute you know we love each other's
19:14 food we to love each other's music we
19:16 love each other's culture we're not
19:18 terribly different from each other and
19:20 they're part of the base race that built
19:23 this country did built it they gave it
19:26 character you like Elvis Presley we
19:28 better give it up to Little Richard and
19:29 Chuck Chuck Berry and a bunch of other
19:31 blues guys before them right he white
19:34 boys that like breakdancing hey go look
19:37 back it's like that what is it the 20s
19:39 and 30s when they used to dance like
19:40 that on TV and movies there's no white
19:44 people in those shots okay so we've
19:46 learned to get along and you know a
19:48 great to great extent but she is getting
19:51 rid of the war at least that they've
19:54 been fighting for decades and decades
19:57 and decades a bunch of snowflakes are
20:01 turning into Republicans now they
20:03 far-right Radical Republicans know they
20:06 don't belong to a militia a lot of them
20:07 will still won't own a gun but they saw
20:10 themselves get duped they went to a
20:12 protest told to hold a sign and say a
20:14 bunch of things bad about somebody then
20:18 the news caster came up and said what
20:21 are you protesting about about this well
20:23 tell me about that
20:26 look through their friends and they got
20:28 nothing and they're like okay I'm gonna
20:30 get mad at you and spit at you but as
20:32 soon as I'm done spitting on you I ain't
20:33 coming back to one of these goddamn
20:34 protests I'm gonna find out why I
20:36 couldn't answer the question oh and then
20:38 some of them are part of the walkaway
20:41 movement hmm there's a funny meme going
20:45 around that says it's got Pelosi yelling
20:48 in the picture and it says of course I'm
20:51 for open borders and illegal aliens
20:53 because no one in this country votes for
20:56 us anymore what are they telling people
20:58 in South America they're convincing them
21:02 that we have just you know troughs of
21:04 gold coins and food and freed houses and
21:07 social programs that can take care of
21:09 them well who do you think's telling
21:10 them that stuff they're selling them
21:12 upriver when they get here they don't
21:14 get in and now they've trekked
21:15 completely across their continent and
21:17 they're not going anywhere and they're
21:19 hated by those in Mexico or like get the
21:21 [ __ ] out of here man we don't any money
21:24 for you we barely have money for
21:25 ourselves you know the average citizen
21:28 in Mexico makes $500 a month that's it
21:32 okay there's not a lot to go around war
21:35 it's all over the place it's in every
21:40 category of everything they want you to
21:42 be at war with yourself they want you to
21:45 struggle with paradigms of especially
21:48 the doublespeak which we call you know
21:51 the cognitive dissidence where you know
21:56 something is a particular way but
21:58 they've told you you can't acknowledge
22:00 it as the way that it is and so you sit
22:03 and struggle inside it's a little PTSD
22:05 you got for every single subject that
22:08 they get you to buy into the gender
22:11 thing is huge and there's a few people
22:13 out there that just are sick and tired
22:15 of the [ __ ] and they're like look your
22:17 boy your girl if you don't like to
22:21 procreate like we are designed by the
22:24 evolution perfect algorithm of those who
22:27 think that the world came from the Big
22:28 Bang or for those of you who religious
22:30 and believe that there's some sort of
22:31 divine creation or maybe an alien or
22:34 whatever you're designed for an inny to
22:36 go into or an outy to go into an innie
22:38 and that's the only way
22:39 that our race procreates it's the only
22:42 way anything else is an odyssey a freak
22:45 show and they are sitting there going
22:47 look boy scouts are for [ __ ] boys I'm
22:49 really really sorry bro scouts are for
22:52 girls it's just that simple if you are
22:56 butthurt because you don't belong to the
22:57 other group then you need to go see a
22:59 psychiatrist or psychologist and work
23:02 out your personal problem because we are
23:06 designed to be this way
23:07 war but then maybe you're an empathetic
23:10 person you're thinking well geez the
23:13 whole planet because you look at
23:14 everything through the eyes of you know
23:16 social media mass media and liberal
23:21 owned organizations that pump the
23:23 television shows at you you're seeing
23:25 that you know it's being introduced
23:29 constantly so it's like you think it's
23:31 never gonna go away it's like well okay
23:32 I need to come up with something that's
23:33 like alright you know I got friends that
23:37 identify as some other things they're
23:39 perfectly wonderful people that never
23:42 comes up in our conversation they don't
23:44 whine and complain that they weren't
23:45 able to accomplish something in their
23:46 day because of the identification that
23:48 they have so you think okay well you
23:50 know that's cool those people are cool
23:54 and then you see on TV and on the
23:56 internet these freak shows these like
23:59 one in a billion people and you think oh
24:03 my god you know some people aren't
24:05 social welfare welfare literately
24:07 because they have so many tattoos so
24:10 many piercings and so many cosmetic
24:12 surgeries that no one will hire them
24:15 I've seen two or three articles where
24:16 they're whining they've turned
24:18 themselves into like [ __ ] like
24:20 physical Halloween costumes and hey
24:24 nobody has a problem with them doing
24:26 whatever they're doing to themselves you
24:28 know we wish them the best but it that
24:30 way right I don't lose any sleep over I
24:33 don't dislike them at all right but I
24:36 sit there and I think to myself well if
24:37 what they're doing is destroying their
24:39 ability to get a job well then I guess
24:41 we have to allow them to get jobs and
24:44 then when my little you know
24:45 four-year-old walks up to a woman that
24:48 looks or a dude that he can't even
24:49 [ __ ] tell anymore but they look like
24:51 a monster because
24:53 worship the devil they split their
24:54 tongue in half they tattooed their
24:55 eyeballs full facial tattoo
24:58 they put [ __ ] horns like a devil on
25:00 their head and I'm supposed to say it's
25:02 okay Bobby right or Rebecca or whatever
25:07 my little daughter is freaking out
25:08 because she's only seen this [ __ ] in her
25:11 [ __ ] nightmares you see how they got
25:14 you all right they create these
25:16 controversies in your mind no matter how
25:18 how you no tolerance you are of the
25:22 world they can always create something
25:24 that's absolutely crazy
25:25 the pride parades are really hard for
25:28 most citizens they're hard for me right
25:30 all this nudity that is illegal right
25:33 you piss out back of a bar I mentioned
25:35 this before but you can get a ticket for
25:37 that for decent exposure and they can
25:39 choose to put you on some sort of pervy
25:41 list for the rest of your life you got
25:43 to report to your neighbors that you're
25:44 some sort of sexual deviant just because
25:47 you pissed out behind a bar but during a
25:49 Pride Parade again nudity is everywhere
25:52 from the age of whatever to whatever and
25:54 it's super explicit right you got guys
25:58 giving guys [ __ ] right in front of
26:00 little kids you got old men wearing
26:02 dildo costumes with their junk your rec
26:05 to pushing out the front chicks driving
26:08 by with the tits out you know again we
26:11 should love the human body I get that
26:13 whole thing but this is all in a context
26:15 of programming the mind this is what we
26:18 do this is and kids are looking up to
26:20 adults to decide how they're going to
26:22 behave themselves right and if anyone
26:24 denies that you're just a [ __ ] idiot
26:26 right we have mother Goose syndrome
26:29 it's an you can watch it duck attached
26:32 to a dog and he thinks the dog is its
26:34 parent that's how super powerful that
26:37 Association is but it's only during a
26:39 certain formidable amount of years right
26:41 war it's everywhere right controversy
26:47 conflict it's not always a jerk being
26:52 intolerant it's someone trying to
26:54 preserve the human race it's trying to
26:57 preserve cultural norms that we call
27:01 norms okay I know that what is normal
27:03 there's no no
27:04 necessarily speaking but it's ways that
27:07 we use to protect our kids right we have
27:10 female bathrooms and male bathrooms why
27:13 do we do that
27:13 ask yourself some point it happened
27:18 right in fact I don't even know I don't
27:20 know when they split it apart but why
27:22 did they do that
27:23 because guys should be pulling their
27:24 junk out in front of little girls that
27:27 no one really worries about a woman
27:28 going into a male bathroom and raping
27:30 some boy it doesn't happen
27:32 women aren't programmed to be irrational
27:34 for procreation men we have this thing
27:38 where you know an 18 year old kid gets a
27:42 way before that but I mean you know you
27:43 get to this point where you're driven
27:49 beyond rational thought and so the
27:54 problem is that when you act out in this
27:56 irrational mode of thoughts you're not
27:59 rational right and so we have a huge
28:02 problem in society right now which is
28:04 date rape right and they're not all
28:07 roofie date rapes the girls that said oh
28:09 you know I'd like to maybe go through a
28:11 couple bases with you but I sure as hell
28:13 don't want to go through the last two
28:14 saving that's for someone special a
28:17 moment that's special not in a car or
28:19 whatever and it doesn't go down like
28:22 that right because the guy is completely
28:24 driven by a primal force that he can't
28:28 pull his head out of his ass now like
28:31 take me I've been very fortunate that
28:33 I've had that when I had that feeling as
28:34 with someone special and it was all
28:37 consensual but you know I fear I mean I
28:42 think my lucky starts to split this way
28:43 I think my lucky stars that it didn't
28:46 happen with someone that got me all the
28:49 way up to the very edge and then said no
28:51 that was an adult I've had that happened
28:53 to me a couple times and it was a cinch
28:54 it was like oh oh hey man I don't do
28:56 anything without permission
28:57 trust me great and it works out but I
29:02 think some dudes carry that all the way
29:03 you know into there whatever they're
29:05 they're probably 40s and 50s you know
29:07 they never had anyone say no before
29:10 maybe they were married for 25 years and
29:12 the woman liked it every day then the
29:14 girlfriend the first girlfriend he has
29:16 is like hey no no
29:17 we don't know each other good you know
29:19 enough he's like boom right they screwed
29:23 the guide up by indoctrinating him maybe
29:25 watch too much porn on the internet and
29:28 now he's at war with a woman man
29:30 wherever the hell they are he needs to
29:33 back off but maybe he doesn't right I
29:35 think most of you know that in the Great
29:37 Awakening one of the big thing that's
29:38 happening is that we are trying to
29:42 mature as quickly as possible but on
29:44 that pretence the idea is or in the in
29:47 that sense the idea is that you know
29:49 people that can't wake up and you can't
29:52 understand why they can't wake up it's a
29:55 bizarre thing I've eaten dinner recently
30:00 with kind of a quiet polite
30:03 I guess liberal and you know I hear he's
30:08 very very intelligent very kind with his
30:13 delivery on any subject matter that he
30:15 thinks I'm going to disagree with or
30:17 whatever you I'm a bit of a bull in a
30:19 china shop but that kind of conversation
30:20 when I really know someone I'm like yeah
30:22 you can hear everything that I think and
30:24 I know you won't agree but I want you to
30:26 hear me as raw as real as I am because
30:29 I'm genuine right
30:30 try not to be rude but you'll hear
30:34 indoctrinated phrases you'll hear people
30:36 talk right out of you know talking
30:41 points that were handed to them by the
30:42 mass media nearly you're sitting there
30:44 waiting going okay okay I've heard all
30:46 that before because I watch more news
30:48 than you do
30:49 even your crappy news I watch it and I
30:51 listen to it so now give me any line out
30:54 of your brain that isn't off mass media
30:58 crickets man nothing zero if they
31:03 elaborate they simply change channels in
31:05 their brain though tell me like a bunch
31:06 of CNN stuff but dip it dip it and I'll
31:09 go hey well you know well what else do
31:11 you think about that because that's all
31:12 the stuff I hear on mask meat and they
31:13 just go PBS bah bah bah bah right and
31:16 they just changed channels in their
31:17 brain and so he's fighting a war with
31:24 anybody else like me maybe one of you
31:26 guys in Europe anywhere in your Great
31:28 Britain Europe whatever
31:30 do they tell you that Russians are bad
31:33 over there because in America it's weird
31:37 the only people that tell us that
31:39 Russians are bad are the Democrats the
31:42 Liberals our president was an [ __ ] if
31:45 he ever talked to Russia in the months
31:48 preceding his presidency even though
31:50 according to the indoctrinated war
31:54 mongering [ __ ] playbook Russia is the
31:59 number one military threat against the
32:01 United States of America okay so
32:04 wouldn't it be nice to be friends with
32:06 those guys to go talk to them I mean
32:07 isn't it if you can have a conversation
32:09 with your enemy an intelligent dialogue
32:12 with your enemy aren't you making
32:14 progress right Putin's not a guy that
32:17 sits around and you know counts like a
32:19 baby I don't know what that guy's IQ is
32:22 but it must be large okay but they've
32:26 got us worried about a collusion thing
32:28 none of it happened but I almost think
32:31 well it should have happened like we
32:34 should have talked to those folks not
32:36 colluding to steal a election which is a
32:38 whole line of [ __ ] [ __ ] right
32:40 what is it they said that I think it was
32:43 Instagram or Facebook or whatever they
32:45 bought 46 hundred dollars worth the ads
32:46 let's put that to bed real quick shall
32:49 we let's say you're different than me or
32:53 maybe we're the same [ __ ] I don't know
32:54 but you have a belief about brexit you
32:56 have a belief about the EU about whether
32:59 Trump should be a president or somebody
33:00 else would be president you have that
33:02 belief and with the Liberals in America
33:06 wants you to believe is that you've
33:07 looked at a Facebook ad and you changed
33:11 your [ __ ] decision right I would
33:16 wager I would wager that that is below a
33:20 single percent of a single percent of a
33:22 single percent in reality like if we had
33:24 to be the god facts right we asked the
33:27 god whatever the rules our planet how
33:31 many people converted due to a Facebook
33:32 and God's gonna be there going what oh
33:35 no nobody did that
33:37 it's a [ __ ] dumb idea no one ever
33:39 does that he's doing something else
33:40 right the whole basis of the collusion
33:44 is is an IQ test and anybody that
33:46 believes it is failing the IQ test I
33:49 mean we're talking about zero on the
33:52 knowledge scale on the intelligence
33:55 scale and you know maybe a couple points
33:57 in the smart scale maybe but they're
33:59 never able to attach logic to [ __ ]
34:03 reason to to fact it's ridiculous right
34:06 but again I'll say it right now anyone
34:11 who's running for any major presidential
34:14 chancellor or prime minister office in
34:17 this planet would be more qualified if
34:21 they had a good relationship with
34:23 Vladimir Putin or some of his direct
34:25 reports right they'd be more qualified
34:27 because they're like look we're gonna
34:29 stop this goddamn Russia Russia Russia
34:31 thing these people are somehow evil go
34:35 watch Russian car crash videos they got
34:38 other things to worry about they're
34:39 trying to figure out how to cross the
34:41 street and look both ways and they're
34:42 trying to figure out how to look how to
34:43 how to basically make a left turn
34:45 without crossing in front of traffic
34:46 they have much bigger fish to fry
34:49 good to be in some goddamn world war
34:52 with somebody by the way my um I think
34:55 it's my episode called fake enemies he
34:57 got demonetized
34:59 and why did you demonize because I was
35:01 against
35:02 hating other people a petition to have
35:05 it
35:06 rebo no ties not because I need the four
35:08 bucks it's going to generate over one
35:10 year but just to see what would happen
35:12 they're like no no and they won't
35:13 [ __ ] tell you they won't tell you
35:15 what you said or what's in there that's
35:16 bad it's obviously not foul language
35:19 they let that go through every day it's
35:21 amazing how YouTube videos can actually
35:23 use dirty words in the title and they
35:26 can use dirty words as slides within
35:29 their presentations and they'll still be
35:31 monetized so where does thing I mean
35:34 it's good but you mentioned some
35:36 contextual reference
35:38 towards well against the deep state and
35:43 they'll shut you down what's let me give
35:46 you an example of a conversation starter
35:49 or at least a segue
35:56 I don't want to say this sort of a pause
35:59 in the conversation that we don't have
36:01 and that's just to lean across the table
36:04 after someone has you know again you're
36:06 if you're hip to this episode you've
36:07 been hip now to what a dozen categories
36:11 in which we war with each other he just
36:14 leaned up across the table you're late
36:17 aren't you tired of being at war with
36:20 everything with foreign countries in
36:23 your brain with political parties with
36:27 genders with whatever but they're not
36:31 McDonald's is better than chick-fil-a
36:33 aren't you tired the windows versus
36:36 Macintosh iPhone versus Android aren't
36:39 you tired of that crap now what would
36:43 you do if you said and you know the
36:46 rhetorical answer is yes you just know
36:48 before you ask and then when they're
36:49 kinda look at you like yeah of course
36:51 you know and you're like okay if you and
36:54 I could decide at this table that we are
36:56 now sick and tired of this crap can we
37:00 end it can we end it what would you do
37:07 the very next step to not hate
37:10 everything not to be at war of
37:12 everything and the idea might be to say
37:16 well we've got some time we're eating at
37:19 our favorite restaurant we're at the
37:21 kitchen table or Outback or fishing
37:23 wherever the hell you are you say well
37:27 let's let's figure out where we came up
37:30 with this opinion that makes us dislike
37:32 things right for a lot of things
37:35 especially marketing department driven
37:37 concepts it doesn't even matter what the
37:40 other person is doing you use an iPhone
37:43 I use an Android do I care whether or
37:46 not you're using an iPhone I don't when
37:50 it comes to an organization that one is
37:52 loyal to the the biggest litmus test you
37:55 can throw at some was to say in your
37:57 lifetime where have you been benefited
38:01 by that allegiance to that group again
38:04 for those people have listened to all my
38:06 episodes I've said
38:08 several times in your lifetime what laws
38:10 have been passed that benefited you or
38:13 your children or anybody that you know
38:14 you know and it the only one I ever got
38:17 was obviously we had a civil rights
38:20 thing in the 60s but most people I'm
38:23 asking her black are white not black and
38:25 so they can't really claim that that
38:26 helped them personally the other one I
38:29 got was seat belts okay so the biggest
38:34 one we've had in the last hundred years
38:35 in America was civil rights and probably
38:38 if you go back far enough the ability
38:40 for a woman to vote and sort of some of
38:42 the basic equality things that we didn't
38:44 have set up because culture was
38:45 different when the Constitution was
38:47 written but a lot of those have been
38:49 fixed but that offers a tremendous
38:52 amount of decades right the seatbelt
38:54 thing it was somewhere in the 70s I
38:55 think
38:56 no one ever started wearing them until
38:57 the late 80s but that's Ike you know got
39:01 the nighties the first decade of the
39:03 2000s we're about to finish the second
39:05 decade of the 2000s and you know a
39:10 really staunch liberal might say
39:12 Obamacare because their employer pays
39:15 the premium they don't play to pay the
39:16 premium but I can tell you every single
39:21 friend that I have on this planet who
39:23 lives all over sorry I should say in
39:25 America because I'm gonna talk about
39:26 Obamacare for one second you know one of
39:29 my friends who's a teacher who makes
39:32 nothing in the Midwest was paying $1,400
39:36 a month a month for her and her husband
39:39 neither one of them have any
39:41 pre-existing conditions or cancer or
39:43 anything and a perfectly healthy
39:44 daughter how do you think they went on
39:47 vacations they didn't because Obama but
39:50 the pharmaceutical companies and the
39:51 insurance companies draft the whole
39:53 [ __ ] thing and that he made it a
39:55 draconian existence tax you can't get
39:59 any worse than that in this country that
40:02 kind of [ __ ] happening in Venezuela or
40:04 [ __ ] Brazil or something you'd expect
40:07 that kind of weird [ __ ] out of some
40:09 pseudo democracy but you can't call it
40:13 the land of the free and behave like
40:14 that now we should be able to have a
40:16 group program for insurance and the
40:18 Prima should be nothing I mean if 350
40:21 million
40:22 people were insured under one company
40:25 Jesus if everybody paid a hundred bucks
40:28 a month per person that company would be
40:32 rolling in trillions of dollars in 20
40:34 years and only having to shell out a
40:37 little bit here and there right little
40:39 cough medicine here thing your broken
40:42 arm cast oh yeah a couple people are
40:43 gonna get cancer and die but imagine
40:48 tits all the things that poison us in
40:51 this world were then regulated by the
40:53 same organization and said look like the
40:56 Russians did it right Russians pull them
40:57 you know microwaves like I've told you
40:59 guys guys like this makes people sick
41:02 your can certain foods in that machine
41:05 will turn into toxic toxin toxic foods
41:07 right others will just get really gross
41:10 tasting so they yanked it smart how long
41:15 with cellphones last in a country that
41:17 was trying to keep its people healthy
41:19 GMOs and shitty water and [ __ ] you
41:22 know planes that are spraying clouds now
41:26 gee what did we do before 1997 to get
41:30 clouds in the sky right what did we do
41:33 oh my god how did they even exist before
41:34 planes injected them into the skies
41:37 which then coincided with the entire
41:40 area coming up with upper respiratory
41:41 problems right I don't know if you guys
41:44 have noticed with the amount of people
41:46 dying of cancer in their 50s and 60s all
41:49 these celebrities which is just you know
41:51 it's where we see it reported the most
41:53 because we don't pass around our you
41:55 know necessary I love ones unless you're
41:57 on Facebook and you're having to go
41:58 through a tough time but you know I have
42:02 a very close friend of mine extremely

42:07 up in the hospital a few weeks ago his
42:10 liver and his kidneys started failing
42:14 catastrophic ly he's not a diabetic and
42:17 literally the hospital has no idea how
42:21 that happened so everyone's sitting
42:23 around Winnie he's on a list now to get
42:24 a new liver he's in his early 50s he
42:29 doesn't drink write him he's like
42:32 abstains from all things that are
42:34 you know immediate health risks right
42:37 that would at least injure those two
42:40 organs right doesn't do any drugs it's
42:45 like there's this slow apocalypse
42:47 happening right and outros 5g well

43:08 them right there we don't fight wars for
43:11 our health I mean we fight him on our
43:14 personal level one of you just reported

43:26 while for me to notice but eventually I

43:37 I believe it's HBO called better call
43:40 Saul fabulous show right seriously Bob
43:43 Odenkirk is a genius I think the guy is
43:47 Michael Keating because his name he was
43:49 Linney from Lenny and Squiggy he plays a
43:52 brother of salt I think the shows up
43:58 again for another season but anyway
44:01 Keating is like I hope I have a keep
44:04 Keating something like that but anyway
44:05 he's an amazing actor he plays a guy
44:08 who's suffering from radio frequencies
44:12 he can't be next to light bulbs that are
44:15 on anything electric his brother has to
44:17 put his phone inside the mailbox along
44:19 with all other jewelry and things with
44:21 you gonna watch you know the ticks he
44:25 wasn't like that before but then he
44:26 became that way and then he's suffering
44:29 with the exhibition this fictional
44:31 character to be a cookie person who
44:33 believes that RF waves hurt them why so
44:37 that anyone else in your life that says
44:39 that RF waves which are a given problem
44:42 in this world right it's screwing up
44:44 [ __ ] bees flying around like I said
44:45 it's making you unhealthy gives you
44:47 leukemia gives you
44:48 diabetes these are all things that have
44:50 been completely documented and entered
44:52 into the World Health Journal so I want
44:57 to say the World Health Organization
44:59 because they're there to kill you a lot
45:01 of you have kids those kids are being
45:04 forced into vaccination programs to go
45:07 to school I think a lot of states are
45:10 still optional in this but for the ones
45:12 that are mandatory you know a few years
45:14 back California you could file a little
45:17 report a little page that said I don't
45:20 want my kid vaccinated it lasted for two
45:21 years then I lasted for one year and I
45:23 think the rumor now is that Jerry Brown
45:26 who wants to murder all the brains of
45:28 children probably cuz he's a [ __ ]
45:31 [ __ ] and he's really an idiot Jerry
45:34 Brown is a categorical [ __ ] [ __ ] you
45:38 know there's a lot of them that are
45:40 devious and this guy is just an idiot
45:43 right but he tried to sign it away well
45:46 what's the deal you're born and raised
45:48 in California you want to have your
45:50 children here because your parents are
45:51 here all your friends are here it's your
45:52 world it's where you grew up and had a
45:54 great time and you didn't get vaccinated
45:56 and look at you you're smart enough to
45:58 make some money live in this area but
46:01 your kids won't be they're gonna have
46:04 ADHD problems and we take in riddlin
46:06 because they can't concentrate they
46:08 might be so awkward by the time it's
46:10 time to find a partner that they're not
46:12 gonna find a partner they're gonna find
46:15 a weird partner you know they inject the
46:18 war everywhere when you come home at
46:20 night if you're living a conflicted life
46:22 anywhere in the world what does that
46:24 feel like you come home and you're like
46:27 god that sucks that sucks this sucks
46:30 that sucks and you feel lost right those
46:33 are individual Wars right there when
46:36 that old that old wise phrase this is
46:37 pick your battles and what the phrase
46:40 means is you can't fight every war in
46:43 your life all at the same time you can
46:45 only take on what you can take on the
46:48 recommendation usually comes down just
46:50 pick one thing defeat it and go on to
46:52 the next thing you only pick the next
46:54 thing is only one thing and get them all
46:56 just knock down just like targets at a
46:58 em carnival we as human beings
47:02 we'll always have conflict in our lives
47:04 it's just the way it is sometimes people
47:07 get to that point where they feel like
47:08 they don't have any conflict and that
47:11 does happen every once in a while in
47:12 your life and when you get to that sweet
47:14 spot I can't stress enough pay attention
47:18 smell those flowers but also work
47:21 defensively to keep what you have and
47:24 they'll be unrealistic right you could
47:26 have like one of the sweet spots you'll
47:28 have if you have children if there's
47:31 just this age range whether your kid is
47:33 awesome they're well-behaved they love
47:35 you they love your spouse they pay
47:38 attention they want to please and then
47:42 if you let them watch TV if you let them
47:44 get on the Internet if you let them pick
47:47 any friend at all to bring home they'll
47:51 start rebelling against you because
47:53 everything is against you is the parent
47:55 what is Christmas about well if you
47:57 don't spend money on me you don't love
47:59 me
47:59 same thing with Halloween okay and the
48:04 birthday what if you're broke you can't
48:08 can't pull it off but you don't tell
48:10 your kids you're broke because that's
48:11 you think that they understand that
48:13 that's failure instead of just going hey
48:15 honey we're really tight for money right
48:16 now so this particular year it's gonna
48:18 be a little lean but doesn't mean I
48:19 don't love you very very much and when
48:22 we can rebound because we will it's just
48:24 the way it works when mommy and daddy
48:26 make more money we're going to we'll
48:30 make it up to you but honestly these
48:32 things don't control how much we love
48:34 you it doesn't mean anything about how
48:36 much we love you it's a tough
48:37 conversation to have with the kid right
48:38 because they're gonna go to school and
48:41 what's gonna happen you're gonna see the
48:42 kids come in with a lot of [ __ ]
48:43 brand-new clothes maybe new bicycle new
48:47 computer a new phone new iPad they're
48:50 gonna talk about their PlayStation 24 at
48:52 home you got to tell your kid look this
48:55 is gonna probably happen it's gonna suck
48:57 but in the end when you finally make
49:00 your own money and you earn these things
49:03 for yourself your level of appreciation
49:05 for these things is going to be 10 times
49:07 what your friends feel when they play
49:10 their games when they get their new bike
49:12 or whatever their new clothing when you
49:14 get a new shirt
49:15 it's gonna feel ten times better my dad
49:18 and I when we lived together starting
49:20 about ten it was tough man
49:24 we were broke I mean we were broke
49:27 talking about paycheck comes in pay all
49:31 the bills there's 50 bucks left for two
49:33 weeks for two people I think God we
49:35 shopped at military bases for food so we
49:37 didn't go without food but imagine that
49:42 my dad would bring home like six packs
49:45 of jeans okay
49:47 cheapest [ __ ] shoes you'd ever had
49:49 cuz he's like you just grow out of him
49:51 and he was right I was growing like a
49:52 weed when I was really young what
49:55 happened I just told you in Episode I
49:58 lied on a an application so I get a job
50:00 at a movie theater thirteen I think I
50:04 told you guys in a different episode the
50:05 guy who ended up running that place got
50:07 busted for pedophilia with his own
50:09 stepkids but that's probably why the job
50:11 he didn't touch me at all but he was a
50:15 weird dude told lies after lies but they
50:17 were kind of funny yeah a little um yeah
50:21 little blemish on his face that was due
50:22 to probably acne or something and it was
50:24 this little loop and his skin that was
50:25 in a little hole and I asked him I said
50:29 well why did you get that and he'd go oh
50:31 this guy hit me with an ice pick where's
50:34 in a fight and a guy stabbed me with an
50:35 ice pick total [ __ ] but we're like
50:38 oh wow and he was like god I can so
50:41 let's get anything right but anyway
50:43 reason why I bring that up is the
50:45 following because I forgot to make a
50:47 good point my dad couldn't afford
50:50 anything working his ass off and so I
50:54 got a job because I got embarrassed to
50:57 wear the clothing that he was bringing
50:59 home now you could say oh that's you
51:02 know bad on your dad's part or whatever
51:03 depending on what kind of person you are
51:05 I doubt that's any one of you but it was
51:07 the greatest thing in the world because
51:08 I wanted my own money and it drove me to
51:12 work you know and I got in at 13 and
51:15 before I even crossed my 15th birthday I
51:19 didn't work there I can't I can't
51:21 remember how long I worked there it
51:22 seemed like about a year there having 14
51:24 years old
51:26 what I was able to learn by myself
51:29 because they gave me a key eventually
51:30 I'd open the theater up I get the
51:33 tickets ready get all the concession all
51:35 filled up no one else is there we the
51:39 only thing I had to have supervision for
51:40 was loading the the platters with the
51:43 the canisters right so we got the movie
51:45 and a bunch of canisters and we have to
51:46 splice them all together and feed them
51:47 onto the thing I was always under
51:49 supervision for that but I could splice
51:51 a fix you know if the thing the
51:53 projector died and ate up a frame I
51:56 could pull that out splice it together
51:57 at the station and get it back in there
51:59 mmm
51:59 by myself but I would sell the tickets
52:04 calling the tickets to the movie you
52:06 know whatever headquarters you know and
52:10 then I just sit there at night you know
52:11 and the whole place would unload the
52:12 employees would go home and I just sit
52:14 inside they take a booth watching Main
52:15 Street you know 14 years old but and I
52:19 made my own money eventually after that
52:21 I worked at a movie rental place and I
52:22 worked at Walmart and I had my own dough
52:27 immediately I bought my own clothes soon
52:29 as I got my car at 14 I drive to the
52:31 city next door which is Wichita buy all
52:34 my own clothes started looking the way I
52:36 wanted to look and it never ended right
52:38 like where did you go wrong dude so for
52:41 me being broke was a war America was
52:44 changing you know some people are ready
52:47 for that change and some people aren't
52:49 now I probably should have said this at
52:51 the beginning I don't want this episode
52:53 if any of you got to the end to rile you
52:56 up make you angry because what does that
52:59 feed we'll just ask the Emperor right it
53:04 makes you go to the dark side right
53:05 knowledge is power right
53:08 hmm how many of you know that if you
53:13 were at any of these crazy events that
53:16 have occurred in America from say 2001
53:19 all the way till today you need these
53:21 crazy things and you or a passerby with
53:23 what you know now about those events
53:24 even if you don't have all the answers
53:26 you know at least there was some [ __ ]
53:30 going on as we say your anxiety level
53:34 would be low because you're looking at
53:37 something you understand
53:39 in some cases you're like nobody's died
53:41 at this location that's all [ __ ]
53:42 other times you like [ __ ] people die but
53:44 this is those three guys getting in that
53:46 truck over there with a duffle bag
53:48 dressed like SWAT guys who should be
53:50 literally running back into the location
53:52 because there's a supposedly a killer on
53:54 the loose and these guys are leaving
53:55 because they're the actual shooters you
53:58 know so knowing the enemy right you may
54:04 not know the names of the people that
54:05 mess with you I certainly don't but you
54:08 know their organization again we have a
54:11 new phrase that's all over the world now
54:13 called deep state huge it's a huge win
54:18 for us a huge feather in our cap that
54:20 that's being used in mass media and then
54:24 eventually when we hear people you know
54:27 like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and
54:29 those douchebags and all their little
54:30 affiliates you know shifts and those
54:33 guys right the caretaker the pursuers
54:37 right we smile we're not happy that they
54:43 still have the ability to get on camera
54:45 that they have the ability to
54:47 indoctrinate and keep indoctrinating
54:49 tens of millions of people at least the
54:51 United States of America right I don't
54:53 know any of these people overseas really
54:56 besides maybe some some Angela Merkel
54:58 kind of folks right it's a macron kind
55:01 of folks right Mekons get his ass handed
55:03 to him it's awesome
55:04 brooklyn running for re-election I tell
55:06 you that right they're gonna try to
55:08 replace these people with exactly the
55:10 same kind of people they're gonna try
55:11 and they're literally gonna sit in
55:14 conference rooms I mean we have to go
55:15 through this for a second McCarron will
55:18 not be President
55:19 beyond his current office in France he
55:23 won't they're gonna remove him for sure
55:25 he's lost the race below 20 percent
55:27 approval rate he's got a riot that's
55:29 been going on in Paris now for almost
55:31 two months or it's actually over the
55:33 two-month mark now nine weeks they even
55:35 did a little false flag over there to
55:37 trying to end the protests and that
55:39 didn't do [ __ ] okay so they've gonna go
55:43 into the Bilderberg Group which is where
55:45 they recruit the headhunt remember go
55:47 out to 2004 CEO interview where he says
55:51 no no we don't run the world where
55:52 headhunting agency oh really for what
55:55 Oh for world leaders okay no that's not
55:57 running the world is it but they're
56:00 gonna find some deep stator and there's
56:03 gonna be a focus group and a bunch of
56:05 think tanks they're gonna come together
56:07 and go where did micron go wrong what
56:10 don't they like about that guy it's a it
56:12 could be something like they don't like
56:13 its face oh yeah you're right he's kind
56:16 of a weird dude okay not he's not ugly
56:18 or anything he did marry his teacher
56:20 from high school or something right love
56:24 is blind I get it
56:25 nothing wrong with that I guess they're
56:28 consenting adults but I guess he was 15
56:29 when they started falling in love you
56:32 know I'm saying but anyway I don't know
56:35 if that numbers right that's what my
56:36 good friend told me he follows his kind
56:38 of stuff but they're gonna say look he
56:41 said this he did this he did this photo
56:43 op he took this stance he blamed this
56:46 blah blah blah they're gonna say okay
56:48 this can never happen again all of these
56:51 things that he said aren't gonna happen
56:54 so what are we gonna do we we still have
56:55 to get the goals that he was installed
56:57 to get when we're gonna have to throw
56:59 the election look let's get that whole
57:02 group going I uh no problem France
57:03 thrown elections is easier what wait a
57:05 minute we got the LFS now well their
57:07 hubris will say oh don't even worry
57:09 about it okay so this next person maybe
57:13 it's a female who knows well maybe put a
57:16 woman in there that way they can't yell
57:18 at what they yell at her we'll call it
57:19 sexist it should be defended by her
57:21 gender someone's going on like crazy in
57:24 the United States of America right
57:25 Merkel will have the same type of
57:27 replacement this stuff is so strategic I
57:31 don't know I've been involved with a few
57:33 think tanks in my lifetime most of time
57:35 as a presenter and so but sometimes you
57:41 know sitting around dreaming up things
57:43 that were entertainment based not
57:45 nefarious business things or me like a
57:48 normal business kind of thing but use
57:50 I'm observing or presenting you know
57:53 areas where technology might go sort of
57:55 thing right but they're very strategic
57:58 they go on for weeks and weeks
57:59 some of them meet regularly there's one
58:02 in Los Angeles that means regularly
58:03 that's called metal
58:06 and they just talk about business
58:08 constantly these people are just coming
58:09 in there with business cards from all
58:11 over the world we're trying to find
58:13 investors don't expect them to ever
58:15 listen to you basically you better know
58:18 who you're meeting when you're there
58:19 sort of thing
58:19 but believe me the ones that pick our
58:22 leaders are you know they're not on the
58:25 they're not in the yellow pages we used
58:26 to say in the United States of America
58:28 they don't have a website probably that
58:29 would really reveal what they do be very
58:32 symbolic we're political strategic
58:35 people right but now how much does an
58:38 average citizen invest in any sort of
58:41 counter strategy for anything I don't
58:44 think that much you're they can okay
58:47 take you know here's how the think tank
58:49 might think about us right the one we
58:52 are sheep when we need to follow and
58:54 cattle when we need to be slaughtered
58:55 okay those are the two terms you
58:57 understand that we are called by them
58:59 the idea is to say okay if we have
59:03 economic prosperity then people have
59:06 time to think they have time to invest
59:08 money and investigate things they got
59:10 time to sit around at night looking at
59:12 their computer watching deep thoughts
59:13 videos okay but when you're you've just
59:19 lost your job he got two kids that are
59:23 still in school they need to have the
59:25 roof over their head you got a couple
59:27 car loans kids or you know costing you
59:30 this and that whatever how much time do
59:33 you have to mess around and think about
59:36 things not a whole lot right yeah why
59:39 they've created so many personal Wars
59:42 for you you have no time left well
59:45 they're thinking really hard about how
59:46 to screw you over take everything away
59:49 hmm so if you are privileged enough to
59:53 have some time left to invest in this
59:59 sort of thing well then you're gonna
60:01 have to step up and be the hero and you
60:05 might be you might be the the counter
60:07 archetype of a hero right let me give
60:10 you some examples I won't mention the
60:13 names because I don't know what they
60:15 would think about me throwing them in
60:17 the middle this episode but we've had
60:18 some followers
60:19 of this show start their own shows I
60:22 mentioned almost all these people at one
60:24 point now let's just say one of them is
60:28 a I guess like late 20s early 30s male
60:33 and even though he's a father he cares
60:36 about the world and he makes time
60:38 whatever his regimen is he's got time he
60:41 obviously makes his show we have another
60:44 person that is seemingly I guess retired
60:47 maybe he's always been a housewife I'm
60:49 not sure what the background is she
60:52 created a show that really engaged some
60:56 of these more controversial conspiracies
60:59 she went into flatterer she went into
61:02 consciousness and dreams and all kinds
61:04 of wild stuff because that's what
61:07 appealed to her but now imagine you're a
61:11 guy so you view yourself as Bruce Willis
61:14 or Sylvester Stallone or or maybe a more
61:16 academic brilliant person and Marshall
61:19 McLuhan or Thomas Sowell or Martin
61:22 Luther King kind of person right and
61:24 you're you don't have any real problem
61:26 thinking of yourself as rising to the
61:28 hero level but let's say you're female
61:31 and you've been a stay-at-home mom
61:33 you've been in the corporate world and
61:35 you know there's things you don't know
61:37 because you just have an experience to
61:39 get but you're watching the same stuff
61:42 and you're parsing the same reality and
61:45 you're finding out that you're able to
61:47 make connections that all your guy
61:50 buddies your husbands buddies or
61:52 whatever aren't able to put together you
61:55 find yourself more often in
61:56 conversations clarifying points for
61:58 people you know dismissing myths versus
62:01 reality you know someone's got something
62:03 wrong about somebody about history or
62:06 whatever okay you don't hear I mean you
62:11 do hear if you pay attention there's a
62:13 lot of housewife's that have invented
62:15 things and blown up a particular
62:18 industry they have an invention
62:19 literally the people buy on their homes
62:21 by the tens of millions and they become
62:22 very wealthy but there's nothing
62:27 stopping you from going from that
62:29 perceivable non leadership
62:33 addition in the world you have to put up
62:34 with kids or anything you're already
62:36 battle-hardened rate and moving into the
62:39 world of starting your own channel
62:41 starting your own blog but you don't
62:43 have to completely reach out if that's
62:45 not your game but you know maybe in a
62:47 comment on a video you make a really
62:50 good sound comment people read it I
62:52 think that well here's something that I
62:57 don't know if I mentioned this before
62:59 but let me say this year as a wrapping
63:01 up this this episode here's this really
63:04 weird for me and ladies bear with me for
63:07 a second because I'm on your side in
63:08 this comment here but I'm gonna start it
63:10 off in a traditional stereotype that's
63:14 not gonna sound like I'm on your side
63:18 well Thomas Sowell
63:20 who's a brilliant man here in America
63:22 proved back in the 70s that women who
63:25 who are unmarried meaning without
63:28 children in his category who are trained
63:30 exactly like men make more money than
63:33 men when they take a job so he says wage
63:36 inequality is [ __ ] it's
63:38 qualification inequality that you're
63:40 complaining about and he proved it
63:42 you said women that raised kids and and
63:45 stay out of the public sector for ten
63:47 years and then try to join with perhaps
63:50 a degree that's ten years old or a fresh
63:51 degree they don't have the experience
63:54 that the other people have either the
63:55 women that never stopped or the men that
63:57 were always in the game but there's this
64:00 huge we are equal to you sort of
64:03 broad-stroke brush that you have to hear
64:05 from a lot of females especially the
64:07 feminists right and so then I say I only
64:11 wish that was the truth and they'll go
64:14 why and I go well name a famous female
64:17 car designer name of famous I mean a
64:20 well-known I've met a couple in my
64:22 lifetime but my god they're like needles
64:24 inside galaxies right I've been an
64:29 engineering software engineering my
64:31 whole life in video games especially
64:34 there was one girl who is probably the
64:37 most brilliant coder I've ever met who's
64:40 a female who worked on EverQuest she
64:43 worked at EA for a little while and her
64:44 name at her and I made real good friends
64:46 beautiful girl who you would think she
64:49 was so pretty that you would think she
64:51 would never have to study she would
64:52 never have to do anything she could just
64:53 marry a handsome guy and pick pick which
64:55 one right but no she stayed single she
64:58 stayed brilliant and she was school and
65:00 all these dudes right
65:01 very rare situation well no guy in the
65:04 software business wants to be sitting
65:06 with a bunch of sausages right we want
65:08 women everywhere in that business but
65:09 they don't show up women are supposed to
65:11 be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen
65:13 because that's their game but the ovens
65:15 the refrigerators the dishwasher is the
65:17 sinks all invented by guys nobody wants
65:21 that to be the truth it just is the
65:23 truth name a famous female classical
65:25 composer
65:26 now of course those of you who are hip
65:29 or going well dude it's because of
65:30 repression yes exactly
65:33 women were kept away from work they you
65:36 know and honestly most of them didn't
65:38 like didn't dislike it they got to stay
65:40 home and raise kids and and become
65:42 heroes to humans right whereas these
65:44 guys run off and work for corporations
65:46 that didn't care if they died on the way
65:48 to work right but here's the big stunner
65:51 in 2019 for me where do boys come from
65:55 Oh women women give birth to all sexes
66:01 both of them okay so what's the
66:06 difference
66:06 genetically between a male and a female
66:08 there's an X chromosome and a Y
66:10 chromosome what is that X chromosome do
66:13 and the Y chromosome too well on a
66:15 biological Anatomy level you know bits
66:19 and pieces turn into different things
66:20 these nipples start having more of a
66:22 purpose okay all right now we also know
66:27 that chemically in the brain the female
66:30 is over however many years of design or
66:34 evolution is more empathetic by nature
66:37 more sensitive because children need
66:41 that connection they need that
66:44 connection now would say men and the
66:46 21st century become very beta and
66:49 they've become more sensitive as well
66:50 unfortunately they've had to you know
66:52 they've been convinced to give up their
66:54 masculinity at the same time it's a
66:56 bummer right but here we are in the
66:58 middle of a feminist movement
67:00 been going on for 30 years much longer
67:03 than that but I mean the early 90s we
67:05 have some definite businesses and groups
67:08 that form to to champion that it goes
67:11 all the way back to Eleanor Roosevelt
67:12 but and Joan of Arc right but now we're
67:17 sitting in a world where the only
67:19 difference we have is some Anatomy okay
67:22 we know there's some predispositions for
67:24 how girls think of boys think again boys
67:27 are driven to have sex 10 times more
67:30 than females and I know there's some
67:31 females out there they could show men up
67:33 like I do know but they're rare right
67:35 every boy is the same way okay whether
67:38 they're straight or gay or whatever
67:39 right they're still punching for that
67:41 thing so now we have a bunch of movies
67:44 with a bunch of girls heroes there's
67:46 tolerance movements right I think
67:50 parents are getting probably better
67:51 about it girls now at least in America
67:53 they see themselves having careers
67:55 they're making choices about when
67:57 they're gonna have the career voices or
67:59 just having children some women still
68:01 want the child stay-at-home mom wife we
68:04 have to honor those women with all of
68:06 our power but here's the thing we're
68:08 still indoctrinated to be at war with
68:11 each other but we're really just a
68:13 couple chromosome or one chromosome that
68:15 flips right it causes a bunch of protein
68:17 patterns to change because the protein
68:19 patterns are what carry those
68:21 instructions to the DNA right but why
68:25 are we so different now and maybe we're
68:28 not I don't I don't you know we don't
68:30 have the God facts on that situation but
68:33 right now females should be getting into
68:37 everything we should see females
68:39 penetrating every male business on
68:41 planet earth now I teach a lot of
68:43 students from time to time right I'm not
68:45 teaching right now but when I do I go
68:47 for months and months and months and I
68:49 will say that I have seen a tremendous
68:51 amount of female engineers I actually I
68:55 fall some of them on Instagram I'm not
68:58 you know well enough to be their dad and
68:59 I'm just following them because I get to
69:01 they'll take pictures of their code
69:03 right other the post memes there are
69:06 funny code memes and it just warms my
69:09 heart every time I see him do that cuz
69:10 I'm like wow this girl got so
69:13 decoding that this meme is only
69:15 understood by advanced programmers
69:17 that's awesome I mean that's just great
69:21 the reason why I mentioned that is that
69:23 I want you females to understand that we
69:27 need you to be heroes as well obviously
69:29 those of you raise children and get
69:32 along with a partner of any sex you know
69:37 you're always a hero when you do that
69:38 but we need it to be extroverted heroes
69:40 you have to find a way to to touch other
69:43 people's hearts if you're super
69:46 empathetic and you have this soft
69:47 beautiful voice my god people will
69:50 listen to you five thousand times more
69:53 likely than they'll ever listen to me
69:54 smoking a cigar and black and white
69:56 cussing like a sailor you have a power I
69:58 don't have I just want to remind you of
70:01 that most sentient intelligent men do
70:05 not fear strong women which is some [ __ ]
70:08 II mean that goes out all every once in
70:10 a while for my friends I'm like oh
70:11 really every woman that I ever grew up
70:14 with could kick your ass I mean they
70:17 were tough on Barry women who had who
70:22 maintained their beautiful soft grandma
70:26 spirits aunts moms whatever but they
70:31 will not take [ __ ] from anybody and
70:33 they're fair about it hey are they
70:35 always right about what their opinion is
70:37 of course it's just an law of averages
70:39 maybe but they still were females they
70:43 still dress like females they smelled
70:44 like females it was beautiful
70:46 you big hug that no one else can give
70:48 you about a female they went oh when you
70:52 had a problem in life right melting your
70:54 heart but at the same time when [ __ ] hit
70:58 the fan they would go stoic and handle
71:00 the problem and then pop right back into
71:02 being a female again that's a superpower
71:05 that's a superpower guys have to
71:08 struggle their entire life's to get the
71:10 sensibility that a girl can have it
71:12 thirty years old
71:13 right I say that now because we're so
71:17 regressed in our maturity levels right I
71:20 think I told you guys the story where
71:23 one of my grandmother's became a
71:25 schoolteacher
71:27 and back in the sea what would have been
71:30 late 20s early 30s in fact it would have
71:33 been over in 1929 she was living in a
71:37 house because the city that you teaching
71:39 provided living quarters for you but it
71:42 was usually a room in someone's house in
71:43 the town and this this guy that was the
71:48 father in the house when he drank he got
71:51 a little frisky and he happened to be
71:54 drinking and he had his buddies over as
71:56 the stories told and the women you know
71:57 fixed the food and cleaned it up and
71:59 that kind of thing the guys set out
72:00 front and his buddies were giving him
72:03 crap like boy she's gorgeous I bet you
72:06 bet you'd love to you know hit that as
72:08 they might have said and so he got all
72:12 riled up you know in his bravado and
72:14 went into the other room and my
72:16 grandmother was cleaning dishes next to
72:18 his wife and I think he she said he
72:21 grabbed her but it's 1929 different
72:24 standards in the world but it's 17 years
72:27 old probably got five six by about a
72:29 buck ten she turned around and punched
72:31 him in the nose
72:32 she said I think she said she broke his
72:35 nose because it was bleeding really bad
72:36 and was dented forever right and his
72:38 wife turned to my grandmother said thank
72:40 you very much that because that was so
72:41 disrespectful to me let alone you I'm so
72:45 sorry
72:46 my grandmother finished the dishes
72:48 grabbed her [ __ ] and left right what are
72:51 you telling me that's a weak woman
72:52 repressed back in 1929 no we were a lot
72:57 stronger back in the day we just weren't
73:00 convinced that there was a war going on
73:02 about it right how many how many asses
73:05 do you think that guy grabbed after that
73:07 moment I'm gonna save his wife didn't
73:10 leave him which they probably didn't
73:11 because he had more standards back in
73:12 those days
73:13 I'd say zero anyway I think you feel me
73:16 I hope you guys dig these more cerebral
73:19 episodes these are the ones that I I
73:21 personally gain more satisfaction from
73:24 these kind of episodes because it's
73:26 again here's the litmus test for me with
73:28 an episode in each topic whatsoever if
73:32 we're not talking about it but we're all
73:34 thinking about it that's the thing we
73:36 need to be talking about right when I
73:39 manage my own business
73:40 I was a manager or CEO some other
73:42 company my whole thing was but you know
73:44 you get these situations brewing inside
73:46 the company where something's going bad
73:48 or there's a perceived problem that
73:50 really doesn't exist I walk in the room
73:52 make sure everyone's happy and calm and
73:55 get your cookies and whatever and I'd
73:57 say okay first thing out of my mouth is
73:58 the elephant in the room and everyone
74:01 just has a huge sigh of relief and
74:04 because I present it in a nice way you
74:05 know and I say look this isn't gonna be
74:07 a problem for us I realize this is a
74:09 challenge here here and here but look I
74:11 already got a plan that's why they hired
74:14 me to protect you guys from these
74:15 problems and I'm gonna prove it to you I
74:17 have a very quick fast change right
74:21 that's kind of why I have respect for
74:23 our president in the United States
74:24 because I've been in his shoes a
74:26 thousand times at a micro level right
74:28 big problem in the room hit it anybody
74:31 wants to cock-block to you and carry the
74:33 deep state agenda what do you you didn't
74:36 expect me to be nice to you I'll be nice
74:37 to you a couple times I'll even go to
74:39 the podium like he does and say well I
74:42 know my friends on the left are going to
74:44 work with me and we're gonna come up
74:45 with a partisan solution for something
74:48 and when they run out to their podium
74:50 and they carry a deep state of Jena and
74:51 they called me names yeah you want me to
74:55 continue being a a nice guy in the
74:59 public about you and you backstab me
75:01 right in front everybody maybe give you
75:04 one more chance and after that it's
75:06 strike three you're out
75:08 and we're not gonna be friends and you
75:11 will be eliminated because I don't lose
75:13 I think that's what the president does
75:15 right that's why I understand the guy is
75:19 he not refined and uncouth well you know
75:22 if you understand that he might be
75:24 choosing his words very carefully and
75:25 choosing the perception of the optics to
75:27 the outside world yeah he's fighting a
75:30 war first for the United States of
75:33 America second for the outside world
75:36 right what happens when China can't get
75:39 away with 500 billion dollars worth of
75:40 shitty imports I don't mean bad products
75:43 but I mean these these tariffs are
75:45 horrible right we're gonna have to start
75:49 paying their people more and their
75:51 economy is gonna rise to our economy
75:53 and then we're gonna be on the same
75:54 playing level there people don't
75:55 necessarily need more money per day but
75:57 they're gonna have the inflation bubble
75:59 that we have they're gonna have to
76:00 dilute their money and then milk cost
76:03 ten times as much but they make ten
76:05 times as much this is what we've been
76:06 doing in America forever to run away
76:07 from our debt you know I don't know if
76:11 the yellow vests would be going on in
76:12 France if we didn't have this giant
76:15 movement of awakening because of the
76:17 internet because perhaps some of the
76:19 policy changes in America because people
76:21 are seeing what they can do to their own
76:22 country they're like we have power we're
76:25 not doing this because of Trump but
76:26 these guys are wearing Q and non-branded
76:30 yellow vests I don't see Q and on posted
76:34 much about France he posted about this
76:37 country in fixie in this country but
76:39 they drew enough idealistic force from
76:41 that movement whether it be a LARP or
76:43 real it doesn't matter it's becoming
76:45 real in people's hearts right trust the
76:48 plan as they say right we're part of the
76:51 plan we have our own agenda talk about
76:55 these things that no one talks about
76:56 because it affects your life
76:58 I understand there's wars on all levels
77:01 not just the ones with blood baths and
77:04 the Middle East anyway if you haven't
77:07 been to deep thoughts radio.com please
