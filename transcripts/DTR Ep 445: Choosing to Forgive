00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen to an episode that'll be
00:34 watched by very few except for those
00:37 maybe you're chronically dealing with it
00:40 today's episode is about choosing to
00:42 forgive or choosing forgiveness
00:46 forgiveness is an extremely interesting
00:49 process and it's one of these things
00:53 that we do on a daily basis whether or
00:57 not we realize it or not you're driving
00:58 in traffic you're thinking about your
01:00 past but it is such a rare occurrence in
01:06 the macro sense and a big sense that
01:09 even if you live a really long time it's
01:13 not something that plagues us like
01:14 breathing and needing to drink water and
01:16 eat food where we all talk about that
01:18 stuff
01:18 forgiveness and forgiving is usually a
01:23 fairly isolated activity and it's a very
01:27 it's a very trying taxing activity for
01:31 the mind in some cases and only you know
01:34 the circumstances by which this
01:36 forgiveness needs to occur at its full
01:37 dimension as much as you might try to
01:40 explain it to someone else and that's
01:43 why it's difficult and we don't have you
01:46 know as far as I know there's no classes
01:47 in high school college anything but this
01:50 is something that we all need to become
01:51 a master at because we are all living
01:54 with each other and we're all flawed as
01:57 much as we might love each other and try
01:59 to understand each other and not say the
02:01 wrong thing or do this other thing yes
02:03 we needed nut up and grow some you know
02:05 some thick skin and not be so so you
02:09 know sensitive but regardless of how
02:12 much armor you have on your soul you can
02:15 be hurt and in need of sort of getting
02:20 rid of a circumstance that is long in
02:22 your past plugging your now and
02:26 theoretically destroying your future
02:29 so as we always do on this show we're
02:31 going to take the concept of forgiving
02:33 and the circumstances around it we're
02:35 going to slow with time down
02:37 when you go to bullet time now we're
02:40 gonna look at in a micro sense and we're
02:42 looking at a macro sense and see if we
02:44 can't establish some line of
02:46 communication between all of us that
02:48 will help us become the Masters of
02:50 forgiveness haven't you ever seen
02:53 someone who's a little older or a lot
02:57 older even even if it's a fictitious
03:00 character that you're reading about in a
03:02 book seeing in a movie television show
03:06 and the coolest thing about them is that
03:09 they can forgive I've seen this several
03:13 times in my lifetime in real life and
03:15 it's always the person who has had the
03:18 most experience in life they have seen
03:20 the most they've been betrayed the most
03:22 you know there's a there's an episode I
03:24 did on betrayal and I definitely tell
03:26 you you know to really think about
03:28 forgiving those who betray you but I
03:31 didn't really get into the details of
03:33 the science of perhaps with forgiving
03:35 someone might entail so this is where we
03:38 focus but I think that we want to be
03:42 that person who can forgive now
03:48 obviously there are individuals who
03:49 would take advantage of anyone who can
03:51 just constantly forgive so forgiving
03:53 someone doesn't mean you continually
03:55 embed them in your life right you know
03:58 you could have someone mooching off of
04:00 you stealing your money whatever and
04:02 they just put the puppy-dog eyes on and
04:05 because you're a good person and you
04:06 forgive they'll take you in one more
04:08 round and one more round until you're
04:10 buried in the ground starving to death
04:11 and they're on to taking from the next
04:14 person so I'm not trying to write blank
04:17 checks for criminals who you may be
04:20 related to or you may be best friends
04:22 with on some level habitual betrayal is
04:27 a different process than I'm really
04:29 talking about what I want to address in
04:31 this particular episode are the little
04:34 tinges of forgiveness that we need on a
04:37 daily basis and you know and before I
04:41 say the next side of that understanding
04:45 forgiveness can help you toughen up such
04:49 that you don't need to always default to
04:51 this
04:51 need for forgiveness in your own heart
04:54 you will understand that things are just
04:56 pragmatically happening to you and you
04:59 don't always know it's what's going to
05:01 happen and so you you don't get to the
05:06 state of feeling betrayed or hurt but on
05:11 the second side of this we're going to
05:12 get into real betrayal as I just as I
05:17 should say real forgiveness as it
05:19 relates to deep betrayal because I feel
05:24 like I've personally experienced quite a
05:25 few little shots keys in my life where I
05:28 needed to forgive and need it to be
05:31 forgiven ultimately the goal of this
05:36 episode if you're watching and you're
05:37 continuing to watch would be this you
05:41 want ultimate control over your psyche
05:43 over your life over your happiness so
05:48 the two-sided two-pronged approach to
05:51 this thing is sort of what you really
05:52 want to have which is you want to be
05:54 stronger and you don't want to be
05:56 offended as much and you don't be
05:58 betrayed as much and you don't want to
05:59 be angered as much right but if it does
06:04 come to that situation you want to have
06:07 control to quickly eradicate from your
06:11 soul from your mind's eye from the
06:12 processes of electricity in your brain
06:14 maybe thus to your soul that allow
06:18 someone or something to rent space in
06:20 your brain and steal the now from you
06:23 how many of you could raise your hand if
06:25 I said look how many of you were having
06:28 a great day one day he had a huge list
06:30 of things you needed to do perhaps for
06:32 your business perhaps for just keeping
06:34 the house clean or whatever you wanted
06:35 to do maybe even lay out in the backyard
06:38 and take in some Sun and something
06:43 happened to you you got a phone call a
06:45 text message an email you just recalled
06:48 something in the back of your head
06:49 someone who's supposed to come over to
06:50 visit and share that moment with you
06:52 doesn't show up and now you were so
06:55 pissed off that you can't accomplish
06:58 anything
07:01 you get these little seeds in your brain
07:03 if you've ever struggled with jealousy
07:05 in your lifetime that it could be just
07:10 devastating that's why you don't want to
07:12 have any perspective of life where
07:13 jealousy is something that really is
07:16 serious in you not during jealousy could
07:18 be kind of fun you wish you could be
07:21 with your spouse you wish you could be
07:22 with your significant other but for
07:24 whatever reason they can't be with you
07:26 and you just instead of feeling horrible
07:28 about that feeling you start to realize
07:31 how lucky am I to have someone in my
07:33 life that I would have such a feeling
07:35 for and you know that'll help you
07:40 mitigate this stuff so let's get into
07:44 this entire process of forgiving someone
07:48 the word thing about forgiveness is that
07:50 every single experience that that
07:52 creates the need for such such a
07:55 contemplation to think about having to
07:57 forgive someone is such a snowflake of
08:00 complexity and unlike snowflakes it's
08:04 more complex and that it doesn't come
08:06 down generally in the same size it comes
08:09 to you in all shapes and sizes from
08:12 different tenses from your child to your
08:15 spouse to your relative to your buddy
08:16 maybe even to yourself because you have
08:21 to forgive yourself sometimes to you
08:22 make stupid mistakes right they go my
08:25 god I've been such an idiot I messed up
08:27 my life in this one area and it is
08:29 important we don't talk about it right
08:31 so someone needs to say you know you
08:34 need to forgive yourself sometimes too
08:37 now the other thing too is with
08:39 forgiveness you have a situation where
08:42 you want to create a life that is a
08:44 marathon not a sprint right now there
08:49 are some people that will take care of
08:51 an ongoing situation as it occurs to you
08:53 right so you will study every day if
08:56 you're in college and keep the homework
08:57 down and keep your your just ready for
08:59 the test and you're not stressed there's
09:01 no cramming before the test you're good
09:03 and then there's those that are trying
09:05 to enjoy two halves of life at their
09:08 absolute extremes and so you don't study
09:10 into last second then you cram and you
09:12 go into the study there's no go into the
09:14 right with forgiveness you have a sort
09:21 of a biorhythm of your life that can
09:25 control some species of the need for
09:29 forgiveness which is to stay informed
09:32 about everything around you and to weigh
09:36 the cause-and-effect models in your life
09:39 at all times what that means is if you
09:45 know your kids going off in this
09:46 direction your husband your wife's going
09:48 off in that direction and you analyze in
09:50 your mind just lightly not obsessively
09:53 right the notion of anything could
09:58 happen and what could happen and you
10:02 just lightly kind of contemplate in your
10:03 brain the consequences of life right if
10:08 your kid's gonna take a trip from point
10:10 A to point B in a snowstorm well when
10:13 you live in the Midwest you kind of go
10:15 well I hope I see my kid again because
10:17 it could hit black ice they could
10:19 someone else could be driving
10:20 erratically and it just can be the case
10:23 that things happen your spouse goes off
10:27 for a week in a major city you've just
10:30 had an argument and there gonna be some
10:32 conference with a lot of mixed sexes
10:34 there and so you think you know gosh I
10:36 guess he or she could could lose their
10:39 loyalty and then you can react to the
10:44 possibilities and increase the fabric
10:47 and the density of your bond prior to
10:50 these events
10:51 maybe apologize for your half of the
10:53 argument maybe forgives before they
10:56 leave with some sort of word that they
10:58 understand that we're we're growing
11:01 closer together we're not falling apart
11:03 hopefully in terms of arguments most of
11:07 your arguments are a situation where you
11:09 are learning more about each other at
11:11 such a rapid pace that smoke starts to
11:15 come off and then fire starts and then
11:17 you put the fire out and everything is
11:19 better now I think that most of us when
11:22 you get to a certain age and I couldn't
11:24 possibly I should say age of maturity
11:28 age as in how old your body is but a
11:30 certain level of maturity that you
11:34 realize that the best thing you can do
11:36 for your life is to try and arrange your
11:38 life in a way that you're not challenged
11:40 with the need to forgive and it can be
11:44 very very confusing to distinguish how
11:47 to do this if you're thin-skinned you
11:52 know there's the old saying of the
11:54 common denominator right there are
11:56 people out there that always seem to rub
11:59 everyone wrong no matter what in their
12:01 brain they're so myopically focused so
12:03 narcissistically out of control that
12:06 they don't understand why everyone
12:08 rejects them in the end right they can
12:10 only maintain a friendship for a certain
12:11 number of months or maybe at tops a year
12:14 well if you were always offended right
12:17 and I got a whole episode on that
12:18 [ __ ] emotion and if you're always in
12:21 the in The Hurt Locker you know you're
12:24 unable to be happy all the time well
12:26 it's probably you it's probably you and
12:30 honestly just like an alcoholic and AAA
12:33 saying I'm an alcoholic they are taking
12:36 the first step to fixing themselves and
12:38 never drinking again
12:39 so when it comes to this need to forgive
12:41 all the time if you're in a bitch'll
12:42 situation where that has to occur all
12:44 the time I would as your counsel how do
12:48 you explain to me a series of these
12:50 moments and it could be one of two
12:53 things simply solved you're too
12:57 thin-skinned and everything is rubbing
12:59 you the wrong way because you live this
13:01 your policies of life are so intense and
13:04 so detailed that not a single [ __ ]
13:06 human being on earth could possibly live
13:07 within them including you right we're
13:11 not gods
13:11 we aren't we're pretty damn cool but
13:14 we're not gods and therefore we do not
13:16 write the policies of how to operate on
13:20 a my especially a micro-level yes we do
13:22 have some common law things just to
13:24 preserve our own sake which is don't do
13:26 no harm you don't anyone messing with
13:27 you and you shouldn't be messing with
13:29 anyone else but beyond those core
13:32 policies of our world we as man really
13:36 are renting our bodies we
13:40 our privilege to be in someone's
13:43 presence regardless if you have a
13:45 marriage certificate or whatever they're
13:49 not your property
13:50 right middle east they still pretty much
13:54 practice slavery but it's called
13:55 marriage a guy can do it over the [ __ ]
13:58 he wants woman has to do exactly what
14:01 the guy says that's a really intense
14:04 example of how some of us operate on a
14:07 micro level in first world countries
14:10 it's funny there are a couple of shows
14:13 on HBO one of them is Boardwalk Empire
14:17 and the other one was carnival both of
14:21 them wish had males white males who
14:24 would hit themselves on the back with a
14:26 strap and a buckle or herb pieces of
14:30 metal to punish themselves for having
14:32 impure thoughts Boardwalk Empire I'll
14:36 use that as an example there was a
14:37 prohibition IRS officer that was falling
14:40 in love with a widowed woman but he was
14:42 already married and so he's beating
14:45 himself up of course as he takes the
14:46 shirt off you could see all the scars
14:47 that he's been doing this his whole life
14:49 he is doing that because he can't
14:51 forgive himself for having an impure
14:53 thought towards another woman while he
14:55 is married instead of doing what your
14:58 humble narrator would do which is just
14:59 to say I'm a man I have genetics I am
15:02 programmed to appreciate the female form
15:04 yes I used to live as an my ancestors
15:08 used to live in harem form and screw
15:10 anything that existed that gene has not
15:12 been completely wiped out so as a
15:14 subconscious human being every male will
15:18 have those pings of wanting to procreate
15:20 at different times which just gets
15:22 pushed away through practicality and
15:24 what is left is having sex in your brain
15:26 but the thing that makes you grown-up is
15:30 to control yourself and not go after it
15:33 to understand you're committed to
15:35 someone else
15:36 that's the beauty of the life that you
15:38 live right now and yeah yeah if the life
15:40 was different you were single right now
15:42 you would approach that person I said
15:45 this guy's beaten should have himself
15:47 punishing himself trying to do the Tony
15:49 Robbins thing almost where he's
15:50 attaching pain to the impure thought
15:53 is a very fascinating idea now one of
15:57 the things that precedes the need to go
15:59 into this forgiveness mode and analyze
16:01 things as having your feelings hurt and
16:05 it has to be one of the most amazing
16:07 accomplishments of our Creator and if
16:10 you were putting a bunch of stuff
16:11 together and you're looking for
16:12 indications to determine whether or not
16:14 your experiments working well the second
16:17 that we as human beings could have our
16:20 feelings hurt as as morbid as the sounds
16:24 our designer had to have high-fived
16:26 himself and said oh my God look at the
16:29 depth of experience that just gave
16:31 another sentient being something didn't
16:34 happen the way that you wanted it to
16:36 happen someone violated a policy in your
16:41 mind I will tell you that slavery is one
16:44 of the most amazing concepts the man
16:47 could ever ever have allowed into our
16:50 thought process because on one level if
16:54 you look at bringing a soul down to a
16:57 body and then launching it into life the
17:00 idea that an one soul would think that
17:02 he could own another soul is actually
17:04 very interesting I would have assumed it
17:07 would have taken a lot longer to get to
17:09 that stage but apparently that's more
17:11 primitive which is you know being a lazy
17:14 [ __ ] is just really popular among the
17:17 elite right why do I mention that well
17:21 one of the key areas where people feel
17:23 betrayed and I've definitely been a
17:25 victim of this in a big way and I'm not
17:29 saying that we shouldn't be able to come
17:31 up with an approach to make this happen
17:34 but it is that we are we can't own
17:38 someone until we get into a relationship
17:41 and then there's this somehow this
17:44 duality between having security of being
17:47 with someone else and having the
17:48 companionship and the interaction with
17:50 someone and then there's the other side
17:52 which is the I own you you should not be
17:58 with other people unless I say you can
18:00 sort of thing right guys we have messed
18:04 up relationships with our girlfriends
18:05 and their girlfriends
18:07 right so the woman that we're dating we
18:09 sabotage their time with the other woman
18:11 because we're jealous we want the woman
18:13 to want to stay home with us some guys
18:16 will be Hermits and they'll stay in the
18:18 house all the time and so they are
18:19 actually holding up their side the
18:21 bargain to say we're always supposed to
18:22 be here and then the other side is that
18:24 the guy says why go out whenever I want
18:26 you stay here when I want to be here and
18:28 when I go out you can go out but don't
18:30 go out to that place this place that
18:31 place because I know that you act like
18:33 this and and you're gonna do something
18:35 unsavory but meanwhile I'll go to the
18:37 strip bar I'll go to wherever and do
18:39 whatever I want I've seen that several
18:42 times in my lifetime but what would have
18:45 happened to society have we raised our
18:48 children our boys especially our boys
18:50 but also the girls to say look you will
18:53 never own another human being you won't
18:55 they are their own sovereign living
18:58 flesh the most that you can possibly do
19:00 is convince them to dedicate their time
19:01 to you that's all and every time you
19:06 wake up and you choose to be together
19:09 you've had a great day but every time
19:14 they choose to be with another person
19:15 for a particular spell spell of time but
19:18 they still return to you in the end
19:21 you're even more privileged we all know
19:24 what reunions feel like right they feel
19:26 pretty damn good don't they how do you
19:28 think that happens but you get separated
19:31 and then your reunion but now let's dive
19:34 into the first stages of being hurt and
19:37 see how we get to this forgiveness
19:39 mechanism and obviously we have to run
19:43 down some scenario I'll try to keep this
19:45 as generic as possible a human being
19:49 that you like the net to be a lover
19:53 could be a friend it could be the lover
19:55 they behaved in a way that you didn't
19:58 predict and that disturbed you and
20:03 that's where I want you to stop time and
20:06 look back on moments that you're having
20:08 a problem forgiving and think about what
20:12 was the activity a lot of times the ones
20:15 that remember and the ones that are hard
20:17 was that they either loyalty to someone
20:20 else
20:20 whether be adjust three friends right
20:23 they would say three's a crowd when it
20:24 comes to friendship I've experienced it
20:26 several times as a young person and then
20:28 I had no problem in my 20s it's really
20:30 weird but the idea is you're not allowed
20:34 you're you're not allowing someone else
20:36 in your life to pay attention to anyone
20:38 else they can't have friends especially
20:40 if the opposite sex depending on where
20:42 your orientation table flies right if
20:46 you think about the moments in which we
20:49 commit to each other there is a stream
20:53 of energy that goes through any human
20:54 being based on the food supply based on
20:57 your rest based on your overall attitude
21:00 towards life it's sort of a kind of a
21:03 wiggling wave of water you know
21:06 sometimes there's a surge in water and
21:08 then there's very little water sometimes
21:09 it might just reek trickle in like drops
21:12 your energy level right when the tide is
21:17 in when there is a tremendous amount of
21:19 energy in a particular individual and
21:21 you coincidentally have the same exact
21:23 string you're both just your cup is
21:27 overflowing both of you your attitude
21:29 towards each other towards each other is
21:30 intense you can say and make all kinds
21:33 of commitments and it could be that
21:36 every time you get together you energize
21:38 each other up you're able to satisfy you
21:42 know what kind of home you want to live
21:43 in a location where you want that home
21:45 in the world you agree on everything I
21:49 want X number of kids and you're lucky
21:51 you have a boy you have a girl whatever
21:52 the hell that you're looking for you're
21:54 one of those coveted couples but at some
21:58 point over time there might be a time
22:01 when one of you doesn't have the
22:03 superduper energy that you had before
22:05 and it could just be temporary but in
22:08 that moment of vulnerability of low
22:11 energy to keep up and keep keep propping
22:15 up paradigm that you've created
22:16 right because you face it you know a
22:19 relationship is a lot of a lot of it's
22:23 in your head as to who you are how many
22:27 people listen to you as a John Cougar
22:29 Mellencamp is
22:33 his song his song Jack and Diane how
22:39 many how many of you have heard that and
22:41 you know you're a boy and a girl you're
22:44 in a heterosexual relationship and you
22:46 listen to that song and there's
22:47 something about that little story the
22:49 fact that you grew up in the Midwest as
22:51 well and you have someone that matches
22:53 sort of the profile with you and forever
22:57 there's this kind of notion that you're
22:59 sort of a Bonnie and Clyde couple you
23:02 just enjoy sort of the fact that both of
23:04 you aren't [ __ ] and you went through
23:06 life and you yep toughed it out and you
23:10 found each other and you're together and
23:12 you have that feeling but no one else
23:15 can see that right that's just something
23:18 that the two of you sitting in some
23:20 picnic some barbecue some bar some
23:22 backroom whatever your bedroom whatever
23:24 you guys had made this your song and
23:28 this is this extra paradigm of existence
23:30 in your head and one of you sees that
23:33 for the rest of your life and the other
23:35 one kind of gives it up once High
23:37 School's over or college is over or by
23:39 the time they hit 30 they're not
23:41 thinking about the John Cougar
23:42 Mellencamp song anymore so when you go
23:46 out and you see the opposite sex that
23:49 you're into and you think about being
23:52 tempted you think about the John Cougar
23:53 song like I would never do that I got my
23:56 Jack I got my Diane we're loyal to each
23:58 other but they have forgotten the song
24:01 forgotten the paradigm forgotten the
24:03 commitment notion that you have and they
24:06 peel away and go do something it doesn't
24:10 have to be anything amazing they just
24:11 spend time with someone else
24:14 and you're crushed because your
24:16 expectation is we don't do that we
24:18 agreed on a policy and even though we
24:21 didn't write it down and sign it in ink
24:22 or blood it wasn't it commonly
24:25 understood that you were going to keep
24:27 this sort of attitude towards things now
24:32 that's a silly example of something that
24:34 happens on a micro level and almost
24:37 every single relationship and it leads
24:39 to moments of hurt which is why it is
24:45 important to regroup everyone
24:47 while in a relationship especially if
24:49 things are going great and just say you
24:52 know do you still like me this is good
24:54 you know you're not saying it's like in
24:57 a morbid serious way you're just
24:59 tongue-in-cheek are we so good you know
25:02 maybe after a really wonderful moment
25:04 you just kind of go I mean I'm really
25:06 glad we got together I met you ba ba ba
25:09 and I hope you're still interested in
25:11 going the distance it's good to regroup
25:15 reset expectations if you had a silly
25:19 song that you guys both loved you might
25:21 check in on that little one in the brain
25:24 go do you still are you still my jack
25:26 are you still my Diane whatever get them
25:29 to tell you that they're still in the
25:30 same level with you and maybe they even
25:32 drift away and they come back to that
25:34 low let's see later but Alice go one
25:38 step further into this process an event
25:42 occurs the details of it not really that
25:46 important you can substitute anything in
25:49 there that did you're currently dealing
25:50 with in life and I'll do my best to give
25:53 you a generic path on the ground lit
25:57 with beautiful LEDs to get you out of
25:59 that situation making a mistake is
26:03 something that we do have little
26:06 aphorisms four little sayings for you
26:11 know you can learn a lot from mistakes
26:12 those are usually the biggest kind of
26:15 thrust of theme of sayings but mistakes
26:19 do happen but there's two types of
26:22 mistakes the people make when it comes
26:25 to the path of forgiveness meaning
26:28 they're sort of you know there's one
26:30 party that's usually being accused of
26:31 betraying and the other party has to
26:33 sort of get over it right let's just say
26:35 you're in the party that has to get over
26:37 in my life the only part that I try to
26:40 figure out is whether or not someone is
26:42 trying to to rig the system or play the
26:45 game or gain the system I should say and
26:49 if they want to have this little sort of
26:52 recurring mezzanine this little
26:54 cul-de-sac where they can always do what
26:56 they want claim innocence and then go do
26:59 it again
27:00 and again once I see you behavior like
27:03 that I'm not dealing with a good person
27:05 who is having you know some temptation
27:07 problem I'm dealing with someone who's
27:11 maliciously premeditating things to have
27:13 their cake and eat it too you know
27:16 behind my back sort of thing right
27:18 generally you need to understand to make
27:21 your judgement is this something that
27:23 the overall majority of society would
27:27 agree with you over or is this part of
27:31 that weird paradigm that you might have
27:33 created in your mind between the two of
27:34 you ten years earlier five years earlier
27:37 two years earlier that you haven't
27:40 checked in on where you thought you guys
27:42 had a commitment in this particular area
27:44 in this particular way and this is what
27:46 I would call like an obtuse offense
27:48 which is the big ones like hey I had sex
27:51 with someone else but I'm in a
27:52 relationship with you
27:53 that's an obtuse offense easily
27:55 understood I don't think anyone's gonna
27:57 write me a blank check about it and then
28:00 there's the one where I didn't make the
28:02 bed this morning or I didn't say I love
28:05 you in a particular way or whatever and
28:07 that's a more micro offense we have a
28:09 way that we do it and that's why it's
28:12 always important to check in on the
28:13 policies maybe lighten up a little bit
28:15 for Christ's sake simplicity is the best
28:18 right you're not here to create a
28:21 intellectual cage or on yourself let
28:24 alone someone else but the mistake has
28:27 been made and the mistake is almost like
28:28 a seed it's like this little bubble in
28:31 time that has its ingredients its
28:33 circumstances inside of it right as the
28:38 ice cream truck goes by so you have this
28:41 little Easter egg and you open it up and
28:42 inside are all the facts about the
28:44 situation but the first mistake that we
28:46 made is that we look at the facts from a
28:48 subjective standpoint of our opinions of
28:50 the situation now again without two
28:53 situations it's a little easier to parse
28:55 the facts right
28:56 if someone sleeps with someone else well
28:59 that's pretty easy to understand if it's
29:03 some meticulous behavior that didn't
29:05 happen in the kitchen in the bedroom in
29:07 the bathroom or whatever well then
29:09 you're sort of looking at it
29:12 really specific standpoint you might
29:14 back off on right but forgiveness is
29:18 going to be the value on the right of
29:21 the equal sign when it comes to this
29:24 equation your your facts are on the left
29:26 there's an equal sign and you're gonna
29:28 have to figure out whether or not equals
29:30 a need for forgiveness or nothing it's
29:34 know it just empties itself out like oh
29:37 yeah whatever that's fine I didn't
29:39 expect that it sort of maybe even hurt
29:42 my feelings a little bit but I totally
29:43 understand why they did that I didn't
29:44 you know I didn't I didn't ask her what
29:48 she was doing on Friday night and she
29:49 ended up going out with their friends
29:50 and I didn't tell her on Wednesday or
29:53 Thursday that man I've had the worst
29:55 week of my life and I really needed
29:56 companionship that day and all my
29:59 buddies are out of out of town so yeah
30:01 the poor planning on my part no offence
30:05 hope you had a good time so it is my
30:08 hope that within this this next step
30:11 here that you couldn't personally
30:14 forgive in your mind and adjust your
30:18 expectations your policies can be
30:20 rewritten a little bit to have a little
30:22 more flexibility for a lot of events now
30:26 my advice to you is to do the following
30:31 if you think that what you're having to
30:33 contemplate is going to occur routinely
30:36 I mean you're gonna be dealing with this
30:38 over and over again you need to look at
30:40 yourself and make a decision and it's
30:43 actually very simple there's no big big
30:46 deal going on here but you need to
30:47 understand about yourself can I forgive
30:50 this thing every time it happens from
30:53 this point forward and even even get to
30:55 the point where it's just ubiquitous to
30:57 our lives I don't notice it occurs
30:59 because of adjusting my expectations
31:00 you know the friday-night thing is gonna
31:03 happen every once and while she's gonna
31:04 want to run off with their friends I
31:05 guess Saturday in Sunday so no big deal
31:07 and then you could just not say anything
31:10 you've grown up yourself you've improved
31:13 your circuitry to be able to handle more
31:15 scenarios which is sort of where we need
31:17 to end up in the end of this thing but
31:20 if you think that you're going to
31:21 struggle with what scurred but you're
31:23 okay with it you're okay you just
31:25 you know you didn't understand sort of
31:27 what you're getting into there in that
31:28 particular situation you may bring that
31:32 to the attention of the person that
31:34 you're talking about and say hey you
31:36 know what I just want you to know I'm
31:38 totally cool with you going on Fridays
31:39 but I just need you to understand like
31:41 well my buddies are out at the same time
31:43 and I don't have you and it's been you
31:45 know this project I'm working on it's
31:46 kicking my butt you know it it maybe
31:51 maybe you guys could go out on Saturday
31:53 or one small or just know that if I'm on
31:57 edge this is why or before you go off
32:01 with your friends just give me a little
32:03 nookie and I'll feel great when you pop
32:06 it in drunk at night or whatever give me
32:10 a little attention you know whatever the
32:12 hell works for you you create a scenario
32:14 where the other person understands this
32:17 is sort of a point where you are wanting
32:23 something different you're not asking
32:25 them to change their plans really you
32:28 just asking them to notice what's going
32:31 on in your life as you spend the time
32:32 together right and I know that you might
32:35 be inclined to blow off those little
32:37 scenarios but I'm telling you life is
32:39 not made of big decisions life is made
32:41 of teeny-tiny decisions and hundreds of
32:43 thousands of them right so we tend to go
32:47 well I only need advice when I'm making
32:48 a big decision sometimes you need advice
32:51 from yourself and from others when you
32:53 make a series of ten teeny tiny
32:56 decisions we are made of the tiny ones
32:59 the big ones are big for sure and you
33:03 don't really don't need to worry about
33:04 them as much because you will get second
33:06 opinions and you will think about it
33:07 carefully you know do I do I go to Japan
33:10 do I go to Africa what am I doing here
33:12 and do I marry this person those are big
33:14 decisions right so your micro
33:16 forgiveness moments are very very
33:18 important because it builds up an
33:19 overall sentiment that you have towards
33:21 life and towards yourself and towards
33:23 others you might end up thinking oh my
33:26 god the whole world's against me if you
33:27 can't forgive if you get super
33:30 thin-skinned now I'm gonna put a little
33:33 footnote right here about the half hour
33:35 mark if you haven't seen my episode on a
33:38 fin being if
33:39 it's important as a companionship
33:42 RSR companion episode to this because i
33:45 really talk about others please no such
33:47 thing and that being offended has turned
33:50 into emotional and physical extortion
33:53 out of other people if someone can tell
33:55 you that they're offended they want the
33:57 fur coat the diamond they want you to
33:59 fix their car I mean they want you to
34:01 try to get something out of you to
34:03 grovel right and forgiveness is the
34:07 antidote if you can get your mind to the
34:11 point you feel like you've been hurt or
34:12 offended or you're angry
34:13 forgiveness is your way of completely
34:16 controlling your life and not being
34:18 subject subjected to the need for an
34:21 emergency room of emotional restitution
34:25 right but now let's talk about a big one
34:29 those nuclear bombs that go off and your
34:32 emotional spectrum of life now there are
34:37 situations where you can avoid
34:38 forgiveness because the other individual
34:42 has decided to exit your relationship it
34:46 could be a family member to be your son
34:49 your daughter could be your spouse for
34:52 whatever reason they have you know
34:55 developed in their mind perhaps without
34:57 you know the ability to forgive your
35:00 indiscretions as well they have come to
35:03 a point where they want to leave now
35:07 some people have the maturity although I
35:08 think it's very few these days to
35:10 actually break off a relationship and go
35:12 off and do something with their life
35:14 without hurting you and then there is a
35:17 huge group of people that always go off
35:19 to find the other person this sort of
35:22 the safety net first then they clip it
35:24 with the one that they're with and they
35:26 jump off and seemingly don't care how
35:29 much damage they do to the other person
35:32 it's one thing to be dumped it's another
35:34 thing to be cheated on then dumped right
35:37 in the end it really is the same thing
35:40 to be honest but we're looking for a
35:43 technique to be owed something from
35:46 someone when they leave if you break it
35:49 off with someone and as I took a
35:51 courtship and marriage class and
35:53 was in high school and the big advice
35:55 from the 40s was never break up with
35:57 someone in their face because they'll
35:58 cry and when they cry you typically cave
36:01 in and go another round even though
36:03 you've made a logical decision based on
36:05 who you really are to get the hell out
36:06 of that situation but if you do break up
36:09 it's clean and no one can extort
36:11 anything out of you really oh they can
36:14 try but they won't be able to really
36:16 because you've done the honorable thing
36:19 tried to rationalize with them while
36:21 you're leaving is usually best done a
36:23 letter because in a conversation someone
36:25 can keep the conveyor belt going you
36:27 can't let go
36:28 but-but-but it's better just to put it
36:30 in a letter which is today an email
36:33 right don't do with your text if you can
36:36 help it give it a little bit of
36:37 dimension well let's just say the
36:41 Hollywood thing happens and there's a
36:44 there's infidelity someone goes off and
36:48 sleeps with their secretary someone go
36:49 sleeps with their whatever neighbor now
36:54 you got a kind of a mess on your hands
36:55 now if you're just dating and you live
36:58 in separate locations hey that's pretty
37:01 easy to resolve right stop going to each
37:03 other's houses if you live together but
37:05 you're just dating well then someone
37:06 needs to move out in the middle of the
37:07 goddamn day or night when you're off on
37:10 vacation or off on business because
37:12 you're got your stuff tied together then
37:14 there's a dispute of what's mine and
37:15 what's yours but if you were married and
37:18 you actually share bank accounts and god
37:21 forbid you have children you are asking
37:24 for some serious hurt and I don't care
37:27 what side of the fence you're on right a
37:29 big big mistake to not get divorced
37:32 first and then go chase your hair
37:34 alternative options but now let's look
37:37 at a relationship forgiveness for one
37:38 second because and I believe I
37:40 plagiarizing a little bit of my betrayal
37:42 episode but let's think about it for a
37:44 second the expectations of the United
37:47 States of America is that between the
37:49 age of perhaps maybe 18 and 28 the
37:53 10-year period you were probably
37:55 destined to find the spouse you're gonna
37:57 live the rest of your life with or at
37:59 least the first one you're gonna try to
38:00 do it with in that time you have not met
38:04 that many people unless you're a
38:05 celebrity
38:06 an actor a musician someone super famous
38:10 and some other category Olympic
38:12 capabilities and so most of us don't
38:15 meet that many people and we certainly
38:17 don't meet them at any intimate level of
38:19 intellectual exchange or physical
38:21 exchange but we want it so bad because
38:23 there's so much pressure and so much
38:25 chemical changes in our bodies to get
38:27 this thing taken care of because again
38:31 life as life kicks our ass the second we
38:33 get our high school sharing that
38:35 ass-kicking with someone else is
38:37 actually it's it's nice they know the
38:41 most wonderful things in the world are
38:42 free that's love and companionship
38:45 something you choose right well we
38:48 barely meet anyone and then we convince
38:50 ourselves that we have enough empirical
38:52 knowledge about that person and the rest
38:54 of our options that we run off with them
38:56 and as it really doesn't fit we just
39:01 fudge it in our own brains now I don't
39:04 care about that I don't care about that
39:06 I don't care about that well I guess I
39:08 can like that I guess I couldn't like
39:09 this but when you have a doozie on your
39:12 hands it's tough something happened that
39:16 the world will obtusely agree with you
39:19 on and now you have to figure out how
39:23 you're gonna deal with it and depending
39:25 on your life you may not have any advice
39:29 at all in the world and usually it takes
39:32 a lot of to figure out that you haven't
39:34 met that many people in life usually
39:38 that sentiment only comes into your mind
39:40 after you find a person after your
39:44 person that has dumped you has left you
39:47 and the second you find the second
39:49 person and then you can apply a little
39:51 more science to it you can have a few
39:53 more conversations about who are you
39:55 well who are you I like this like you
39:56 know I thought this was not important
39:58 but it is important hold me - bah bah
40:00 bah your second attempt to having a
40:03 long-term relationship is typically
40:04 exponentially better than your first but
40:08 when you're in your first what happens
40:10 you're usually younger by mathematical
40:12 certainty and therefore less mature
40:15 right
40:18 so let me ask you you're hurt and you
40:22 hurt bad well before forgiveness comes
40:25 into the picture what are your options
40:27 here if someone has convinced themselves
40:30 that you're not they're not the one for
40:32 you and you're not the one for them what
40:36 can you do to possibly change their mind
40:38 in rare cases there are some
40:40 communication efforts that can be very
40:42 successful and you can actually talk to
40:44 someone through a misunderstanding
40:46 that's usually what it feels like for
40:48 the receiving end because you'll say why
40:51 and they'll give you some really bizarre
40:53 excuse and you'll say well that's not me
40:56 that's not the way I would think I've
40:57 never had that thought ever popped
40:58 through my head ever but you're accusing
41:00 me of having that thought every single
41:01 day that's not fair
41:03 again I had a girlfriend of mine I think
41:06 I mentioned this in season one really
41:07 funny situation she had she had gone on
41:14 a date with somebody at her work and it
41:16 was a non-sexual thing at first pretty
41:18 platonic and I found out about it and I
41:23 said you know why did you do that and
41:25 she accused me of something that I
41:28 didn't do at all because we were at a
41:31 gathering of Thanksgiving gathering and
41:34 her aunt was throwing the event and this
41:37 guy came in it was kind of acidic dude
41:39 and he made a comment about a dress that
41:43 he didn't like it but he was kind of you
41:47 know he wasn't saying your dress is ugly
41:49 but he was like Oh where'd you get that
41:50 dress and you know it was a pretty
41:52 obvious that it was just it was
41:54 definitely an odd dress okay so she was
41:57 in the back room and tore it off I
41:58 remember I was following her because she
42:00 was seemed so disturbed and I'm like
42:01 what's going on what's going on and she
42:03 just tears this dress up puts on some
42:07 other dress and then I don't know six
42:11 months later whatever she said well you
42:12 made fun of my dress at Thanksgiving I
42:15 was like hmm that wasn't me that was
42:18 your aunt's friend do you remember now
42:21 and the look on her face was devastating
42:24 she went off and done a date with
42:26 someone else and you know if she did
42:29 physically get involved with the guy
42:30 just think about
42:31 all this rationale based on something
42:34 she thought I did now obviously it was
42:36 more to the game than that we were quite
42:38 a few years apart in age she was much
42:40 older than me but and she's married that
42:43 guy and stayed with them since then so
42:45 that's 25 years ago so pretty damn
42:48 awesome scenario for her but what had
42:52 happened at that moment cuz that was
42:53 pretty young I think I was about 23
42:55 years old so I wasn't the Y soul you see
42:58 today I still had to go okay so she
43:02 misunderstood something I understand
43:04 when you're angry the who's what where's
43:06 in house can get all kind of mixed up
43:08 especially if you're going under some
43:09 sort of your your you've convinced
43:11 yourself you're in some traumatic
43:12 situation and so I spent probably four
43:16 months after that trying to convince her
43:17 to come back saying what wasn't me that
43:20 did that and if there's something else
43:22 that's going on I told her I said look
43:23 have you talked to me about what what's
43:26 bothering you
43:26 right and it really came down to an age
43:28 difference which now I understand the
43:30 significance of that more than ever did
43:32 not understand it back then but let me
43:35 give you some advice about trying to go
43:37 through the ritual of forgiveness for
43:39 gigantic issues if someone has a
43:42 preponderance to doing something and
43:45 they show at a bitch'll weakness to
43:48 something you must be extremely careful
43:50 and realized that if you're going to
43:52 forgive them once you're probably going
43:54 to have to forgive them multiple times
43:57 you will never know when the end of that
44:00 process will occur they may tell you
44:03 it's the last drink I'm gonna do it's
44:04 the last thing I'm gonna do and you they
44:07 don't know and you don't know really
44:09 that that's the end as much as they say
44:11 if someone has no record of ever doing
44:14 anything like that and they do slip into
44:16 it once you can probably give it a very
44:21 decent beautiful second round because
44:23 [ __ ] happens it does right but there's
44:28 something called trust that sort of
44:31 introduces itself as the little Yago on
44:33 the side of this play now Trust is a
44:36 very bizarre thing because it has to do
44:39 with the proprietary notion that certain
44:44 things are going to
44:45 be a certain way all the time I trust
44:48 you'll never do this I'll trust you'll
44:51 always be there right it's always trust
44:53 is related to a policy never being
44:55 violated here's something you can never
44:58 say to your lover I trust you'll never
45:00 hurt me now you might say I trust that
45:03 you'll never try to hurt me but if you
45:05 have the wherewithal to just the
45:07 sentence just a little bit then you have
45:08 to have the the maturity to say well
45:11 you're human
45:12 I'm human you don't want to be laying
45:15 down policies that put you in a glass
45:17 house throwing stones if a gigantic
45:20 moment of betrayal that would lead into
45:22 forgiveness occurs Trust is going to
45:26 have to be redefined and readjusted only
45:29 time obviously will tell you whether or
45:32 not your trust policy is still in place
45:36 now I know people that live lives where
45:39 they really just share their lives
45:41 together and they operate almost like a
45:43 couple the entire time but they certain
45:46 they're sort of open as well at the same
45:48 time but here's the bummer about
45:51 forgiveness of the larger sort you were
45:55 gonna have to carry a little suitcase of
45:57 pain in you until you can stop caring
45:58 about it right you were let down the
46:05 expectations you had about life about
46:08 how that other person was going to
46:09 behave did not pan out at all for that
46:12 one finite moment but you're gonna have
46:15 to carry it around with you your whole
46:16 life you know until you stop caring
46:18 about that one thing and I can assure
46:22 you the more time that you devote to
46:24 just living life and stop focusing on
46:26 past events the more that the past will
46:28 stop plugging your life the need to
46:31 forgive old things it's it's almost
46:34 you'll get to a point where the amount
46:36 of energy you would expel out of your
46:38 body to go through the ritual of
46:40 forgiveness to even tell the other
46:42 person that you forgive them is such a
46:44 fruitless use of your time that you
46:49 won't do it you don't care that's the
46:54 world you want
46:55 forgiveness is also related to when you
46:58 put your stakes in the ground in terms
47:00 of sort of acceptable behavior now some
47:04 of you are raised in really wonderful
47:05 families and wonderful regions of the
47:06 world and you wouldn't give up any of
47:09 that for any price whatsoever right this
47:13 is the way a man behaves this is the way
47:15 a woman behaves and this is the way they
47:17 behave together this is how a young
47:19 child is allowed to behave
47:21 pre-adolescent adolescent etc and if you
47:25 have that conviction in you then go
47:28 ahead and stick to it
47:29 but then you should not move an inch
47:31 from where you were raised such that you
47:34 may find people like yourself it's like
47:37 it's you pick up your roots and you go
47:39 someplace else and you lay down you're
47:41 now in a different culture things are
47:43 different if you want to pat yourself on
47:45 the back for being adventurous you also
47:47 have to be culturally open-minded but as
47:52 it is the sense of right and wrong that
47:54 gives us the foundation to create the
47:56 policies to create sort of the laws of
48:00 the land within your own life and within
48:02 a life you might share for others such
48:04 that you can itemize and recognize and
48:07 identify moments of betrayal that would
48:11 need forgiveness in the first place we
48:15 have this saying if you're over 25 years
48:17 old an especially if you're 35 45 55 or
48:20 higher that you don't know [ __ ] about
48:22 the world into you're 25 right we always
48:25 say that you don't you got to finish
48:26 college and then you got to get your ass
48:28 kicked for three years and only at that
48:30 point do you really just sort of enter
48:32 the chambers of maturity and again a lot
48:36 of you grew up a lot faster now because
48:37 you had much more intense life's but on
48:39 average that's usually about the year
48:41 you start to grow up start to grow up
48:44 you are now grown up one day into your
48:47 25th birthday I only wish that was the
48:49 case why mention that I mentioned it
48:53 because we form all of these notions of
48:57 knowing how life should go before we
49:01 ever live it to know what it should
49:04 actually be one of the reasons why when
49:07 people get older they get a little more
49:08 real
49:09 in the universe is because they've seen
49:11 [ __ ] come and go
49:12 they've prioritized things that weren't
49:15 that important they thought they owned
49:17 another human being and realized they
49:18 didn't and the more simplistic the more
49:22 they simplified their life Martha kept
49:25 it simple the more life just opened up
49:29 and opened up and opened up and made
49:30 itself so much more pliable you all know
49:34 a person that's pretty much a hermit and
49:38 and I don't mean it for any condition of
49:40 the mind it just mean they're in it
49:42 they're in these really small bizarre
49:45 worlds you see these guys all the time
49:46 I've talked about him every once in a
49:48 while in previous episodes but they live
49:51 in their little bubble of policies
49:54 there's a old thing I used to see when I
49:57 used to have a season pass to Disneyland
49:58 take my daughter with me I would go in
50:02 there and I would see a white guy who
50:03 has definitely done the mail-order bride
50:05 thing which is fine and you'd find them
50:10 with the ones that were just happy and
50:11 open and bubbly and just having a good
50:13 time and he's showing her America and
50:15 she's digging the place they had some
50:17 kids together and that kids are
50:18 beautiful and then you see the guy that
50:20 is usually a little more awkward looking
50:25 it was his only option in the entire
50:28 world
50:28 to do this the wife is absolutely
50:31 unhappy her face is just as boom
50:33 monotone as possible the kids seem
50:37 afraid
50:37 and it's usually a guy who turns around
50:41 and you know you know I don't say this
50:44 as like a standard but it's typical some
50:46 short guy who's yelling and pointing his
50:48 finger in his wife's face he's always
50:50 passing out discipline smacking his kids
50:53 something like that and he's living in a
50:54 world where he is actually a big coward
50:58 but he's created this little world of
51:00 his right he's got all of his policies
51:01 where he could beat up on his wife and
51:03 beat up on his kids even if he doesn't
51:04 truly punch them or anything he just
51:07 torments them mentally and obviously you
51:11 know from a macro standpoint his life
51:13 didn't turn out well someone didn't hug
51:15 him enough someone didn't teach him the
51:16 stuff that we talk about on the show and
51:19 so he's sort of a victim of society
51:22 if whatever reason he didn't get out of
51:25 it you know actually got into a little
51:30 squabble with the guy during one of the
51:33 firework shows who was exactly this kind
51:36 of [ __ ] and he lifts off to me as I
51:39 was pushing you know it was a big
51:42 opening in the crowd in front of where
51:44 he was standing where we're all supposed
51:46 to go you know if you want to watch the
51:47 fireworks show and so I asked him very
51:50 politely I could just get by and I let
51:53 my kid go by my lady go by and then I
51:56 stepped down and the second I stepped
51:57 down he [ __ ] lifts off to me about
52:00 being an [ __ ] or something like that
52:02 and I just pushed my [ __ ] face right
52:05 against his I said you know I asked you
52:08 politely and then he tried to do a push
52:11 and then it was just like got the point
52:13 I almost [ __ ] deck to [ __ ] up but the
52:15 security went and grabbed him and pulled
52:18 him out it was great guy was a dick but
52:24 I forgave him but the reason I mentioned
52:26 this policy thing is that I think that a
52:29 lot of us are hurt as a young as young
52:31 people and we get less hurt as we get
52:33 older because we simply grow up now we
52:38 all know those guys that are in their
52:40 70s that are just [ __ ] children they
52:44 just never have had to grow up they've
52:46 either lived a privileged life or
52:47 they've been just isolated and no one's
52:49 come in to bust their bubble but as you
52:53 develop your life to try and figure out
52:55 where you're offended where people's
52:58 behaviors are going to go left or right
53:00 or up or down I need you to contemplate
53:02 the fact that we are all human you're
53:05 just as flawed as other people but
53:07 perhaps in different ways some people
53:10 take that system and they gank it day
53:12 they really try to get as much out of it
53:15 as possible and it's offensive as hell
53:18 it is it pisses you off to close this
53:23 thing off I really want to suggest that
53:25 if you are dealing with a really tough
53:28 moment where you need to forgive try to
53:33 see what bucket it's in right is it a
53:35 obtuse big a very obvious thing that is
53:40 very tough to deal with or are you
53:42 dealing with a bunch of like micro
53:43 fractures of your policies and your
53:45 thought process take a look at the
53:48 policies that you use to surround your
53:51 life to follow to follow in general
53:54 maybe you need to ease back on some of
53:57 those maybe need to add some different
53:59 policies at different times in the
54:00 pipeline maybe do you just need to sit
54:02 down and talk out with someone that you
54:04 share your life with as to how life
54:09 should be lived you know I should
54:14 probably repeat this more often than I
54:15 do I believe I got it out in a couple
54:17 times in season one I don't know if I
54:19 remembered it wants in season two but I
54:21 have a methodology that's I think works
54:24 really really well for figuring out
54:25 whether or not you're compatible with
54:26 another human being because it's one of
54:30 the most untaught free-flowing things
54:35 but gosh isn't it kind of important that
54:37 you figure out whether or not you're
54:38 compatible with someone else here goes
54:40 folks here's the [ __ ] trick of all
54:42 tricks most valuable thing you can hear
54:45 if you're not married you ask another
54:49 human being what their purpose and life
54:51 is that's it don't ask them what they
54:56 want to be in life where they want to
54:58 live whether they not they breathe to
55:00 write oh my god I breathe in they Bri we
55:04 have so much in common they like to
55:05 drink water so do I you know it's like
55:07 no purpose in life what is your purpose
55:10 in life is it getting rich is it serving
55:13 yourself is it helping others what is
55:17 your purpose in life once you understand
55:19 that you're good
55:20 and if once you understand that and
55:23 you're agree that your purposes are the
55:25 same you're good
55:27 another test I did and when I was 17
55:29 years old before my mom married my
55:31 stepdad I set him apart on a table and I
55:35 said okay getting two pieces of paper
55:36 two pens and I said look I want you to
55:38 both write down your definition of love
55:40 and don't look at each other's paper
55:42 I've never seen two adults more nervous
55:45 in my life out of ten words that I had
55:48 them write down they
55:49 shared one but it was a very big
55:52 eye-opener for them to see what each
55:54 other thoughts about love imagine the
55:58 difference between you sitting in a
56:00 crowd watching your favorite musician on
56:04 stage and how you feel entering the
56:07 arena showing your ticket getting your
56:09 food whatever and going down and
56:11 watching the show versus the person
56:15 that's on stage walking out to entertain
56:18 you think about how they think about the
56:21 arena it's like this is just a mechanism
56:25 like an instrument to get to my fans I
56:28 own the music that goes through these
56:31 speakers I'm in complete control if I
56:34 sing one way the crowd feels this way if
56:36 I sing another way the crowd feels that
56:37 way if I have an update or bad day their
56:39 constants you that good or it's bad
56:41 there is the duality and the reason why
56:44 I mentioned that is there's a difference
56:45 between the way that you approach your
56:47 life because in your destiny you're more
56:50 the person on stage you are trying to
56:54 control your life to get to your end
56:56 goals whatever the hell they are and
56:57 hopefully they're not all completely
56:59 selfish to you but the second side of
57:02 the equation is when you are interacting
57:05 with others you are more like the
57:08 spectator down there in the crowd now if
57:11 you are brilliant which most of you are
57:15 try to live right in between those two
57:18 be sociable right get to a point that
57:23 you can flow with the punches ease your
57:25 policy such that your need to forgive
57:27 anyone or anything becomes almost
57:30 negligible if you were an alien coming
57:34 down from another planet you lived a
57:36 thousand years old and you came down to
57:38 these human beings and you spent twenty
57:40 years right and they're being offensive
57:43 they think you know you're whatever race
57:45 and sex you decide to tell the computer
57:47 to make you when you come down they
57:49 don't know you're alien but they're
57:50 being offensive to you point in there
57:52 and your finger at you telling you how
57:55 life is you get a girlfriend or
57:57 boyfriend depending on what sex of alien
57:59 you are and they weren't off and cheat
58:00 on you you could give
58:02 right because you're going well [ __ ] I'm
58:05 just an alien coming down for some
58:06 sociological psychological analysis of
58:09 human beings I don't care what you guys
58:11 do it doesn't offend me I don't have any
58:13 attachment to you whatsoever I'm gonna
58:16 live 950 years longer than you are try
58:20 to get your mind to be that mature
58:23 within this life and then you will
58:27 simply be your the skin on your back
58:29 will be very thick right be resilient as
58:34 Michael Jackson categorized himself this
58:37 is one of those really obscure ones I'll
58:39 throw this in probably two months from
58:41 now but anyway I probably appreciate you
58:44 guys listening take care of yourself and
58:46 someone else we're skipping the bumper
58:47 over and out
