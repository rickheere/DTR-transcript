00:21 [Music]
00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen on this beautiful summer
00:35 afternoon in late late August it's the
00:42 last day of August so much for that
00:45 global warming [ __ ] you've just had
00:49 the coldest summer I have ever
00:51 experienced in Southern California in
00:55 the 32 years of lived here
00:57 it's as if summer never showed up at all
01:01 it's taken literally to August 31st to
01:04 have a day like this where it's 10:20 in
01:08 the morning in Huntington Beach and it's
01:10 just absolutely perfect it's prob about
01:12 75 plus this episode is gonna be about a
01:16 term I heard a couple of nights ago on
01:19 YouTube that my smoked lounge were it
01:25 was the word instant truth is over I
01:28 mean it was that was the phrase excuse
01:29 me and I absolutely loved it soon as I
01:33 heard that I was like oh my god that's
01:35 one of those phrases instant truth
01:40 here's the thing we are always looking
01:43 for the one phrase that you can tell
01:46 someone who's asleep that will infect
01:49 their brain like an image of some
01:53 impossible like assure infinite loop
01:56 image were a computer simply trying to
02:00 analyze the image will go crazy and
02:03 overload and have to change their
02:05 programming to be able to acknowledge
02:08 something that doesn't really exist
02:12 instant truth what does that really mean
02:15 if you're confused it means that people
02:17 believe in [ __ ] because the institution
02:19 is bringing it to them has some history
02:22 in their family life right it's the New
02:24 Yorker magazine it's ABC it's whatever
02:28 CNN it's a Huffington Post doesn't I
02:31 just sound real Huffington oh my god how
02:35 could they possibly lie to you
02:37 Reagle rags of yellow journalism that
02:43 are now infiltrated broadcast television
02:45 the internet places like Google and
02:51 YouTube censor against instant truth
02:56 would you know what I think it's even
02:58 deeper and more hilarious abouts instant
03:02 truth it's that the boomers of the world
03:06 and some Millennials but mostly boomers
03:09 they're so [ __ ] lazy when it comes to
03:12 discerning the truth they want to phone
03:15 the whole [ __ ] thing and they want a
03:17 phone parenting in they want to phone
03:19 life in everything is a low risk low
03:22 yield low [ __ ] fulfillment history of
03:25 their lives on average now I hang out
03:29 with some boomers and a rock stars and
03:31 they were anything but that their whole
03:33 thing was being neurotically focused on
03:35 what the hell they want in life they
03:38 kept the thing on eleven constantly and
03:42 therefore they really lived they did
03:45 something unique with their life which
03:47 again there's an episode I put out there
03:50 called why are you here and the whole
03:52 thrust is not to do something trivial
03:55 man you're not here to do the same
03:57 [ __ ] again to someone else is
03:58 already done you ready to do something
04:00 special so find out what it is and do it
04:02 but that's another episode instant truth
04:08 instant truth is such a ridiculous
04:10 paradigm of claim but if you really
04:14 think about it and I think psychologists
04:17 have proven it it's sociologists have
04:19 proven it I saw that basher get up there
04:22 I go do Scarecrow work hang on it's my
04:26 privilege on this day but they proved it
04:29 several times that when a human being is
04:31 at a location and they aren't a witness
04:33 to a situation that your personal
04:37 psychological biases start to infect
04:41 what you think you saw if you have any
04:43 uncertainty and you try to fill in that
04:45 uncertainty was sort of like you know
04:47 your Jurassic Park frog DNA to try and
04:49 figure out what was there you try to
04:50 guess to me
04:51 was there your biases will control what
04:54 you do with that unknown information
04:56 sometimes there's a situation where what
05:02 happened was so unbelievably terrible
05:04 and against all your belief systems that
05:07 she'll simply either wipe it clean like
05:09 it didn't happen or you'll retell the
05:10 story from scratch what do you think it
05:13 must be like for these families that
05:15 have you know gang bangers for kids when
05:20 they get the phone call from the police
05:21 or they turn on the television and their
05:22 kid has got an ak-47 robbing a bank
05:26 downtown Cal you know downtown Los
05:29 Angeles and they got a thousand PD LAPD
05:31 on these people and you're like you know
05:34 then the name is being announced who's
05:36 doing it's being announced and the guy
05:38 walks down the sidewalk puts a gun up
05:40 innocently this job blows his brain out
05:42 and if that's your kid and you have no
05:45 idea because you've been in I'm not
05:47 saying you these people have no idea
05:48 because they didn't accept the fact that
05:51 their kid was in a gang or whatever and
05:55 so they just short-circuit in real life
05:57 end up in some institution what are the
06:00 classic things that happen when I was in
06:02 junior college it would probably be too
06:05 you know
06:06 risky today because I went to junior
06:11 college of two locations I want to
06:12 inverter junior college and Dan's a
06:14 junior college where Steve Jobs went and
06:18 they taught the same thing twice I
06:20 remembered it really well they run this
06:23 experiment where a bunch of kids ran
06:24 into a room and they did a mock murder I
06:28 guess even fired a gun which is a
06:30 traumatic sound object right so your
06:32 brain starts going to trauma for
06:34 physical reasons let alone the
06:36 psychological reason and then it was
06:39 like scene it's over all the actors
06:41 leave and then they asked the kids okay
06:44 based on what you saw write it down you
06:47 just I witnessed this whole thing what
06:48 did you see it was a few black kids in
06:52 room but a bunch of white kids in room
06:54 of the actors that came in and did this
06:57 one was a black male and the rest were
06:59 all mixed white as I have had this told
07:02 to me a couple times
07:04 the black kids in the room actually got
07:06 it right
07:07 they said the white dude shot the white
07:11 girl something like that but all the
07:14 white people said black guy shut the
07:16 white girl and the truth is the white
07:20 guy shot the white girl but all this
07:23 racial bias that was going on in the 60s
07:25 when this experiment was done was
07:27 infecting all the bias of course the one
07:30 that they are ridiculously afraid of the
07:33 black male well of course he's the
07:34 aggressor the folks are black they don't
07:38 see any threat and someone just took a
07:39 different color because they're smarter
07:41 and they they kept their own you know
07:43 they kept their trauma down and they're
07:44 looking at the situation going who's got
07:46 a gun who's got a gun
07:47 and they were able to filter through
07:48 their bias that's why instant truth
07:51 doesn't work no matter what you think
07:55 but insta truth again is one of those
07:58 phrases that if you sit down with
07:59 someone who's idealistic aliy drunk on
08:03 fake news and it could be it's right now
08:05 it just happens to be in 2019 a lot of
08:07 leftist stuff but there's definitely
08:14 lies everywhere everywhere all the time
08:17 and there is no such thing as instant
08:20 truth for the most part now where
08:23 there's a binary question being asked
08:26 that's as close as you can get to a an
08:28 instant truth so it heads or as details
08:31 well that meteorite kill all of us you
08:34 know is George Soros really dead
08:38 binary answers are the easiest ones but
08:42 by no means the ones the the type of
08:45 question you can ask that you're
08:46 obviously going to get just instant
08:48 truth but why do people want instant
08:51 truth right haven't you ever been in a
08:54 conversation where someone was like
08:55 taking too long to explain something and
08:57 you're just like hey what happened is my
09:00 kid alivers my kid did don't give me
09:02 this big build up you're not a
09:04 storyteller dude because people ask me
09:07 all the time how do you read the news
09:08 man how do you read the news such that
09:10 you can keep a mental image of the world
09:12 and I will tell you that it is
09:14 increasingly difficult extremely
09:16 difficult
09:18 because there's nowhere to go there's
09:21 nowhere to go
09:22 it's amazing you will find remarkable
09:25 articles in everywhere it's strange I've
09:29 seen CNN reporting that I was shocked
09:32 CNN was reporting the Hongkong riots
09:34 while Fox News is almost never
09:37 acknowledge that they exist what the
09:40 hell would you kidding me
09:42 a thousand people downtown Hong Kong all
09:45 over bridges and shooting green lasers
09:48 in the face of the cops to keep her out
09:50 you know it means you know facial
09:52 recognition cutting down telephone poles
09:56 with diamond saws so they can crush the
09:58 cameras at the end which is the
09:59 surveillance state that's been installed
10:00 by mainland China
10:02 this is history happening and they're
10:04 not they're not reporting it Paris has
10:06 had riots every single weekend since
10:08 December of 2018 barely any one's
10:12 governing it anymore so that's it
10:16 RT the Russian news yeah they'll report
10:21 you know some things that you don't get
10:23 to see anywhere else in the world but
10:26 then they have probably 50 to 60 percent
10:28 of just absolutely either fake news or
10:32 ridiculous fear-mongering op-eds I mean
10:38 super super ridiculous ignorant writers
10:42 the believe in this matrix that we live
10:45 in in terms of who's in control you know
10:48 who's in debt to who go [ __ ] yourself
10:50 are you kidding me America's in debt to
10:53 nobody Europe's a debts and nobody this
10:55 is all funny money all fiat currencies
10:57 been created by these bankers to to
11:00 screw us over they're the ones that
11:03 create the war such that we borrowed
11:05 money in the first place they're the
11:06 ones that crashed the economy to make
11:08 sure we had to borrow money in the first
11:09 place they're they own the choice of
11:12 what energy we use when we're all
11:15 getting blamed you know for having
11:17 nuclear power plants power homes
11:18 I didn't [ __ ] choose that nobody
11:20 chose that some banker chose that and
11:24 imposed it on me and then later on when
11:27 he decides he wants to change the
11:28 business he guilt trips to [ __ ] out of
11:30 me through
11:31 Al Gore in this [ __ ] climate change
11:33 stuff which ain't happening incident
11:36 news doesn't exist or sorry instant
11:39 truth doesn't exist excuse me it's the
11:42 news is out there but insta truth has
11:45 never been easily accessible in the
11:48 history of man you could have a village
11:51 with 50 people no other people on earth
11:54 and you know Bobby hits Mary in the face
11:57 or whatever and you can't get all the
12:01 facts not in the instant way okay what
12:04 was going on what do you do there what
12:06 you say you should never hit a woman and
12:08 but still what do you do what you say
12:11 you don't say there's a million
12:12 circumstances what's interesting is that
12:19 to have instant truth and what I'm
12:23 trying to do here is given giving you
12:25 the stage to 3/4 through in follow-up
12:29 statements when you bring this up to
12:32 someone who's completely indoctrinated
12:33 and you get them on the bandwagon of
12:34 like oh yeah there is no instant truth
12:36 is there no and now let's talk about it
12:38 and so I am going to freestyle as I
12:41 always do tons of things that you can
12:43 bring up to further drive the nail in
12:46 the coffin that hey since there is no
12:50 instant truth once you go back and ask
12:53 yourself all the things that you've
12:54 believed through the apparatus of
12:56 instant truth and then do yourself and
12:59 meet a big giant favor including society
13:01 and get rid of all that information and
13:06 then you could take them down rabbit
13:07 hole up the rabbit hole to find out
13:10 what's going on but think about the very
13:13 fabric of information today because
13:17 isn't that the substrate what are you
13:19 reporting on I'm reporting on the river
13:20 of truth oh you are where's that where
13:25 is the river of truth by which this
13:27 information is cleansed it's beautiful
13:30 it's the pure source entron 1982 there
13:34 is none is there I was talking with a
13:37 friend of mine yesterday and it was all
13:41 about the fact that I don't think we can
13:43 go back more than maybe
13:45 the 1500s and have just even a an idea
13:51 of what the hell was going on in this
13:53 world it's all been filled in by
13:54 historians who smoke pipes and we're you
13:58 know there was it powdered wigs telling
14:03 us what happened and telling us
14:05 confidently that we have that that
14:08 certain uncertainty that we be loathe
14:10 and certainty because uncertainty is the
14:12 monster in the whole you know it's
14:14 monster in the cave it's the disease
14:16 that might eat you up and so once you
14:18 fill in all the gaps for me right so you
14:22 know and it's one of these things of you
14:25 know there's a lot of analogies for for
14:28 planes flying over
14:30 Wow it's for World War one fighter
14:35 planes
14:36 [Music]
14:45 Wow they're flying a formation that's
14:48 just super cool but there's all these
14:52 metaphors and parables and songs about
14:57 when you build something you've got to
14:59 build it from a foundation a strong
15:02 foundation right all right when your
15:07 foundation is crap but everything you
15:10 build on its crap when your philosophy
15:12 of the world is crap it's socialism then
15:15 everything you're gonna say from this
15:16 point forward is based on complete
15:18 [ __ ]
15:19 well if history is completely tanked
15:22 right I mean let's just go through some
15:25 basic things you know you have
15:29 stonehenge stonehenge is supposedly
15:31 built 5000 BC blah blah blah
15:36 well I was in a completely different
15:37 location in 1953 and then was picked up
15:40 brushed off all the rocks were repaired
15:44 a new site was determined and they built
15:47 the whole thing in 1954 and there's a
15:49 hundred ten photos of them building it
15:51 you know you go there and you see like
15:54 the stones have been completely filled
15:55 in with concrete at the base so they
15:57 would stand straight up you didn't think
15:59 that was a little bit weird but you're
16:01 not really seeing it where it used to be
16:03 and then of course they immediately
16:05 impose on it some druid calendar thing
16:08 it's all [ __ ] made up people didn't
16:11 you don't you realize that that whole
16:13 story is made up and then what do they
16:16 do
16:17 archaeologists come in and start digging
16:19 around the new fake site right it used
16:22 to have a ring there so there was some
16:24 sort of thing going on before they put
16:27 those stones there but they dig up
16:30 little pots and little things supposedly
16:33 I mean archaeologists I now think are
16:34 just about as fake as a $3 bill they
16:37 only make money if they find something
16:40 in the ground that's old okay not
16:43 everybody has access to all the great
16:44 digs in the world because other someone
16:47 already has it or a country says we
16:48 don't want you to dig up this history
16:49 because you know might alibi traverse
16:52 some of the power structure we have on
16:53 surface of the soil now Egypt
16:57 talk about it all the time don't we
16:59 Graham Hancock is uncovered what we
17:03 believe to be easily another 35,000
17:09 years of history added to the 5,000 it's
17:11 on the books we only goli go back 3,200
17:14 but he's found temples that designate
17:18 pharaohs back 35,000 years okay we now
17:25 figured out what the pyramids do they're
17:27 big giant batteries the big giant will
17:29 it break basically ether will power
17:30 plants okay as Tesla proved and his
17:35 antenna de built we have a bunch of
17:40 people who believe that in their
17:42 particular area of the world some
17:44 religious magic person existed not just
17:47 Christians a bunch of folks and you know
17:52 there's no harm and some of that because
17:54 you can go eh this is a way to teach
17:55 your brain how to think correctly and
17:57 how to behave in society and well yeah
17:59 we have some things you should do to
18:00 your body because we say God doesn't
18:02 want you to be that way but what was
18:03 really about is keeping you clean and
18:05 keeping you from getting sick
18:08 so we baked into the religion whatever a
18:11 bunch of us exists now because we cut
18:14 that little piece of skin off where we
18:16 did this and we eat fish on Friday or
18:17 whatever the other thing is right but it
18:19 was just it wasn't anything to do with
18:21 God or any religion or magic people that
18:24 really existed but isn't it funny I mean
18:27 we all want a little bit of magic to
18:28 exist in this world and it's sort of
18:30 like screw you don't tell me magic
18:32 doesn't exist all right can you function
18:36 in society as an adult
18:37 are we gonna live in some margin
18:39 efficient is it good to live in a margin
18:41 of fiction maybe it is Johnny Depp's
18:43 movie where he played Don Juan he was
18:46 living in a fictional character
18:47 personifying Don Juan the Ladykiller
18:51 and he brought joy to all these women
18:54 who were unloved in the world hey that's
18:57 pretty cool and then he gets cornered in
18:59 a hospital has to take drugs to remove
19:01 his fantasy it's a damn shame but it was
19:05 beautifully done in that film that's why
19:07 these films that he did that nobody even
19:08 remembers and it was
19:10 first act is so brilliant the way he
19:13 seduces these women it's so funny it's
19:16 also one of these movies it's you know
19:17 trying to teach women to not like your
19:21 alpha males but whatever generational
19:26 gaps instant truth mmm does it NASA
19:32 enjoy instant truth man anything they
19:35 say they do holy [ __ ] I mean it's so bad
19:39 now I mean imagine SpaceX with all their
19:41 CG landings and all this stuff NASA
19:47 doing spacewalks in some weird water
19:51 laboratory you know water testing ground
19:53 and you know all the fake harness stuff
19:56 on the ISS I mean they are pumping out
19:59 they're pumping out scenes in the in the
20:02 ISS that if you were to watch you know
20:05 gravity - and Sandra Bullock floats by
20:09 in a harness or she says look at me I'm
20:11 doing some 3d air Sarris than 360
20:14 zero-gravity rotations and her you know
20:17 her clothes or pollen we're all the
20:18 wires are hanging onto her which is what
20:20 happens to all the astronauts including
20:21 a guy reaching over and grabbing the
20:23 damn wire you would leave the movie
20:27 saying those were the worst special
20:28 effects ever I will recommend this only
20:31 to laugh at but NASA gets to present
20:35 that crap and get away with it don't
20:37 they it's real folks okay I need to
20:41 believe in more fake [ __ ] because I've
20:43 been totally enchanted on the fake [ __ ]
20:45 to fairies and Easter bunnies and Santa
20:48 Claus and now the next thing is religion
20:51 I get to keep this one this is my fake
20:53 one I get to keep don't tell me don't
20:55 tell me magic doesn't exist and I worry
20:59 about your soul because you don't
21:00 believe in fake [ __ ]
21:01 and then NASA comes around and goes well
21:04 you're totally in doctrine and watch
21:06 this it's all real and do you believe in
21:09 Jesus yep you do right cuz these two go
21:11 together the second or an atheist maybe
21:13 you got a chance of just oh but no
21:15 atheists have science as a religion so
21:17 [ __ ] you're screwed - this has to be
21:21 real because this is the usurpation of
21:22 man's capable
21:23 into my own heart but man does it than I
21:25 did it boom don't tell me I didn't do it
21:28 we're [ __ ] aren't we I think a lot of
21:32 you who watch the show you you're the
21:38 most awake people on planet Earth
21:40 because even if you're got a foot in
21:42 some of that stuff and a foot ins you
21:44 have a footing in the opposite direction
21:46 like you're you know you're not going to
21:48 be necessarily heartbroken like say
21:54 you're flat earther and you actually see
21:56 the photograph of Earth that's from one
21:58 of your legit sources and it's round and
22:00 you see the whole thing and it rotates
22:02 under 24 hours observation and then
22:06 you're like okay alright well I was
22:08 wrong you're not going to be destroyed
22:10 because you weren't irrational about
22:13 your devotion to a potential theory same
22:16 thing for the globe or I think if you're
22:20 on this show it means you're watching
22:21 this show I feel like you guys around
22:23 the show this your globe ER and geez I'm
22:28 a globe or I'm like spanning earth guy I
22:30 think it makes other sense but it's not
22:33 so I can hurt a flat earther it's just
22:38 if man if I found that the place was
22:40 flat you have to understand the level of
22:42 mind blowing that it's gonna happen in
22:44 my soul is going to be the best orgasm
22:48 I've ever had in my life to see the
22:50 places flat damn because you know me
22:52 I've I've run through every scenario I
22:54 can think of you know if it is flat then
22:56 what is it who owns it can I meet the
22:59 owners of a grey aliens or is a God on
23:01 the other side I music eyeball looking
23:03 down to the top of the firmament I don't
23:05 know I don't care it's all gonna be
23:06 great I mean I suppose if were truly
23:12 some slave you know it would only be
23:14 because you were told you were slave
23:16 that you would think this world is a
23:17 prison I guess but if they said yeah
23:19 yeah you know why the whole world is run
23:20 by evil reptilian bastards it's because
23:24 we control who's in charge and we have
23:27 put these people on top you know that
23:28 would piss us off and we want to break
23:30 down the wall and get out of here but I
23:31 assure you we probably can we'd have to
23:34 get away more clever not to escape
23:36 again my thing is that this existence is
23:39 merely something that we've had to
23:41 create because we live forever
23:42 reincarnation is not a religious thing
23:45 it is a ecosystem of our existence
23:48 that's what I believe
23:50 let's get back on to the subject of
23:52 instant truth
23:53 I guess the fundamental question is you
23:57 know well you might get like an academic
23:58 or something saying well you know it's
24:00 the best truth we can get ahold of man
24:03 okay yeah
24:05 probably is you know if we are to frame
24:07 the question with the serendipitous you
24:10 know chaotic nature of a society
24:12 creating itself from scratch then you
24:15 know that you know we didn't we didn't
24:18 have let's just say Adam and Eve was
24:19 real we don't have a situation where we
24:22 go okay
24:23 I'm Adam you're Eve you got any
24:26 parchment so we can write down what
24:27 happened here because if we don't start
24:30 writing it down I'm gonna start
24:31 forgetting what happened I mean we're
24:32 gonna live with nine hundred to a
24:34 thousand years we're gonna have hundreds
24:36 and hundreds of kids I'm gonna start
24:37 forgetting my own grandchildren's name
24:39 let alone my first generation kids Nev
24:42 is like being pregnant for the very
24:44 first time ever so we didn't write
24:47 anything down for a long time we didn't
24:49 have a methodology or the idea to do so
24:52 if we were ever caveman or Neanderthals
24:55 or the Homo sapiens sapiens was some
24:57 sort of new hybrid coming out of a
24:59 spaceship somewhere there's some
25:01 laboratory then it was probably feral
25:04 and weak up to a point and so we just
25:09 don't have the beginning we don't have
25:12 99.9% of man's history we don't I mean
25:17 even if we were to say okay we're gonna
25:18 we have found a perfect technique and we
25:21 go a little off the rails here for some
25:23 fun but if we were to go completely off
25:24 the rails or sorry see geez I'm lost my
25:28 soul apples there let's say we give
25:32 Scientology its wet dream and we figure
25:35 out a machine that can 100% accurately
25:37 connect to your soul and then
25:40 immediately looks up all your previous
25:41 lives and I mean it's a thousand percent
25:43 detail there's going to come a point in
25:47 the history of man it's going to go back
25:49 several tens of thousands of
25:50 years of the hundreds of thousands years
25:52 where were actually totally
25:53 communicating like intelligent beings
25:56 we're gonna have weird clicky clacking
25:57 languages probably but it's going to be
26:00 a normal get up get some water kill some
26:02 animals go harvest some fruits or
26:05 whatever screw a lot probably raise our
26:10 kids blah blah blah but there will come
26:13 a point we go back so far that man will
26:15 seem almost incapable being understood
26:18 because we're just going to be weird
26:21 feral beings again this is this is if we
26:25 weren't dropped off as a hybrid creation
26:29 of an alien they might have imbued us
26:31 with sort of some of the intelligence we
26:33 have today right it was an interesting
26:36 that we would go back to a point where
26:38 we simply couldn't discern the truth to
26:41 begin with now obviously when we're
26:44 talking about instant truth we're
26:45 talking about today's current events
26:48 what does America think what does Russia
26:50 think what does china think is Trump a
26:52 bad guy or good guy he's cute real or
26:53 fake as Hillary Clinton really a child
26:55 killer so these are the questions we ask
26:59 you know right now we are seeing in
27:02 America at least your traditional wipe
27:06 clean the slate of all these people who
27:10 committed massive treason with this
27:14 [ __ ] cue guy off to the side he's now
27:16 completely gone off the map since
27:18 they'll pass a shooting as of August
27:20 31st we don't know what's real and
27:26 here's what's interesting we don't
27:29 typically put forth a how do I say this
27:33 like there's no constitutional amendment
27:36 anywhere in the world that protects
27:38 truth right we say we have the freedom
27:42 of speech right to bear arms don't have
27:43 to house soldiers in your house there's
27:45 no ease dropping you don't
27:47 self-incriminate data all the way down
27:50 the line but at no point is to say if
27:54 you publish they used to be laws like
27:57 this after the big was it the gameshow
28:00 clue the United States
28:03 you know lied for years and
28:04 brought this guy up through the ranks by
28:06 telling him all the answers there was
28:08 some legislation passed that said you
28:09 can't lie on television people were so
28:12 pissed off propaganda is not allowed
28:14 well that was revoked you can lie you're
28:18 expected to lie it's your job to lie but
28:22 here's the thing we have this sort of
28:25 diabolical plan that's going on where
28:28 these two things are opposed to each
28:30 other which is let's just say that the
28:33 non propaganda legislation was
28:37 reintroduced if you get caught
28:39 pushing propaganda which is
28:40 unsubstantiated claims about a person
28:42 place or thing and there's a hitch to
28:44 that too you go to jail if you do it you
28:48 go to jail your news organization
28:50 organization doesn't get fined it gets
28:52 shut down instantaneously so if CNN's
28:54 caught doing it one time Fox gets doing
28:57 it gets caught doing it one time RT
28:58 whatever they're banned from the United
29:02 States of America all the employees have
29:05 to go find work someplace else wouldn't
29:07 that change the world but we have
29:11 opinion pieces so unless we put a little
29:14 little sentence on the end of that
29:16 legislation that says and it is not the
29:19 place of news organizations if you use
29:21 the word news you are legally forbidden
29:25 from having individuals express personal
29:28 opinions ever on your show so all these
29:31 op-ed pieces are gone you can create
29:33 another organization instantaneously
29:35 that is Fox opinions or or something but
29:39 you can't use the word news on it it's
29:41 an opinion piece channel that you can
29:43 just flip on you can find out with Bill
29:44 O'Reilly things and all the douche bags
29:49 from seeing in and debt it up but all of
29:51 them all these folks at how there are
29:52 pieces Rush Limbaugh is in there and Al
29:55 Franken's in there and they can just
29:56 talk all they want and it's a freedom of
29:58 speech zone they can do what they want
29:59 but it's not news and so then when an
30:05 individual wants to connect themselves
30:07 with something that is of truth
30:09 they can say I keep my mind straight
30:12 because there's a laws on the books
30:15 where there's if there's one
30:17 of telling the truth in a new zone he
30:21 lies this isn't impossible right but
30:24 they say look there's one area I go to
30:26 it's just news I don't look at op-ed
30:28 stuff so I keep those opinions out of my
30:30 paint or they say look I do go to the
30:33 Young Turks to find my reality and
30:35 someone's like oh really okay see you
30:39 later so you can see how difficult it is
30:44 well then if you had the news
30:46 organization let's dive into splitting
30:48 the hair here
30:49 it's important you're gonna have this
30:51 conversation with anybody and especially
30:52 with yourself we know they're all these
30:56 mass shootings that are organized by the
30:58 deep state they do they are there gasma
31:02 monetization and they they're obviously
31:08 reporting to the news let's just say
31:10 fake facts lies but who did what when
31:15 and how but they have organized for the
31:18 observers a fake shooter you know we got
31:22 this video these cops splash and fake
31:23 blood on their hands on a helicopter
31:26 shot I believe it's a helicopter shot
31:28 the guys push two cops in a cop car on
31:32 the right side of the passenger side of
31:33 the car splashing all this fake blood
31:35 and they got it all over the ground
31:37 they're smashing all over themselves so
31:39 one guy just runs off if they're in a
31:41 big hurry to get this done super fast
31:42 they're part of the Cabal and of course
31:45 Trump the big super Savior can't find
31:47 these guys and arrest them yeah yeah
31:50 we're in a big [ __ ] awakening here in
31:52 America give me a break
31:53 we're waking up but the government is
31:56 still organizing these things and
31:59 allowing them to occur we're just people
32:02 on the internet looking at these two
32:03 guys flesh and blood on themselves
32:05 where's the FBI
32:06 where's Trump but you're gonna take ten
32:08 months to get rid of this these two guys
32:10 know you raid their homes in the middle
32:13 of the [ __ ] night you put them in
32:15 prison for treason for the rest of their
32:17 lives and you go hey you know you're
32:20 gonna bars a [ __ ] until you start
32:22 coughing up some stuff and then maybe we
32:24 give you a ham sandwich but you're in
32:26 here for the rest of your life you chose
32:27 badly your kids they have no father
32:30 anymore tough [ __ ] man you wanted to
32:33 serve the deep state and welcome to
32:35 Gitmo none of that shit's happened none
32:38 of it and it never will so if you think
32:41 you're winning you're not you're not
32:43 winning
32:44 there's no mega arrests going on there
32:47 appeasing you with a bunch of arrests
32:48 here and there yeah a couple pedophiles
32:50 are getting picked up but new people are
32:52 going in their place a couple pedophile
32:55 servers go down well ten come up in its
32:56 place unless we have someone who is
33:00 willing to kick ass and take names and
33:02 not negotiate with the [ __ ] evil side
33:04 of the world and really really do what
33:09 needs to be done for society we're gonna
33:12 go right back to where we were and ten
33:14 levels deeper in four years six years
33:17 whatever results baby that's what you
33:22 need you don't hire an employee that
33:24 constantly tells you how great they are
33:26 how they're gonna fix all of your
33:27 problems internally of which you've
33:29 hired them to fix and then every day
33:34 nothing happens except they tell you how
33:35 bad the problem is they prove it to you
33:38 they prove them and it's even worse than
33:39 you thought and they bring up more
33:40 evidence and you're just kind of sitting
33:42 there as the legitimate employee and
33:44 you're like yeah when you're gonna fix
33:46 it and they just go trust the plan man
33:47 trust the plan I can't fix everything at
33:50 once we're sitting there going we'll fix
33:51 something oh I will yeah that little
33:54 tiny thing I fixed that you know I put
33:57 the cups back in the dispenser next to
33:59 the water bottle
33:59 yeah see I did some things yeah
34:03 not what I hired you for Thanks but we
34:07 you know go back to the idea that we
34:09 might pass the legislation that says you
34:11 can't lie anymore okay well then if you
34:16 can't have as a penalty of a felony an
34:19 imprisonment life in prison for telling
34:22 lies to the public representing yourself
34:25 as a news organization let's just say
34:26 we're able to get that passed then how
34:29 this is a military core of psyops get to
34:32 remain funded at god knows how many
34:34 billions of dollars every year fifteen
34:37 years ago I think it was 1.5 billion a
34:39 year to lie to the world of course they
34:42 tell you oh that's not to lie to him
34:44 Americans would really really reborn
34:47 yesterday seriously it is to ally to
34:50 Americans probably more so than to light
34:53 anybody else in the world these
34:56 organizations were formed right after
34:58 World War two it was really during World
35:01 War two but the organizations that were
35:03 formally funded came out of World War
35:04 two well what have we learned from World
35:06 War two
35:07 oh we learned how brilliant Joseph
35:09 gurbles was the king of propaganda boy
35:13 we were gonna smuggle a bunch of Nazis
35:15 into this country and not use them we
35:18 weren't gonna allow skullenbones to take
35:20 over our country and not use them the
35:24 Central Intelligence Agency was all
35:26 Skull and Bones for like 20 years the
35:28 top brass were all graduates of that
35:30 infiltrating anti-american pro-european
35:33 Pearl World Bank organization George
35:38 Herbert Walker Bush was the skullenbones
35:40 his son was the skullenbones john
35:43 kerry's the skullenbones our first
35:45 president was Taft he was the
35:49 skullenbones that's right well right
35:50 before we got the 16th amendment Woodrow
35:54 Wilson was just a nice guy he was a
35:55 history professor who was controlled by
35:58 these guys one after the other after the
36:02 other we got war war one world war two
36:03 Korean War Vietnam War Desert Storm 9/11
36:09 all that [ __ ]
36:11 the neo-cons and all these other
36:14 individuals deep States on both sides of
36:16 the fence they on both sides of the
36:18 fence because they do not go into a
36:19 negotiation of by which they don't
36:22 already have the results controlled it's
36:24 in every single you know Carnegie how to
36:28 run a successful business how to run
36:31 your life book control both sides of the
36:34 argument that's how you win and that
36:36 goes back hundreds and thousands of
36:39 years that whole idea but some people
36:43 might say well man you just need to
36:44 trust the plan man it does take a long
36:46 time to get all the stuff done mm-hmm
36:48 okay I also think it takes a little bit
36:51 of pressure from the citizens to say you
36:54 know what we're getting impatient and
36:56 you know what impatient should translate
36:57 to on
36:58 they're in we're ready we're ready for
37:02 change we're ready for these big things
37:04 to occur there's all these people that
37:07 people think are gonna get arrested to
37:09 again expose the truth
37:12 upgrade the truth by which we can draw
37:14 from to have a semblance or some idea of
37:18 an instant truth it's not gonna happen
37:21 look at the epstein situation what a
37:24 joke he's dead now
37:27 probably off on some island somewhere
37:29 but he's pronounced dead he's officially
37:31 dead you know again he they found him
37:33 dead in his prison cell and then they
37:35 have photographs of administering you
37:38 know oxygen to him and trying to revive
37:40 him well he's dead he's got a broken
37:43 neck he supposedly blew he's so
37:44 supposedly cold and you got photographs
37:46 of them trying to help them you don't
37:49 try to do that to a dead body it's dead
37:51 so it's all [ __ ] the guy's scot-free
37:55 somewhere scot-free people they gold
37:59 Trump Trump captured him and put him in
38:01 Gitmo yeah so that way the investigation
38:03 goes away because they now had to
38:06 legally get rid of his case against the
38:08 dead man look what can you do and now
38:11 what they're doing is they're dropping a
38:12 bunch of kind of light soft porn
38:16 photographs that they found in in his
38:19 Island to give you the idea that that's
38:23 all there is that's all there is there's
38:25 no children involved with this thing
38:27 there was no underground bunkers Q's
38:29 whole thing about telling you they got
38:30 all their surveillance because I got all
38:32 the cell phone communications from the
38:35 island and the NSA database whatever
38:38 meant you'll never see it and no one
38:42 responsible for it will be prosecuted
38:45 ever ever ever ever this whole thing was
38:48 a big wash I think if you want to get
38:51 back on the bandwagon a progress my
38:55 advice is don't trust the plan go online
39:00 and express yourself you know if you're
39:04 afraid to express yourself as who you
39:06 are that's fine just get your message
39:08 out somehow blog under some
39:11 sudonym you know just get the
39:13 information out comment on someone's
39:15 youtube channel or some other place that
39:19 you think is more secure [ __ ] shoot
39:20 everything is on [ __ ] you but let's
39:23 focus back towards an original statement
39:26 I made which is I think that instant
39:31 truth is a sign of cowardice of not
39:35 being able to deal with not wanting to
39:37 deal with whatever trauma might be on
39:39 the other side of truth and you know
39:43 again for children we don't need
39:45 children to understand what pedophiles
39:47 are not until they become adults and
39:52 then hopefully if we do our job as
39:54 parents and grown adults which there's a
39:56 hell of a lot more of us than them we
39:59 will have done our job and it will be a
40:01 case study in history instead of a this
40:03 is a current predator problem that we
40:06 have in the world so my son my daughter
40:08 when you start getting pregnant having
40:10 kids these are the creeps you need to
40:13 look out for and this is what we know
40:15 about them up to this point don't do
40:17 this don't do that don't serve your kids
40:21 milk cartons with little kids on the
40:23 side saying hey if you see me lately can
40:26 you imagine you know like they have
40:28 these movements to come around saying
40:30 don't drink milk drink milk that I don't
40:32 eat meat eat meat whatever and what if
40:35 you told the milk industry look as long
40:37 as your little cartons have pictures of
40:38 children on the side we're not buying
40:41 enjoy yourself and have them rip all
40:44 that crap off their little milk cartons
40:46 especially into a school district
40:48 insane insane you know it's just like
40:53 putting murder photographs on the side
40:55 of cereal boxes for adults to watch what
40:58 kind of world do we have who thought
41:00 that [ __ ] idea besides some Satanist
41:02 to Gasol so the truth is extremely
41:05 important to a human being who is awake
41:10 because we're we're trying to control
41:14 our lives right we're trying to be
41:16 successful in our lives both on a
41:17 personal emotional level in a external
41:20 business level with our families with
41:22 our friends
41:24 we're trying to live a good life but if
41:26 everything we base our life on is based
41:29 on a lie because we can't get the truth
41:31 and we might be offending someone
41:33 because we're quoting a lie with the
41:39 mass shootings it's crazy you have like
41:42 you have situation where we think that
41:45 in some cases no one died other cases
41:48 people really dying and so what if
41:51 you're accidentally cross pollinating
41:52 some of that stuff well nobody died at
41:54 this place but you were there and you
41:55 watched somebody's head get filleted by
41:57 a bullet and you're looking at this
41:59 person going oh my god yeah they did
42:02 with the Vegas shooting people really
42:06 died man
42:07 people really died man being this close
42:11 to Los Angeles it's not if you knew
42:15 someone who was there and saw the things
42:19 how many do you know and I mean just
42:22 just I'd say two or three degrees away
42:25 from me this dude who's close friends of
42:29 close friends you know he's like my
42:31 daughter got killed right in front of me
42:35 no parents to see their child murdered
42:37 or lose their child any circumstance
42:40 whatsoever you're supposed to die before
42:42 your children die this guy's in the
42:44 middle of a concert having a good time
42:46 in poof it's over and that wing of his
42:50 life and he dreams he thought he was
42:52 gonna have with this kid having kids and
42:54 having a full life he was a bunch of
42:57 lies that took that away from him I
42:59 don't know about you but I don't really
43:02 want to live in a world where it's sort
43:03 of like well what is truth anyway man
43:06 you know we can never find it because we
43:09 the people of this world equal to all
43:12 other people on this planet because of
43:13 the sovereign right that we get for
43:16 existing in this planet something the
43:18 Republican forces you don't really have
43:21 that you've got monarchs and you know
43:24 ahead of you in the line to get to God
43:27 and you've got bankers it's simply
43:29 because they have more fake units in a
43:31 bank a digital number in a bank and they
43:34 have possessions that we allow them to
43:36 control
43:37 through ill-gotten gains they're more
43:41 powerful than us they're higher than us
43:42 there is a class structure there is a
43:45 class structure everywhere at all levels
43:47 of discernment let's just say we were to
43:52 balance all the resources in the world
43:55 you know I don't mean to be getting into
43:57 some socialistic Pro socialistic
43:59 statement here but let's say we get to
44:01 Gene Roddenberry's world the perfect
44:03 socialistic world again it takes a lot
44:06 of IQ to get to that world which we are
44:09 thousands of years away from unless we
44:12 can come up with a matrix machine where
44:14 I know kung-fu in a split second but
44:17 once you have the same amount of money
44:19 as everybody else and your body's the
44:21 same shape as everybody else guys are
44:24 all one shape girls are all one shape
44:26 we're all good with it you can have the
44:28 fancier clothes you can have whatever
44:30 clothes you want whatever house you want
44:32 whatever car you want whatever you got
44:34 all the same possessions physical
44:36 characteristics now there's a problem
44:39 we're a class structure starts to become
44:41 an intellectual prowess thing how much
44:44 information that is accurate have you
44:46 memorized and can then intelligently use
44:49 to connect dots meaning you have an IQ
44:53 well someone's gonna have a higher IQ
44:55 than somebody else and there's gonna be
44:57 some event college business external
45:02 event where you're gonna be smarter than
45:04 someone else and someone else is going
45:06 to say you are have and there I have not
45:09 and they're gonna hate you because
45:11 you're smarter what can you do to become
45:13 dumb well we're gonna ice pick right
45:15 right between your eye we're gonna go in
45:17 there and rub around and scramble your
45:19 frontal lobe to make you stupid that'll
45:21 make you all like the rest of us who are
45:23 lazy [ __ ] and don't want to learn
45:24 anything then let's just say we balance
45:27 the IQs somehow right it's a magical
45:30 sauce we drink and boom we're all same
45:33 level of intelligence hopefully high
45:36 probably low then some people are gonna
45:38 be creative some people gonna be able to
45:41 pick up a guitar and write a song in two
45:42 seconds and sing in tune some people are
45:46 gonna create rocket ships and all kinds
45:49 of other stuff well
45:51 if you can't and we have built this
45:53 pussified society that says I get
45:55 everything you get then I guess you're
45:58 not allowed to be creative because it
46:00 makes other people feel uncomfortable
46:02 there's class structure everywhere sure
46:07 there is a gigantic problem but just the
46:09 concept defining truth in the first
46:11 place as the Big Lebowski says well
46:14 that's just your opinion man and that's
46:17 probably all we can ever have is our
46:18 opinion of something but then the one
46:22 added little layer we can put on top of
46:24 pretty much all the things that we
46:26 absorb as human beings would be what I
46:30 use to bring a group of people together
46:34 so say you have a roomful of super
46:38 extremist snowflakes maybe we have some
46:42 LGBT representatives in the room and
46:44 then we have the rest of your normal
46:48 meat-eating American kind of folks I'll
46:50 be talking about American subsets I
46:52 can't speak for any other country put
46:54 them all in the room and if they come in
46:56 through they get into a conversation and
46:58 they get into it from a party-line
47:00 perspective Democrat Republican LBGT
47:03 representation you know all the gender
47:05 stuff they're gonna argue like crazy
47:08 it's gonna get bad people are gonna want
47:11 to go to blows but if we say look let's
47:18 introduce the concept of common law in
47:20 the room and in common law as I always
47:23 say on this show is do no harm to
47:24 somebody else all right so I go off to
47:29 my Republican people first and I say
47:31 look do you wish any harm
47:33 on anyone else in this room do you
47:36 really want them to feel pain do you
47:37 want them to die no of course not I
47:40 don't know I just want a great world
47:41 okay good LGBTQ how do you feel oh you
47:45 know we want the same thing we just kind
47:47 of want to be left alone not prosecuted
47:49 persecuted you know not oppressed
47:51 because we have our gender
47:52 identification it's different than yours
47:55 go over to your extreme leftists what
47:59 are you trying to do with your socialism
48:00 well we want to have everybody feel good
48:02 and
48:03 okay great so under common law umbrella
48:07 I haven't had to fail yet it takes some
48:11 some work in conversation sometimes but
48:13 we all kind of get to the point of like
48:15 okay I got plenty of relatives that are
48:18 very very leftist okay so if I ask them
48:25 do you wish the world was more peaceful
48:28 and no Wars absolutely do you think that
48:31 people should be allowed to worship
48:32 whatever God that they believe in even
48:35 if you think it's silly yes of course
48:38 now of course there's obviously caveats
48:40 to all these answers which is but does
48:44 that form of belief cause harm to people
48:47 and they all have to kind of go well
48:50 yeah I guess it could be my belief
48:53 system that I came in the room with it
48:55 does get angry and violent at times I
49:00 think the most common are the most basic
49:03 definition of a half of a healthy
49:06 society would be a happy Society right
49:08 we don't agree on the cause-and-effect
49:10 models in the world for sure
49:13 you know we think that well some
49:17 historians will tell you that religion
49:18 has been the biggest death pool machine
49:23 that the world has ever had prior to
49:27 religion we simply had resource battles
49:31 you know you have the waterhole I don't
49:33 have the waterhole you've got the beach
49:34 I don't have the beach I'm starving
49:36 you're not so I need some of your stuff
49:38 need you to share it's alarming to have
49:42 someone come in and say I need your
49:44 stuff because I'm dying every time you
49:47 see a homeless person
49:48 it's a rough mental thing that occurs
49:52 because you're like well if this person
49:55 is truly down-and-out and willing to
49:56 work and participate in society then
49:58 they're probably the person you want to
50:00 give the money to help talk to whatever
50:03 and if you got the folks that you know
50:05 like the 18 year old silver spoon white
50:08 girl up in San Francisco choosing to
50:11 live on the street because she's just
50:13 too damn lazy to get in get an education
50:15 with all the
50:17 perfectly financed opportunities in her
50:18 life you have no sympathy for that
50:21 person I mean at least on the obtuse
50:23 level in the acute level you can say
50:25 well something went wrong something went
50:28 wrong that you got to be born into all
50:30 this opportunity
50:31 aka privilege and you're not taking
50:36 advantage of even a thimble of it and so
50:38 now you're burdening society with your
50:40 existence because you're incapable of
50:44 becoming a productive person it gets
50:47 rough really fast man
50:49 my personal belief about humanity is
50:51 that we are truly you know and I don't
50:55 mean this as a slam against mankind at
50:58 all I think our life is supposed to be
51:01 very chill I think we're supposed to be
51:04 just chilling out in our house there's
51:06 not supposed to be a job that's just
51:09 some arbitrary thing build rockets you
51:11 know solve accounting problems I don't
51:13 think NSF is supposed to exist at our
51:16 current level of development we have fed
51:18 ourselves a lie that we are
51:20 sophisticated and that has caused all
51:24 these paradigms to exist such as taxes
51:26 and you know wages and all this other
51:28 stuff that you're supposed to do to
51:30 exist in society so some people who want
51:34 to control us manifest these paradigms
51:36 because it is a control mechanism if you
51:38 had to pay taxes if I have to pay rent
51:41 I've got to go work and that forces me
51:43 to do something no the flipside the
51:46 argument is well we're trying to evolve
51:48 man's intelligence man's capabilities
51:50 and so this pressure is necessary if we
51:53 are to exist
51:54 probably not technically true but then
51:57 there'd be a lot of genocide of wars
51:58 because we would be fighting each other
52:01 for land as we continue to procreate run
52:03 out of space run out of resources if we
52:05 don't develop technology to to live up
52:08 and buildings and down into the ground
52:09 and you know put food inside you know
52:14 these greenhouses that can just spray
52:16 them spritz up you know a watermelon
52:19 with water every once in a while we're
52:22 gonna starve to death Society is an
52:25 extremely complicated thing so anytime
52:29 you hear these
52:30 instant truth paradigms that exist maybe
52:36 not even instant truth but you got to
52:37 stir the pudding a little longer kind of
52:39 truth you can't really get it one
52:43 because we allow folks to tell lies so
52:47 we let you throw this at you too little
52:49 esoteric but it will give get you a
52:51 little bit further down the road of sort
52:54 of potential solutions in this to this
52:56 problem so so if you're Christian that's
53:01 what I know most about I guess in terms
53:03 of organized religion there's this
53:06 there's this dream and this hope that
53:08 the second coming will happen that Jesus
53:11 did exist a long time ago he's gonna
53:13 come back and there's a couple different
53:16 philosophies of how that's gonna work
53:17 there'll be a thousand years of
53:18 prosperity on earth and then we all go
53:20 to heaven or we all go to heaven and I
53:22 don't know what happens the meat gets in
53:23 here at Earth while the rest of us go to
53:25 heaven I don't know but there's a
53:27 supernatural instantaneous fix that
53:30 people sit around hoping for and again
53:33 it happens about 45 and up for a
53:36 Christian who still devout they really
53:39 believe that everything is the end of
53:40 the world constantly because they don't
53:42 want to pay taxes anymore they don't
53:43 want to work anymore they're terrified
53:45 of their retirement and so it is scary
53:48 but what if the solution was Jesus comes
53:54 down he doesn't bring any angels with
53:56 him and we all you know he walks on
53:59 water he does all of his miracles but
54:02 one there's some people that will just
54:03 say screw that guy they just will no
54:06 matter how much he proves he's a magic
54:09 deity or whatever they'll just resist
54:12 the guy but let's just say that America
54:15 being mostly a Christian based society
54:18 elects Jesus to be President and Jesus
54:22 like okay I'm God I'm the son of God
54:25 either way I'm pretty knowledgeable
54:28 about things I know the truth to all
54:29 things but now Jesus has to legislate
54:33 the fixes into place so we can trust
54:37 everything that he comes up with the
54:39 house and the Senate just absolutely
54:42 pass everything that he proposes
54:43 hearings
54:44 please write a law about that they
54:45 develop it boom he signs it
54:47 he gets line out of veto power but
54:52 there's no more pork belly spending you
54:54 know you know there's no more bridges to
54:56 places that don't exist there's no more
54:58 of that stuff
55:00 so how would how would God fix the
55:03 problem through the system by which we
55:05 have established today mm-hmm you could
55:11 just see how utterly complex that is if
55:13 any of our foe enemies were to not
55:22 believe in him think he's a fake
55:24 then the wars are gonna continue so if
55:28 Christ came in here and said well we're
55:29 going to defund military instantaneously
55:31 because there shouldn't be any Wars I
55:33 didn't make you guys that you kill each
55:35 other you don't have the right to kill
55:36 each other which is why it's a global
55:39 law from the 10 commandments thou shalt
55:41 not kill okay it's a mess I mean you'd
55:44 have to have education be number one and
55:47 then education is gonna have to be
55:48 completely redone all the fake science
55:52 would just be instantaneously over well
55:55 is that easy what if you said you're not
55:58 supposed to work an eight-hour workday
55:59 you're not supposed to be up at some
56:01 desk at 8 o'clock in the morning trying
56:03 to think straight because I didn't build
56:05 your bodies to do that kids shouldn't be
56:07 in school all freakin day but if they
56:11 are there they're supposed to learn
56:12 something and so all this other stuff
56:14 they're learning this is don't teach
56:18 that teach this it's super complicated
56:21 super quick well if it would be that
56:24 tough for God to work through our system
56:26 someone who knows everything how could
56:30 he fix the truth of the history of this
56:33 world it's guy gonna sit around and you
56:36 know materialize history books I guess
56:37 I'd have to be the way it is a boom
56:39 there it is I put it on the Internet's
56:40 and a Wikipedia that's like Jesus pedia
56:43 and it is all true truth opee do if you
56:48 read it here it did happen
56:50 sorry dinosaurs and think about the
56:54 generation so let's just run it for just
56:56 a couple decades what
56:58 about the generations of boomers that
57:00 believe in all this crap we all believe
57:03 in some crap but each generation down
57:05 generation acts the Millennials the
57:07 Jin's ears whatever's after them they're
57:11 gonna hang on to their belief systems I
57:15 can't even imagine I can't imagine okay
57:19 going up to some of my relatives and
57:21 saying so what do you think 9/11 was an
57:25 inside job JFK was murdered by LBJ's
57:28 folks Nazis came into America and ran
57:31 the place bah Papa Papa whatever the
57:34 truth is right I can't imagine how their
57:38 brain would discern that it would be
57:40 Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet
57:44 self-destructing because the Morbius
57:46 told him to shoot the captain and he's
57:48 got a directive not the huge hurt human
57:50 beings and so he just sits there it
57:51 starts short-circuiting I would imagine
57:52 that would be half their brains we'd
57:56 have to have Jesus lay hands on people
57:57 to keep them out of insane asylums from
57:59 having to deal with the truth so what
58:02 does all this prove in the end well I
58:05 think it easily proves that we live in
58:08 absolute pure concentrated reinforced
58:11 fed chaos and if you ever metaphorically
58:16 slipped on ice walking outside never
58:19 ever in your lifetime something slippery
58:21 a wet floor and you're in those few
58:26 split seconds before you hit your ass on
58:29 the ground and you're thinking to
58:31 yourself this sucks I am completely and
58:36 utterly out of control I know how to be
58:38 in control I know how to stand on solid
58:39 ground and stand straight up and walk
58:41 fine but right now in this hysterical
58:45 loop I am a Warner Brothers cartoon
58:48 slipping and sliding and I can't get my
58:53 foot footing at all but you know you
58:58 could if you could just stabilize
59:00 everything well that's the world that is
59:04 the world so the idea has been that we
59:08 will infect society with the
59:11 with at least the mechanisms to think
59:14 for themselves to at least stay in a
59:17 neutral position until something takes
59:21 an unequivocal truth bias where it's
59:24 sort of like 1+1 always equals 2 and can
59:28 we use mathematics on in various
59:31 dimensions of thinking to say well we
59:34 know that that didn't happen you know
59:35 most of us look at 911 and we're like
59:37 well we don't know who exactly did it we
59:41 don't know how exactly they did it but
59:43 the official story defies physics so we
59:45 know that the official story is untrue
59:48 same thing with about every conspiracy
59:50 on planet earth the moon missions JFK's
59:53 murder MLK RFK Malcolm X I mean just one
59:57 after the other after the other things
59:59 don't make sense they don't make sense
60:01 but the official story tries to make
60:04 sense out of it using propaganda and
60:07 other lenient interpretations of the
60:11 truth then where we're kind of screwed
60:15 right that's why the most brilliant
60:18 people on earth who've had the
60:20 opportunity to study reality at its
60:22 finest detail always come out saying
60:24 well I learned I knew nothing and I
60:27 think it really comes down to truth is
60:30 perhaps just an idealistic perspective
60:35 of reality that is never attainable in
60:38 the current state of reality that we
60:41 choose to live in you know what's
60:44 interesting about dreams dreams
60:48 typically don't have mystery there might
60:52 be some things that you know something's
60:53 happening you're not quite sure what it
60:54 is but when you get around the corner
60:56 you look around and your brain because
60:59 it's controlling this this very dynamic
61:02 reality it's able to say well I'm the
61:05 creator of this reality is sort of what
61:06 you don't realize about what you're
61:08 thinking but it is true do you you do
61:12 know the truth for the most part inside
61:14 of a dream it's this sort of idealistic
61:18 haven that we're allowed to live in to
61:21 to test ourselves when we wake up to
61:25 compare realities and go you know what
61:27 this one is really weird like I'm in my
61:29 backyard that's what I know I'm making a
61:31 show that's what I know it's a sunny day
61:33 that's what I know right now there's no
61:35 Kim trills that's what I know so the
61:39 only thing that really exists that we
61:40 could have really any opinion about is
61:42 our little sphere of influence our
61:45 sphere of observational reality but you
61:48 know just like the psychology experiment
61:51 with the kids watching the murder biases
61:55 can easily take place especially if
61:57 traumas involved with the event
62:00 but now let's as we finish up this
62:02 episode let's let's take one of these
62:05 concepts that we've come up with and
62:08 it's reiterated in the conversation with
62:11 those who believe they have access to
62:12 instant truth let's say we have this
62:16 detail one-hour conversation with
62:17 someone who watches propaganda news and
62:20 thinks they've got the lockdown on it so
62:24 we say do you agree that we have no
62:30 grasp of reality really we have no real
62:32 grasp of the truth and it's done through
62:35 accidental inability to record history
62:38 or you know I mean we have no language
62:40 we have no written word up to the point
62:44 of allowing yellow journalism to become
62:46 certified as truth we finance to the
62:50 tune of billions of dollars
62:51 organizations that are literally geared
62:55 and chartered to lie to the people of
62:57 the world sometimes it's under the
63:00 pretense that you can't handle the truth
63:02 but whatever most intelligent people
63:05 would come to conclusion well yeah we do
63:09 sort of live in a BS planet you know
63:11 where we can't get access to the truth
63:14 and then it's like okay now what about
63:17 all that anger you have that's legit
63:19 it's inside you because dumb things are
63:23 happening around you what do you do with
63:26 that
63:28 I don't know I think we have to figure
63:31 out a way to live in the unknown 24/7
63:34 again you know the news reports murders
63:37 all over the world horrible horrible
63:39 things all over the world constantly
63:41 right because they're part of the drama
63:42 news drama news situation right they
63:45 want to traumatize you so you believe
63:47 all the other horse crap they have the
63:48 shove down your throat do I live in
63:50 sunny California sunny Southern
63:52 California let's just say do I really
63:55 need to know that a housewife murdered
63:56 another housewife in Kansas to steal her
63:58 baby out of her womb probably not
64:02 do I need to hear how many people got
64:04 killed in Chicago yesterday probably not
64:07 I don't live in Chicago nothing I do is
64:11 gonna affect local laws in Chicago
64:13 people in Chicago have to care about
64:15 Chicago they have to wake up and say we
64:18 don't want that anymore
64:19 la used to have massive gang fights in
64:21 the late 80s early 90s and I mean
64:23 massive shootings happen every single
64:26 day I used to drive to work and a guy
64:28 guys would drive to work with helmets on
64:32 which had like funny sayings on them
64:34 about you know don't shoot me or
64:36 whatever but we got rid of it everybody
64:39 got tired of it now the Midwest is taken
64:42 over for LA and they're trying to listen
64:44 all the gangster rap music and also the
64:46 crap that's glorifying death and guns
64:49 and drugs and women are [ __ ] and blah
64:51 blah blah so they're hanging on to this
64:54 Dallas Texas Austin Texas Chicago Kansas
64:58 City all these places in the Midwest are
65:00 trying to be the hardest to LA
65:01 impersonation they can possibly be when
65:02 we're out of it go talk to an LAPD and
65:05 say how bad is it now compared to a it
65:07 was the 90s and they're like man it's
65:08 nothing now I don't even remember last
65:12 time I heard about a drive-by shooting
65:13 in Los Angeles I'm sure they happen all
65:15 the time but not like they used to so
65:18 there is no such thing as instant truth
65:20 and the never has been outside of your
65:23 immediate circle of influence but you
65:25 know that we've all had mistaken facts
65:28 and our minds
65:29 I told an old story I'm gonna say it
65:33 again just in the episode it's a stupid
65:36 little story watching a movie with a
65:39 girlfriend
65:40 and we had bought it was a blockbuster
65:43 thing so rear-ended a couple movies and
65:46 we bought the candy at the store right
65:49 and we had some M&Ms peanut M&Ms in a
65:52 bag and we're obviously taking turns
65:54 because it's all up on the coffee table
65:56 or taking turns eating the peanuts and I
65:58 was the last one to visit the bag and I
66:00 part it out and I squeezed the back of
66:02 my hand
66:02 and I thought I had it you know
66:05 guaranteed myself there was no more
66:07 peanuts in the bag my girlfriend
66:09 five minutes later goes is there any
66:11 more opinions and I got the last one
66:12 sorry man damn I really wanted those
66:14 peanuts there's obviously an air show
66:18 going on I was unaware of sounds so huge
66:21 some jets flying around I can't see him
66:24 anyway movies over about to go to bed
66:28 and picking up all the trash and she
66:30 picks up the M&M bag and there were M&Ms
66:32 in the bag she's like dig Dean she's
66:34 like you you lied to me you said there
66:36 were no M&Ms left and I said oh man I
66:38 thought there weren't and of course it's
66:42 a funny moment between the two of us but
66:44 it taught me that even in my local
66:45 circle of influence I can be wrong about
66:48 something so easy it would have given
66:52 her pleasure to eat those two M&Ms that
66:54 were left in the bag but I blew it right
66:57 that's how easy it can be just to tell a
66:59 lie to be incorrect to assess facts
67:03 wrong and right in front of your face
67:05 keep that in mind next time you're so
67:08 sure about the truth I think that's all
67:14 I got about that topic hopefully that
67:16 was useful for your brain if you have me
67:20 - deep thoughts radio.com please go it's
67:23 all spruced up works on your phone works
67:24 on the web should remain that way until
67:27 I upgrade it again not going to make a
67:29 long bumper today there's all the
67:31 choices for video audio donating to the
67:33 page social media and of course the
67:36 remastered season one channel it's a
67:38 different Channel so until next episode
67:41 take care of yourself in someone else
67:43 and I'll see on the next deep thoughts
67:44 over now
