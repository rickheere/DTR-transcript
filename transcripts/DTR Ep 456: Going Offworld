00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today we are going to talk
00:34 about a subject that I think will
00:35 lighten the load of some of the more
00:38 intellectual / political things we've
00:40 talked about some of you might see the
00:43 title and you're thinking oh my gosh is
00:46 he talking about that and hopefully the
00:48 answer is yes which is going offworld
00:52 the first time I ever heard the phrase
00:55 going offworld ever communicated any
00:58 type of script was Blade Runner and then
01:02 I've recently started seeing it in other
01:05 series on prime and netflix and that
01:08 sort of thing and it's just an
01:10 interesting notion to live off world so
01:15 I'm going to divide everything up into
01:16 five categories and the fifth one is
01:19 actually to be integrated into the first
01:21 four which is first stage would be
01:26 living on the moon and I know for those
01:30 of you who don't believe space exists
01:32 and that sort of thing just go with me
01:34 on this because if it did exist these
01:37 are subjects we would want to talk about
01:39 movies and television shows do a fairly
01:42 decent job dramatizing it but they
01:43 really are on the hook for the emotional
01:45 arc of the characters you know what can
01:47 be displayed on camera whereas a novel
01:49 can get into all the science fiction of
01:51 the night the true science behind
01:53 something but even if I lived in a
01:57 matrix of some sort well at some point
02:00 we exist somewhere and so maybe this
02:05 conversation for you if you don't think
02:07 space exists is simply just a
02:09 conversation of any other place that's
02:11 out there now hopefully if we live in a
02:14 matrix wherever we end up going after
02:15 that is already well suited for Humanity
02:19 but the places I'm talking about
02:21 I don't think man has ever been ever I
02:25 don't think we've ever been to the moon
02:28 and go see my episodes on that just go
02:31 to deep thoughts radio.com and click on
02:32 space programs or NASA or whatever and
02:35 you'll see all those episodes
02:37 but after the moon would be conquered we
02:41 will get into a little bit of science
02:42 we're not gonna OD on you know the Van
02:44 Allen belts or something like that but
02:46 wool will take a pass but the other one
02:50 would be to live on something like Mars
02:51 right Mars if it has any inkling of what
02:56 we think it might be it's probably cold
02:58 as hell
02:58 I think NASA is faking everything about
03:01 Mars probably almost categorically if
03:06 they are able to get to Mars with
03:07 reconnaissance missions remember nASA
03:10 has barely ever failed putting a probe
03:13 on Mars whereas every other country
03:15 that's tried has almost ceremoniously
03:18 failed and again once they figured out
03:21 NASA was lying then anyone can lie and
03:24 and you know we never know who's telling
03:25 the truth anymore but I think Mars would
03:28 be a fairly decent stopping point to
03:30 actually get to another planet not a
03:32 moon there are large moons that circle
03:36 Jupiter that's quite a ways further out
03:40 there who knows if they're hospitable
03:42 who knows if they have an atmosphere we
03:44 could work with whether or not it's just
03:46 so Furyk acid floating around in the
03:48 atmosphere could you imagine that you
03:49 land and your whole ship just starts to
03:51 disintegrate then it would be us
03:55 traveling to another solar system within
03:57 our galaxy which is a pretty big place
03:59 so then we have basically no empirical
04:04 data and we're going to need to know a
04:05 lot of information very quickly which
04:07 requires a bunch of technology to be
04:10 able to do that and then of course the
04:15 fourth and final stage outside of our
04:18 fifth which is going to be inserted in
04:19 all these would be to leave our galaxy
04:22 and go to another galaxy it seems a
04:25 little absurd that we would need to go
04:27 to another galaxy because in our
04:29 lifetime of humanity it would take you
04:33 know theoretically hundreds of millions
04:35 of years for us to dominate every planet
04:38 that could be an in one class planet in
04:39 our own galaxy before we would need to
04:42 go anywhere else but you know maybe even
04:45 star trek doesn't play with anything
04:47 outside of the galaxy they divided the
04:49 galaxy into sectors and
04:51 quadrants and all that stuff so it's
04:55 interesting to note that most of the
04:58 science fiction interpretations of
05:00 living off world have to do with you
05:05 know it's sort of divided down the
05:06 middle there's this prosperous hey it's
05:09 great where everyone else is living but
05:12 in most cases they talk about you know
05:16 having some sort of job out there you're
05:18 mining some big asteroid somewhere and
05:21 it's a tough place it's like Deadwood
05:23 and I think it would be for a while
05:27 think about it you leave the world with
05:29 all the law and order plus taxation and
05:32 penalties and then if you're a nut case
05:35 you're on earth you're gonna do whatever
05:38 you can to get off this planet so you
05:40 can go do what you can never do here
05:42 which is potentially maybe some good
05:45 stuff like you create a nice little um
05:47 log cabin somewhere or it could be that
05:51 you're trying to rape and pillage
05:53 somewhere else
05:54 like all the you know well I should say
05:57 the very few immigrants we get from
05:59 other countries that happen to do that
06:01 and I'm sure ours go across and do the
06:03 same exact thing and the reason why I
06:05 think this episode will be interesting
06:07 is that we do have an amalgamation of
06:10 tons of shows and again some films that
06:14 have tried to address this like Star
06:17 Trek for one is probably the most
06:19 exhaustive exercise in offworld living
06:24 that has ever been created by mankind
06:26 and it we were fortunate that was
06:29 created by a guy named Gene Roddenberry
06:31 and again I have a whole Star Trek
06:33 episode I believe in season two but am I
06:37 even in season one the second half but
06:39 it talks about the Gene Roddenberry
06:40 world so let's set the foundation here
06:45 who would be going off world and who
06:47 would be financing it how would this
06:50 technology get there let's say again the
06:52 gloves come off we deprecate all these
06:55 fakes space organizations with very few
06:58 people but some very important people go
07:00 behind bars or at least get sort of that
07:04 Scarlet Letter around their neck that
07:06 says hey I lied about everything so
07:10 there'd be two different types of
07:11 organizations you would have your your
07:14 banker controlled world where they're
07:18 going to try and do exactly what they
07:20 did when they founded America which is
07:22 to create another extension of their
07:24 tyranny someplace else then you're going
07:28 to have the other option which is
07:30 they've all been eliminated and we've
07:33 put very strict and you know processes
07:37 in place such that whoever gets allowed
07:39 to go and create these worlds would be a
07:44 stable individual but here's what I
07:47 think regardless of who's gonna do what
07:51 because we will continue to give those
07:54 two scenarios of how the bad people
07:56 would do it and how the good people
07:57 would do it one of the most fundamental
08:00 concepts in a tort type of space
08:02 exploration is the notion of a probe
08:07 it's so cold out here
08:08 it looks like I'm smoking their every
08:10 breath I assure you it's not but the
08:15 probes go out into space and they have
08:17 infinite fuel for the most part they
08:20 would have to have some sort of sensor
08:22 array to be able to pick up on bodies in
08:28 space that seemed to resemble what we
08:30 need as human beings they're going to
08:34 look for gravitational readings such
08:39 that it's not too light for us such this
08:41 is not too heavy for us it's gonna look
08:43 at atmosphere it needs to look at life
08:45 indigenous life it needs to separate
08:48 plant from animal it probably once it
08:51 gets into the animal kingdom it should
08:54 comb through all the phylum class order
08:57 tables to see know is there an insect
09:00 that's formidable to man is there a
09:03 rodent formidable demand is there a
09:04 giant hyena
09:06 that's formidable are there other
09:08 intelligent beings and so we would have
09:12 to create a probe that is sort of
09:15 combing like SETI
09:17 everywhere goes but I'm getting ahead of
09:21 myself we need some technological
09:23 breakthroughs don't we well with the
09:26 probe technically speaking as long as
09:29 it's insulated properly and as long as
09:31 we have the technology to move it
09:32 through space the Van Allen belts would
09:36 probably be the only thing that we need
09:38 to insulate it against because all other
09:39 bodies in space also have vanilla belts
09:41 and let's just say it's not only out
09:44 there to register things that are in one
09:46 class planets meaning earth-like planets
09:49 Gaia class planets right but it's also
09:52 in it to explore everything else that it
09:55 finds unless of course we have some
09:57 impending doom here on earth that we
10:00 need to hurry up and get to another
10:02 location in terms of propulsion systems
10:06 well obviously fuel systems in terms of
10:09 some sort of combustible fuel that's
10:12 probably well it's debatable whether it
10:15 works in a vacuum or even in blank space
10:18 which has plenty of ether particles
10:21 moving everywhere but it's a limited
10:23 fuel supply no matter what so that's not
10:27 gonna work we cannot explore space
10:29 deeply with fuel based systems the whole
10:33 idea that we're going to go to Mars
10:35 ok and anytime soon and come back it for
10:40 me is completely laughable because
10:41 you're going to have to take with you
10:43 all of the fuel to get home and that's
10:47 risky as hell because anything happens
10:50 to it on the way over I think most folks
10:52 that dig into any type of propulsion
10:54 system that has a sustainable design in
10:58 space one gets to sort of whether or not
11:02 they use the proper words to describe it
11:04 they're going to have to come up with
11:06 some infinite fuel system which is
11:08 usually some system based off of you
11:12 know again like some atomic property in
11:16 an element that is constantly renewable
11:18 with very little stimulation this tiny
11:23 kernel can stimulate enough energy to
11:27 essentially achieve infinity
11:29 again I think Bob Lazar has done an
11:31 amazing job at describing what could
11:34 work at least in theory and for those of
11:37 you are familiar with his thing
11:39 he's come up with this plan where if one
11:44 takes element 115 which is not a
11:46 naturally occurring element in the
11:49 periodic table it's something that we
11:50 would have to synthesize if you
11:53 stimulate it and you hook it up to
11:54 various components his theory is that it
11:59 will exacerbate in my opinion the ether
12:03 orbits of ether winds around it and fuel
12:07 and this is his terminology an
12:09 antimatter engine which you know
12:13 honestly if you could create minut
12:15 amount of antimatter and then converted
12:17 into energy that minut amounts
12:19 converting constantly would provide a
12:21 tremendously efficient engine if one
12:25 gram of antimatter is calculated to be a
12:28 43 Megaton bomb then wow that's pretty
12:33 amazing so imagine just creating
12:35 infinitesimally mounts of this stuff
12:37 nano sized amounts of the stuff to
12:40 create a constant wave of
12:44 electromagnetic energy that creates a
12:47 gravity bubble around your ship thus
12:51 moving anything away from the ship
12:54 that would push it and pull it in any
12:56 one particular direction thus giving it
12:59 the capability of reaching phenomenal
13:01 speeds in the vacuum of space which in
13:04 our definition of vacuum of space it is
13:06 a vacuum of potentially high order
13:10 atomic energy high inter high order
13:13 atomic matter at best you have the waves
13:16 of photonic energy moving through space
13:20 which won't metabolize in your eyeball
13:22 until it hits an atmosphere to turn into
13:25 light but it's still out there now I
13:29 have an episode on building a UFO it's
13:32 actually fairly important I think I have
13:35 an episode on anti-gravity which will
13:37 help you out with this whole thing
13:38 talking about the actual ships design
13:41 but now the ships that we're talking
13:44 could be little tiny ships that are
13:48 little probes and so they simply do they
13:50 don't have to house human beings so they
13:52 can be utterly packed with equipment now
13:55 a probe is going to want to be as
13:57 protected as possible from debris flying
14:00 around in space because it will get
14:02 pummeled at some point and we want this
14:04 thing to be so utterly invincible we
14:07 would we would try to give the probe as
14:09 much of a three-dimensional sensory
14:13 capability to make sure that if
14:15 something's coming at it you can do tiny
14:16 little coarse adjustments to get out of
14:18 the way but at some point it's probably
14:20 going to run to something large that's
14:22 coming at it so quickly or multiple
14:25 objects just like the game asteroids
14:26 when you were a kid where you're gonna
14:28 have to shoot one shoot through it right
14:32 our vehicle they simply need to be able
14:35 to be hit by it without suffering any
14:39 damage and with certain types of force
14:41 fields they could temporarily turn on
14:44 using more of whatever engine system
14:47 that we have there's a technical
14:49 capability it could bounce off something
14:51 as a rule borrowed from Star Trek the
14:58 prime directive which for those of you
15:01 didn't watch Star Trek it's all about
15:03 the fact that there are rules about
15:04 contacting outside societies about
15:07 disturbing a planet that you have no
15:09 intention on actually living in or do
15:11 anything with even if it is ripe for
15:13 your taking we don't want to shoot an
15:17 asteroid in half create two asteroids
15:19 and then one flies over and lands on
15:22 some city somewhere killing billions of
15:24 people right so there might need to be a
15:28 tremendous amount of course planning by
15:32 the probe especially as it starts to
15:34 exceed our knowledge of the solar system
15:37 right we know about the solar system we
15:39 know very little about anything else
15:41 that's out there and so the journey
15:44 between here in Alpha Centauri which is
15:46 rumored as a binary star system you need
15:49 two suns that circle each other there
15:53 might be a lot of stuff flying between
15:55 us and and it most
15:57 likely definitely would be if space does
15:59 exist the way capitals as science says
16:02 right but what if we could do little
16:05 jumps you know from here to the moon
16:08 okay
16:09 probes being tested it finds that all
16:12 the soil samples finds out its overall
16:15 weight and mass its doing it all by
16:16 itself with zero slate you know results
16:21 table we might know all this stuff
16:22 already but it's it has to be burdened
16:25 with finding it all out by itself and so
16:28 it makes a quick jump over to Mars and
16:30 again with our new propulsion systems
16:33 all of the anomalies and lies of this
16:36 current space program no longer become
16:37 of any concern to us because it can stop
16:40 on a dime you can get into orbit it can
16:44 speed up to however fast the planets
16:45 going it doesn't have limitations
16:48 well we'd make the thing jump probably
16:51 all the way out to Pluto and then you
16:54 know there's some rumored bodies out
16:56 there beyond Pluto and that's where it
16:58 would start to look it would have the
17:00 most advanced optics in existence from
17:04 humanity it might use a camera that is
17:09 reading you know that ultraviolet wave
17:12 that we have off of the universe in
17:15 general as a backdrop anything that's
17:18 blocking it and that takes picture after
17:20 picture after picture after picture and
17:22 it's seeing something move blocking the
17:25 blue screen basically that it could
17:27 create by studying various ultraviolet
17:29 x-ray light and then it starts to make
17:33 estimates it starts to look for other
17:36 debris and then it tries to create the
17:39 quickest trip between where it is and
17:42 where that other planet is or with the
17:44 other body and spaces and the reason why
17:47 it would try to make the quickest path
17:49 or the quickest you know speed from
17:54 point A to point B is to avoid more
17:56 random stuff that be introduced into the
17:58 equation the longer that you wait now
18:01 let's just say for the sake of argument
18:04 that he gets to Pluto and to
18:09 to get Pluto in your brain in terms of
18:12 how far away that is based on again what
18:15 we've been told
18:16 and I understand you roll your eyes but
18:18 go with this because it's kind of fun if
18:22 the Sun was a 10 inch basketball right
18:26 here in my lap again the earth would be
18:29 about 36 feet that way and it'd be one
18:31 third of the size of a period on a piece
18:33 of paper I believe of basketballs ten
18:37 inches in diameter but Pluto would be
18:40 about 500 miles from the North Pole
18:41 that's how far away Pluto would be from
18:45 this ball what's in my lap so safe to
18:49 say that whatever is out there beyond
18:51 Pluto could be a whole nother eight
18:54 thousand miles in that direction
18:55 relative to the ten inch ball that would
18:57 be the Sun but the chances are that we
19:00 have a big heavy orbital body out there
19:03 is probably very slim so if our Charter
19:06 for our probe is to find things that are
19:09 in one class planets similar to the
19:13 diameter of Earth for the sake of
19:14 gravity and obviously needs to be
19:17 analyzed to see if it has life on it
19:20 then our probe could simply deprecate
19:22 all of these other bodies in space and
19:28 simply focus on the ones that are better
19:30 closer more accurate to what we need now
19:34 you have seen this would be so funny if
19:36 someone would create this this vehicle
19:39 because you've seen you know hundreds of
19:42 articles all over the web over the last
19:45 twenty thirty years but in the last five
19:47 years it's gotten insane where they're
19:48 talking about having found you know
19:50 three dozen in one class planets or
19:55 potential candidates right now the real
19:58 question would be is there a limitation
20:02 to how fast something can travel in
20:04 space now let's just rewind a little bit
20:09 to the old experiment to find this stuff
20:13 called ether again the most brilliant
20:16 scientists in the world based all of
20:18 their inventions off of it and then
20:21 like my last episode which is why I'm
20:22 putting this out here I don't know if
20:23 I'm gonna do this sequentially but then
20:25 it started getting all polluted and they
20:27 took ether out of the mix okay but ether
20:31 is registered speed moving through the
20:34 universe is 50 times the speed of light
20:37 that'd be a 50 warp engine that's damn
20:42 fast I think what is it the fastest Star
20:47 Trek Enterprise was something around 11
20:50 I think maybe up to 13 there's some
20:53 theoretical models out there and I can't
20:54 remember what the one that little bullet
20:57 that was parked at deep space 9 but that
20:59 was SuperDuper fast as well but that
21:03 starts to become almost a believable
21:04 threshold at some point you can't exceed
21:09 how fast ether moves through the
21:11 universe you simply can't do it the
21:13 fabric of the universe doesn't move that
21:15 fast
21:16 now they have again theoretically
21:20 theorized okay Einstein Rosen bridge
21:23 technology or theories I should say they
21:27 have theorized folding space they have
21:31 theorized black holes wormholes which
21:35 are essentially einstein-rosen bridges
21:37 but einstein-rosen bridges I stained
21:39 Rosen bridges I'll say that a bunch of
21:41 times is really the concept of
21:45 interdimensional travel or dimensional
21:48 travel I should say on the other half of
21:50 that is another dimension
21:53 cue the beastie boys so you know when I
21:57 look at the theories of ether and I
22:00 review these legacy theories of warped
22:04 space and time well there's some truth
22:09 to it with ether in that ether because
22:12 it displaces itself and creates negative
22:14 pockets of pressure which is what we
22:17 call gravity the push gravity then you
22:22 would get around a large body in space a
22:25 three-dimensional distortion of the path
22:28 of how ether moves around itself
22:33 itself being the earth itself being an
22:35 atom's core if an atom truly has any
22:39 semblance as to what we've had on paper
22:41 well again you know electro we're
22:44 magnetism is the orbital ether
22:46 dielectric is the ricocheting ether and
22:48 as they hit each other in those two
22:51 paths it creates this cloud which we
22:53 call Lucknow electromagnetism and the
22:55 uke electricity okay that's really the
22:59 basics of it well if you were to see
23:01 that in 3d space and track all the
23:03 electrons then you would definitely see
23:05 this distortion you would so the real
23:10 question starts to present itself which
23:13 is could there be bodies in space so
23:16 large and you know again if you've
23:18 watched any Science Channel that shows
23:19 you how small our Sun is compared to
23:21 other Suns now let's just say they got
23:24 the math correct just for the sake of
23:26 argument that there are Suns that are a
23:28 thousand times as big as our Sun all
23:31 that means is that it's negative
23:33 pressure for anything that gets close to
23:36 it's gonna be pretty vacuous rights I
23:38 mean it's gonna be vacuuming everything
23:40 towards itself our little ship we just
23:44 have to work a little bit harder to
23:46 always get around this stuff but again
23:49 as long as our ship could create that
23:52 negative gravity pocket on whatever side
23:54 of the ship it needs to create in order
23:57 to move in that particular direction as
23:59 bob lazar I think accurately described
24:01 his design it turns its bottom part of
24:05 the disk and flies actually towards a
24:08 body in space at the bottom of the craft
24:11 that's pretty brilliant based on his
24:14 design through you antimatter engines
24:17 just push themselves into a little
24:18 pointed triangular pyramid shape
24:22 internally and then poof it goes in that
24:24 direction but the ship design that Bob
24:27 always talks about what's extremely
24:30 primitive if you really think about it
24:31 if we wanted to create something that
24:33 didn't have to occupy be occupied by any
24:36 living creature then you can put
24:38 antimatter engines around it like a
24:40 tetrahedron a 20-sided die or something
24:43 right and you could just fly that ball
24:45 on any direction you need to go
24:46 you can keep most of them off most the
24:49 time until you needed them until you're
24:52 right up against a big big star you want
24:55 to make a pass by it but in terms of
24:59 folding space so intently intensely that
25:02 you think you're going to punch through
25:03 the fabric of space to go to the other
25:05 side
25:07 it might work well I would say this much
25:10 any anomaly that we've ever seen in
25:12 water is anomalies are anomalies that
25:15 exist in space with ether dictating how
25:20 water actually ends up behaving and so
25:23 because ether creates water ether
25:26 creates itself it can either creates the
25:27 fabric of the universe and so it's it's
25:30 fairly theoretically possible that you
25:33 might get some different movements now
25:36 whether or not you can duck dive a wave
25:38 in space I don't know you know if you
25:42 punch through supposedly with your
25:44 vehicle and you enter a place out there
25:47 in the universe where there is no ether
25:50 for whatever reason then you cease to
25:52 exist most likely at least for a time
25:55 right I think it's probably I don't know
26:00 the notion would be that you would have
26:02 to create the hole yourself with a
26:05 tremendous amount of push energy to say
26:08 okay I'm gonna take all this ether that
26:10 I am made of and I'm gonna pull it with
26:12 me so that I have the constant
26:14 replenishing source of the ether
26:16 particles that I need to exist
26:18 personally as the probe and get it to
26:20 the other side before it runs out and I
26:23 don't think there's any way to calculate
26:24 that if space is folded most likely what
26:29 would occur is that you would simply go
26:31 on the outside of the curve just like a
26:33 kid going on a slide that's bouncing up
26:36 and down you have to obey the design of
26:39 the fabric of the universe in order to
26:42 be there but if it could swivel and
26:45 create a little vortex or whatever which
26:47 technically could be possible then you
26:49 might find yourself capable of traveling
26:52 SuperDuper quick now what is unclear is
26:58 the experiment that
27:00 Tesla and everyone between he and
27:03 Faraday Faraday's you know Perry was
27:07 born in the late 1700s and died in the
27:09 mid-1800s
27:10 you've got Tesla born in the latter half
27:14 of the 1800s dying in the middle of the
27:16 1900s but they both had the same results
27:20 but if they're simply studying ether as
27:23 were in relation to our existence here
27:25 on earth maybe the constant norm speed
27:28 of ether is around 50 times the speed of
27:31 light but imagine this imagine that
27:35 there is a well to say that there's a
27:38 whole array of movement of ether in
27:43 space due to all of the colliding forces
27:45 out there that it does vortex and go
27:49 much faster
27:50 just like water is pretty still on the
27:53 top when you pull the drain out it's
27:54 still pretty slow until it gets down
27:56 into that spiral man it goes nuts so
28:00 maybe that would help us travel a little
28:01 faster here and there but then again
28:03 you're talking about if we can't create
28:07 the vortex ourselves which maybe we
28:09 could come up with an engine
28:10 configuration where we would actually do
28:11 that I'm going towards hyperspace wait
28:14 one side then if we just rely on native
28:19 movement out there then we're gonna be
28:23 basically slaves to whatever's going on
28:26 since we have never traveled space ever
28:30 at least at this level we don't know we
28:35 don't know what's out there if the
28:38 pictures of spiral galaxies are truly
28:40 real and not some artist's rendering
28:42 that sold to the public as real then
28:46 there is a very electrical looking
28:50 object in space all these electrical
28:52 cosmologists say hey man the universe
28:54 rotating and spinning like that looks
28:56 very electrical well it's getting
29:00 together and it's starting to do the
29:01 rangering thing right it's starting to
29:03 do the bathtub drain right there in
29:05 space with trillions and quadrillions
29:07 and whatever amount of stars hmm but
29:13 down imagine
29:14 that we have this amazing power system
29:17 this infinite cough [ __ ] if you will and
29:21 we know that for at least a certain
29:25 distance in space based on souping up
29:28 this engine which could be massive I
29:30 mean we could make a spaceship the size
29:33 of Rhode Island you know I mean we could
29:36 do something massive in space but every
29:40 may be the size of Kansas I don't know
29:43 but it has in it this multiplier
29:47 exponential engine in it they can do at
29:50 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 it just
29:52 gets up to damn near infinity and then
29:55 it could look deep into space and say ok
29:59 I want to be way over there and I want
30:01 to be there fast how do we get it done
30:04 well it might be able to with advanced
30:08 knowledge of ether forget to bring the
30:10 stuff back in the classroom would be
30:12 nice so we could study it
30:15 imagine that we create the wave we
30:19 create the wave that is inside the drain
30:22 at the sink when you pull the plug out
30:24 eventually I mean have you ever done
30:26 this you create one of those little
30:28 tornadoes when you were a kid you know
30:29 you're just playing with the water and
30:31 you see all the sudden the eye of the
30:33 storm in the middle of that that little
30:36 vortex that goes down and you stuck your
30:38 finger straight down in the center and
30:40 you realize first what's second none of
30:43 the water was touching your finger even
30:45 though you might be a an inch deep
30:46 inside of the sea level that is your tub
30:49 that is in your sink ok so let's take
30:54 that take that physical model which
30:56 should exist in space somewhere made of
30:59 ether take the plane that is the normal
31:02 sea level of your bathtub or your sink
31:04 and pull it up so it's perpendicular to
31:07 your face to your ship wherever
31:09 whichever direction it likes to drive in
31:11 maybe it's the bottom of the ship
31:12 according to bob lazar and here comes
31:16 this massive dam near infinite amount of
31:20 electromagnetic energy which is perfect
31:25 for controlling ether particles because
31:27 electromagnet
31:28 Tizen is like a rope penetrating this
31:32 this soup that is the water that is
31:36 ether that is space and it just hits it
31:41 really hard and starts to create this
31:43 this vortex it's very similar to you
31:47 know most of the space travel that we
31:50 see in sci-fi shows where you have this
31:51 tunnel you know and the enterprise is
31:55 going down the tunnel and everything is
31:56 coming by you and it's all circular you
31:58 know what that makes complete sense
32:01 they're creating the lack of of
32:08 obstacles in front of themselves by
32:10 creating this vortex now what probably
32:12 doesn't pan out is that you would need
32:13 something to propel you forward so you
32:17 need to leave all of the ether behind
32:19 you alone that is going to be pushing
32:21 you and get this thing to drag you
32:24 forward or maybe it's slightly smaller
32:26 than your ship and those outer rims are
32:29 just tossing you straight down and if
32:31 you didn't have an inertial dampers
32:32 you'd be splattered inside the vehicle
32:35 as its spun infinitely fast but with
32:38 inertial dampers it creates a relative
32:41 calm perfect universe inside your ship
32:44 so there's a little bit of Technology
32:47 now let's talk about the psychology of
32:49 some of this stuff living off world hmm
32:54 well if you talk to anybody who's moved
32:57 to Hawaii in their lifetime from the
32:59 mainland they will tell you that there's
33:03 the syndrome called LAN Locke syndrome
33:04 and manavas I thought that that started
33:10 really quickly maybe in six months or
33:13 something like that it actually doesn't
33:15 typically start until about two years
33:17 people realize well the islands alone so
33:20 big oh ah who's 40 by 30 and it's really
33:23 very civilized as everything you'd ever
33:25 want a little expensive here and there a
33:28 little cheaper sitting there in depend
33:29 on where you're from so now we have to
33:31 start doing mathematics which we're not
33:33 going to do on the show here but wait to
33:35 start figuring out how long you'd have
33:36 to be in space an ass has done a lot of
33:39 deprivation
33:41 tests they you know they built cities
33:43 under the ground or people volunteer to
33:46 go in for a couple years and they found
33:49 you know some of very interesting things
33:51 that humans do especially when you can't
33:53 see the Sun you know supposedly we've
33:55 had you know Russian astronauts in orbit
33:57 for damn near two years and they come
34:00 back all messed up their bone is you
34:03 know and their muscles of atrophied our
34:06 ship would definitely have gravity
34:08 inside the ship would be problem with
34:11 that but imagine that you're going to a
34:17 location now we all know that when we
34:21 explore somewhere were really on the
34:25 cusp of everything that we've ever
34:26 discovered in terms of how to maintain
34:29 our life outside of where we natively
34:32 are right so imagine everybody practices
34:36 on the moon first then they get advanced
34:40 up to Mars and they have to pass get the
34:44 past the psychological test that says
34:45 you're used to the earth and now you're
34:48 never gonna potentially ever see it
34:50 again in your lifetime and someone has
34:53 to pay for your trip unless this stuff
34:55 is just effortless you build a ship
34:58 which could definitely be the case you
35:00 could build a ship with an infinite
35:02 level of energy because we're using
35:04 anything but fuel it's something that
35:07 naturally exists which is why I like Bob
35:09 Lazar see element 115 story because it's
35:12 just there it doesn't run out for [ __ ] I
35:15 don't know millions and millions years
35:17 with infinite energy you know the amount
35:19 of incredible a Lloyd's we could create
35:24 and alloys and metals and what-have-you
35:26 would be tremendous again I like my idea
35:28 of creating a Faraday a Faraday fabric
35:31 so that you can fly anywhere in the
35:33 universe and not only do you not get
35:35 eaten up by the electromagnetism that
35:37 you might run into like a Van Allen belt
35:39 either of earth or wherever you're going
35:41 but if you were to create the skin of
35:44 the ship in a particular geometric shape
35:47 we could route that energy to our liking
35:51 directly into the engines thus
35:54 not using our 115 maybe we'd never have
35:57 to do that but we could use it if we
35:59 wanted to store it up if we can store it
36:01 up it sounds a little dangerous
36:03 it sounds a little unnecessary if we
36:05 could create our infinite power source
36:07 but I know that there are satellites
36:10 that tap into this right now that's the
36:12 old experiment that many of you have
36:14 seen NASA you know releasing this giant
36:17 cable outside of the space shuttle then
36:19 it popped off and started floating and
36:21 that's when everyone saw those UFO discs
36:22 flying around it could simply be that we
36:26 tap into a Van Allen belt around a
36:29 particular body in space simply just to
36:31 get a little bit of a boost it just kind
36:33 of gets us away from the planet whereas
36:35 this thing would normally trap us on the
36:38 planet because of its radioactive nature
36:40 we're just metabolizing that into a
36:42 giant boost so that the negative wave
36:44 that we put out in front of our ship
36:46 that causes us to go into the hole is
36:48 SuperDuper powerful it's it's so big we
36:51 just start falling into it now whether
36:52 or not you need any more than an inch on
36:55 the outside of your ship if you just
36:57 sustained an inch of a void around your
37:00 ship in one particular region of the
37:01 ship it would seem like that's enough
37:03 just to get you pushed into that
37:04 direction as long as the void continues
37:06 to exist on that side of your ship but
37:10 there would be a generation that would
37:12 be your first explorers your settlers as
37:17 civilization would say and they're going
37:20 to have to be those kind of people very
37:23 nomadic very unattached to anyone on
37:26 earth and very unattached to earth
37:29 itself yeah maybe they're sociopaths
37:32 maybe they're more dry reptilian minded
37:36 people to just simply look at everything
37:37 as a scientific equation they've never
37:39 gotten into society they don't like
37:41 anything on earth they don't hate
37:42 anything on earth they just don't
37:44 necessarily have any preference but then
37:47 you might have a planet that we might
37:50 get to that is it's not developed no
37:55 matter how we might Index it let's just
37:57 say you have a planet that is covered in
38:00 rust
38:00 like they say Mars is covered in rust
38:03 maybe it's covered in oceans for the
38:05 most part maybe it's
38:08 jungle maybe it's lush forests maybe it
38:12 has everything what's gonna have to have
38:16 a proportion of continents and water
38:19 because everything that we need you know
38:21 we're a very water based being and it
38:23 has to be fresh water it has to be water
38:25 devoid of poisons which you know no
38:28 planet has any predisposition for Homo
38:31 sapiens and so it might be that we have
38:35 something that looks gorgeous but if we
38:37 get down there we start melting or
38:39 freezing or boiling or whatever at some
38:44 point we have to evaluate the food
38:45 supply
38:47 now we could bring potentially something
38:51 that create that could create food if
38:53 we're able to create some ship that can
38:54 travel through space maybe we can find
38:57 some sort of fusion system that can take
38:59 anything and make it whatever we want
39:01 just like the replicator it sort of
39:04 blows me away that you know we've heard
39:07 of all kinds of nutty things like you
39:10 know the Japanese have actually created
39:12 a device that takes human feces and
39:14 turns it into steak it's edible it's
39:16 like oh my god why the hell would you
39:18 even put money that imagine - that pitch
39:21 meeting on shark tank and what do you
39:23 got for me yeah you know you know all
39:25 those porta-potties everywhere we're
39:27 gonna turn that into food hey man I'm in
39:30 you know I don't know who finances that
39:32 stuff but let's just say it's a little
39:34 bit more raw material based system it's
39:38 been a long time since man has lived a
39:40 rugged life at least civilized man quote
39:43 unquote civilized strength could you
39:47 imagine taking some tribal people with
39:50 you and they get out and they start
39:53 looking around they immediately know
39:55 what to do they immediately know how to
39:56 build a hut they immediately know how to
39:58 hunt the wild they know how to deduce
40:01 medicine out of roots and flowers and
40:04 all kinds of stuff and here's like your
40:05 scientists completely lost with this
40:07 microscope can't figure out how to make
40:10 anything I think that'd be funny but
40:13 let's talk about the sensors again on
40:15 the probe because this is actually a
40:16 very interesting super difficult thing
40:19 to actually accomplish in my opinion
40:22 now for those of you have dealt with
40:24 electronics you're very familiar with
40:26 the principles of sensors a sensor
40:29 senses something
40:30 it has a some sort of mechanism to feel
40:36 what's outside of itself and there are
40:38 sensors that sense oxygen molecules co2
40:41 molecules sound light your normal
40:46 incandescent light or laser light and so
40:50 the sensors that we need to pioneer are
40:54 gonna have to be at best that the very
40:57 best that we could make them they're
40:58 actually in the probe they never leave
41:00 the probe and the probe is literally
41:02 like all those fictional shows you see
41:04 the episodes of Star Trek where they
41:06 just you know they look down on the
41:08 planet and they say it we don't see any
41:09 signs of life or they say there's one
41:12 place on this entire planet and they'll
41:14 know the species of the body if they've
41:18 ever seen it before so we want our probe
41:22 to be able to find a body in space go
41:25 towards it park itself in space perhaps
41:29 it's doing in orbit so that it gets you
41:31 know a good sampling of the entire
41:33 surface of the planet but at all times
41:37 it's going to be sending things down to
41:39 the planet's surface and have it get
41:41 bounced back up and getting inside the
41:43 sensor itself now if you've done any
41:46 sensor component building or not
41:50 building necessarily but implementation
41:53 sensors often will have to be exposed to
42:00 the elements in order to properly sense
42:02 so it's hard to have a sensor behind say
42:05 a Faraday fabric there's some some
42:08 awesome space fabric in your spaceship
42:10 and still be able to see anything
42:12 outside because it's being blocked and
42:14 so that's why when Bob Lazar was drawing
42:16 his spaceship and the special on I think
42:20 it I think it was on Netflix as well he
42:24 said that those little black sensors
42:26 that were the black rectangles on the
42:28 top when the spaceship lands in my
42:29 backyard you'll see them he says those
42:31 are sensors those aren't windows for
42:33 someone to look out that's why it
42:35 rotates
42:35 stealing okay that makes sense to me we
42:40 have to have something that will shine
42:43 down come back and we have to not
42:46 disturb what's down there right we don't
42:49 want to send a beam of stimulated light
42:54 which is a laser what does it light
42:57 amplify a light amplify by stimulating
42:59 emission radiation I think that's what a
43:01 laser stands for right so we don't want
43:03 to like fry a bunch of creatures down
43:04 there on the planet we want to see it
43:08 now with our probe many of you have
43:12 already thought of this was waiting for
43:14 this moment the probe could just simply
43:17 fly down to the surface because there's
43:19 no difference between flying in space
43:20 and flying in this atmosphere provided
43:23 the atmosphere doesn't have something in
43:25 it that's acidic to our vehicle itself
43:27 you know sometimes things are amazingly
43:32 solid I've got a crystal at my house
43:34 that if you put water on it and it's
43:35 just simply melt but prior to that it's
43:41 as hard as a rock so sometimes you can
43:43 have something that's really solid and
43:45 strong but you put something on and
43:46 immediately just turns to dust we have
43:50 to be careful with that
43:51 so our probe enters the atmosphere and
43:54 simply drives around and at that point
43:58 it can start using visual data I start
44:01 figuring out what's on the planet
44:02 obviously it could take chemistry at all
44:04 times pulling in part of the atmosphere
44:06 into a tiny little lab unit
44:08 it starts to disassemble the particles
44:10 and figure out what the atmosphere is
44:11 made out of what its mixture is all
44:12 about perhaps that's the first stage
44:15 before we come up with some other more
44:17 Star Trek supernatural technology that
44:20 uses potentially waves of energy that we
44:22 don't understand currently now currently
44:25 what we use to obviously figure out the
44:28 chemical composition of something if we
44:29 can get into a gaseous state is to look
44:32 at the light and how it reflect refracts
44:34 through things we know that light
44:36 bounces through oxygen in a particular
44:37 way and so when we see that particular
44:39 way we know there's some oxygen
44:41 particles in there that's how they've
44:42 determined the composition of the sun's
44:45 atmosphere which is not really an
44:47 atmosphere but you know as a coronal
44:48 mass ejection pop
44:49 they can look at it and go hmm so
44:51 imagine instead of using light we use an
44:57 ether a wave something much more
44:59 meticulous and much more accurate to say
45:02 well if there's plant life down there
45:04 then this is going to be in the
45:06 atmosphere let's look for it oh there it
45:08 is
45:09 well there's plant life down there
45:11 potentially just looking at light coming
45:14 up from the surface obviously if we saw
45:16 something green there's a chance that's
45:18 plant life because the universe is going
45:21 to be creating the same stuff everywhere
45:22 it's the same book of physics everywhere
45:25 you see blue that could be water then we
45:28 need to determine does it have a fresh
45:30 water inland salt water on the outside
45:32 salt water is only created when we have
45:35 fish and plant life that ends up dying
45:38 inside the water usually it's it's fish
45:42 right because fish turning back into
45:44 like salts and stuff and that's why it's
45:46 so so for some of us gross to sit there
45:50 in surf and just keep swallowing all
45:53 that water it's why it makes you your ph
45:55 balance goes completely wacko when
45:57 you're in the ocean for a long time
45:59 video we got off on technology for one
46:02 second I think it's interesting to think
46:05 that we would have to bring all of our
46:09 stuff with us because we are human
46:10 beings and we have requirements nowadays
46:13 we're not going to be living in caves
46:15 anymore if we don't need to now we could
46:17 potentially use a cave-like structure
46:20 and then put our stuff in it as an extra
46:22 measure of security provided the cave
46:24 doesn't have some big alien bear in it
46:27 or a big giant spider the size of your
46:29 house that loves human beings but one
46:34 thing I think that's very off world that
46:36 we've already experienced on earth is
46:38 the discovery of America we had a fairly
46:44 civilized version of Europe albeit very
46:48 tyrannical and crazy but the Romans had
46:51 you know aqueducts and water and you
46:54 know we were able to flush our stool we
46:56 were able to irrigate a crop and rotate
47:00 it you know we hadn't quite hit the
47:02 Indust
47:03 real age yet of course but we had our
47:06 own little man-made assembly lines as
47:08 well here and there in Europe for
47:10 various inventions but when we came over
47:12 to the United States
47:14 imagine someone living in a plush
47:16 version of some cottage or some home in
47:19 Europe and realizing the you know the
47:22 fact that they can't convince their
47:23 neighbors to get rid of kings and queens
47:26 migrates over and hopefully they're not
47:29 in that first batch that gets
47:30 slaughtered but they come over to the
47:32 United States that Plymouth Rock moment
47:35 and they were dealing with Native
47:38 Americans where they didn't know how to
47:40 really communicate well they certainly
47:43 didn't respect the indigenous
47:44 capabilities of the Native Americans
47:46 their sort of opinion was well you're
47:48 not white so I don't like you or you
47:51 don't have my technology or better
47:53 technology than me so you're just in my
47:56 way sort of bad mentality right but
48:00 erasing that particular part of our
48:03 analysis just for a second you did have
48:06 folks living in log cabins I mean my
48:09 where I come from there's like a you
48:12 knows a few dozen in the state of Kansas
48:14 that are all you know dilapidated and
48:15 and you know leaned over and
48:18 what-have-you
48:19 there's all kinds of old structures and
48:21 in the Midwest of America it's pretty
48:24 fascinating to look at like Barnes that
48:25 are almost 200 years old and all fallen
48:27 over but what do we have happen as a
48:30 result of that migration you got your
48:33 Dodge City Kansas
48:35 you got your Deadwood South Dakota you
48:37 got your Tombstone Arizona you got these
48:40 fairly lawless areas where people were
48:44 looking out for number one because there
48:47 is no other number and so their gun
48:50 slingers a lot of it was exaggerated but
48:52 you know some of it did happen the OK
48:55 Corral moment happened and so you had
48:59 human beings that went from a civilized
49:01 world to a feral world and then went
49:05 feral to a degree themselves and then as
49:10 each generation was birthed into that
49:12 feral state a bunch didn't survive a
49:15 bunch did survive but
49:17 they survived at a completely lower
49:18 standard then the at least the
49:20 technological advancements of Europe and
49:23 it's something that is not really taught
49:25 in school they don't teach you the
49:27 differential between where some of these
49:29 people came and where they ended up the
49:33 the movie Unforgiven a completely
49:36 fictional story but it had a was it
49:40 Richard Richard Harris the British actor
49:44 who played all kinds of amazing you know
49:47 roles before I got into the solises not
49:50 quite his last film I think gladiator
49:54 was his last film but he kept saying you
49:59 know I think in the movie Lincoln was
50:03 shot and he said why not shoot a
50:04 president and they're all looking at him
50:06 like you're really gonna say that right
50:08 in front of us and he's like he's not a
50:10 king why not shoot a president he's not
50:12 a special person he's not anointed by
50:15 God as this guy believed right it was a
50:17 beautifully written character okay so
50:22 that said the standard that was upgraded
50:24 migrating to Americas was at least in
50:27 the end freedom getting away from the
50:30 kings and queens and the the stamp taxes
50:32 and all that crazy crap right now there
50:36 was a whole new batch of people building
50:37 their control mechanisms around us but
50:39 you know for a while there people tasted
50:42 it and it would taste it good now let's
50:45 go back to our two types of folks that
50:48 might finance and make this happen if
50:50 you let bankers continue to exist and
50:53 royalty to continue to exist just sort
50:56 of one in the same
50:57 royalty gets a few extra perks from the
51:00 people like you can't prosecute them if
51:03 a Rothschild broke the law they could go
51:07 to jail you could charge them but
51:11 currently you can't press charges
51:13 against anyone the royal family anywhere
51:15 in the world like any royal family
51:16 they're all documented you know they're
51:20 immune from everything it's illegal to
51:23 press charges against them how nutty is
51:25 that right so if they finance the game
51:28 what they're gonna do is
51:30 gonna set up an infrastructure that
51:32 maybe you get you know a few decades
51:34 without them overseeing you but I doubt
51:36 they would they would say you're an
51:39 indentured servant to us we're paying
51:41 your bills we got you here
51:42 and that you need to work for us and the
51:45 only plant they're gonna have her get
51:46 into is a planet that has some precious
51:47 material that they want a part of if
51:50 they could find a planet damn near made
51:52 it gold oh my god they they grab as much
51:57 gold as they can and bring it back to
51:58 the world and just be as rich as they
52:00 could be limiting and of course but they
52:03 would keep you in servitude like we did
52:05 the two families that came over I should
52:10 sorry there's three families of mine
52:11 that came over and were indentured
52:14 servants right away in the 1630s that
52:18 was the roush family the knight family
52:20 and the Lowe family all there so that's
52:23 not a very good scenario is it so the
52:28 general formula I wanted you to put in
52:30 your brain for when this thing should
52:34 occur and when we would ever personally
52:36 try it's not gonna happen our lifetime
52:37 of course but you know who knows how
52:39 long the internet lasts for these these
52:41 messages to go forward in history but
52:45 whatever is happening on earth is what's
52:46 going to happen on this new planet this
52:49 new place whether it be the moon Mars or
52:51 someplace else
52:52 they're gonna duplicate their control
52:54 structure up there so it's best that we
52:58 get to Gene Roddenberry's world here on
53:00 earth before we go jumping out into
53:04 space so we can take a good formula into
53:07 space but now let's move on to something
53:10 else there's all kinds of details I'm
53:13 gonna continue riffing the cigar is
53:14 pretty long here woody if similar
53:21 similar to the Star Trek world were as
53:23 soon as we hit warp 1 we get a visit by
53:28 the Vulcans there is a whole group of
53:31 folks out there they've been watching us
53:33 for a long time we show the aptitude to
53:37 travel in their districts and now
53:40 they're like okay first contact let's
53:41 make it happen so
53:43 as we show this aptitude we prove a test
53:46 with an e throw based into gravity
53:48 engine we had not only warp 1 but maybe
53:52 word and warp 5 right away and they come
53:55 in and they go ok now you have to learn
53:58 about the rest of us at that point will
54:02 be utterly fascinating is to find the
54:04 whole place already occupied it would be
54:08 as if someone raised their family and
54:13 there's there's a bit of this with the
54:15 twilight zone but they raise the whole
54:18 family inside of this one-bedroom
54:21 apartment or what I don't know sorry
54:23 shouldn't say it but just like you know
54:25 some apartment somewhere this fully
54:26 soundproof it has machines that bring
54:30 food through the little slots in the
54:31 doors right and the whole family is just
54:35 unaware of the outside universe whatever
54:37 that room is is all there is and they
54:39 don't ask questions in fact it's almost
54:42 blasphemy to suggest something's on the
54:43 other side of the walls that don't join
54:46 other rooms and then all sudden someone
54:49 unlocks the door and walks out and they
54:53 find themselves and I don't know
54:55 Manhattan downtown LA downtown Tokyo
54:59 Paris or maybe some other crazy place
55:02 and then just think about the brain
55:05 explosion that would occur for the
55:09 consciousness of an D the the
55:11 pattern-based man being that we are we
55:15 love patterns we love finding new
55:17 patterns and Allison we realize in our
55:20 lifetime there's more infinite patterns
55:22 out there than will ever experience
55:24 mm-hmm now of course we have beat up on
55:28 this show the notion of what would occur
55:31 if UFOs landed and people came out and
55:38 say hey what's up now what's fascinating
55:42 about that argument is that we've
55:43 already done it several times here on
55:45 earth several times on earth when the
55:49 white man came over to the Americas you
55:52 know is the old story of the shamans
55:55 they said that when they finally learned
55:57 how to communicate with us they said you
55:59 know what you don't understand about you
56:01 guys arriving was that when you came up
56:04 on your ships no one here knew what they
56:08 were looking at and and several people
56:10 looked at it and didn't know what it was
56:13 to such an extent they didn't see it and
56:16 it wasn't until the shaman who was
56:18 raised to look you know at things super
56:22 analytically that they explained that
56:24 thing is coming at us do you realize how
56:26 it keeps getting bigger can't you see it
56:29 can't you see what it is such a [ __ ]
56:31 it's like because I don't say [ __ ] but
56:32 it's like something of course they don't
56:34 know men are on it until they get close
56:36 enough they can start seeing human heads
56:37 on it now the only caveat here is that
56:41 the beings that came off of these ships
56:44 were human so at least they had two eyes
56:47 a mouth and he looked very similar now
56:50 some of the sketches of some of the
56:52 beings that they said they found over
56:54 here it's it's rarely ever mentioned but
56:57 there was this a bunch of illustrations
57:00 and I find it sort of hard to believe
57:03 they couldn't draw what they saw that
57:04 just seems a little strange but they
57:06 said that there were these beings that
57:07 didn't have heads that their faces were
57:09 kind of in their torso it's really
57:12 strange man they don't exist anymore as
57:15 far as we know and there's no skeletons
57:16 of them so someone must have just made
57:17 something up it's really strange but one
57:20 of the shaman continued to describe this
57:22 and he said look when you stepped off
57:23 the ship for some people you stepped out
57:25 of a portal like you didn't exist before
57:28 you step down we could see your body and
57:30 then of course they're riding horses
57:32 this is fairly well dramatized in the
57:34 movie 1492 but here you have this horse
57:39 they've never even seen one I mean
57:42 imagine that it's like a it's almost as
57:44 intense as a triceratops popping out of
57:48 us a UFO right but what I'm illustrating
57:51 to you is all of these indigenous tribes
57:56 that are all over the world that have
57:58 never made contact with other humans
58:00 that look different than them when a
58:02 white man gets in there I don't know if
58:05 there's been a white race discovered
58:08 in the jungle by a non-white race that
58:11 would be actually interesting to know
58:13 but most cases that was talked about you
58:15 know there's these white guys and of
58:17 course white for whatever reason is
58:21 considered to be some clean color and I
58:24 think it's only because okay this is not
58:27 trying to be you know some white power
58:30 thing
58:30 it's just think about what would create
58:33 white in nature it'd probably be snow
58:36 maybe some ice but you know the second
58:39 you move in snow and you move in ice you
58:43 have dirt that will come up from the
58:47 ground and mix with it and it's no
58:49 longer white so white was a very
58:51 difficult color to create you know ivory
58:54 is very precious because it's a white
58:57 bone you know it's interesting right and
59:00 people always took care of the bones of
59:01 things because it was just this
59:03 interesting looking stuff but white
59:05 white is interesting you know no white
59:07 person is truly white well maybe in a
59:09 few places but so that I don't see there
59:13 being a gigantic difference between
59:15 these videos that we have of people
59:18 discovering the modern society on camera
59:20 you know is that again that keep
59:23 forgetting the islands that's north of
59:25 New Zealand where you really have those
59:27 isolated folks that supposedly a
59:31 Rothschild I think as a watch out or
59:34 rockefeller went on the island and raped
59:36 a girl and killed her and they will then
59:42 forever hate the white man every time he
59:45 comes close they throw Spears and they
59:47 want to kill us all and it's like I so
59:50 respect that because it's like we were
59:51 we let some total pervy epstein guy get
59:56 involved with the first contact moment I
59:57 mean how horrible is that right so to
60:00 that degree end to the fact that modern
60:02 society has concocted for the super
60:05 sophisticated folks in the world plenty
60:08 of UFO alien shows on TV you know got
60:11 all kinds of aliens and all kinds of
60:12 fictional things on TV Star Trek alone
60:14 should have cleansed the world of any
60:16 fear of aliens there's that movie
60:21 valerian
60:23 what is it the what is it something of
60:26 this the ten thousands of the thousand
60:28 planets for ten thousand plants whatever
60:29 I Luke was on a very interesting thing
60:33 where the opening scene of the movie is
60:35 us kind of having an advanced version of
60:38 our ISS up in space and somehow we have
60:41 made first contact with a ton of
60:44 different aliens and we've come up with
60:45 this sort of agreement that they're all
60:48 gonna bring ships in they connected this
60:51 space station and it becomes this
60:53 there's all kinds of aliens that walk up
60:54 to the the human beings as we shake
60:56 hands with them I mean it's one of the
60:58 most brilliant first twenty minutes of
61:00 any cinematic film ever made the money
61:02 they spent on this was crazy I think
61:03 some of the casting was lousy but it's
61:06 it's incredible so once the ship is
61:08 built at the beginning credits it's over
61:10 like literally when the credits are over
61:12 the ship takes off into space and you
61:16 have I guess ten thousand or a thousand
61:18 different species on this ship all
61:20 learning how to get along and eventually
61:23 the characters get back to that ship and
61:26 you start to see you start to have a
61:28 narration of all the different species
61:30 in what they do there's a whole species
61:31 of robots to think in binary there's a
61:34 whole bunch of aquatic animals that
61:36 exist on the seafloor I mean it's just
61:38 phenomenal they don't know how to
61:40 explain that but but now what if we do
61:43 the probe technique I used to have this
61:47 dream and it was it's a very advanced
61:51 dream I haven't had it for quite a while
61:53 but it went like this
61:56 I guess it was me I had created this
62:02 propulsion system and it was an infinite
62:07 propulsion system now I hadn't really
62:08 factored in and when I was having the
62:10 dream the limitations of potentially the
62:13 speed of ether in the universe but the
62:16 way my dream went was that I had this
62:17 sort of mothership I had toyed together
62:19 by creating something on earth that
62:22 could metabolize up any invention
62:24 through potentially like a nano based
62:27 printer that could make anything it can
62:29 take any matter and make it something
62:31 elsea build a small craft and then you
62:33 can just go out in space and use etho
62:35 matter so
62:36 whatever you wants you have infinite you
62:37 can make a Dyson Sphere if you wanted to
62:39 because you're just using the flow of
62:41 ether in space right it's always going
62:43 to be there plenty of it right but I
62:46 built this space station that I hid in
62:49 orbit around Mars and it was I think I
62:53 put it next to a moon in my mind but it
62:56 was just this crazy gigantic hotel in
62:58 space with all these crazy inventions
63:00 that would heal your body and protect
63:02 you and but what I ended up doing was
63:05 having a party with some of the people
63:08 on earth that I thought would be really
63:09 cool to bring up at the time Steve Jobs
63:11 was alive but I thought you know what if
63:14 you had this capability of synthesizing
63:16 anything for no money at all really you
63:19 just need the design you need a 3d print
63:21 out of it right then I kept going back
63:24 to the dream one of the dreams was that
63:25 I brought George Lucas up there and what
63:30 I had done was I created a it's some
63:35 other place in the galaxy far far away
63:38 I had created the Death Star I created
63:40 all the spaceships the Star Destroyers
63:42 all the Thai fighters plus a rebel rebel
63:44 force on some sort of m-class you know
63:47 indoor type planet and I had him with me
63:52 and I took him out there and I said you
63:54 know of course I blow in his mind every
63:56 two seconds right I went to his ranch up
63:58 there in San Rafael and I popped into
64:00 his office and I said give me 60 seconds
64:03 I'm gonna prove to you I have to say to
64:04 you the most important thing I got a
64:06 ship parked outside no one can see it
64:08 but you and I are going to get into it
64:09 and we're gonna have this experience I
64:10 took him out into space it's
64:12 instantaneous travel everywhere we went
64:14 because the engines are so powerful and
64:16 I let him live his universe right I let
64:20 him go through a space but it's all
64:21 pre-programmed so we're totally safe
64:23 yeah they're blowing up those Tie
64:25 Fighters it's literally like a scene out
64:26 of his movie but he's seeing it for real
64:28 maybe we're the Millennium Falcon I
64:30 think that's what I was initial idea was
64:32 that but the reason why bringing that up
64:36 is that one of my notions was in a party
64:40 I had built of kind of a sub probe ship
64:44 pretty massive and what the ship's
64:47 design was was it was a kind of a wedge
64:49 and
64:49 space with you know big sort of a short
64:52 wedge so not like a Star Destroyer it's
64:55 really long but take that and spread it
64:57 out almost like the stealth fighter but
64:58 little less wide like an Aurora type
65:02 thing but it has the propulsion system
65:04 on it and it had computers on it
65:07 computers that had you know quadrillion
65:11 levels of data you know like holographic
65:14 memory data or data storage so you could
65:17 just basically store infinity which I
65:19 didn't hadn't studied my quantum
65:21 computing but as part of this party
65:24 though you know like a good presentation
65:26 party used to have some big crescendo at
65:29 the end and the idea was I brought all
65:31 these people up there to meet each other
65:33 and they're all part of this clique now
65:34 because they get access to the ship and
65:37 I say okay here's the big crescendo on a
65:40 bottom part of the ship just pops off
65:41 and floats out in front of everybody in
65:43 this big beautiful glass window and they
65:46 can see it and I tell them that is the
65:49 probe that's gonna document the universe
65:51 and it can it's like a it's like a heart
65:55 of gold in probability drive type ship
65:57 right and so you turn the thing on and
65:59 it will go in every point in space at
66:02 once and document the whole thing so we
66:05 have a three-dimensional map of the
66:06 entire universe in a split second
66:09 and so I'm telling everybody that and I
66:12 push a button and tells it to go out and
66:14 do its thing and it kind of goes out and
66:15 then you go whoop and disappears and
66:17 then in less than a couple seconds it's
66:20 Bands back and it's aged right it's been
66:23 through everything it's like a VG or
66:25 something like that and then we
66:26 basically all look through the data now
66:29 I went and relooked up the the comments
66:34 about Tesla and his Colorado Springs
66:39 experiment where he did mention the time
66:42 seemed to compress in on itself that he
66:46 felt like and this is there's a
66:47 difference between what's actually
66:49 occurring what a human being thinks
66:50 they're experiencing we all know that
66:52 right but he was basically trying to
66:55 communicate through his written word
66:58 that he was seeing all time
67:03 all at once that it was due to being
67:08 encapsulated in three and a half million
67:10 volts of a lightning bolt which I think
67:13 is very interesting for him in
67:15 Springfield Colorado which was it was
67:18 fairly early in his career that he did
67:20 this which is I think about 1913 or
67:22 sorry 1916 excuse me this happened but
67:28 he had already done I believe the Paris
67:30 World Fair I think by that time maybe I
67:33 have those years wrong he used to be
67:36 known for going on stage and
67:38 encapsulating his body and electricity
67:40 in front of everybody
67:41 which you know I mean no one's ever done
67:43 that sense and so nobody knows quite how
67:46 he did it but he didn't get fried and of
67:48 course he's sitting there saying look
67:49 electricity is so safe you have no idea
67:52 and the guy lived in his 80s and so if
67:54 he was gonna get radiation from wireless
67:57 technology however he did it he was able
68:02 to create some sort of almost natural
68:04 Faraday cage around his body without the
68:06 Faraday cage or at least the we could
68:09 see and he was a friendly lanky guy you
68:13 know he was about 150 pounds but he was
68:16 fairly tall and thin right so I am yet
68:21 to explain how time actually exists you
68:27 know how some how stimulating yourself
68:30 and your environment with a bunch of
68:31 electricity is somehow going to bring
68:35 back previous stages of the universe
68:39 such that you can access them even
68:42 visually right I asked my teacher once
68:46 in high school I said you know this
68:48 time-travel exist I mean does anyone
68:51 have any theories about time travel and
68:53 he said no not really he said the only
68:55 thing that they that you could possibly
68:57 do would be to get in a spaceship that
69:02 can go faster than the speed of light
69:03 and he said you could go away from the
69:06 earth faster than the speed of light and
69:08 start looking back at the earth and
69:10 because the light coming from Earth
69:11 would start getting old
69:14 the further out you can go
69:16 faster-than-light that you can achieve
69:18 you could potentially look back on
69:20 Napoleon's battle if you could just get
69:22 the optic to work right I thought that
69:25 was pretty fascinating but because of
69:26 diffusion I'm sure that those that's a
69:30 completely ridiculous notion meaning
69:33 light would diffuse by the time you got
69:37 way out there so what would what would
69:40 we have to bring if we were going to do
69:43 an initial landing on some other planet
69:47 well Star Trek is dramatized this
69:49 several times in a very realistic way
69:51 there was the episode when Voyager were
69:54 Janeway and Chakotay had this virus and
69:56 they weren't able to leave the planet's
69:57 surface because if they did they would
69:59 die but as long as they stayed on the
70:00 planet they were fine and so they
70:03 thought well geez we're gonna have to
70:04 leave him there this is the captain and
70:06 her number one so the ship's gonna have
70:08 to adjust all of its ranking and it's
70:10 it's they're losing two of their most
70:12 powerful people and the ship so the
70:13 psychological impact of the ship was
70:15 devastating but they dropped all these
70:18 little kind of mobile home units these
70:20 sectionals down with all the Replicators
70:23 power supplies you know some phasers to
70:26 hunt and do all that kind of stuff it
70:30 was a very hospitable planet thank God
70:33 but now you would if we didn't do a
70:38 probe first which would be very silly
70:40 man just simply being in space and
70:43 traveling and exploring it would have to
70:46 have the infrastructure that is the
70:50 space Academy that's inside of the Star
70:54 Trek world whereby your ship only goes
70:57 out far enough that it can get back home
70:59 safely you know with Voyager the really
71:02 cool thing about that entire episode
71:04 season show in general was that a being
71:10 had grabbed the Voyager ship and had
71:14 pulled it 75 light-years away from Earth
71:18 into a whole different sector of the
71:19 galaxy and then he died and then that's
71:22 the first episode and then they have to
71:24 have 75 years to get home at full well
71:28 it must have been
71:29 let's been further than that but it was
71:31 because they do travel more than warp 1
71:33 it was gonna take several years to get
71:34 him stick by 70-79 years to get home so
71:37 the however far out that was but if this
71:40 is the first time we've ever done it
71:41 okay let's so that let's say that we
71:44 conquer every body in space that's in
71:46 our solar system first we figure out
71:49 ways to deal with crazy situations you
71:52 know you know they've they've lied so
71:55 much about Venus it's not even it's not
71:58 even funny anymore
71:59 again when I went to Edward Tufte z--
72:01 class twice you know he was hired to to
72:04 deal with the data that came back from
72:06 Venus his first probe and they you know
72:09 if this is true it's actually very
72:11 interesting
72:12 they said they put a probe and it did a
72:14 bunch of like you know laser sensor
72:15 stuff getting the typology or its
72:18 entomology it's a topography excuse me
72:20 contour data of Venus surface and it was
72:24 so flat and so boring that they took all
72:28 the data and multiply two times 22 to
72:31 create valleys and mountains and stuff
72:33 so it would look really Spacey and then
72:35 they created that 3d fly-through in the
72:36 90s and he was just he doesn't like NASA
72:41 I don't think at some point isn't really
72:43 say but he also talked about how the
72:45 Space Shuttle exploded and how they knew
72:47 it was gonna explode back in 1986 he
72:51 blamed the White House for pressuring
72:52 NASA to launch yet launched at 39
72:55 degrees Fahrenheit man told us launch
72:57 before that was in the upper 60s and
72:59 everything went wrong in the upper 60s
73:02 and so they debated for thirteen hours
73:04 the day before scientists literally said
73:07 these o-rings could crack and sure
73:09 enough they cracked but they hid that
73:11 data and then they suckered a Richard
73:16 Feynman into being a part of the
73:18 investigation group to investigate why
73:20 it blew up and he said that they didn't
73:24 have any data as to why I mean they
73:25 pretty sure the o-ring popped but he
73:29 said before was conclusive he in fact in
73:31 fact they didn't know and he was invited
73:33 over to dinner at the head of NASA guys
73:35 the guy's house he ate dinner
73:37 Athena's wife and then the guy who's
73:40 head of NASA was a carburetor enthusiast
73:42 he took
73:43 not to his garage and he started showing
73:45 them rubber o-rings and the carburetors
73:47 and he said you know I noticed that this
73:49 o-ring when it got really cold it
73:52 cracked and then it let all this fuel
73:55 spill out and I was wondering if maybe
73:58 those booster rockets on the side of the
74:00 same exact thing to happen then he said
74:02 man I knew I was I was lied to the
74:04 entire time they knew this the whole
74:05 time
74:06 so between ever tuff T's class and
74:09 Robert firemen's autobiography you get
74:13 the whole picture but now hopefully
74:16 before we were to journey outside of our
74:18 solar system and go on some
74:19 multiple-year thing we get to our
74:21 category 5 which is how do we exist on a
74:24 ship for potentially a lifetime you
74:27 never know how far we're gonna be going
74:29 out we know how far the ships gonna go
74:30 she could have all kinds of anomalies in
74:32 space that we've never even seen before
74:34 because perhaps there's a bunch of
74:36 unification of etheral behavior inside
74:39 of a solar system that the second you
74:41 get outside the solar system that
74:42 becomes very turbulent which is why
74:45 probes are very important you send a
74:48 probe out and you make you come home
74:50 and you send it out and you make it come
74:51 home and this is what we have to do to
74:54 test out the fabric of space itself now
74:57 if we take a little fiction and mix it
75:01 with a little bit of fact there's
75:04 actually a very interesting idea and
75:06 this is where ideas become a major ibly
75:10 valuable douglas adams who wrote The
75:13 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy if you
75:15 haven't read it don't and just go get
75:18 the BBC broadcast of the original series
75:21 on whatever mp3 somewhere because that's
75:25 the way it was originally broadcast and
75:27 written and sorted and arranged but he
75:30 created this spaceship called the heart
75:32 of gold flown by one
75:34 dzifa Beeblebrox and his girlfriend
75:38 Tricia McMillan who is from Earth now
75:42 Zaphod has two heads by the way and he
75:44 has three arms and again if you want to
75:47 see the original actors from the BBC
75:49 broadcast acted out go get the 1981
75:53 made-for-tv movie of it and the only
75:56 character
75:57 swapped out was the guy that played Ford
75:58 Prefect who's Arthur dents buddy but
76:02 Arthur Dent is this uptight guy from
76:04 England who gets pulled off of earth
76:06 with his buddy Ford Prefect and
76:09 eventually does a couple jumps in space
76:11 and finds himself and the art of gold
76:12 with he fought people Brock's his
76:15 distant cousin but the heart of gold had
76:20 this engine in it which was this super
76:22 state-of-the-art engine that was the
76:23 infinite probability drive and it what
76:27 it does is when it turns on it enters
76:30 every single point in space and simply
76:33 chooses when it's going to come out and
76:34 where it's gonna come out I should say
76:36 an XYZ system not potentially time could
76:41 have a factor in this there's a great
76:45 scene in the book slash the two the BBC
76:49 series where they have to they're
76:50 trapped and they need some help and
76:53 Zaphod he calls through a seance to his
76:56 great-great-great-great grandson and
76:58 they said wait a minute your Greger
77:01 grandson what you don't you mean your
77:02 great-great grandfather he says none
77:04 others the there was an accident in a
77:05 time machine with a condom but we can't
77:07 talk about that right now we'd have time
77:09 to talk about that right now it's just
77:10 it's just such a brilliant show it's
77:12 mentioned all the time by everyone who
77:15 is remotely intelligent it's great so if
77:17 you consider yourself witty and smart
77:20 then you are in for a treat
77:23 if you go listen to this go listen to it
77:25 don't don't read it it's all out of
77:26 whack with the books they changed the
77:28 scenes and doesn't make any sense
77:30 half the time with the books but anyway
77:33 the idea of this engine that if you
77:37 could take Tesla's testimony from
77:39 Springfield Colorado that he saw time
77:42 compress on itself through some weird
77:43 anomaly that I don't believe he ever
77:45 solved for maybe he did what is it
77:48 Donald Trump's uncle went and grabbed
77:51 all of his stuff when the FBI seized all
77:54 of Tesla stuff there's that whole funny
77:56 Baron Trump conspiracy which is just so
77:59 much fun so funny but potentially if we
78:04 could start playing with our engines our
78:08 infinite power
78:10 system and start experimenting with I
78:13 don't know electromagnetic fields see if
78:17 we can't get something to disappear into
78:19 the future disappear into the past now
78:22 what's interesting about time travel in
78:25 general and I've talked about it several
78:26 times on the show is that obviously if
78:29 anybody had time travel and it was just
78:32 willy-nilly capable of being purchased
78:34 by someone in some futuristic target and
78:37 time was linear then they'd be popping
78:40 up all the time and I mean not just a
78:42 guy looks like jay-z in the 1800s some
78:44 dude would be here in my backyard he
78:46 would have got one of these episodes
78:48 2,000 years from now and come back here
78:50 oh my god you know the episode you did
78:52 was so funny it doesn't happen like that
78:55 does it so maybe all Tesla did was see
79:00 something now let's just say that again
79:05 there's remote viewing which again
79:07 remote viewing is kind of like astral
79:09 projection everybody says they asked for
79:12 project we'll have people just talking
79:13 about dreaming really hardcore the other
79:15 half are making it up because they never
79:17 can find out any empirical data that
79:19 would be immediately available to you
79:21 when you astral projected right I'll
79:23 take a shirt of my choosing out of my
79:27 library of shirts and I'll put it in a
79:28 drawer it has nothing else in it but
79:30 that shirt if you're gonna ask your
79:31 project mean you're not hindered by your
79:33 body's form anymore you're floating
79:34 around the universe will go in that
79:36 drawer and tell me what shirt it is dang
79:39 ding ding it doesn't exist ok
79:42 remote viewing that's another thing well
79:44 if everybody could see everything
79:46 everywhere well geez I don't think the
79:47 world would have all the problems it
79:48 does but maybe there's limitations that
79:50 do lend itself to being real I don't
79:53 know but they say that they can ask
79:55 though or sorry not sure project they
79:57 can remote view into the universe and be
80:00 anywhere they want to be it's that old
80:03 story that military guy that said we
80:04 have the technology to send et home you
80:08 know a statement like that gets
80:12 overplayed tremendously because the guy
80:15 who has said it was not a scientist
80:17 necessarily that would know exactly how
80:19 to do it right so if you've ever shown
80:23 your
80:23 some piece of technology they were blown
80:26 away by it but they don't quite
80:27 understand it and they run off and tell
80:29 a bunch of you know stories that are you
80:33 know that your demonstration gave them
80:35 that gave them the impression of its
80:38 wholly inaccurate
80:39 it's like Arrested Development's
80:42 fakeblock right absolutely hilarious
80:48 then we could basically have a general
80:50 that sees something and then he he's
80:52 told that it could do something well you
80:54 know anyone looking for money from a
80:56 military organization is gonna say
80:57 whatever it takes and then they fund it
80:59 and maybe it works maybe it doesn't who
81:01 knows again if there was space travel
81:05 today then they would put on the moon
81:09 all of the Apollo lunar lander module
81:14 kickstands
81:15 where they're supposed to be they would
81:17 take Rovers up for 15 through 17 and
81:19 drive them all around where they said
81:21 they drove and they'd leave them there
81:23 they put all the flags there and then we
81:25 would get the most incredible
81:26 reconnaissance photos and we would send
81:28 a probe or a rover to those locations on
81:31 the moon so we could prove that we went
81:33 but since that doesn't exist and didn't
81:35 happen and etc etc we still get images
81:39 of these landings that are 4x off scale
81:43 I don't have my phone with me but there
81:46 was a movie that I think had Sean
81:50 Connery in it and had the guy from Jaws
81:52 in it not Dreyfuss but the other dude
81:54 who was also in 2010 and I think it was
81:58 called Outland I think that was the name
82:01 of it but it was about a mining colony
82:03 of human beings that were out there in
82:05 space and they were it was a brutal sort
82:08 of deadwood world where all these really
82:10 rough tough biker guys you know big
82:13 alpha males are constantly digging and
82:14 trying to make some money they leave
82:16 their family for like you know six years
82:18 that maybe takes a year to get there and
82:20 they work for five and then they took a
82:22 year home I don't know something like
82:23 that and then maybe seven but they
82:27 portrayed this this feral offworld
82:29 community I think very accurately and
82:32 what I find interesting about the movie
82:34 Blade Runner and it's constant
82:36 advertisement of being
82:37 offworld you know the blimp that flew
82:39 around and constantly gave the
82:40 advertisement and then when Priss meets
82:42 Sebastian at his house she notices he
82:46 has the skin you know issue and they
82:50 said you know is that why you're not
82:53 offworld or is that why you're still
82:54 here and he says yeah you know I can't
82:56 get on the I don't qualify to be
82:59 offworld because of my what she called
83:01 accelerated decrepitude and he said I
83:04 kind of like it here I have friends I
83:07 make my own friends you know so
83:10 obviously in that situation the other
83:13 backstory we had was boy baddies
83:15 character at the end of the film when
83:16 he's given that beautiful statement
83:18 about all the things he's seen and they
83:21 talked about at the beginning of the
83:22 film how he busted out the offworld
83:24 colony and they came back to try to find
83:25 Terrell to get their life extended he
83:30 talks about you know the different
83:32 species of replicants that they created
83:34 to handle a situation you know Roy and
83:38 Zora were you know war machines of
83:42 course Leon was probably pretty much a
83:43 war machine as well
83:44 Leon kind of comes off more as a
83:46 blue-collar worker that can just really
83:47 get it done and he just happens to be
83:49 strong but Roy and Zora were just death
83:53 machines and pris was a pleasure model
83:56 to keep all of the offworld colony
83:58 individuals satisfied and again if you
84:02 look at the history of Deadwood it's
84:05 phenomenal I mean Deadwood was so so
84:07 rugged and rustic that you know average
84:09 family that didn't mind gold or owned a
84:12 building with an establishment you know
84:14 to sell supplies or to service drinks or
84:16 something
84:16 the women were prostitutes and the men
84:19 did some trade skill during the day and
84:21 they'd come home and have dinner and it
84:23 would be asking your 13 to 14 year old
84:25 daughter how many men she had that day
84:26 it was a very standard process amazing
84:30 you know it's fascinating having these
84:33 conversations hundreds and hundreds of
84:35 years before it actually occurs save any
84:38 super epiphany that might come out of
84:41 uncovering technology that's being
84:43 hoarded by those that controlled our
84:45 world but let me redirect perhaps some
84:49 of your anxiety with that
84:51 in that if you're a person like me you
84:53 would love to see this occur and maybe
84:55 if it's all home doubt experience it
84:57 yourself again I'm not I'm not really
85:01 keen on leaving earth anytime soon
85:03 unless I can get back to earth fairly
85:06 soon as well but do think about the fact
85:09 that you know you're told that there's
85:12 technology that's out there that's you
85:14 know I think it's always exaggerated I
85:18 think with the internet the window of
85:21 what your military might have or it's
85:27 probably always military corporations
85:29 own a little bit of technology but the
85:31 military is always right there so if if
85:35 you've invented something they'll find
85:36 it right but they always tell you know
85:38 the military is like 20 years out I just
85:40 recently watched the red pill guy say oh
85:42 it's you know at least 50 years out I
85:45 mean they just pulling this out of their
85:46 ass and you know I think we need to pull
85:49 back on that just a tad
85:50 no no offense guys I think we need to
85:52 pull it back but the other one would be
85:54 you know saying it's even more than a
85:56 hundred years our 50 years excuse me now
85:59 I have the hundred world excuse me I
86:01 have the hundred year theory episode
86:04 that if you dig this kind of discussion
86:05 go see that episode because it is an
86:07 analyzing what would the world be like
86:11 if the afar controllers were 100 or more
86:16 years out on technology but let me throw
86:20 you for a loop I do forget the exact
86:24 foreign names for what I'm about to
86:27 describe a lot of you've already seen
86:29 this there are sketches from the ancient
86:33 Hindus around 0 ad to a thousand BC
86:39 they're not quite sure where the stuff
86:41 originates and this is something that
86:42 Bob Lazar has leaned on in his remake
86:45 where he actually was interviewed by Joe
86:47 Rogan where they were asking him where
86:50 do you think these ships came from that
86:51 you worked on and he said well one of
86:56 the theories was that they were
86:58 archaeological digs so here's where we
87:03 I have to flip this argument of 20 years
87:05 ahead or 50 years ahead or 100 years
87:08 ahead
87:08 what do you call technology that's 3,000
87:11 years old but way more advanced than
87:13 anything we have today what do you call
87:15 that it's just hidden technology what do
87:19 we say we're 3,000 years ahead of you
87:21 but 3,000 years ago they're flying
87:23 around
87:23 we have all of those paintings on the
87:27 desert floors of Peru that only makes
87:30 sense when you're up in space I mean
87:31 we're not space but you know you need a
87:33 hot air balloon or something to get up
87:34 there to see what's going on and then
87:36 the interesting thing about that whole
87:39 regiment of drawing ants and people and
87:42 all kinds of stuff and the sand there's
87:44 a bunch of shapes that don't seem to
87:45 make any sense but they never really
87:46 show you those is how do you know you're
87:49 drawing accurately you know if you are
87:54 say they had hot-air balloon technology
87:57 I think hot-air balloons as soon as man
88:00 could knit a fabric
88:01 I don't think skin works that well you
88:03 know if you had like the skin of a bison
88:05 it's so heavy that you would be able to
88:09 sense if you put your hand over a fire
88:10 that that there's this pressure coming
88:12 up of extreme agitated particles right
88:14 but if you could create a bedsheet level
88:17 strand and a loom and then you got four
88:21 people to hold four corners of some sort
88:23 of fairly non permeable membrane and
88:27 held it over a little small fire you
88:30 would probably see it start to bulge and
88:32 then someone starts thinking and
88:34 thinking and going oh my gosh what if we
88:35 started to the little balloon objects
88:38 and then we put fire underneath and I
88:40 believe the hot-air balloons could be a
88:42 lot older than we think
88:44 but then again if a society were to
88:47 accomplish this technology you would
88:51 think they would advance up with the
88:53 rest of the world or ahead of the rest
88:54 of the world and so you have a situation
88:57 where I don't think hot-air balloons a
88:59 threatening device right if you created
89:01 some antigravity thing which I'm trying
89:03 to get to here then there should be
89:08 workshops and drawings of these things
89:11 as soon as they were able to do it if
89:13 you're gonna draw something on the
89:14 ground how does a hot air balloon really
89:16 hell
89:16 you you're up in the air and what are
89:19 you doing shouting down okay go do that
89:21 yeah exactly no no go to left go you
89:23 know it's like how do you do that I
89:25 don't know but these Hindu drawings it's
89:30 sort of what I've always heard it
89:31 described as they have things that look
89:33 extremely identical to a lot of what
89:36 happened deemed as UFOs the especially
89:41 the discs that sort of flat on the
89:43 bottom but has these little nubs and
89:45 then it has the sort of the hook with a
89:48 weird kind of World War 2 helmet on the
89:50 top and you know these little window
89:51 looking things maybe sensors and it
89:54 makes me wonder the the bob lazar find
89:56 these in some tech somewhere and then
89:59 just modernize them for his story don't
90:01 know but it looks like potentially man
90:05 and again that stuff could be a PSYOP
90:07 you got a no I don't know enough about
90:09 this where you know if I could meet a
90:11 guy that was 100 years old and said oh
90:13 yeah that was around when I was a kid
90:15 that make me feel a lot better that I
90:18 think psyops today that are hatched
90:20 today have infinite levels of complexity
90:23 you know you can back story books and
90:25 back story human beings that never
90:27 existed but let's just say it's true
90:30 let's say that some of those has tech
90:35 you know drawings of these beings that
90:38 look like they're inside vehicles with
90:40 fire coming out at the bottom let's say
90:42 those of legit okay so what would cause
90:46 man to give up on that technology or is
90:51 it like the the video game you find out
90:55 that in in sort of the art deco world
90:58 that this genius built a city on the
91:01 bottom of the ocean and he brought all
91:03 the intellectuals down with him to live
91:05 there and eventually it wouldn't really
91:07 well for a while then it went tits up
91:09 and there's this little girl that's got
91:11 all this weird possession in her and
91:12 she's got this big robot that protects
91:14 her I can't believe a camera of the name
91:16 of that was like three versions of the
91:18 game but I thought that was a
91:19 fascinating notion that you know
91:21 potentially this society advances itself
91:25 to the point where it can go live
91:26 someplace else maybe here
91:29 earth but in some black panther city you
91:32 know that's stealth somewhere you know
91:35 but then you know what it's hard for me
91:37 to understand I guess could be that they
91:42 would leave their own kind behind maybe
91:45 that's just what you have to do you're
91:47 you're not really beholden to your race
91:49 like you know I think a lot of romantic
91:52 stories try to insinuate so yeah if you
91:55 get any inks from that whole thing just
91:59 think about if we could free information
92:00 from all these coveted places you know
92:05 is there technology that man shouldn't
92:07 have oh yeah Oh certainly you know as
92:10 long as we still have primitives on this
92:12 planet that don't believe that you know
92:14 people that don't believe certain you
92:18 know deities were gods then yeah we got
92:20 to be careful until we exhaust ourselves
92:22 out of all that stuff and get to the
92:24 point we can recognize man as Gene
92:26 Roddenberry did in his scripts then we
92:29 can kind of unleash stuff and it's
92:30 really super sad because that we're kind
92:34 of a chicken and egg situation with
92:36 technology like that let's say that what
92:38 Tesla was creating the death ray which
92:40 was not to kill human beings but it was
92:43 really a directed-energy weapon that was
92:46 probably best portrayed in the 1951
92:48 movie The Day the Earth Stood Still if
92:50 you just watched the first 10 minutes of
92:52 the movie you'll see Gort who comes out
92:55 of the spaceship when they shoot the
92:58 little unit out of the humanoid aliens
93:02 hand
93:03 Gort you know he's like bucket piss man
93:06 he brings up his shield and he starts
93:07 shooting the tanks and the and the
93:09 pistols in these guys hands and and the
93:11 cannons that were brought there the the
93:13 you know the howitzer sort of things
93:14 they all started melting down to the
93:16 ground that's sort of what Tesla was
93:18 creating as I understand it I went on a
93:20 deep dive a couple years ago but imagine
93:24 the technology just flat-out given to
93:28 every human being before educating
93:30 ourselves about what it does imagine
93:32 imagine you go back to primitive times
93:34 when we're fighting for land or
93:37 something or resources and you just give
93:39 everybody a m16 or something
93:43 full-auto m16 with you know infinite
93:45 rounds or whatever they just kill
93:47 everybody they wouldn't understand how
93:49 to use it but if you give some of the
93:52 smartest people in the world who have
93:54 empathy and sympathy and the air
93:56 conscious of mankind and they have a
93:58 great vision for Humanity not some
94:00 agenda21 vision of humanity and they
94:03 could actually build something out of it
94:06 you don't necessarily get to own it but
94:08 you get to use it as it has been
94:11 distributed to man and a good way let's
94:14 just say we had anti-gravity vehicles
94:19 well let's just say the very first time
94:22 that that's actually debuted to mankind
94:23 is not here's your keys to your into
94:26 gravity unit here is your ability to get
94:29 on a bus that is going to take you from
94:31 point A to point B instantaneously
94:33 they didn't call it a bus whatever it's
94:35 called the ship then you want to eat
94:37 lunch in Paris go for it
94:39 you're in Los Angeles ping you're there
94:42 in five minutes or five seconds or one
94:45 second and you go eat lunch and you go
94:47 back home you don't need to invade
94:49 someone's country you just go and visit
94:51 and you have a good time you know we'll
94:53 man and never ever inhabit the world
94:55 such that we have to leave because
94:57 you've run out of space maybe but just
95:01 to put into perspective you can fit a
95:03 billion people in a building that's one
95:05 mile squared so what do we have almost
95:08 eight billion now okay so eight
95:11 buildings that are one mile square which
95:15 you couldn't see from orbit it could fit
95:19 the whole world now it doesn't mean that
95:22 those you know individuals couldn't
95:25 cause regional problems you know we've
95:28 we've just talked to people who are in
95:32 agriculture like really advanced
95:34 agriculture they can take deserts and
95:35 turn them into amazing lush worlds they
95:39 just not allowed to and so any any part
95:45 of the world that is stricken by famine
95:47 there's really no excuse we can always
95:49 find a way to get the water there to get
95:51 the seeds to grow to nourish the soil
95:53 there's always a way
95:55 I mean we put it to you this way how
95:59 many of you seen like a greenhouse that
96:01 can grow plants just hanging on the wall
96:04 with no soil you just spray the
96:06 nutrients on their roots and they yield
96:09 whatever they yield once you see that
96:12 you're like wait a minute can we just
96:14 build this wherever there's a famine
96:15 problem yeah make it big
96:17 but there's famine you know yeah well
96:20 how much can that cost the seeds are
96:22 free enclosure yeah you don't have to
96:24 have some electricity and that kind of
96:25 stuff but we got plenty of power
96:27 supplies we can do we got solar farms we
96:29 could build I mean there's all kinds of
96:31 ways of doing it but we don't and so
96:35 this is why we have to change the world
96:37 so we get some of these fantasies to
96:40 become realities if that's what we want
96:42 to do and if you're someone who doesn't
96:44 believe space exists well geez you're
96:46 you have to double down triple down
96:47 because you'll be able to prove your
96:49 theory I mean isn't it fascinating that
96:52 the formula is still the same if you
96:56 prove it's flat then there's a whole
96:58 amazing array of reality that the man
97:01 gets to deal with and experience but if
97:06 you prove the space does exist well then
97:08 you got the universe that you can play
97:09 it with so either way it's a great
97:11 journey to go on because there's a bunch
97:14 of stuff we can learn we don't know our
97:17 true potential until we explore all of
97:19 our potential and all these things are
97:22 potential realities right anyway I think
97:26 that's about all the time I got I have
97:27 no idea how long the show is because the
97:30 camera does not give me a time readout
97:33 as lawfully this is good if you have me
97:36 to deep thoughts radio.com please go
97:38 that's the hub for the whole show and
97:39 again if if anything were to happen to
97:41 the channel then that's definitely place
97:43 you'll find out where is but if you go
