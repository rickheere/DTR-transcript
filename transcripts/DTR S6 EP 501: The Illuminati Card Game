00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:35 deep thoughts
00:37 season six i guess i can't welcome you
00:39 back to season six but welcome back to
00:41 the show it is now season six hope you
00:44 dug the new intro
00:45 sorry took a little longer over the
00:47 summer
00:48 hopefully the bonus episodes kept you
00:50 guys busy
00:52 i have a ton of episodes planned for
00:53 season six so
00:56 uh we'll we'll play catch up here if you
00:58 think about it a season is
00:59 approximately 100 episodes i start
01:02 somewhere around this time of year and
01:04 i'm over somewhere around june
01:07 and there's only 52 weeks in the year so
01:09 i have to put out
01:10 approximately two episodes a week
01:14 for a year just to do it in 12 months
01:16 but i'm typically done in 10
01:17 so i'm just gonna pound through some
01:19 really great subjects
01:21 we'll probably have a third of the
01:23 season done
01:25 in just a couple months so and then
01:27 we'll just
01:28 hit cruise control and make it happen
01:31 as you can see from the title the maiden
01:34 voyage
01:34 of this season is going to be the very
01:37 interesting steve jackson
01:39 card game called the illuminati
01:43 the uh i believe it's the nwo version
01:46 from the early 90s early mid 90s 94 95
01:51 right a friend of mine brought this up
01:54 to me
01:56 and um she was a collector
01:59 she is a collector of card games in
02:00 general right so
02:02 you can talk about 100 games magic the
02:04 gathering the star wars decipher cards
02:06 or
02:08 the pokemon cards or whatever right
02:10 extremely
02:11 lucrative industry in fact my first game
02:14 site i ever created was called
02:15 cardgames.com
02:17 back in 96. so
02:20 i look at this and they were saying okay
02:22 so this game is based on
02:24 a book called the illuminati trilogy
02:25 written in 1975.
02:28 apparently steve jackson and his buddies
02:31 read that book
02:32 and we're inspired now i haven't read
02:33 the book personally so i don't know
02:35 what's in it
02:36 and then he starts creating card games
02:38 paper card games because
02:40 you have to understand in the early 90s
02:42 you had magic the gathering
02:44 create this game i mean the game came
02:47 out excuse me lots of expansions
02:49 you had to play a location card
02:52 character cards then you had effects and
02:54 all kinds of good stuff
02:56 then the star wars card game came out
02:58 which i think is quite frankly the most
03:00 gorgeous
03:01 car game ever made i still have seal
03:03 boxes of the originals
03:05 but they have to create a conspiracy
03:07 game
03:08 which means they're going to have to
03:10 just think about it just think of it as
03:11 you
03:13 they're going to have to come up with a
03:14 bunch of kind of
03:17 low-hanging fruit cards that describe
03:21 or demonstrate uh conspiracies and all
03:25 the various elements and all the various
03:26 categories
03:28 now those cards have been discovered and
03:31 there are
03:32 some very interesting correlations
03:34 between
03:36 some of the artwork and events that have
03:39 taken place
03:40 now what i'm going to do and the value
03:43 of me
03:44 doing this episode for you guys i
03:46 believe is that i was in the
03:48 video game industry but i was also
03:50 immersed in
03:51 those that were into car games again
03:53 like i said my first
03:55 business online was cardgames.com and i
03:58 did a
03:59 distribution deal with a company in uh i
04:01 think it was arizona
04:02 and so i was selling boxes of magic
04:04 gathering and
04:06 uh star wars before my partner
04:10 who was so excited about starting the
04:12 business with me uh
04:14 just kind of faded away so
04:17 i sold the domain to this dude and it's
04:19 been
04:20 in a weird state ever since but my buddy
04:23 who invested in
04:24 the online site with me created a card
04:28 game which some of you know i've talked
04:30 about in the past
04:31 and i won't rehash that story but what
04:33 that allowed me to do was watch a buddy
04:35 create one of these games based on
04:37 sort of the mechanics of the era
04:40 of the early 90s and he came up with all
04:43 kinds of cards
04:44 so now steve jackson is
04:48 being accused by some of being sort of a
04:51 huxley
04:52 huxley who wrote brave new world was
04:55 said to have
04:56 been allowed to see the plans by the
04:59 ruling class elite in the early 30s
05:03 and through their regiment of predictive
05:05 programming which we're going to talk
05:06 about
05:07 they feel like they need to do two
05:10 things they they have to show the public
05:12 what they're gonna do which is a bit of
05:14 a hubris
05:15 see what's coming you can't do anything
05:16 about it and the other half
05:18 is to soften the blow
05:22 for those that are going to experience
05:25 the event
05:26 meaning take it it's not so surprising
05:30 don't fight back don't look for any
05:32 conspiracies
05:34 this for some reason in your mind
05:36 because you've already been exposed to
05:37 it
05:38 perhaps a dozen times through literature
05:40 at the time would have been maybe a
05:42 radio show
05:43 or some story that's being released in a
05:45 book by a publisher
05:46 you've been slowly programmed to accept
05:48 this unacceptable event
05:51 okay so there are hundreds and hundreds
05:54 of cards
05:55 that steve jackson and friends designed
05:57 and published
05:58 in the mid 90s
06:01 i'm going to be unboxing during this
06:04 video
06:05 just underneath my my voice a true
06:08 booster pack from 1995
06:12 and i am going to unbox the more recent
06:15 completely updated version
06:17 of the the game in which the artwork has
06:20 been completely
06:22 in my opinion savaged it's good artwork
06:25 but it is absolutely out of the pocket
06:27 of a conspiracy
06:29 feeling game the first version which was
06:32 more marvel comics
06:34 is much more in line with the sort of
06:36 mental
06:38 setting of such a game
06:41 because if you're going to play a
06:42 conspiracy game it should be
06:44 a faux le you know seriousness when
06:46 you're sitting at the table not
06:48 um you know goofy saturday morning
06:51 cartoon
06:52 characters and you're trying to be
06:54 serious about something
06:56 and uh because the cards are pretty
06:58 intense in the end
07:00 no matter if they're fictional or not
07:01 right now the way this game is laid out
07:03 is that there are various illuminati
07:05 groups
07:07 that are on these black cards like black
07:10 with gold writing
07:12 and i believe in the expansion that they
07:14 that's released in 2018
07:16 those cards they gained a few different
07:19 factions but i think back in the day it
07:21 was something like six
07:23 uh six factions or something maybe eight
07:25 tops
07:26 and they have certain alignment certain
07:29 goals that they want to do
07:31 it's really quite brilliant and then you
07:34 have these organizational cards
07:36 which might be television movies
07:39 medicine what have you and your
07:42 organization that you pick your
07:44 illuminati group that you pick then goes
07:46 after and tries to conquer
07:48 these various groups and there are
07:51 certain power levels
07:53 on the cards so you might have an
07:55 illuminati group that has a sixth power
07:58 but you might want to be taking over a
07:59 card that has a 12 power
08:02 right so you need to make up for the six
08:03 you got to roll a die to see if you can
08:05 get the other six which means you'd have
08:07 to roll a six
08:08 in addition to your sixth power but he
08:10 has a little economy in there with
08:12 little tiny
08:13 teeny tiny uh money dollar bills
08:17 smaller than a postage stamp and you
08:20 gain an economy
08:21 at some point in the game some cash and
08:22 you can buy the extra points
08:25 so you can actually buy three of the
08:27 points and then you only have to
08:29 roll a three or a higher and you defeat
08:31 the other card for any of you've ever
08:32 played war
08:34 back in the day right you divide a deck
08:36 in half or you get two decks of cards
08:38 you throw down a card your buddy throws
08:40 down a card whoever's got the highest
08:42 card
08:42 gets the cards and whoever has the most
08:44 cards in the inn wins the game
08:46 there's basically a glorified version of
08:48 that
08:50 so that you understand the mechanic
08:51 before we go into it now
08:53 right away i'm just going to get into
08:55 the one card that
08:57 has everyone up in arms so the most
09:00 amazing card without really diving deep
09:04 into it
09:05 or before you dive deep into it is
09:08 called terrorist
09:09 nuke and it is a card with the world
09:12 trade centers on the front
09:14 and one of the buildings has a
09:17 horizontal
09:18 explosion coming out of it which
09:21 the funny part about that is or
09:25 i mean almost like from an artistic
09:27 standpoint we're going to get into this
09:29 obviously a nuke inside of a building
09:32 it's not going to look like that right
09:35 who knows what that would look like
09:36 that'd be a really amazing
09:38 thing to see a nuke go off inside of a
09:39 skyscraper but it looks like
09:42 that that infamous day in 2001 when the
09:46 second
09:47 explosion happened in the second
09:48 building that was injured
09:51 because it went sideways having to do
09:53 with some
09:54 cg trickery to make you think that
09:57 another
09:58 object was involved in it when most
10:00 likely that's not the case anymore
10:02 if you doubt me just go download the
10:04 footage of that second impact and run it
10:06 through
10:06 final cut and stabilize the footage and
10:08 then watch the plane wiggle up and down
10:10 and you'll realize
10:11 something's not right but everyone
10:13 thinks that this is predicting because
10:15 it's 1994-95
10:17 that they had pre-knowledge of the world
10:21 trade center attacks if you
10:24 rewind and it's funny because the
10:25 younger crowd jumps to this a little
10:28 faster
10:28 because they don't have perhaps the
10:30 memory of what was going on at that time
10:33 and believe me i'm not trying to build
10:34 anybody out but in 1993
10:37 the world trade centers were attacked by
10:39 a bomb
10:40 a bomb made by the fbi given to a
10:44 guy to supposedly sting a terrorist cell
10:47 the fbi actually told the terrorists to
10:50 park the
10:50 van next to the central column thank god
10:54 the proxy between the fbi and the
10:56 terrorist group thought that was too
10:57 dangerous and so he parked the van on
10:59 the outside because he didn't want to
11:00 he didn't want the building to fall over
11:02 the van explodes i think it
11:04 it ruptured it killed like six or seven
11:06 people and it was
11:07 it was a massive bomb in the basement
11:09 but now that happened in 1993.
11:13 okay so this card is made it's probably
11:16 in production it's probably being
11:17 designed at the time that this explosion
11:20 happens in the world trade center
11:23 so world trade center explosion just
11:25 happened in real life
11:27 so be careful on how amazing you think
11:30 this is but you're probably going to say
11:32 to me but wait wait wait
11:34 look at the picture dude it looks just
11:35 like that moment
11:37 when the tower the second tower world
11:39 trade center uh
11:42 one i believe had the explosion that
11:44 occurred and it happened exactly like
11:46 the artwork
11:48 okay well regardless no artist in 1983
11:53 going for a 94 publication is going to
11:55 know
11:56 how that fireball is going to look even
11:59 if they had the full schematics of what
12:00 the day's events were going to look like
12:03 but two yours truly was a professional
12:06 video game artist
12:08 at 19 years old having drawn tons of
12:11 video games before that
12:13 for myself so say that someone and i've
12:16 done all kinds of like
12:17 all kinds of art projects for books and
12:19 book covers and cartoons and just all
12:21 kinds of stuff
12:22 if someone came to me and no matter what
12:25 year it was and said look i got this
12:27 card game
12:27 and we have a bomb you know nuclear
12:32 card a terrorist nuke card
12:35 for political reasons we're calling it
12:37 terrorist nuke card because we can't
12:40 really uh latch ourselves to a
12:43 particular
12:44 group of people in the world like we
12:46 don't insult
12:48 a particular group by saying you know
12:50 that group
12:51 nuke you need to draw we're thinking
12:55 they're going to blow up the world trade
12:56 centers okay
12:57 all right so you need to draw that now
12:59 in my
13:00 reality at the time i would have just
13:02 noticed and
13:03 lived through the 93 bombing of one of
13:07 the world trade centers right
13:08 now what am i going to do am i going to
13:10 draw the basement level of a building
13:13 where this this bomb went off an 83
13:16 am i going to do that it wouldn't
13:18 recognize much in your mind what am i
13:20 looking at i'm looking at a weird
13:22 explosion it's really tough
13:24 but you also want to have the shock and
13:25 awe that the world trade centers
13:27 to the largest buildings in new york
13:30 could actually be attacked at all
13:32 so to get that emotion out of you i have
13:34 to draw the trade centers in a way that
13:36 you can notice their trade centers
13:38 but i also have a fixed amount of real
13:40 estate
13:41 i have just an off-square shape inside
13:44 of a rectangular card where you're going
13:46 to have to
13:47 leave room for the designers to write
13:49 the mechanic of the card and perhaps a
13:50 little story element in there
13:52 a lot of the cards have barely any story
13:54 element to them you just have artwork
13:57 and we'll get into that so now i've got
13:59 to draw what an explosion
14:01 well i can't really i mean i would
14:03 probably if they were really
14:06 making this a new card i would have
14:07 probably done some bizarre
14:09 you know airburst newt cloud with the
14:12 trade centers in the center
14:14 but even that might not read that well
14:15 for the brain anyway
14:17 the artwork artwork was extremely clear
14:19 these are the world trade centers
14:21 they're being bombed
14:22 again one year later this card is
14:25 showing you
14:27 that these things have been bombed what
14:29 about the steve jackson guy
14:31 is he one of these uh you know eclectic
14:34 uh
14:35 illuminati guys well yours truly was
14:37 blessed to be in the
14:38 san francisco area really the silicon
14:41 valley area which is below
14:42 san francisco it's the valley literally
14:45 between san francisco and san jose
14:47 during the explosion of the card game
14:50 industry
14:50 this particular card game industry we
14:53 had a
14:54 card game company i believe was in san
14:56 mateo or just south of san mateo
14:59 it's called gator games and the rumor
15:01 was that
15:03 just selling magic the gathering it's a
15:04 little teeny tiny store
15:06 but just selling magic the gathering
15:08 this woman
15:10 was said to have grossed over 11 million
15:12 dollars
15:13 selling little tiny trading cards
15:16 i remember buying my first darth vader
15:18 card for my star wars deck for 50 bucks
15:21 but role playing was still pretty pretty
15:24 big
15:25 i got a chance to play with george
15:28 mcdonald the
15:29 inventor of champions
15:32 came over to our house and sat down with
15:34 us and beta tested a brand new more
15:36 abbreviated version of the game
15:38 so getting to see the mechanics getting
15:40 to hear the minds of those who design
15:42 these things
15:44 and i was designing my own stuff right
15:46 for the video game industry
15:48 okay so i've seen probably
15:51 half a dozen videos about the steve
15:54 jackson thing what was actually
15:55 encouraging
15:56 to me was that it hasn't really taken
15:59 off that well
16:00 um that people haven't gone nuts over
16:02 this whole thing
16:03 potentially harm this man he does seem
16:06 to me to be
16:07 your absolute consummate game designer
16:10 he's got that lovable level of totally
16:14 geekdom to him which if you're in those
16:16 realms they know that that's a trophy
16:18 and not a
16:19 criticism by any means the interesting
16:22 thing too is he strikes me as a very a
16:24 fairly analytical guy
16:26 and there are really two types of folks
16:29 that participate in game design
16:31 there's your super visionary sort of
16:33 emotional designers that are trying to
16:35 give you these
16:36 you know these opening scenes to world
16:37 of warcraft shadow lands you know they
16:39 want your mind to get
16:40 goosebumps and then you have your your
16:43 hardcore mechanic guy underneath who
16:46 may or may not have that emotional side
16:49 to them
16:50 but they really know the numbers they
16:52 really know how to create suspense
16:54 with the numbers steve jackson
16:57 strikes me as more of the mechanics kind
17:00 of guy
17:01 than the other side he could very well
17:03 have both sides of the game
17:05 but you know what you do when somebody
17:06 accuses someone else of being
17:08 one way or the other and you're not sure
17:11 most of time this happens in our
17:13 personal life
17:14 what do you do well if you're mature
17:16 you'll
17:18 get them in a room or get in the room
17:19 with them and you'll just sit and watch
17:22 and just see are they matching the
17:25 stereotype that was you know inserted on
17:27 top of them
17:28 and you'll make your own decisions with
17:29 your wisdom the worst thing we can do is
17:32 take someone else's word for it and rush
17:35 in
17:36 because it's amazing no matter how
17:38 brilliant your colleagues in this world
17:40 might be
17:41 they'll they'll misjudge those things
17:43 quite quite a few times because they
17:45 might have like built-in
17:46 pavlonian triggers from bad people in
17:49 their past like i always say
17:50 you know a con man really messes up the
17:53 world because they have a frequency in
17:55 the way that they talk
17:57 like i my voice has a frequency
17:59 hopefully you trust me but maybe you
18:01 don't whatever you're skeptical
18:02 more power to you but if i sold you some
18:05 snake oil
18:06 with this tone of voice the next time
18:08 and you realize you've been had by me
18:11 then the next person who sounds like me
18:13 is going to make you
18:14 very suspicious but i watched again
18:17 about
18:17 half a dozen interviews with him i tried
18:20 to watch one of his presentations but
18:21 whoever uploaded the video had the audio
18:23 like
18:24 0.25 percent of a single percent so you
18:26 could barely hear it i'm gonna actually
18:28 jack that up and
18:30 listen to it again he seems pretty
18:32 authentic
18:34 and again i'm not seeing anything in the
18:36 cards which we're gonna start reviewing
18:37 here
18:38 that is anything other than what you and
18:41 i would do today
18:43 think about it if you and i wanted to
18:45 create this game today
18:46 and that other game never existed let's
18:49 create a cool
18:49 card game that has to do with
18:51 conspiracies
18:53 well we have the internet now
18:56 to harvest all of the archetypes of
19:00 conspiracies from georgia guidestones to
19:03 satanism everything i mean there's like
19:06 there's so many we probably have
19:07 twice the number of cards right now one
19:11 of the other cards related to that
19:12 infamous day in 2001
19:14 that has people kind of up in arms is
19:16 there's a
19:17 cart called the pentagon and it has a
19:21 big fire coming out of the center of the
19:23 pentagon
19:25 now i don't know if the if the exercise
19:29 in 1991 was actually publicized where
19:31 they
19:32 they did a simulation with
19:35 planes hitting the pentagon there's
19:37 pictures of that
19:38 consequently one of the guys in that
19:40 exercise was consequently
19:42 the pilot that supposedly hit the
19:43 pentagon with this plane
19:45 what are the odds i think it was flight
19:47 77
19:49 we're probably going to touch on this
19:50 subject after things cool down with the
19:52 uh
19:54 the old draconian censorship that seems
19:56 to have exploded recently
19:59 but okay so someone goes hey look you
20:01 got a world trade center getting popped
20:03 and you've got this fire in the pentagon
20:05 but now
20:06 pull back you're going to create a
20:08 conspiracy game
20:09 you need hundreds of cards because
20:12 that's how you make your money through
20:13 booster packs
20:14 if you do not have a ton of cards and
20:16 there's a critical mass number
20:18 which i think this card game has about
20:19 800 or something
20:21 then you don't sell that many expansion
20:22 packs you have too many common cards
20:25 that people run into
20:26 when they buy expansion packs thus
20:28 frustrating them thus making them not
20:30 like the game
20:31 so part of it's just sheer attrition of
20:34 hitting critical mass with such a thing
20:36 if you had a military target a number
20:39 one military target in the united states
20:41 of america
20:42 and this is someone just asking you a
20:44 question we need to make a card it's
20:46 the number one military place gets
20:48 attacked wouldn't the pentagon be number
20:51 one in your mind
20:52 if not at least in the top three there's
20:54 a lot of air force bases in military
20:56 bases
20:57 um maybe area 51 tops right
21:00 now there are um just a bunch of
21:04 low-hanging fruit that seems to be
21:05 freaking people out
21:08 one of them is a jogger and the card
21:11 says something to the effect that the
21:12 jogger who would ever suspect a jogger
21:16 creating some sort of bad event and so
21:19 what did they do they linked that to the
21:21 the boston bombing
21:22 with joggers running by okay
21:26 well no one accused a jogger
21:29 of being the person that supposedly put
21:31 together that uh
21:32 was it the pressure cooker bomb now
21:34 again i'm not gonna go through
21:36 the conspiracies around those events is
21:38 it interesting yeah that's probably one
21:40 of the more esoteric cards but the card
21:42 doesn't really
21:43 connect to the event that actually
21:45 happened in real life right
21:47 so some of the other cards that are
21:49 really low hanging fruit cards for
21:52 any type of world domination
21:55 nwo new world order card game
21:59 would be all of the totalitarian
22:02 tiptoeing
22:02 that we have seen previous leaders of
22:04 the world do
22:06 and i'm assuming that the illuminati
22:08 trilogy book would have these
22:10 low-hanging fruit things in there what
22:11 am i talking
22:12 about well gun control martial law
22:16 he has one on tobacco companies and
22:18 they're kind of funny
22:20 uh there's one car called corporate
22:22 masters
22:23 well go watch rollerball in 1975
22:27 man with james khan the movie is about
22:29 the fact that corporations
22:31 eventually succeeded in what they're
22:33 trying to do today which is take over
22:36 the world you know where you don't have
22:38 countries you have corporations
22:40 right and they have in that movie
22:44 the houston corporation which is the
22:46 corporation of power
22:48 and that's what james khan's character
22:51 plays for there are no more countries
22:54 and if you watch the dialogue at the
22:55 fireplace
22:57 in the center of the movie they talk
22:58 about the corporate wars and
23:00 his his trainer lived through those as a
23:03 kid
23:04 and here they are there's cards on
23:06 russia
23:08 there's a card in florida's ation which
23:10 i thought was actually fairly insightful
23:11 for 94
23:12 but you have to understand too i was
23:15 you know 24 at the beginning of 94 25 by
23:18 the time it was over
23:20 and we didn't have an internet that was
23:22 http
23:23 savvy if you did but you didn't have any
23:26 websites on there definitely not
23:30 a preponderance for people to find
23:33 conspiracy sites they may have been out
23:34 there day one
23:36 but people were awake right john
23:38 carpenter did create they live
23:41 by what 1990 1987 you know
23:45 by the way i want to correct something i
23:46 keep saying i i kept saying wrong
23:49 the year this is a total random
23:50 statement planet of the apes was
23:52 actually released in 68 same year as
23:54 2001
23:56 and i i think i'd said 63 a couple times
23:58 so i apologize
24:00 now the other card that is really sort
24:02 of hilarious
24:03 is that there's a card called enough is
24:06 enough
24:07 and the people it's a man's
24:10 face in a cartoon screaming
24:14 with or yelling with sort of this
24:17 definite viral
24:18 matter around his head and of course
24:21 we're now inside
24:22 beside this uh this event
24:25 in 2020 and i still haven't found a
24:29 microscopic
24:30 photograph of this thing that supposedly
24:32 exists but you know
24:34 i guess as long as you pass around a cg
24:36 model of it it's totally real
24:38 yeah but what they have done to this
24:40 thing
24:41 and it's interesting because i'm a one
24:43 of my first skills in this world was
24:45 portrait
24:46 face illustration i can make people up
24:48 in two seconds i can draw your face in
24:50 two seconds it looks just like you
24:52 and so when i look at the anatomy of
24:54 this face and then they have one picture
24:57 of the president united states and
24:59 they're trying to say oh my gosh they
25:00 predicted he was going to be the
25:02 president and he would be
25:03 within a viral disruption
25:07 in 1994 right i would say that
25:11 if if that was truly the intent of the
25:13 artist of that card slash the designer
25:15 of the accord
25:17 then they do have time travel and they
25:20 put this all together but they missed
25:21 one critical element which is
25:24 donald trump is most famous for his hair
25:27 and there wasn't a strand of hair in
25:28 this card in the artwork
25:32 i have photographs of myself for
25:34 artistic reasons
25:36 uh with a very similar face so we have
25:40 it could be a pretty generic caucasian
25:43 male face let's just put it that way but
25:46 again you know the other thing too is
25:47 like
25:48 if you've ever seen the movie andromeda
25:50 strain
25:51 uh if you've ever seen what is it the um
25:54 the movie about ebola a virus taking out
25:58 the world
25:58 is hardly an original concept what was
26:00 it prince philip
26:02 said in his what his memoir he published
26:04 in the early 90s before this game was
26:06 made
26:07 i believe that's like 91 or something
26:09 that he said if he was ever reincarnated
26:11 he would come back as a virus
26:13 and wipe out the human race so there's
26:16 always been these
26:17 self-loathing human hating individuals
26:21 that have always wanted to do that i
26:24 mean
26:25 in the mid 90s my friends and i
26:28 i don't know why it was like a joke that
26:30 someone would say oh we need the 99
26:32 virus anytime we'd see someone in public
26:36 it wasn't something i said but i kept
26:38 hearing it and hearing you know someone
26:39 bad in public a lot of people acting
26:41 really stupid in public
26:43 they just go we need to get rid of all
26:44 these people and they'd say the 99
26:46 virus joke so it was in the lexicon of
26:49 man that they're
26:50 obviously it's in movies it's in
26:52 television shows
26:53 it's in our personal lives that a virus
26:57 could happen remember the whole thing
26:59 about antibiotics and over prescribing
27:02 them
27:02 the biggest problem with that is that we
27:04 become they become immune to everything
27:06 that we create
27:07 in the sewers and then they they kill us
27:11 the other thing was that they actually
27:12 had very topical cards
27:14 there's a card with george bush on it
27:17 there's a card with hillary clinton on
27:18 it
27:19 bill clinton on it ronald reagan on it
27:22 and al gore
27:22 making fun of al gore being sort of this
27:25 green
27:26 leftist which i thought was interesting
27:28 now i also want to say that um
27:31 it's not that these cards aren't
27:34 phenomenally educational
27:36 because in my experience they are
27:40 it just doesn't mean that that they knew
27:42 what was going on but we're going to
27:43 talk about in the second half of this
27:45 whole thing
27:46 what we do know i believe is a fairly
27:48 legitimate game that's going on
27:50 remember in 2001 i was not an x-files
27:54 viewer
27:55 i later watched all of them but
27:58 apparently the episode where
27:59 a plane was being threatened our plane
28:02 threatened
28:03 to hit the world trade centers was an
28:05 episode released before
28:06 the event of 2001 and
28:11 just recently the writers came out and
28:13 said you know what an alphabet agency
28:15 brought that starts with a c brought
28:17 that concept to us the premise to us to
28:19 turn into
28:20 a show and they kind of been nervous i
28:23 guess to say something because of the
28:25 obvious
28:26 implications of exposing that
28:28 organization but apparently they feel
28:29 safe enough today to say something
28:32 i think they also realize they have to
28:33 meet their creator and that's a
28:36 traditional predictive programming
28:38 mechanism
28:39 right you want people to
28:42 to go where you want them to go
28:45 narratively even their mind and so if
28:48 you show a terrorist
28:50 doing this particular event and then the
28:53 event actually can
28:54 occurs the most unthinkable event at
28:56 least in the narrative
28:58 you'll go along with it because yeah
28:59 somewhere i saw that before
29:01 but if you've never seen someone predict
29:03 that to you and program your mind to
29:05 accept that concept
29:07 you might go to your leaders you might
29:09 think that uh someone in your government
29:12 potentially did that to you and they
29:13 don't want you to go that way they want
29:14 you to go the way they want you to go
29:16 now the other one that's interesting is
29:18 the supreme court card
29:20 which shows a bunch of
29:23 guys dressed in in the robes
29:26 but above them is your illuminati
29:30 triangle with
29:31 two little eyes poking out okay well
29:34 pretty
29:34 logical thing wouldn't it wouldn't it be
29:36 in your brain to say okay the
29:38 the organization that looks down on the
29:40 people from a sovereign country called
29:42 washington dc
29:43 which does not have to follow the
29:45 constitution that follows the bylaws of
29:47 the united states of america corporation
29:50 of course they can rule down on your
29:51 second amendment your first amendment
29:53 because they're not bound by it
29:55 their flags have gold fringes on them
29:57 every time you walk into a court
29:59 with gold fringes on the flag you're
30:02 walking
30:02 out of the constitutional realm and into
30:04 the corporate realm
30:06 by which you can be judged outside of
30:08 your constitutional rights which is how
30:09 that happens
30:11 it's called maritime law now there's
30:13 always been a push
30:15 especially by those who are acting in a
30:18 conspiratorial way remember it's two or
30:20 more people conspiring against one or
30:21 more
30:22 people that's what a conspiracy is
30:25 when your toothpaste tells you for 60 to
30:28 80 years that it keeps getting better
30:30 every year
30:31 there you go that's that's a basic
30:33 conspiracy
30:34 really what are you doing i mean at some
30:37 point if they put any more fluoride
30:38 toothpaste it'd just be a block of
30:40 fluorine dust from making aluminum right
30:44 the other one is the the new world order
30:46 card
30:47 that says world war iii big deal
30:51 big deal oh somebody conceived of there
30:53 might be another war
30:55 have you watched any television shows
30:57 have you seen mad max have you seen all
30:59 these
30:59 funny movies they created in the 80s
31:01 with these post-apocalyptic worlds with
31:03 hot
31:04 chicks on motorcycles you know not an
31:07 original concept whatsoever and i don't
31:09 think steve jackson would ever say that
31:10 was like the most creative card they
31:12 created right
31:13 now one thing that i thought was
31:14 interesting is they put remember i told
31:16 you that you're this illuminati group
31:18 you pick which group you want to do no
31:20 two people i believe can have the same
31:22 group and then you're acquiring and
31:24 conquering
31:26 other industries to control the society
31:29 and one of the industries that they put
31:31 out there was the recording industry
31:33 the music industry well if you do a
31:36 little bit of research
31:37 especially with the rap industry as it
31:40 entered the
31:40 90s there is a group of gentlemen that
31:42 said they were invited to a party in the
31:44 hollywood hills
31:45 where they're being financed by the
31:47 prison industry
31:48 to change all their lyrics to
31:51 glorify acts that will get people
31:56 put in prison thus funding the private
31:59 prison industry and of course there's
32:01 probably some invisible layers over
32:02 those folks and these
32:04 individuals who defected were not
32:06 willing to participate
32:07 and thus lost their connection with the
32:09 music industry
32:11 as those that pushed drugs and gun
32:13 violence prospered
32:15 mightily now one of the more i would say
32:18 gutsy cards
32:20 and i'm not sure how this is actually
32:21 played in the in the game was gay
32:23 activism
32:25 i can't remember there being a
32:26 disproportionate amount of
32:28 representation
32:29 in the 90s it just seemed like it was
32:31 normal
32:32 you know evolution of man to be
32:34 courteous to those who are
32:35 perhaps different than you orientation
32:37 wise there's a
32:39 card that's a earthquake projector which
32:42 i think is pretty interesting
32:44 again depends on how geeky these guys
32:47 are
32:48 when harp was patented in the late 50s
32:52 one of the patents that was entered into
32:54 the harp design was be it was
32:57 the ability to be able to
33:00 add a electrical frequency to the plates
33:03 of the earth to cause
33:04 an earthquake it also had mind control
33:07 weather manipulation
33:09 i'm not making this stuff up it's in the
33:11 pattern
33:12 mainly based on inventions by nikola
33:16 tesla
33:17 who would have never allowed such a
33:18 thing to be used right
33:20 yeah the other one is there's a jihad
33:22 card and
33:24 you know look at back to the future
33:28 with michael j fox and christopher lloyd
33:30 who
33:31 gave them a problem at the mall the twin
33:34 peaks mall
33:36 i think it's always called or twin pines
33:37 mall or whatever it was called
33:39 who popped out of the van at the very
33:40 beginning you're arab terrorists
33:44 okay if you ever watched the movie used
33:47 cars from 1979
33:49 with kurt uh kurt russell
33:52 when they did the marshall t justice
33:55 thing across the street and blew up all
33:56 the cars which is one of the funniest
33:58 scenes on ever been filmed in a
33:59 in a film when the cops showed up
34:03 to to ask who blew up these cars across
34:06 the street
34:07 we had just had the iran hostage
34:09 situation
34:11 we had the 1972 munich kidnapping and
34:14 murdering of all the olympians
34:16 so we had this narrative going
34:19 that the arabs were more radical in
34:22 certain areas of the world
34:23 so the jihad card is hardly original
34:26 people
34:27 and i'm not criticizing the game at all
34:29 i'm just saying for those that want to
34:31 suggest that these cards are absolutely
34:32 epic predictions of the future
34:35 it would really it would really attest
34:38 to the fact that perhaps the individuals
34:40 who feel so passionate about such a
34:42 thing
34:43 lack perhaps a complete memory of recent
34:46 history
34:47 and it could just be your age no big
34:48 deal one of the other interesting ones
34:50 was population reduction
34:53 the car just has a city on it and
34:56 again this is not a new thing
34:59 when the euthanization organizations
35:03 like the the predecessor to planned
35:04 parenthood came out
35:07 it was later renamed planned parenthood
35:09 it was about
35:11 exterminating various races on earth
35:14 if you ever watch the cinema what is it
35:16 the cinemax show
35:18 the nick which stands for the
35:20 nickelodeon hospital
35:21 in new york city when you get to season
35:24 two it rolls over
35:26 to the year 1900 and
35:29 they dramatized in the series these
35:32 sort of quack doctors that were going to
35:35 start
35:36 working to create medicines to euthanize
35:39 certain people to sterilize them
35:41 chemically and what have you it's just
35:43 history man
35:44 you know the other one that i love is
35:46 they actually have a moon card
35:48 and at this exact moment the name
35:50 escapes me
35:51 it's like a nasa card and it shows a man
35:54 on the moon
35:55 and inside the artwork you get to see
35:57 the the
35:59 the light rig that's lighting the set
36:01 it's obviously suggesting that nasa
36:04 is uh a fraudulent organization that
36:08 fakes things like the it was the
36:10 capricorn movie
36:12 not a new conspiracy one of the goal
36:14 cards is called blinded by silence
36:17 science
36:18 now okay you've got thomas dolby who had
36:21 already had his song blinded me with
36:23 science
36:23 out for 10 years before this car was
36:25 created so there's a little play on
36:27 words there most likely
36:29 but of course if you are a geek
36:32 and which means you're a valuable asset
36:34 to this world
36:36 you're going to probably
36:39 study official science and then you're
36:40 going to probably know some geniuses if
36:43 you're not one yourself and realize
36:44 that you know the things that made
36:46 nikola tesla so successful which is
36:49 ethereal sciences
36:50 were deprecated after he died
36:54 and again just to put this in your in
36:56 your head it's a slightly different
36:57 topic we have tons of episodes on it
36:59 in season five but the second you lose
37:02 ethereal sciences
37:04 it's the second you don't understand why
37:05 the world expands and it's the second
37:07 you
37:08 will forever lose track of how to gain a
37:11 zero point energy system out of the core
37:13 of the earth
37:14 right imagine a battery that is like
37:17 quadrillions of times more powerful than
37:19 any power that we use on the surface of
37:21 the earth but it's in the core of the
37:23 earth
37:23 and all you have to do is tap into it
37:25 and pow you've got infinite energy
37:27 thus hobbling these organizations well
37:30 they'll pay trillions
37:33 a couple times over a hundred years to
37:35 make sure that man loses
37:37 that empirical science so they stay on
37:39 top
37:40 now there's a las vegas card which again
37:43 is another industry
37:44 it's a big cash cow it
37:47 harbors all forms of influence in terms
37:50 of performing performing arts
37:52 but someone is insinuated that this is a
37:56 a call out to the shooting that happened
37:59 in las vegas now watch the video where
38:03 one of the people examining the games
38:05 had associated the uh the time of 1030
38:08 to the card
38:09 you know looking at the card i don't see
38:11 any reference of that
38:13 either using the power or the resistance
38:16 or the verbiage inside the card
38:19 but they were trying to say that since
38:22 10 30 was in the center
38:24 time frame of the shooting in vegas that
38:26 this is a conclusive predictive card
38:29 for the future and i'll just let it sit
38:32 right there because i don't buy that at
38:33 all
38:34 now one of the cards i thought was
38:35 interesting was called plague of demons
38:38 and it shows the capitol building in
38:40 washington dc with a demon
38:42 outside and obviously
38:46 we are concerned that powerful people
38:49 are participating in belief systems that
38:53 may or may not be true
38:54 but it doesn't matter as long as their
38:56 doctrine is to
38:58 hurt man in the process we can't have
39:02 that police belief system
39:03 you know proliferating through the
39:05 planet because eventually you will
39:06 become a victim of their
39:08 actions and since there's no honor among
39:10 thieves we know that they
39:12 have no loyalty between each other
39:16 should there be a benefit to taking out
39:19 one of their own
39:20 so it's just interesting there's a card
39:23 on conspiracy theories
39:24 and we all know that uh
39:28 the demonization of anyone who is
39:30 cognitively awake
39:32 is uh is a threat to those who are
39:35 living in illusions
39:37 sold to the people right now the other
39:39 one that it actually debuted around that
39:42 time
39:43 was related to another card called flesh
39:45 eating bacteria
39:47 and i had a real interesting personal
39:49 experience
39:50 with a friend of mine who believes that
39:54 a test he took for his phd in
39:57 microbiology was used to create this
40:01 this horrible weapon because the
40:04 whatever he was taking outside of his
40:08 doctorate paperwork that he wrote
40:11 was that uh someone the professor
40:14 had offered an extra credit question an
40:16 extra credit question was to
40:18 create a flesh-eating bacteria and then
40:21 to kind of give them
40:23 for extra credit talk about how
40:26 you might deliver this system to another
40:29 human being
40:30 and his system of delivery was to offer
40:33 someone a free prize
40:35 i think his idea was a makeup kit to
40:37 someone which only
40:38 really goes after the females but you
40:40 offer someone a prize to the mail
40:43 and you say just send this envelope back
40:46 that you're interested in receiving your
40:47 prize
40:48 and you're set up and i thought he was
40:49 talking about makeup like
40:51 batman 89 right nope he actually put it
40:54 in the
40:55 adhesive in the envelope that you would
40:58 lick to close
41:00 and luckily we don't do a lot of uh
41:02 mailing back and forth at this point in
41:04 our life right
41:05 now there are some i would say jewish
41:07 cards there's two
41:09 one is just a card with israel on it
41:11 well israel's been a hotbed
41:13 ever since it was created not a big
41:15 thing there the other one is the elders
41:17 of zion
41:18 which really talks to the zionistic
41:20 movement which is not a race
41:22 but a movement of individuals that from
41:25 all my
41:25 exploration is more of a banking cartel
41:28 movement than anything else they might
41:31 have other rituals that they associate
41:33 with
41:34 their uh activities but again
41:37 it's these are kind of old conspiracies
41:40 you might be new to them today you might
41:43 think that they were only
41:44 hatched and uncovered due to the
41:46 internet in the last 20 years
41:48 but go read books by people like bill
41:51 maher
41:51 and you'll realize there's some og dudes
41:53 out there that were tracking this stuff
41:55 for
41:56 for decades the second the bilderberg
41:57 group met in 1954
41:59 in the bilderberg hotel of the
42:00 netherlands certain people
42:03 took notice and they realized what all
42:05 these people doing
42:06 how come all these world leaders and
42:07 kings and queens and their proxies are
42:09 showing up to this hotel
42:11 and then they started getting rumors out
42:12 of that that it was actually
42:14 sort of a head hunting agency as well as
42:17 a
42:18 agency that will pass out once a year
42:20 your walking
42:22 papers as to what you're going to do for
42:23 the next 12 months
42:25 thus controlling the planet now there's
42:27 a low-hanging fruit card called tidal
42:29 wave
42:30 now someone might say oh fukushima look
42:32 at that boy super predicted this thing
42:35 and what about the 2004 tsunami they
42:38 killed
42:39 what 280 000 people in the world tidal
42:42 waves happen every once in a while
42:44 there are movies with tidal waves prior
42:46 to 1994.
42:47 not a big deal another card was nuclear
42:50 accident
42:51 okay chernobyl happened in the mid 80s
42:55 is that a huge stretch that someone
42:56 would create a card that did exactly the
42:58 same thing
42:59 now two other cards which i think were
43:00 fairly insightful was
43:02 the i think low-hanging fruit
43:05 totalitarian mechanism which is called
43:07 censorship
43:08 that's pretty on point right what
43:10 censorship well you can't be a free
43:12 citizen the first amendment goes away
43:15 and pretty much 2020 in a nutshell
43:19 but the other card was actually i think
43:23 fairly edgy for the time which was
43:24 political correctness it was definitely
43:26 a full swing by 94
43:28 and they realized that that was the same
43:30 thing as censorship
43:31 now one of the cards that i have not
43:33 seen
43:34 pushed to the forefront in most of the
43:37 reviews which again it's
43:38 it's almost like the um someone you know
43:41 a bunch of you realize that
43:43 rumors had been surrounding nikola tesla
43:45 creating this death ray
43:47 which he just called the weapon to end
43:48 all wars
43:50 and when i went out to research it it's
43:52 been scrubbed
43:53 badly i mean you can go to duckduckgo
43:56 and search and it's still just
43:57 tiny ridiculous episodes where no one's
43:59 really getting into tesla's life in his
44:01 invention
44:02 patent history which we did in episode
44:04 500
44:05 but this next card is called pizza for
44:08 the secret meeting
44:09 for those of you who follow a particular
44:12 letter in the alphabet
44:14 this is a big deal bizarre card
44:18 pizza and a secret meeting man like what
44:22 i don't see any logic in that in 1994
44:26 and i will say that i forget this young
44:29 woman's name
44:31 i mean this girl looked like she was
44:32 under 18 years old and she was so awake
44:34 it was crazy i don't think everything it
44:36 was
44:37 she misquoted some dates and stuff on
44:39 accident but
44:40 her big concern was that
44:44 a game could be released in 1995 slash
44:46 94
44:48 and someone in the on the internet could
44:50 use photoshop
44:51 and illustrate cards that match the very
44:55 style of the card
44:56 that the cards do exist and then insert
45:00 that into the narrative
45:01 creating sort of a faux mandela effect
45:04 and these cards really don't exist
45:06 and so she went through
45:09 and researched legitimate
45:13 decks where people actually have these
45:14 cards and i think it's
45:16 i don't think anyone disputes that these
45:18 cards actually exist
45:20 now there's another card called and stay
45:22 dead
45:24 apparently the card is played after a
45:26 particular group has been
45:27 annihilated in the game but there must
45:30 be some methodology to resurrect
45:32 a group after it's been knocked out you
45:35 play this card on top of that card
45:37 as soon as the group gets destroyed and
45:40 it guarantees that they cannot resurrect
45:41 themselves
45:42 the gentleman inside the cards artwork
45:46 kind of looks like the guy from
45:47 poltergeist 2 the weird weird preacher
45:50 guy
45:51 who in real life is an actor that
45:52 suffered a a slight
45:55 well i would say significant burn on his
45:57 face but only slightly shows up nowadays
46:00 it's kind of got a colonel sanders tie
46:02 on and that sort of thing because kind
46:03 of long white hair
46:04 and they're associating this with julian
46:06 assange
46:08 who has a very similar shot of him with
46:10 the hair and it is it is amazing that
46:12 when you become famous
46:14 there are so many photographs taken of
46:16 you from so many different angles
46:17 that if there's any remnant of artwork
46:19 that could remotely be associated with
46:21 you
46:22 they can find this shot where it it
46:26 aligns with your artwork there's a kind
46:29 of a funny card to me which is called
46:31 vatican city
46:33 and it's essentially you play the card
46:35 and no one can mess with you
46:37 because you have card blinds to do
46:39 whatever you want
46:40 now by 1994 for those of you who
46:44 remember the late 80s were
46:46 just saturated with all of these reports
46:48 about
46:50 members of the catholic church being
46:52 busted for
46:54 hundreds and hundreds of pedophilia
46:57 cases
46:58 i think the very first one i ever heard
47:00 this guy had over 500 pedophilia cases
47:02 against him
47:03 and this is when we found out that the
47:05 vatican had been paying attorneys
47:06 to defend the cases move these guys all
47:09 over the world
47:10 such that if say he was a pedophile in
47:12 america they might move them to
47:13 argentina
47:15 to avoid extradition and kind of wipe
47:18 the whole slate clean
47:20 now one of the other cards that i
47:21 thought was fairly ingenious
47:23 but again not a huge stretch for 1994
47:27 is called orbital mind control or mine
47:30 lasers excuse me
47:31 so it's mind control orbital mind
47:33 control lasers
47:35 look at that right it shows the
47:37 gentleman
47:39 kind of zombified by a ray from above
47:41 him
47:44 not a stretch at all for the technology
47:46 that was being rumored
47:47 at the time again you this isn't quite
47:51 exactly on target
47:53 but again if the geeks had read about
47:55 harp
47:56 patents this is in the patent list okay
47:59 so that's what they do they get into
48:02 eclectic things it's interesting
48:04 obviously they read the book the
48:05 illuminati trilogy
48:06 again i don't know if that's in there or
48:08 not there was a game released
48:11 about 1993 i believe which is called uh
48:14 demand to conquer by westwood studios in
48:16 las vegas
48:18 notorious game for any of you remember
48:20 it and they had in the game and ion
48:22 cannon
48:23 where you could zap a building from
48:24 space and just nuke it out of existence
48:27 well that's about as fringy as
48:32 controlling someone's mind from space
48:36 again most of us realize that our brain
48:38 operates on
48:39 you know infinitesimal amounts of
48:43 electricity so beaming down electricity
48:46 over us
48:47 just strong enough to penetrate the
48:48 scope before cell phone towers
48:50 provided such a mechanism in everyone's
48:52 neighborhood
48:53 wasn't a stretch i have to say in my
48:57 normal journey of life up to 1994
49:00 meaning
49:01 very little conspiracy was ever
49:02 communicated to me when i was
49:05 of that age you know we had the moon
49:07 mission conspiracy probably
49:08 we had jfk assassination right
49:12 maybe some other little low-hanging ones
49:13 but no one really had
49:15 just even the conception that a person
49:18 like jeffrey epstein would have
49:19 ever existed once you hear it you're
49:22 kind of like oh yeah i can see how that
49:24 works probably happened by accident at
49:26 first
49:27 where someone gets caught with a
49:29 underage
49:30 person and then you can blackmail them
49:32 to death if you don't want to
49:33 just turn them into the police right now
49:35 at this point i'm going to
49:36 stop reviewing the individual cards
49:38 because we could go
49:39 forever i think that's enough cards that
49:42 you kind of understand
49:44 my take on this thing and i think we
49:46 need to make a distinction here
49:48 with you know this this era has been
49:51 very very interesting if you've ever
49:54 considered yourself asleep at one point
49:56 and then awake at another point you were
49:58 blue pilled
49:59 and then you were red pilled and you're
50:01 excited about it you're excited about
50:02 finding
50:03 things out because life has never made
50:06 sense to you in certain
50:07 realms of you know consideration
50:10 and then all of a sudden you get red
50:12 pilled and certain totally unexplainable
50:14 things make sense and why are we doing
50:16 that why is this happening why would the
50:18 government do that why would we be
50:19 war here and all sudden those answers
50:22 start coming in
50:23 really strong possibilities what can
50:26 happen
50:27 in the midst of that excitement
50:30 that red pill excitement is that things
50:33 like this get thrown in there
50:35 and it's not at all
50:38 bad to review these things and to
50:41 to go in like i've said several times in
50:44 episodes to believe it for a few days
50:46 or weeks just to see if you can maintain
50:49 that belief
50:50 it's dangerous you have to be careful
50:51 you need to be really awake and
50:54 alive and being able to be able to pull
50:56 out of it
50:57 as soon as possible or if you need to
51:00 because sometimes people can fall into
51:01 rabbit holes and then they can't climb
51:03 out
51:04 but this entire the blanket over the
51:07 whole
51:08 thing really stems directly back
51:11 to the concept of predictive programming
51:13 that someone might
51:15 feed game designers this idea
51:19 and they're like complete innocent
51:20 people they're just great game designers
51:23 and so they're like oh okay yeah sure
51:24 you know whatever
51:25 ding ting ting ting ting for my
51:29 analysis of this game and my knowledge
51:33 be it limited or extensive of reality
51:36 that i've
51:36 lived through i personally do not see
51:42 any sort of black and white proof
51:45 that this stuff is
51:49 really a predictive programming exercise
51:51 if anything else
51:53 if nothing else i should say it would be
51:56 a really good exercise to understand
51:59 the game because it would equip you with
52:02 potential realities
52:04 that exist in your future if any one of
52:07 these conspiracies come true and i'll
52:08 give you a real world example of what
52:10 i'm talking about
52:11 i once talked to a guy who was a very
52:14 senior military person
52:16 who was in charge of various command
52:19 groups in the theater of war in the
52:22 middle east
52:23 this was probably about 2010.
52:26 i had uh probably been about five years
52:29 into some of the more popular
52:31 you know thought processes of the red
52:33 pill experience
52:35 and i talked to this guy and i said well
52:36 what do you guys as soldiers think about
52:38 these
52:39 heavy duty conspiracies most of them at
52:41 the time were related to 2001
52:44 and the guy told me something very
52:45 interesting only two things i think that
52:47 were very fascinating he said well
52:50 he goes understand this he goes all of
52:52 our guys meaning the soldiers
52:53 all the way up to the command level he
52:55 says we've heard
52:57 your theories and he said
53:01 we're not convinced they're true but we
53:04 know
53:04 what behaviors would occur at the upper
53:07 level
53:08 of the command structure of the military
53:09 and government
53:11 if they were real and so he said
53:14 if we see the behavior that coincides
53:16 with your theories
53:18 meaning perhaps the takeover of america
53:20 or something like that
53:22 because we will activate against the
53:25 upper tier
53:26 of the government and neutralize the
53:29 threat
53:30 and i thought that was very interesting
53:32 statement it was like one i i love when
53:34 someone says something i couldn't
53:36 possibly have conceived before they said
53:38 it and that was one of them
53:40 and i somehow through the conversation
53:43 within the next two minutes
53:45 i said something to the effect of well
53:47 why is that
53:48 and he said well he goes every soldier
53:50 who's ever been to war
53:52 has lost a partner due to war
53:55 you know someone gets killed and he goes
53:59 here we are swearing to the constitution
54:02 defending the constitution which
54:04 really means everything that's in the
54:06 constitution plus protecting the vote
54:09 because if the vote isn't protected then
54:10 a country goes down really fast right
54:12 and it's 2020 problem and he said there
54:15 are graves
54:16 all over the world full of soldiers and
54:19 he goes
54:20 perhaps you've seen veterans visit their
54:23 buddies graves the
54:25 the vietnam wall you know with all the
54:28 names of people that died in vietnam
54:30 and these guys will make pilgrimages
54:32 completely across the
54:33 country just to stand in front of their
54:36 body's name and say you know i miss you
54:37 bro
54:38 and so he said if what you're saying
54:42 were true then all of those graves get
54:45 immediately compromised
54:48 because it was a pointless exercise
54:52 now again for those of you just coming
54:54 in for the game itself
54:56 you're probably fairly red pilled which
54:58 is why you're interested in the subject
54:59 to begin with
55:00 what i want to put out there before the
55:02 show's over here
55:05 is that there's a correlation between
55:08 predictive programming
55:09 frequencies and the
55:12 the velocity of which those that would
55:15 those that want to engineer the world
55:18 are moving
55:19 so let's say you want to make a
55:20 tremendous number of changes to a
55:23 society within 10 years
55:26 remember agenda 21 has been rebranded
55:28 agenda 2030
55:30 some pretty scary objectives within that
55:33 plan one being the reduction of world
55:35 population by 97 percent
55:37 as a minimum that's just rounding up
55:40 okay so if you want
55:44 to maintain any level of control over
55:47 billions of people on the world like on
55:50 the world surface
55:51 then you have to help them
55:54 digest the undigestable
55:58 it's almost as if you're giving them a
56:00 little probiotic
56:02 of horror so that when these horrors
56:04 come true
56:06 someone in a family can say uh well you
56:08 know
56:09 i always knew this was possible and it's
56:11 just the way the world works you know
56:14 that's coming down children spouses
56:16 relatives what have you
56:17 friends getting everyone on board
56:20 i don't think without a gigantic change
56:24 to the over
56:25 all consensus of reality
56:28 okay that we're going to see any
56:31 reduction
56:32 in predictive programming i think over
56:33 the next 10 years
56:35 you are going to see an apocalyptic
56:37 level of predictive programming
56:39 unless we can neutralize those who
56:42 actually
56:43 are engaging in these negative
56:45 activities against mankind
56:47 i think the greatest value of the game
56:52 in 2020 which again let's think about
56:55 this is
56:55 26 years ago this game was released
56:58 but again i haven't read the the book
57:00 that they read in 1975
57:03 but the best value that you can get out
57:06 of a kind of a fun way to think about
57:08 things
57:09 is imagine this we
57:12 believe some of us that there is
57:15 predictive programming
57:16 to make us digest horrors that they have
57:19 planned for our future
57:20 which will then through problem reaction
57:22 solution
57:24 change the world for the worse thus
57:27 moving more power and wealth
57:28 up more poverty and tyranny down below
57:33 but now imagine and this is already
57:35 occurring and many many of you know this
57:37 imagine that we used predictive
57:40 programming
57:42 to help it's probably the wrong term
57:45 it's probably reality programming in
57:48 these
57:49 more fun vessels like a game a card game
57:54 where you could just pull the game out
57:56 with let's just say a bunch of blue pill
57:57 people
57:58 and you say you want to play this game
58:00 it's really cool you don't say anything
58:02 about anything being linked to any
58:04 conspiracies or anything like that in
58:06 real life but you just play the game
58:09 and keep playing it you have to learn
58:11 the rules really really well so you can
58:13 get people to play the game super fast
58:14 with you
58:16 again it's it's sad that the current
58:18 game looks really goofy but maybe even
58:19 that's better
58:21 for smuggling in like a trojan horse
58:24 the truth into a blue pills person's
58:26 mind now i would suggest a little bit of
58:28 caution
58:29 because you could have someone be fairly
58:32 neurotic
58:33 that might go balls to the wall
58:36 crazy with some of these things and you
58:39 know trying to
58:40 bring them back or reign them back from
58:43 losing their life
58:45 into these theories could actually occur
58:48 so you you have to be the judge of who's
58:50 sort of mature enough to to digest these
58:53 in a very intellectual way
58:57 but i think playing this game today will
58:59 introduce all the fundamental concepts
59:01 of
59:01 potential control over society
59:05 as well as if some of these cards are
59:07 played down the one thing i couldn't
59:08 figure out
59:09 because i didn't receive the the
59:12 terrorist new card in any of the
59:13 expansion packs that i had the boosters
59:15 or the new starter kit for the 2018
59:17 version of the game
59:19 whether or not that card still exists i
59:20 would imagine out of sensitivity for
59:23 those affected by that day they probably
59:26 pulled that card
59:27 out of the new deck or at least change
59:30 the artwork
59:31 such that it doesn't look so intense but
59:33 i have never seen in my research
59:35 the redrawing of that card and what's
59:37 really weird about it as i don't
59:39 see um there's a lot of new cards in the
59:42 in the new one but i don't see
59:44 i haven't seen i should say anyone show
59:47 the old card in the new card
59:48 the new ones are really different i mean
59:50 in terms of their look and feel
59:52 you know i might simply like the older
59:54 game because i
59:55 i'm i'm older you know who knows but
59:57 there's new cards like hipster
60:00 and i think i believe i remember steve
60:02 jackson saying that in the 1994 version
60:05 they had yuppies a yuppie card
60:09 and there's it's really funny because
60:11 i'm probably the youngest you could be
60:13 to really remember yuppies being a thing
60:17 which was this group of people in the
60:18 80s who drove 320
60:21 i bmws and they're
60:24 they were just sort of i don't know a
60:28 weird tail grabbing group of people that
60:31 were trying to gain status through just
60:33 purchasing
60:34 minimum items to qualify to be a hip
60:38 a yuppie excuse me it was like a hipster
60:40 hipster is the new card
60:42 so i saw an interview with him just
60:44 prior to the 2018 release
60:46 by 2017 he was talking about updating
60:48 the cards
60:49 and what have you now one of the
60:51 episodes we're gonna do
60:53 this season is a full review of ipad
60:55 goat 2.
60:57 if you want to really see something that
60:58 is legit
61:00 in terms of there's no monetization
61:04 it must have cost a tremendous amount of
61:06 money to make
61:08 if you've seen my intro you know that
61:10 i've got a fairly good
61:11 versed mind in what it would take to
61:13 create
61:14 special effects especially of the almost
61:17 pixar level
61:18 animation in ipico 2.
61:22 there's a huge bunch of
61:25 conflicting claims about the creation of
61:28 that particular animated cartoon
61:31 it is for some people
61:34 the most fascinating thing you've ever
61:36 seen for me i was just
61:38 i felt like there was a huge negative
61:40 vibe out of it but there was also this
61:42 fascinating vibe of
61:45 i would say the next 50 years of their
61:47 plans but if you haven't seen it it's a
61:49 the most bizarre computer animated
61:53 animation i've seen it is utterly
61:55 brilliant in its construction in its art
61:57 direction
61:57 its 3d modeling and its animation but it
62:00 has
62:02 these very trade center looking
62:04 buildings collapsing it has the
62:07 notre dame falling at the end which we
62:10 know now is burned
62:11 and we have photographic proof that some
62:14 very famous people were
62:16 in paris at the time sipping wine
62:19 watching it occur just go look up notre
62:22 dame fire
62:23 reflection and wine glass and you'll
62:25 find out what i'm talking about
62:27 but there's a jesus character in that
62:30 cartoon that is
62:32 littered with every sort of belief
62:35 system that we have created on earth
62:36 with
62:37 your illuminati pyramid with the
62:39 all-seeing eye
62:41 on i believe the forehead but it's on a
62:43 couple times on this on this
62:45 kind of weird effigy of christ
62:49 and for those of you that are um really
62:52 into this kind of thing
62:53 if you are familiar with the denver
62:57 airport murals
63:00 if you ever watch the two or three hour
63:03 if not even more documentaries on that
63:07 collection of of paintings you again
63:10 have an artist very similar to the ipad
63:13 go to or the guy who
63:14 supposedly created it gives a bunch of
63:17 weird excuses
63:19 and and descriptions of how it was
63:21 created but again
63:22 for the layman that doesn't work in
63:24 special effects or hollywood
63:26 those answers might be satisfactory to
63:28 you
63:29 once you're in the industry you look at
63:30 you're like what he just said about how
63:33 this thing was created
63:34 is conclusive proof that this guy is
63:38 lying about the way it was created
63:40 that's my opinion of the situation but
63:42 they have painted these things
63:44 and you know millions of people normally
63:46 when
63:47 we can fly normally walk by these things
63:49 every day and they're getting programmed
63:50 by them
63:51 and it's got some pretty disturbing
63:53 imagery
63:55 not to mention lucifer the big giant
63:57 devil horse
63:58 outside of the airport of which the guy
64:00 who
64:02 crafted it died falling off of it which
64:05 i think is so ironic
64:07 so we're going to be cranking out shows
64:08 quite a bit in season six
64:10 right off the bat to kind of uh reward
64:13 you folks who are
64:14 diehards who have been waiting patiently
64:17 i want to thank you guys
64:18 so much for uh waiting for this thing to
64:20 come about
64:22 i've got some pretty interesting stories
64:24 to share as a result of creating this
64:26 new intro
64:27 it's actually created some interesting
64:29 buzz for me which is kind of cool
64:32 but if you haven't been to
64:33 deepthoughtsradio.com please go that's
64:35 where everything is
64:36 again if you're looking for episodes
64:39 that are perhaps like this one
64:40 or other categories all the categories
64:43 of
64:44 episodes are on that website we have two
64:47 reliable video sources
64:50 i'm obviously researching alternatives
64:52 given the crazy
64:55 channels channel cancelization that's
64:58 been going on here
65:00 in october 2020. uh the only thing
65:02 that's happened to me is there was an
65:04 episode about
65:05 sharing conspiracies and it was
65:08 they sent me an email saying that they
65:09 had changed the age restriction
65:11 for that episode which i don't
65:13 understand because the entire channel is
65:15 age restricted
65:16 because i in the past use a lot of foul
65:19 language
65:20 and probably will every once in a while
65:22 moving forward
65:23 i don't want underage people hearing
65:25 that
65:26 being influenced this is an adult
65:28 channel doesn't matter how old you are
65:30 if you're an adult in the head
65:31 this is for you we have all the
65:33 podcasting you would ever
65:35 we have social media which is a locked
65:38 facebook group
65:39 which in the last two days we have had a
65:42 tremendous number of our posts
65:45 either removed or flagged as being false
65:48 with the obviously impending threat that
65:50 the page will get destroyed
65:53 if that occurs what i'll probably do is
65:56 start juicing up the minds.com page
65:59 i don't know if i want to fight the
66:01 zuckerberg wars of censorship
66:04 but they're all getting called to the
66:05 hill so we'll find this very interesting
66:08 uh tampering with an election is pretty
66:10 serious charge
66:12 i do tweet every once in a while and
66:15 again it's just
66:16 more of uh just kind of following stuff
66:18 it
66:19 the feed i get is all pretty much the
66:20 same stuff not a lot going on there
66:23 but again we have mines.com which is a
66:25 beautiful copy of facebook
66:27 and then gab.com which is several
66:30 iterations of features behind everyone
66:32 else
66:33 so i kind of throw out there i did also
66:35 join parlor
66:36 the parlor is a security nightmare to
66:38 log into
66:40 and just doesn't quite have the
66:41 viewership that's there
66:43 and they you know they've already linked
66:45 it you know erroneously to
66:48 bad groups in the world trying to
66:50 demonize it you know
66:52 my gosh it's unbelievable we also have
66:54 an all
66:55 remastered season one so for those of
66:57 you looking for episodes that i'm
66:59 referencing and you're like where the
67:00 hell
67:00 are these things you might find a link
67:03 to a legacy video from the past that is
67:06 still
67:07 active but it's unlisted but i
67:10 remastered them all
67:11 everything's on bit shoot everything's
67:13 on youtube again the website is your
67:15 friend to find all the episodes again if
67:17 we ever got banned
67:18 from youtube then what we would do is uh
67:21 we go through the website 530 entries
67:24 and update everything to a bitcoin or
67:26 that bitcoin a bit shoot url
67:30 hopefully that you know we're we're not
67:32 too deep into the uh
67:33 the crazy stuff we're more about
67:35 improving the cell from
67:37 a subatomic level up there are a few
67:41 ways to donate
67:42 to the page and again you folks have
67:44 been absolutely generous
67:45 through patreon and through paypal
67:48 so there'll be some new names in the
67:50 credits this year
67:52 again what you get for donating anything
67:54 is you getting the credits if you want
67:56 if you don't want to be any credits you
67:57 gotta let me know
67:57 only have one person petition out but uh
68:01 you'll be in there for the rest of your
68:02 life
68:02 if you're an active donator then your
68:04 name is big and if you're just a pass
68:06 donator your name is just in the credits
68:08 at normal
68:09 font level but i thank you either way
68:12 i was able to use some of the donations
68:15 to
68:16 get the intro done at a much faster pace
68:19 using a render farm
68:20 so that was very very helpful so again
68:23 very much appreciate it
68:25 anyway take care of yourself and someone
68:27 else and i'll see you in the next deep
