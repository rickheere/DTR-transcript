00:56 so
01:24 hmm
01:29 hello my patreons
01:35 i i i've had a busy day
01:39 bouncing around i got up late my body
01:42 just said
01:42 stay in bed so i thought i'd create a
01:46 video exclusively for you guys
01:51 i wish i could make a video that's just
01:52 utterly protected for you guys
02:06 what i'm going to do in this video
02:09 is not edit it at all
02:16 it's not exactly as cold as it looks out
02:18 here but um right
02:22 i just put the cap on just in case
02:26 now this is a fake cohiba
02:30 i don't even know where my friend gets
02:31 these things uh he's a he owns a cigar
02:34 place
02:35 and people just give them crap last time
02:37 i spoke one of these it was one of the
02:38 grossest things i've ever smoked
02:40 so i thought i would share it with you
02:46 so i keep thinking about
02:50 you know some sort of reward system for
02:52 you guys donating to the show because
02:55 no matter how small or big your donation
02:58 is you're
02:59 parting with your calorie energy for the
03:02 show
03:02 and it's it's very humbling
03:06 it really is you know
03:09 it's that old saying you know it's the
03:10 meaning that counts sort of thing
03:13 and that's exactly the situation
03:20 so i thought with this i'm doing some
03:23 laundry
03:24 i've eaten late so i've gotta uh
03:28 digest my food so hey man you're gonna
03:30 get all the little burps and
03:32 hiccups and stuff
03:35 i've i've debated doing a show where i
03:38 don't edit it and i just think the
03:41 problem is is some of the content in my
03:43 opinion i think is
03:44 is good and will attract new people and
03:47 if they see me
03:48 you know clearing my throat or
03:52 burping in the mic or something which
03:54 happens every episode pretty much
03:59 i just don't think that they they might
04:00 walk away where they would otherwise
04:02 stay
04:02 you know
04:05 so i thought i would just ramble a
04:08 little bit for you guys
04:09 i have no idea how long the stick's
04:11 gonna last and how long
04:13 i'm gonna last this looks like about a
04:14 30
04:16 minute to 45 minute stick it's probably
04:18 short filler
04:20 cheap sticks are okay as long as they
04:22 don't they're not made like crap you
04:23 know
04:27 what happens i'm just going to share
04:29 some stuff just randomly with you
04:31 that i have discovered since making
04:33 these kind of shows
04:35 because i had never done anything like
04:36 this in my entire lifetime
04:39 whereas a super long format before mk
04:42 ultra radio
04:44 which was all audio which made it very
04:46 easy to edit
04:47 i just watched an audio track cut it up
04:50 there was no dissolves there were no
04:52 pictures
04:53 and so it was good it was good training
04:57 to be in that
05:02 took us a while to find the hardware to
05:05 handle the two mic situation i still
05:10 have a box that cool j gave me that does
05:12 two mics
05:12 but it's it's i don't understand why
05:16 it's a digit design box it's about an
05:18 eight hundred dollar box
05:20 and they just digit design just com
05:22 almost completely
05:23 abandoned the machine which is nuts i
05:26 mean
05:26 it's a premium customer who should be
05:29 taken care of it's really strange but
05:30 anyway i got this new one that's
05:32 pretty badass little box
05:36 but what i found by doing shows like
05:39 this
05:40 is that when you talk like when you talk
05:43 and you don't stop talking
05:45 for a really long time there's somehow
05:47 you know there's your chest muscles that
05:50 if you go on a big diatribe like i do
05:54 it tightens up it tightens up tightens
05:56 up and then you
05:58 need to suck in some air and it will
06:03 of course i'm i just ate some food i'm
06:05 smoking a stick and so you can get a
06:07 little bit of like
06:09 congestion which makes me clear my
06:12 throat
06:13 and it's funny because all the throat
06:14 clearing usually happens either
06:16 right at the very beginning where i've
06:19 also realized
06:20 it's just notes in case you want to make
06:21 a show like this
06:23 if i've been inside my house and i've
06:25 been toiling away i'm doing something
06:28 and i'm not talking to anybody
06:29 i didn't get any phone calls
06:32 i uh will come out here and start
06:35 talking and and that's when you realize
06:36 you got a bunch of goop in your throat
06:38 it's really funny but then after a while
06:40 you keep talking talking talking and
06:42 it's just like
06:43 just through the tenseness of your
06:45 abdomen
06:46 uh it seems to
06:50 get you everyone's well you know
06:55 i have learned not to eat right before
06:56 doing the show that's that's definitely
06:58 a
06:58 big gotcha
07:02 i think also what you folks will notice
07:04 since
07:05 you know you're really my hardcore
07:08 listeners
07:09 if you go back to the season one and i
07:12 think
07:13 i haven't marked them private i marked
07:15 them unlisted on this channel you can
07:16 get to season one episodes but they're
07:19 they're marked private that way if
07:22 someone's embedded somewhere
07:23 you can still see it and i just had a
07:25 comment on episode 26 of the old school
07:28 uh what's kind of cool about it is you
07:30 get to hear the original intros that i
07:32 put together
07:34 but man you know i had the mic like this
07:36 really super close
07:38 and just god-awful
07:50 the other one is just there's so many i
07:53 didn't edit much you know i just let
07:54 everything go
07:56 and so every single mistake is in there
07:59 and i just feel like
08:01 it's not a hubris thing of me trying to
08:03 correct all my issues
08:05 some of it is just your time is valuable
08:09 and so i i edit to make sure you get a
08:12 nice thing plus
08:14 obviously what i create in the video
08:17 is now becoming the mp3 which is used
08:20 for the
08:23 podcast so they're identical they've
08:24 been identical for years
08:32 so i thought i would share a little
08:35 kind of walk through and maybe i'll put
08:37 some photographs together for you
08:40 to show you a bit of my world on the
08:43 inside
08:49 so as you know my primary job that i
08:52 used to pay my bills
08:54 not just a hobby on the side is writing
08:56 film
08:58 but that comes and goes because you have
09:01 to find a studio that's looking for a
09:03 film and they have to
09:05 dig on you and trust you and have a
09:06 project and you have to be the right
09:08 person for it and all that kind of stuff
09:10 and so just prior to 2020
09:15 i had a studio it's a very small
09:18 studio in san diego see one of my
09:21 episodes
09:22 as a matter of fact this was what was
09:24 shocking
09:25 and he had been bothering me for
09:27 probably and i say that
09:29 lovingly he'd been approaching me for
09:32 the entire summer of 2019
09:34 probably even starting around may and he
09:36 was like dude dude you know i want you
09:38 to write this film for me
09:40 and i thought it was like a listener
09:42 that was
09:45 wanted me to do it for free that's the
09:46 first thing
09:50 and i just i just didn't have any ideas
09:52 so finally i reached out to this guy
09:54 and he's like let me come visit you i'm
09:56 in san diego
09:57 you're in huntington beach which is
09:58 about an hour and a half apart
10:01 i said okay got nothing to lose man he
10:04 comes up and he's
10:04 a film school graduate he tells me i saw
10:07 one of your videos and he goes i just
10:09 watched your other videos and he goes
10:10 man
10:11 we're really of like mind and so
10:15 i'm going to hire you for this film i
10:17 said great
10:23 now the mechanism by which he gets his
10:25 money
10:27 is like every other person's mechanism
10:29 they go up and they go down so we get
10:31 started
10:32 and i i was contracting for these
10:35 two young guys in long beach
10:39 just literally out of sheer curiosity i
10:41 found them and i said you know you guys
10:42 want to help
10:45 and they said yeah and so i started
10:46 working for them well they got screwed
10:48 over by amazon
10:50 servers who has a whole scam about the
10:52 second you sign up they
10:54 give your credentials to companies in
10:57 asia
10:58 from japan to china to korea and those
11:01 folks use up your account
11:03 charging you hundreds of thousands of
11:05 dollars
11:06 and then they come back to you and they
11:08 say oh you lost your credentials
11:10 and so you need to pay this big giant
11:12 bill so they managed to escape the first
11:16 scam of amazon doing that and then while
11:19 i was working for them
11:21 we just literally spun up a server five
11:23 minutes passes
11:25 here comes another scam brand new
11:28 credentials no way we lost them amazon's
11:30 handing these things out
11:37 so the serendipitous timing was amazing
11:39 these kids are looking at me going
11:41 because they get this phone call and
11:42 they're like they have to pay twenty
11:43 thousand dollars
11:45 i said don't pay the twenty thousand
11:47 dollars move to a different server i
11:49 don't care what you gotta do
11:50 and that was an option but they said
11:54 well
11:55 we just ramped up and you know we got to
11:56 pay this thing and
11:58 and uh so they go we can't pay you for
12:00 at least
12:02 you know a few months here while we're
12:04 chasing away this bill we don't have the
12:05 20
12:06 000 so that's the other big problem i
12:08 said well i just landed a film contract
12:10 so
12:11 i'll go ride the film you guys do what
12:14 you got to do
12:15 well that was the tail end of 2019
12:18 and of course we know what happened in
12:20 20 2020
12:22 by by march
12:25 when they would have normally brought me
12:27 back in which i
12:28 i was working on a bunch of other stuff
12:30 but uh they were squeezed
12:32 and so but the dude who was financing
12:35 this film
12:36 had to take a hiatus about halfway
12:37 through because the way he gets his
12:39 money
12:40 and the investment just dips you know
12:42 comes in a ghost sort of thing
12:53 so then fast forward to this end of this
12:56 year
12:58 into last year i should say beginning of
13:00 this year and i finally i know that his
13:02 business
13:02 is doing really really well so i just
13:04 reached out to him and he goes thank you
13:05 so much man
13:07 he goes i need people to do that to me
13:09 because i'm ready to go i just have too
13:11 much going on
13:12 here's a lot going on so we ramped back
13:16 up
13:17 i just finished a first draft and he is
13:19 super duper happy
13:21 with his associates
13:26 and we were meeting tomorrow to go
13:29 through that
13:34 yeah so the other thing i did was i
13:37 as i've told you guys part of the intro
13:41 is to create a portfolio piece to prove
13:44 my abilities in
13:45 blender 3d but 3d in general which is
13:47 hard surface modeling
13:48 modeling the organic modeling stuff
13:52 you know you can create a monster or a
13:54 person i need to get into that i've got
13:56 to do
13:57 designed on paper it's just extremely
14:00 time consuming
14:02 and you know with 2020 hollywood turned
14:06 off
14:06 right my agency laid off 60 of their
14:09 people
14:10 agents quit because they were like hey
14:12 man i'm just sitting here doing nothing
14:14 you're not moving anything through the
14:16 system so a lot of these guys have
14:18 salaries and they rely on the residuals
14:20 of signed projects
14:22 to survive this is all the shuffling
14:26 around
14:26 which will usually turn out to be sort
14:28 of a blessing in disguise
14:30 because an agent signed up to one
14:31 particular agency
14:33 can only go to that person to get
14:36 anything to move forward
14:38 and if they pop out they know everybody
14:40 in the industry and they could talk to
14:41 any agency what so
14:43 whatsoever and whoever's interested is
14:45 interested it just widens your playing
14:47 field
14:55 so the other business i work on
14:58 and was just doing really well in
15:02 was doing 3d for projects
15:05 like restaurants and office complexes
15:09 and everything under the sun in terms of
15:11 interior design
15:12 needing to prove their concepts in 3d
15:17 but here comes march last year
15:20 and they're being shut down
15:24 which canceled a few projects i mean i
15:26 literally had checks that were
15:28 supposedly in the mail
15:31 and then they disappeared they vanished
15:34 while in transit
15:36 yeah right they just didn't pay their
15:38 bill they were all lying
15:41 but that dude's just recently come back
15:44 so it's pretty cool
15:45 they just got nabbed you know i mean
15:46 they just had a problem and here they
15:48 can't even open their restaurants
15:50 and the restaurants actually i didn't
15:52 know this
15:53 and it makes complete sense but just
15:55 never occurred to me because nothing
15:56 like this has ever happened in history
16:00 they can't afford to fire or lay off
16:03 their chefs
16:05 because a lot of chefs are three and
16:06 four and five star chefs
16:08 really it's four and five and so they've
16:10 learned these giant menus
16:13 they've learned and designed their own
16:14 meals and so they have to stay on
16:16 payroll and so how these guys were able
16:20 to pay off these dudes
16:22 it blows me away i mean some of these
16:24 guys are making deep six-figure salaries
16:27 and now they're just sitting around
16:28 waiting
16:31 so there's a huge lull
16:34 in this whole thing due to this thing
16:36 that happened
16:42 then we had a few stragglers that stayed
16:44 on board
16:46 try to help me ends me but i blew a ton
16:48 of savings last year
16:50 just trying to stay alive you know it's
16:53 just nuts
16:55 and that's how they squeeze this right
16:56 you know they create these crazies and
16:59 then we have to
17:01 deal with them and you know i don't want
17:02 to get into a big
17:04 negative spin on this thing but it just
17:07 fascinates me how
17:10 we how banks are allowed to act like it
17:13 doesn't happen
17:14 but realtors have to acknowledge it
17:17 right
17:17 everyone collecting rent
17:21 gets stiffed because the government's
17:23 screwing the people
17:25 and banks just get to continue going as
17:28 if nothing has occurred
17:29 this is weird
17:37 it's a weird world right
17:43 these are the big pauses that happen
17:45 that you never see
17:47 i just sit and think about it
17:51 yeah so i do have really good feeling
17:53 about 2021
17:54 and for multiple reasons i think that
17:57 people are just tired of being cooped up
18:00 and everyone needs to get back to work
18:02 and everyone wants to get back to work
18:04 and what a blessing
18:04 to go from perhaps not like in your job
18:07 to like yeah i'm totally ready to get
18:08 out there and
18:10 make it happen yeah there's crazy
18:13 everywhere
18:14 yeah they take this less than a single
18:17 percent of world population that is
18:19 really struggling with their identity
18:21 and they keep pushing it up using media
18:23 and so
18:24 like tonight i went and went to one of
18:28 my favorite restaurants that i've
18:30 helped craft over the years
18:33 and i just got a little tiny peanut
18:35 butter stout this little tiny drink
18:38 and i sat there and i'm just trying to
18:40 chill i know half the people in the room
18:43 and one of my friends comes up and she
18:45 just wants to go into it man i think
18:47 she's had more drinks than me of course
18:48 but
18:49 she wants to go into all the negativity
18:50 and it's not to
18:52 she just needs to vent and so i let her
18:55 go for about 15 minutes and i was like
18:57 all right you're you're a huge debbie
19:00 downer man i'm paying for this drink i
19:01 didn't come here to get all
19:03 negative and she immediately got it she
19:05 was like gives me this giant hug and
19:07 she's like i'm sorry
19:08 that's good we can talk i just i don't
19:10 want to talk about this crap you know i
19:11 don't want you to pretend like this one
19:13 percent is a real percentage of human
19:14 beings that's going to change our world
19:16 they aren't they've got the
19:20 bullhorn to say they are but let's just
19:21 leave them out there in the field with
19:23 the sheep you know
19:24 while we go into town and actually live
19:26 life you know
19:33 what i want to try to do is
19:37 i'll take some photographs of the
19:40 backyard
19:41 which sounds absurd because who the hell
19:43 cares about what someone's backyard
19:44 looks like
19:45 but you guys have seen
19:48 hundreds and hundreds of episodes and
19:51 you know you only get this view right
19:52 here
19:53 and i did the couple over there earlier
19:55 this year
19:57 i thought i'd take you around it's
19:58 nothing uh nothing fancy
20:03 i'll show you my lab
20:07 now some of you attract me and we're
20:09 friends
20:10 on different channels and stuff or you
20:13 come over to my instagram
20:15 which i did finally open up my instagram
20:17 it's my last name
20:18 low lowe dot m-a-r-k
20:23 feel free to come on over and you get to
20:25 see a little
20:27 colorized version of my world
20:33 but i had a friend of mine i wanted to
20:34 share this with you guys because i like
20:36 to get your opinion too
20:39 but she was reading dinner and she says
20:41 well what do you want to do with
20:44 deep thoughts so well you know
20:47 i think that we are looking for some
20:50 catalyzing moment you know where people
20:52 like
20:53 us discover it there's no need to
20:56 discover folks that aren't like us
21:00 first the first step has to be that we
21:02 need to get
21:04 you know 50 to 100 000 people on
21:07 whatever platform it still exists and i
21:09 think youtube's gonna be okay with us
21:12 i'm not trying to pander to them the
21:14 only thing i've tried to do for season
21:15 six
21:16 out of requests from several
21:19 folks that are actually mothers
21:22 i mean i just want to say that is god
21:25 bless them they said look man i try to
21:26 listen to your show
21:28 but you swear and so
21:32 you know i thought about it i was like
21:33 well you know i've been swearing a
21:34 little bit recently but
21:36 i am and i'm trying to preface before i
21:39 say a dirty word so someone can
21:41 turn down the volume or something like
21:42 that but it is sort of unnecessary with
21:45 most episodes i don't need to be that
21:47 way
21:49 and what a shame that the information
21:51 can't get out to people because i'm
21:52 swearing
21:54 and obviously dialing back people are
21:56 going to find angrier episodes
21:59 and that's gonna occur you know moving
22:02 forward that was the big format change
22:03 for
22:04 six that i didn't really announce
22:07 but i'm sure you guys have noticed i'm
22:10 using
22:11 poopoo words now not the not the real
22:13 ones most the time
22:18 and my whole format with that you know
22:21 because i'm talking to you
22:23 usually about a subject and what's going
22:25 on as i've said a bunch of times in
22:27 episodes is i'm seeing the timeline
22:28 ahead of what i'm saying
22:30 and so
22:34 and this will happen to you too if you
22:36 do the same thing when you're presenting
22:38 and you present several times it'll
22:39 start
22:40 becoming a muscle
22:43 but i'll see something coming and i
22:45 decide
22:46 you know seconds before i actually use a
22:48 particular type of word
22:50 that i'm going to use that word at least
22:52 any foul
22:54 manner
22:57 and so this time around i've just chosen
23:00 to kind of like
23:01 take the other fork in the road sort of
23:06 thing
23:08 but she keeps asking me you know what i
23:10 want to do
23:12 and she said well i said you know it
23:14 would be nice to interview
23:15 a few intellectual people like graham
23:18 hancock or something
23:19 but i don't have anyone's phone number
23:22 you know i don't have an agency behind
23:24 me
23:24 for that particular reason because no
23:27 agency would be behind me unless we had
23:29 a studio
23:30 there's money coming through they're
23:32 making money off of it
23:33 but the second that a sponsor gets
23:35 involved
23:36 it's gonna compromise the whole show
23:42 and so you know what i
23:45 do what i told her was i said we can't
23:47 make the show something it's not
23:50 just to say it's been successful because
23:52 now we have
23:54 200 000 followers we have something very
23:57 special here in my opinion
23:59 i don't think there's any show on
24:03 youtube that is directly chartered
24:06 for what we do which is to make people
24:09 think
24:11 it's really just that simple
24:20 and what's weird about it is i knew i
24:22 was doing that
24:25 from the very first episode but i didn't
24:28 realize that that was what i was
24:31 trying to do to the audience i just knew
24:34 that if i talked about subjects you guys
24:36 would come along
24:37 you have to otherwise you wouldn't watch
24:39 it
24:42 what i think is a little sad and i don't
24:46 i'll never know the truth of the matter
24:48 is
24:50 obviously if i put out a nasa episode
24:53 i'm you know
24:53 relating to the moon mars something very
24:56 topical
24:57 ufo alien get a lot of onboarding
25:01 meaning new subs because we are
25:05 being messed with on this channel and
25:07 people getting kicked off the channel
25:09 without actually doing it
25:11 i mean i'm subbed to my own channel okay
25:14 but i will view on my television all day
25:16 long youtube and if i release a video
25:19 i'm never on my own feed
25:22 now sure and go down my channel my
25:24 videos or whatever but i have
25:25 alternate accounts that come in and i do
25:28 get a bit of a um
25:31 in my subscription side of the game i
25:34 get
25:35 immediately hey this dude put out a
25:37 video of course it's me
25:38 so that makes sense but if i go over to
25:40 recommended videos
25:42 i very rarely ever see my videos come up
25:45 and my own recommended videos
25:48 it's strange you know like i'm it's an
25:49 alternate account i use right
25:52 there's one of my name on it
25:57 but yeah so the the ongoing frustration
26:02 is that if i make what i think is a
26:04 really good esoteric kind of mind
26:08 thing like ancient minds or something
26:11 like that
26:12 you guys are getting it ten to one i
26:14 mean your comments are phenomenal you're
26:15 getting it
26:17 and i'm so shocked it's like i'll make
26:20 one of the most bizarre esoteric
26:23 episodes that turns me on like crazy
26:27 but then when i'm editing i'm like man i
26:29 don't know if anyone's you know they're
26:30 gonna just
26:31 finally dive off because they're like
26:33 this dude's lost his mind
26:35 or he's being a little repetitive with a
26:37 certain subject matter souls or
26:40 whatever and then i finally i just
26:43 immediately get back all this feedback
26:44 people go it's my favorite episode ever
26:49 and so there's this interesting thing
26:50 this interesting correlation
26:52 this connection between us you know
26:58 oh what i was going to offer you guys
27:01 who've been on this subscription for
27:02 quite a while
27:04 i don't know how to quantify it but
27:05 there's some of you been on here for
27:07 a year or plus is that we should be
27:10 doing some
27:13 some face time whatever product you like
27:15 you like zoom while you zoom you like
27:17 skype
27:17 skype and facebook chat facebook chat's
27:20 amazing i have to say man
27:22 i know we don't want these people
27:23 looking in on us but man it's so easy
27:26 so let me know if you would like to
27:30 schedule some time
27:33 and we'll do like half an hour an hour
27:34 whatever
27:36 doesn't matter we don't have any agenda
27:38 we'll just talk about your cat whatever
27:40 it is
27:45 if you could i'd like to do it in skype
27:49 now some people are kind of leery about
27:53 that because they're like oh i don't
27:54 look pretty enough or whatever
27:56 you know come on that's don't worry
27:58 about that
27:59 now you can turn off your your video or
28:01 i don't have to use your video
28:03 but it might be interesting let's say i
28:04 talk to every single one of you that
28:06 wants to do it in the next six months
28:08 i mean do it we can do it in a month
28:12 and then i could edit together an
28:15 interview
28:17 from you to me and me to you
28:20 with your permission of course
28:23 and put it all into one episode so that
28:25 everyone else learns
28:27 you know answers to questions you guys
28:31 have because you know me better probably
28:32 than anybody
28:38 see there's a burp right there
28:42 we're getting to know each other tell
28:43 you
28:50 so when i'm sitting here uh
28:54 the uh the environment that i am looking
28:57 at i've got a
28:58 two lights uh there's two bulbs over
29:02 there and there's a big giant square one
29:04 over that way
29:05 and i can show you guys there's right
29:09 oh [ __ ]
29:10 [Music]
29:15 so i know it's super bright that's the
29:18 square one right there
29:20 and then over there the other two
29:24 now bring this back down
29:36 i also have string lights which
29:40 i forget about every other time to turn
29:42 them on they don't really
29:43 provide that much lighting but i like it
29:47 because i can see the backyard a little
29:48 bit better
29:51 let me see you can see
29:55 let's see here
29:59 all right so there's the fence
30:02 i got to keep the mic by my face here so
30:04 there's the fence
30:06 and up there is where the possum comes
30:09 through
30:11 all the way around i don't even know
30:13 you're gonna be able to see this
30:18 so that's the the table that was in the
30:23 first intros it's the neighbor's house
30:26 so this is what i'm looking at
30:28 that big pot over there right there
30:32 that's where i throw my sticks if you
30:34 ever see me throw a stick and try to get
30:35 it into a
30:37 container that's what that is and that's
30:38 of course inside there
30:44 i'm gonna flip this around so you can
30:45 see what the hell is going on
30:50 oh backwards
31:02 yes i've got possums that go by on that
31:04 fence over there
31:06 and so i'll be recording an episode an
31:07 opossum about the size of a
31:09 cat is going by and he's making tons of
31:13 freaking noise the other day i was doing
31:14 one
31:15 which will be coming out soon about
31:17 burying our heroes
31:18 and there's a possum up in the tree
31:20 making a nest or something and my god
31:22 it's just sitting there
31:23 you can't hear it on the mic but to me
31:25 it's like
31:27 and it's just enough to screw with my
31:29 brain
31:31 as i'm trying to put together my
31:33 thoughts right
31:45 but yeah the uh the interesting thing is
31:49 is when i'm sitting here in the middle
31:50 of the night you know i mean
31:51 right now it's 2 37 in the morning
31:56 this is a little bit late i got some
31:58 folks coming over tomorrow so i can't
31:59 stay up too late
32:02 i need i need them to come around
32:05 lunch time they usually get about 1 30
32:08 or whatever
32:12 but i'm sitting inside and i would a
32:14 little catalyze
32:15 an episode other than me having an
32:18 epiphany right where i'm just like
32:20 um why
32:27 what is that see that little what the
32:30 hell is that
32:32 weird
32:37 but if i have an episode idea then i'm
32:39 just almost chomping at the bit i'm
32:41 drooling to get the episode done
32:43 and so then i'm just i'll go literally
32:45 buy a stick for that episode
32:49 and then the other type of episode
32:52 is i feel like doing an episode
32:56 but i have no idea what the hell i'm
32:58 going to talk about
33:07 that's kind of fun because what will
33:09 happen is i'll
33:11 and so many of my greatest episodes in
33:13 terms of my own opinion
33:15 i have to bring a fair amount of
33:16 hardware outside
33:19 and so i'll just say you know what i'm
33:21 just going to set it up and then i'll
33:24 just keep my brain
33:24 open while i'm setting up everything and
33:27 i just think you know and i'm always
33:29 measuring you know hey look i've done a
33:31 lot of alien stuff lately i've done a
33:33 lot of brain stuff like a lot of
33:34 spiritual stuff let's just say
33:36 of a particular time in a particular
33:38 year
33:40 so i have to go now even though it'd be
33:42 great i mean i can if i have a big idea
33:43 i'll throw it down and then i'll just
33:45 hold on to it for weeks
33:47 such that um
33:51 it doesn't repeat too much so i i wait
33:53 for that track to be right for you guys
33:55 you know if you just think about like
33:58 music it would be you've heard a lot of
34:00 supercharged
34:01 metal songs or something and then it's
34:03 like you don't want to know one of those
34:04 you need some sort of
34:05 more bality based you know
34:10 was unforgiving from metallic or
34:13 something
34:16 maybe need some r b or some old school
34:18 rap or whatever it is classical music
34:21 and so i try to pick things to keep the
34:24 flow going inside your mind
34:26 so that the variety show is truly a
34:29 variety
34:30 what i have noticed in the last six
34:33 episodes
34:34 minus the cancer one perhaps if you're
34:37 paying attention
34:39 you're gonna see me or hear me say
34:41 something
34:44 in an episode and then the next episode
34:47 has got a
34:48 sort of an advanced discussion on this
34:50 one thing i said the previous episode
34:52 and in that episode i do the same exact
34:54 thing and the next one is an advanced
34:55 thing
34:57 one of my dreams is to create
35:00 a beautiful index of all the episodes
35:03 that are related to each other
35:05 and then not only on the website
35:08 stitch those together because we do have
35:10 categories on the website i guess that
35:12 does help
35:13 we have categories on them playlists on
35:16 youtube
35:19 but to really go in and
35:23 like find out if i'm missing a category
35:27 i've odor over categorized something
35:32 and then you know inside youtube one you
35:35 got the description i can i can
35:37 cross-link stuff and say hey man if you
35:39 dug this one you'll want to see these
35:40 ones in the future because that's the
35:42 thing is
35:42 i don't know anything that's going to
35:43 happen in the future until it happens
35:45 right
35:46 here fix this camera
35:57 angles everything right i want to screw
35:59 it up
36:00 because i don't change the angle in this
36:01 camera at all
36:07 so anyway
36:11 just know i'm consciously very
36:14 consciously picking the episodes
36:16 as they come out the reason why i do
36:20 double features
36:23 is usually because i've got one that i
36:25 think
36:27 is really fringy for new listeners
36:31 and what i do is i piggyback on top of
36:33 that an episode that i think will appeal
36:36 to the masses so
36:38 something about your soul soul time and
36:40 then i might put a moon
36:42 hoax video right on top of that so one
36:45 is sort of
36:46 for you guys and the other one's for the
36:48 masses and then hopefully the masses dig
36:51 the other one they'll
36:52 eventually work their way around the
36:53 system
36:55 but how cool would it be to go back to
36:57 every old episode which is just
37:00 nauseatingly uh difficult
37:03 difficult to conceive with 500 and what
37:06 is it 80 now or something like that it's
37:08 just a bunch of special reports and
37:10 other things and do all that
37:13 youtube hey you know that little thing
37:16 that shows up right here it says if you
37:18 he just said that episode and then poof
37:20 comes up there
37:22 but i would need probably 10 volunteers
37:27 where we could divide up i mean 100
37:30 would be better
37:31 but think about if you had 100 people
37:35 viewing my episodes each one would have
37:37 to take uh what
37:39 five and listen to them all the way
37:41 through and go
37:42 you mentioned this episode that episode
37:43 and it's a marker you know
37:46 one hour two minutes or 45 minutes in
37:50 and then once we had that spreadsheet of
37:53 all those
37:54 mentions i got to go in and put all
37:57 those
37:58 links in there now apparently i can
37:59 actually make one of you an
38:00 administrator to the
38:02 to the youtube but i don't know any of
38:04 you that well
38:06 to do that and just if you made a
38:08 mistake and you got rid of a video
38:10 on accident in fact i think they can't
38:13 administrator can't do it i haven't
38:14 tried to do it but
38:16 it's just such a burden i can't even
38:18 imagine asking anyone to help with that
38:23 the other one might be to sort all the
38:24 videos by their most popular
38:27 or by the highest view count
38:31 and then at least take care of the big
38:32 ones to make sure we're
38:34 cross-pollinating things
38:38 but to my friend's question you know the
38:42 only
38:43 the only avenue that i can see
38:46 would be a logical avenue for us to
38:49 expand the show
38:50 into an audience that already exists
38:53 there's two the most appropriate
38:58 audience would probably be joe rogan's
39:00 show
39:02 the other one would be and i've got a
39:03 buddy of mine he's really trying to push
39:05 that through
39:09 he doesn't know josie is the problem but
39:11 he's trying to reach out a couple times
39:14 and i think joe is really looking for
39:16 like best buy
39:18 kind of personalities where they're
39:20 super popular already and i don't blame
39:22 him one bit for that
39:25 the only other one would be coast to
39:27 coast i am george nori
39:30 but then coast to coast is looking for
39:33 someone who's got a story a story about
39:38 some crazy on time traveling with barack
39:40 obama
39:41 to foreign planets and all this other
39:43 weird stuff
39:48 the other one that's i'm sure you guys
39:50 are aware of
39:52 this cigar is just coming apart like
39:54 that
39:56 that's a junky stick it actually doesn't
39:57 taste as bad as i remember it tasting so
39:59 that's good
40:12 what's it gonna say
40:23 what in the hell was i going to say
40:25 talking about joe rogan
40:27 and we talked about georgia nori
40:33 oh yes yes yes okay this happens all the
40:36 time and i was
40:37 like you don't get to see it i look so
40:40 smooth
40:40 before
40:43 so there's obviously a lot of
40:44 controversy with the issues that i talk
40:47 about
40:49 and it really breaks my heart in a lot
40:52 of ways that there are controversies
40:54 around things controversies around
40:55 whether or not we landed on the moon or
40:57 whether or not the world's flat or it's
40:59 a globe or
41:01 whatever the debate might be the only
41:06 thing that i
41:08 that's not even the case obviously i'm
41:10 throwing down my opinion
41:12 big time
41:20 but i don't like you know
41:24 creating more of this controversy where
41:27 people are going to have
41:28 extra big arguments because of something
41:30 i've said
41:32 i am trying to get people to to really
41:35 tolerate each other's
41:37 different thoughts and to be excited
41:39 about it right
41:41 you know i don't want to you know if we
41:44 if it's like me
41:45 or you or someone uh we both trust
41:49 were to be put inside some spacex
41:51 vehicle
41:52 with a window and they get the launch
41:56 and you know what's funny is it could be
41:57 somebody's cousin brother
41:59 sister or whatever that just watches the
42:01 show a couple times and they're like
42:04 i've got my brother who's her sister
42:06 who's a
42:07 astronaut she or he is going to put the
42:10 cell phone camera
42:11 on the window and film this exit which
42:14 is how why doesn't that happen you know
42:16 they're going to prove to you the world
42:18 is a ball by
42:20 filming this and we trust them and so
42:22 they go up and they you know they may
42:24 turn off once they get up the space
42:25 station or whatever the hell they're
42:26 doing
42:29 but until we have proof like that that
42:32 we can absolutely hundred percent trust
42:35 for me it seems so exciting to say okay
42:38 we got the jackson five uh for instance
42:40 and
42:41 tito is gonna be the flat earther and
42:44 jermaine is
42:45 uh is that his name germain
42:49 something like that uh he's gonna be the
42:52 the glober
42:54 michael's gonna be the expanding earth
42:55 guy whatever it is
42:58 because he's born of a birthday we got
42:59 to keep it that way
43:01 and they go off and do their research
43:03 and you know they're pushing it and
43:04 pushing and pushing it
43:06 i think that's awesome amazing that like
43:08 a fun thing you don't want those
43:10 arteries to turn off
43:11 unless we absolutely be on the shadow of
43:14 a dow can prove that
43:16 to our satisfaction that is it is not
43:19 one of the avenues
43:21 but then it might be interesting to say
43:22 okay we've proven it's a ball
43:24 let's just say and now
43:28 the flat earth group can go off and
43:30 study the
43:31 the story of flood earth and
43:34 how it came to be and whether or not it
43:37 is a
43:37 recent change from flat to round because
43:40 of consensus reality where we all
43:43 were told it's a ball and all of a
43:44 sudden and then we reconstruct the world
43:48 partially to gain more real estate you
43:50 know we put it together
43:54 what i find really bizarre
44:00 and i i welcome it 100 but there are
44:02 there's at least one gentleman out there
44:04 who's i don't think he's a patreon guy
44:06 at
44:07 but he is a very big flat earther
44:11 and he's one that believes that there is
44:12 the ring of ice and then all the
44:14 continents on the outside
44:15 which is part of that japanese dude who
44:17 got detained in the japanese airport and
44:19 he
44:20 he disappeared and no one ever found him
44:22 again and he
44:23 had a map in his luggage that was of the
44:26 whole
44:27 the whole disc with continents that
44:32 that for square miles
44:36 like probably three times the real
44:38 estate i hate it when i bump the mic
44:40 three times the amount of real estate
44:42 that we've discovered on continents and
44:45 they fly into this area and they visit
44:49 dude i mean you have no idea how
44:52 absolutely
44:53 thrilled i would be to take a plane to
44:56 that other area and imagine if that was
44:57 the case and
44:59 the ruling class do that they go over
45:02 the ice and they
45:03 visit those other worlds i mean what
45:05 would stop us from doing that
45:08 what would stop any one of the
45:11 billionaires from going
45:13 oh yeah there's something past how do i
45:15 get there well you just fly to the south
45:17 pole
45:17 and you keep going worst case scenario
45:20 you come over on the other side of the
45:21 world
45:22 you start in south america and you'll
45:24 end up in in africa
45:27 worst case scenario best case scenario
45:30 you go over that thing and
45:31 like i said the ultimate worst case
45:33 scenario is you fly into a wall
45:35 uh but what is it admiral bird seems to
45:38 be alive
45:39 so you fly over it it becomes tropical
45:41 and it becomes all these other
45:42 continents i mean who the hell wouldn't
45:44 want that to be the case
45:46 who the hell wouldn't want a bunch of
45:47 alien space stations all over the moon
45:52 but you know the only guy we have for
45:53 that is what
45:55 john lear who just pointed every bump on
45:58 the surface of the moon and like see
46:00 that's a that's a toys r us
46:21 let me know what you guys think of this
46:22 longer format me sitting here just
46:25 thinking
46:27 trying to see just starting a little bit
46:29 of a taste out of this horrible stick
46:32 i was able to clean it up a little bit
46:33 there
46:36 yeah so
46:39 we're a little bit uh well i shouldn't
46:42 say we
46:44 i say wheel up because i've run
46:47 companies
46:48 for so long that you know it's just what
46:51 you say
46:54 it's instead of saying me or i or
46:57 something
46:57 it's always a wii i was part of who's
47:00 wii studios back in the day
47:04 but i'm a little bit behind with the
47:06 amount of episodes coming out so i was
47:07 trying to do some math
47:10 coming up on 50 here for this particular
47:13 season
47:15 and what i thought about was
47:18 if i did 10 episodes a month
47:22 then it's a 10 month churn for the
47:25 primary season now what i ended up doing
47:28 last year was working it out so fast
47:30 that i had to put out probably
47:32 what was it 15 20 episodes in the
47:34 summertime which i actually love doing
47:37 have to say there is nothing more
47:40 amazing than being on this patio when
47:42 it's really warm at night
47:44 and it last summer was actually
47:47 the best summer and this winter i know
47:49 i'm always giving you weather updates
47:52 for california southern california here
47:55 comes the
47:55 possum we'll nail him or her in a second
47:58 here
48:01 it was really cold the last two winters
48:04 and i mean insanely cold where the
48:06 the locals and i were just texting to
48:08 psychologically deal with it
48:10 and this winter has been so much more
48:13 gradual
48:15 so it's been nice i see you can't hear
48:17 it
48:18 oh possum's coming down now
48:22 into the backyard we'll see where
48:25 this one goes
48:28 we had a lot of crickets this summer
48:32 and then we got a bunch of lizards
48:33 because we have a lot of crickets and
48:35 then we've got this cat that runs around
48:36 this
48:37 little female cat and she
48:40 chases the lizards so it's absolutely
48:42 hilarious i'll be in the backyard just
48:44 playing with my computer and all of a
48:47 sudden the cat just goes
48:48 whoa and then freezes
48:52 because the lizard's seen her and he's
48:54 hunched down
48:55 so she's like where the hell did you go
48:57 man but man
48:59 those lizards go so fast through the
49:02 backyard here okay here comes the
49:03 possum here this thing's as big as a cat
49:09 let's see here
49:18 okay tilting it up
49:23 oh she's a little freaked out now
49:28 you just don't have enough light
49:31 you kind of see it
49:39 she's way up there at the top you see
49:40 her her white
49:43 don't know why i can't get this thing to
49:45 focus come on baby
49:49 yep she's going freaked out
49:53 all right let's be the weirdest episode
49:57 i've ever done
49:59 here we go
50:03 i try to entertain come on now
50:16 what's really crazy about this show is
50:18 that a hundred episodes
50:20 is a lot of episodes and it's a lot of
50:24 like thought you know
50:27 just a little bit more and what's fun
50:30 about it is
50:30 it's an adventure you know you don't
50:32 know where your mind's gonna go
50:35 but if you really get to the point where
50:36 you open up your brain
50:38 and you really look at the functionality
50:42 of society and then you pay attention to
50:44 yourself you know
50:45 it's one of these things where you
50:50 you just hear your thoughts and
50:54 you know i liken it to what a comedian
50:56 does
50:57 which is comedians are always drudging
51:00 out of
51:01 reality things that are very frustrating
51:04 that no one ever talks about
51:05 that's a great joke you know i have to
51:08 say like this 80s
51:10 comedians were
51:14 so fortunate that
51:17 they were able to talk about all the
51:19 simple low-hanging fruit
51:21 you know you don't you hate it when you
51:23 get on a plane and da da da don't you
51:25 hate it when you get in your car and
51:26 when you drive and there's that type of
51:27 driver and this type of driver
51:31 they absolutely exhausted all the
51:34 low-hanging fruit
51:36 so by the time we got into the late 90s
51:38 21st century these comedians of which
51:40 i've
51:41 worked with several of them in la
51:44 they're off on some
51:45 crazy tangent some amazing piece of
51:48 humor and they had to become more
51:50 brilliant to find the humor
51:57 so it's sort of that same game
52:01 but we're talking about super deep stuff
52:03 our jokes last an hour and a half
52:06 on average right
52:13 and another thing that's sort of
52:14 interesting to format here again let's
52:16 see if i make this hit here
52:18 ah not even close it's up against the
52:21 pot but
52:22 that's not inside
52:27 some of you might be going you know why
52:29 because i don't think you guys do it but
52:31 i think
52:32 that honestly that you guys believe that
52:35 if i
52:36 cut it below an hour you're almost
52:38 getting cheated for your money
52:39 you know and i don't really mean
52:40 monetarily speaking but just for your
52:42 time
52:43 because your time is money however you
52:44 look at it it's your god money
52:46 not necessarily financial money
52:51 but what i've noticed is by
52:54 linking a cigar to the show
52:58 one it's it's a bizarre thing tesla
53:00 talked about tobacco from his pipe
53:02 really soothing the mind's frequency to
53:05 have these deeper
53:07 thoughts to even mechanically think
53:10 deeper than you were before
53:15 you don't know many times i've been
53:16 doing a show and it'll be
53:20 i i feel like i've gone an hour and i'm
53:22 looking down here at this
53:23 uh the sound wave going by my product
53:26 wave pad
53:28 on the windows platform sometimes you
53:30 can see it my glasses
53:31 if i look down at it you can see the
53:33 reflection of the sound
53:35 wave going by but that's my little timer
53:38 down there
53:39 of how many minutes has gone by and
53:43 i feel like i've knocked out 45 minutes
53:45 to an hour and it's only 22 minutes or
53:47 something like that
53:49 and what's interesting about that
53:50 regulator is that
53:53 here i am i got a lot of stick left i
53:55 got a lot of time i'm responsible for
53:58 recording and so then i forced my brain
54:01 to go deeper into the subject come up
54:04 with
54:04 more extensions to the thought my friend
54:07 who came up with the idea
54:10 which i actually said the name of it
54:12 wrong i said the great giveaway
54:15 what the hell did she say she said um
54:21 i forgot what she said she said a
54:22 slightly different phrase
54:25 than giveaway or give up or something
54:28 like that
54:29 but i sent it to her and she just got
54:32 back to me this morning and this is like
54:35 a month ago we sat down for she's one of
54:38 the people working with me on this film
54:41 and her and i just my god we're like two
54:43 deep thoughts going back and forth if
54:44 you guys could just see us talk
54:47 maybe i should have her on the show i
54:49 think that would be phenomenal
54:51 maybe get her to record tomorrow and
54:53 that would be amazing
54:55 but she is just an utterly freaking
54:58 brilliant human being
54:59 anyway she watched the show and she said
55:01 you know
55:03 you took it way deeper than i are way
55:06 further
55:06 than i had previously you know conceived
55:10 of the subject
55:11 and she was the other one that gave me
55:13 the thought she's the one that gave me
55:14 the other thought about
55:17 people accusing you have of having an
55:19 ego
55:20 to put you in your place regardless if
55:23 you have an ego
55:24 they're controlling you they're
55:26 attempting to control you
55:29 and so as long as the review comes back
55:33 man
55:34 that was a really fun adventure for the
55:36 brain
55:38 i feel like i've done my job and i just
55:41 feel like
55:42 you know the minimum amount of time that
55:44 i typically make an episode's about an
55:46 hour and 10 minutes there's only a
55:48 couple episodes i think in the entire
55:50 series that are below an hour
55:52 like 54 minutes i think is this fastest
55:55 episode i've ever done
55:56 it's not one of these specials but this
55:58 one's already going on 54 minutes but if
55:59 i were to cut this thing down and get
56:02 rid of all the pauses which i won't
56:03 that way it'll get to you faster
56:07 it's probably 45 minutes or something
56:10 it's amazing
56:15 i do wish that we had that we didn't
56:19 have the proximity that we have
56:20 between us you know we're all so far
56:22 away from each other
56:24 or that you know chatting with your
56:27 friends in facetime
56:28 wasn't such an ordeal because even if
56:30 the technology was
56:32 absolutely ubiquitous you have 8k
56:34 screens in your
56:36 in your kitchen like in the movie total
56:37 recall or the kitchen window a kitchen
56:39 wall was a television
56:42 if it was that easy there's still a bit
56:45 of vanity
56:46 between us there just is and there's
56:47 nothing wrong with that i i would have
56:49 the same thing i wouldn't want to come
56:50 out in my underwear you know i wouldn't
56:52 want to come out my hair all screwed up
56:55 which is every morning of my life and
56:57 you'll have the same thing
56:59 or some people are just self-conscious
57:00 about being viewed that way
57:02 so when i offer you guys a chat
57:06 because you're patreon folks just
57:08 understand that
57:10 we can do audio if you want if that
57:11 makes you feel more comfortable
57:14 but i'm i'm a person who loves everybody
57:17 so it's not
57:19 it's just an immaterial thing to me i
57:21 think it's wonderful to see people
57:24 as they are you know it's great just you
57:26 know how you would go out in public or
57:27 something like that don't make you feel
57:28 nervous or anything
57:32 but yeah uh you know we were gonna do
57:35 the one thing that i haven't admitted on
57:36 the normal show is that vivian kubrick
57:39 was going to do
57:40 an interview of me because she's very
57:43 brilliant and she knows me because we've
57:45 now been
57:45 talking for years and and she's just an
57:48 extremely
57:50 well articulated person she makes me
57:52 question my ability to speak english
57:54 properly
57:56 but i think she kind of got nervous
57:58 about it and i think
57:59 part of her nerves that she said to me
58:01 was you know i
58:04 i don't want to i don't want to this is
58:07 me speaking
58:08 paraphrasing for her she didn't want to
58:11 take some of the controversy around her
58:13 and attach it to me
58:15 and i think that's more in her concern
58:17 than mine of course i don't care
58:20 you know she you know i don't have a
58:22 permission to
58:23 share a ton of this stuff but she's had
58:25 to defend herself in public a couple
58:26 times
58:27 but she really is interested in the
58:30 technology of scientology
58:32 but not in the the cultness of
58:36 that whole thing because people could
58:37 take anything in this world and make it
58:39 a cult can't they
58:41 and she's really she gets what she wants
58:44 out of it and leaves the rest behind
58:46 she doesn't have a giant touch but i
58:48 think that was one of her concerns and
58:50 she shared a ton of that technology with
58:51 me and boy i'll tell you
58:55 you know just coming from the outside
58:56 having been raised in religion first
58:59 and jumping off into sciences in the mid
59:01 80s
59:02 as i turned about 9 10 years old
59:07 and i was like man i'm gonna discover
59:08 the universe the way god made it you
59:10 know i'm gonna figure out where every
59:11 atom is and how it works and how it all
59:13 goes together and it wasn't until i hit
59:15 my 30s that i bumped into eric dollard
59:17 probably even in my 40s
59:21 where i felt like i got it i got a huge
59:23 part of it through ethereal sciences
59:26 and what's super sad about that is that
59:28 there's a handful of ethereal scientists
59:29 out there
59:33 so you guys can take that role
59:37 if you want to so get your questions
59:40 together
59:44 see it's late in the episode i gotta
59:46 clear my throat
59:48 but anyway i thought you guys would
59:50 would dig this
59:51 i'll try to uh litter things with some
59:53 just some photos
59:54 of what's going on in my uh my little
59:58 studio area
59:59 area here you're going to get daytime
60:00 shots and not nighttime shots
60:04 but yeah i'm very blessed to live where
60:06 i live i've been in this home for
60:10 17 years and it's early january 1st
60:15 so 17 years and however many days in
60:17 this year
60:19 so this is definitely my home
60:22 what's strange about it is there's this
60:25 weird
60:26 thing that if you grow up someplace else
60:29 as a child
60:30 especially if your family's from there
60:32 so both sides of my family from the same
60:34 exact little town
60:35 for the most part you still
60:38 feel like that's your home home that's
60:41 where you're from from
60:42 right but i've spent more years in this
60:46 house
60:46 at this location than my entire
60:49 childhood combined
60:51 because what would be your childhood you
60:53 know i left
60:54 i left my hometown at 17. i've been here
60:57 17 years
60:58 and so it'll probably be about
61:02 halfway through this year
61:05 actually that's not true probably around
61:07 december well i have
61:09 totally eclipsed all the time since
61:12 birth to leaving my hometown
61:16 and then i'll be here the most but this
61:17 this is like my secondary
61:19 home home so
61:22 tmi right anyway hope you dug it
61:27 if you're interested let me know if
61:29 you're not interested that's cool
61:30 again it's the internet so there's no
61:32 long distance phone call issues so if
61:34 you live
61:34 around the world it won't matter just
61:38 uh if you could think about
61:41 the times that work best for you i can
61:43 do it all on the weekend for you guys
61:45 that are
61:46 privileged to go to a work job but i
61:48 mean if you got a time during the day
61:50 throughout the week let me know and try
61:52 to think about a time that's
61:54 kind of generic to every one of your
61:55 weeks because it won't be probably like
61:58 the week that you see this or the next
61:59 week you see this necessarily it'll be
62:01 depend on my time
62:03 if we do facetime or anything outside of
62:05 skype then it'll just be between you and
62:06 i but if
62:07 you want to do sort of the interview
62:09 thing i've got all the software
62:11 purchased
62:12 to do skype and that's exactly what i
62:14 use for the bart sabrel interview
62:16 what happens is i get my feet recorded
62:20 and i get your feet recorded in this
62:22 dual movie format that's really cool
62:24 it's like it's one big frame
62:25 with you and i side by side with the
62:27 audio track underneath
62:30 and so that when i edit i just uh
62:34 crop one whole feed that's you and one
62:37 whole feed that's me
62:38 and then we just go back and forth and
62:41 so
62:41 the other thing too is i've been trying
62:43 to preserve the black and white
62:46 technology that is sort of my persona
62:51 and that way when i make this show
62:54 color which i probably will at some
62:57 point
62:58 maybe uh i need
63:01 the main reason why this thing black and
63:02 white and color thing is that
63:04 one i'm a huge proponent of black and
63:07 white i love it i love twilight zones
63:09 and black and white i think there's an
63:10 interesting feel even though
63:12 i don't have film black and white is
63:15 that it's just got a nuance too it's
63:16 kind of cool
63:17 but the secondary thing was that the
63:20 lighting is always different
63:22 nighttime's different daytime daytime is
63:24 a absolute
63:26 train wreck for exposure and color i
63:28 don't have
63:29 reflectors i don't have lighting rigs
63:32 and so when you see something on
63:33 television or in a movie
63:35 there are tremendous amount of lights on
63:37 someone to make sure they're all equally
63:39 lit
63:39 so the color balance people can make it
63:41 look the same
63:43 i assure you if i had made this thing
63:45 color
63:46 i would have to film it pretty much the
63:48 exact
63:50 time of day where the sun is in the
63:52 exact same spot
63:53 so imagine that changing throughout the
63:56 season so
63:57 winter different than summer and all the
63:59 great gradients in between
64:02 otherwise these shows would look
64:03 drastically different because i'm
64:05 outside
64:06 so i'd also be interested in what you
64:08 guys think about the ambient sounds from
64:10 outside i think it gives it kind of an
64:12 interesting feel
64:13 than these studio recordings that every
64:15 youtube channel seems to have
64:18 and at one hour my laptop sleeps
64:25 but yeah and the other thing too is that
64:27 uh
64:28 you know episode ideas i need them
64:31 i'll think of something always but i
64:34 want
64:36 i want to sort of infect you with the
64:40 same mechanism i use to think
64:42 so that you start seeing these
64:44 epiphanies as well
64:46 where you're going to come to me and you
64:47 go well isn't it weird how people don't
64:49 you know talk about whether or not your
64:51 soul has a gender
64:52 whether souls have time constraints
64:55 those kind of thoughts
64:56 you might be having and just say hey
64:59 talk about that
65:00 getting a lot of suggestions uh recently
65:02 in
65:03 youtube so i'm very happy about that
65:06 but anyway i hope you're having a good
65:08 time wherever you are hope you're safe
65:09 and sound
65:10 i hope you're gainfully employed and i
65:14 hope 2021
65:15 is nothing more than a rocket for you
65:17 despite
65:18 anyone trying to make you feel bad about
65:20 your life
65:22 but we'll stick together we'll get
65:23 through everything
65:25 anyway take care of yourself and someone
65:27 else and i'll see you in the next
65:28 patreon only
65:30 video overnight
65:39 [Music]
65:48 so
65:50 [Music]
65:58 [Applause]
66:03 [Music]
66:09 you
