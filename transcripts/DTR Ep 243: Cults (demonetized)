00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies
00:37 gentlemen today we're gonna cover a
00:42 subject that's actually fairly it's
00:45 really important to me which is cults
00:49 now I'm gonna say that like 30 years ago
00:52 when someone were to say hey we're going
00:54 talking about cults they really thought
00:57 of some very eclectic groups I'm going
01:02 to be careful not to really dive into
01:06 certain cult names because it'll put
01:10 some people off and we don't need to
01:13 mention individual cults we don't
01:17 because cults used to be very obtuse or
01:20 excuse me very acute things very
01:22 pronounced things and they no longer are
01:27 there's subtle and they're profound
01:31 profound in their stupidity but I've had
01:35 some pretty good experience watching
01:37 friends of mine very close friends of
01:41 mine get involved with this stuff and
01:43 it's subtle how romantic it is how it
01:48 promises one thing delivers another and
01:50 ruins their lives it steals their money
01:53 it stills their time but there's a
01:58 there's a whole methodology to cultism
02:01 and I'm gonna miss a bunch of it of the
02:05 stuff you could look it up on look up
02:07 online and find out about cults and
02:09 formulas of cults I'll let you go there
02:13 and find
02:14 and I'm gonna talk about is the more
02:15 subtle problems with cults now some of
02:21 you gonna think about like crazy cults
02:24 you know eyes wide shut [ __ ] right be my
02:29 guest
02:29 be my guest the Colts that I think are
02:34 most destructive are the subtle ones
02:37 tiny ones the ones that cater to the
02:40 disenfranchised or what we might call
02:44 the lost right I have not known a friend
02:50 to get involved with the cult unless
02:54 they're lost and let me just kind of
02:58 itemize this a little bit the cults that
03:00 I have seen people get into because I'm
03:04 gonna tell you right now you might think
03:06 that most the cults I'm going to talk
03:08 about a religious cults and I would say
03:12 in a technicality you're right but these
03:15 aren't cults that are related to you
03:18 know religion as we have it promoted to
03:21 us today such as Christianity or Judaism
03:24 or Islamic nation stuff a Muslim nation
03:27 stuff nope
03:29 the most destructive ones are the little
03:32 tiny ones to promise you that that you
03:37 can sell a product in a network
03:39 marketing pyramid they are cults that
03:43 tell you that if you join them they're
03:45 going to teach you how to better
03:47 yourself now there are great things you
03:52 can get into to learn how to better
03:55 yourself and I can tell you the
03:58 difference I'm just going to jump ahead
04:00 a little bit but the difference that you
04:01 can find between the ones that are good
04:03 for you and the ones that are bad for
04:05 you the ones that are actually courses
04:07 to help you and the ones that are
04:09 actually cult movements are the
04:12 following if what you join has an ending
04:16 a profound in just like a college degree
04:19 you go in for four years three years
04:21 whatever and it has a definitive in and
04:24 they say it's time for you to leave the
04:26 nest
04:26 there's no more here for you to learn
04:28 it's a you've you've acquired your boo
04:31 now get the [ __ ] out that is good for
04:34 you the one that never ends it keeps
04:39 going and going and going there's always
04:42 a new class there's always a new thing
04:43 you have to do in fact you get a sell
04:45 your [ __ ] and move next to them whatever
04:47 the one that's infinite is a cult and
04:51 that's the one you got to be careful
04:53 about what's really weird is I thought I
04:57 was able to live my entire life and
04:59 escape anyone close to me ever getting
05:02 involved with the cult and then it
05:04 happened I had a very close personal
05:07 friend of mine get involved the cult but
05:11 they're not aware that it's a cult
05:13 because they're lost and they don't do
05:18 what we do which is to research
05:19 everything and know a few things they
05:23 research nothing and know everything
05:25 sound familiar
05:26 and so over the course of the last seven
05:30 years of my life I've seen a very close
05:33 friend of mine jump into a cult and I've
05:37 watched the formula slowly develop over
05:40 time I watched the binders you know why
05:44 does this person keep going back to this
05:46 cult what do they keep spending money
05:48 what do they sacrifice a good third of
05:51 every week of their life inside the cult
05:54 why do they give the cult all their time
05:56 and money when the cult never gives them
05:58 anything in return the cults operate
06:03 under usually a charity designation a
06:06 non-profit so you have no taxes all of
06:10 the people that are involved in the cult
06:11 who are paying money to be there support
06:14 the place for free they offer all the
06:18 intellectual labor all the manual labor
06:20 and it's just like a weird thing now the
06:26 question might be asked well why do you
06:28 care dude it's someone else's life are
06:30 they doing you harm
06:31 hmm
06:34 that's a tough question if we see an
06:38 organization or a process or something
06:40 that hurts other people that robs them
06:43 of their otherwise fortuitous life that
06:47 we usually step in as a society and
06:49 label them something aggressive
06:52 something negative and we get rid of
06:54 them because if we don't we start losing
06:57 our loved ones our friends you know
07:01 which are loved ones as well we start
07:03 losing the very fabric of society into
07:06 these cults all right so I've been
07:11 wanting to this episode actually for
07:12 quite a while but was it listener who
07:15 recommended I do an episode on a
07:17 particular religion which is known to be
07:19 a very intense cult who are in nameless
07:23 I think most of you could deduce it if
07:26 you had to guess what I thought okay the
07:29 bigger problem is cults in general the
07:34 cults are very interesting cults are
07:36 usually created by a single individual
07:38 with sort of this bizarre ability to see
07:41 more than most people they're
07:43 enlightened and you know if any of
07:46 you've ever watched a comedian tell
07:48 jokes don't you ever think like
07:49 goddammit this guy or this girl can tell
07:52 me something's really really funny that
07:53 I happens to me every day but somehow
07:55 they can see it a little deeper than me
07:58 and they can turn it to be funny that's
08:01 what all comedians do and there are very
08:03 special people because they have that
08:05 capability well people who create cults
08:08 are essentially a few levels higher
08:11 intelligence and they see the
08:15 psychological and the sociological
08:16 implications of things and they create
08:20 organizations and they give them names
08:22 there's usually some founding documents
08:24 that get their little Church going their
08:28 cult what's odd is that most of these
08:31 founders are always found to be
08:33 criminals always it's unbelievable now
08:37 sometimes it's a particular type of
08:40 religion from another side of the world
08:41 and they bring it to your area it's all
08:43 new and so then they say a few great
08:46 things right
08:47 two people jump on board true that
08:49 matter is is that just like fake news
08:52 fake news has to incorporate truth a
08:55 little bit of capital T truth and then
08:59 they shove down your throat tons and
09:01 tons of lies so gain a little bit of
09:04 credibility for a little while and then
09:06 they turn it some fake news
09:08 organizations have been around so long
09:10 that they tell the truth for maybe ten
09:13 years and then they turn and then you're
09:16 screwed because you have loyalty to
09:17 individuals you're loyal to a particular
09:20 broadcaster a personality that you see
09:24 you get warm fuzzies every time you see
09:25 him and once you give loyalty away magic
09:31 happens your life starts getting
09:33 transformed by propaganda you never ever
09:37 see truth with the capital T ever ever
09:40 again all right now the services that I
09:45 would endorse are the ones again with
09:47 what the finish line they say you're
09:49 gonna take this course and then maybe
09:50 that course maybe there's even three
09:51 levels maybe you could spend five years
09:53 in it but then there's an end you gotta
09:57 leave you got to go get your get your
09:59 goods and you're more than welcome to
10:00 take these courses over again if you
10:02 weren't paying attention but that's your
10:04 own fault we don't have any more for you
10:06 that's new because as long as you pay
10:08 attention to these rules you're gonna do
10:10 well in life
10:11 when it comes to a cult it's infinite
10:14 it's a church you're supposed to be
10:16 there you end up worshipping individuals
10:19 that found the place or if they are so
10:22 exposed as a criminal they usually will
10:25 either wipe out any notion of a leader
10:27 or they rebrand it with a new leader in
10:30 my experience and looking back on the
10:33 people that I've seen get involved with
10:34 this it's about 50/50 50% of them will
10:38 acknowledge their leader and either try
10:41 to expunge his criminalists take tax
10:44 evasion or they will ignore them
10:49 completely completely a lot of cults
10:54 will operate in a very interesting way
10:58 and their patterns they have lots of
11:00 patterns and the first thing they want
11:02 is your loyalty because they're loyal
11:04 your loyalty to them provides financial
11:06 backing to some head of state that's
11:09 going to take most of your money now
11:11 some cults are very really rare and
11:13 maybe they want to have sex with you
11:16 those are pretty rare we've had groups
11:20 that are together that are accused of
11:21 such things but they weren't doing such
11:23 certain things right but the first thing
11:26 I've seen a cult do is they need to
11:30 alienate you from your family because
11:34 that your family is the only thing that
11:36 really truly cares about you in most
11:38 cases it doesn't have to be a relative
11:41 it could be a loved one right but the
11:44 game they play is to do two things
11:49 it's very strategic one they'll build
11:53 you up it builds you up which sounds
11:56 great right make you feel 100 bucks you
11:58 know usually not a million bucks and
12:02 then they start to create a new language
12:05 around their movement they don't want
12:09 you to use words in a normal way anymore
12:11 especially the way you would communicate
12:13 with your family and what this does is
12:15 it creates a incompatibility with your
12:17 family members but anytime that
12:20 incompatibility occurs instead of saying
12:23 oh my gosh this is a little weird they
12:26 give you the sense of superiority
12:28 because you have a different way to
12:30 speak it could be English words could be
12:33 they create some new words but the game
12:36 is to make sure that you alienate your
12:39 family such that you can't be rescued
12:42 anymore your family is now the cult and
12:45 they're the only people that truly
12:47 quote/unquote understand you and you
12:51 feel elevated in your consciousness
12:54 anytime you have an incompatibility of
12:57 communication it's oh my lowly family
13:00 members and friends can't think like me
13:02 I mean I am so [ __ ] enlightened it's
13:06 crazy right and that's the first divide
13:12 it occurs right and that's in some of
13:16 the more modern day cults that I see
13:18 today they have processes that you feel
13:22 obligated to engage we gotta do this and
13:26 you got to do that we have to lay down
13:28 on a sofa and interview you about things
13:29 we have to have you go up to a
13:31 microphone and confess yourself in front
13:34 of everyone and then when someone goes
13:37 up and confesses they cry they have an
13:41 emotional experience and of course they
13:42 feel better because they confess
13:43 something but little do they know that
13:46 these little confessions however they
13:48 occur whether they're being a you know a
13:50 Freudian clap couch or at a microphone
13:53 with the 58 mic just like this one here
13:55 they document your problems they work
14:01 that [ __ ] against you your whole [ __ ]
14:03 life and you can't escape there are
14:08 cults whereby the people that run the
14:11 cults who get in early right
14:14 they listen to let's say there's a male
14:17 they will listen to a lot of females
14:20 confess themselves they find out all
14:22 their problems their daddy issues and
14:25 then they swoop in to provide the daddy
14:28 figure but they'll also swoop in to sort
14:32 of engage in Oedipus complex for a
14:34 female and I'll have sex with the
14:36 females because they know the females
14:39 broken in this area of that area that
14:41 hurry and how did they get that coveted
14:43 information the confession they also
14:46 loved the idea in the process of
14:49 accentuating your sense of failure in
14:54 life your internal brokenness they love
14:58 that lets make you feel as broken as
15:00 possible such that's your only possible
15:04 way of escaping the self-loathing issue
15:07 is to continue going to courses paying
15:11 money for them giving up all your spare
15:13 time such as you can achieve some sort
15:17 of Solace with yourself the problem is
15:21 is that the common denominator being a
15:23 person who was lost person who truly
15:25 needs help there's nothing wrong with
15:27 being lost in life it happens all the
15:30 time you could have your [ __ ] together
15:31 one year and you could start off a
15:34 particular year in GNE where you felt
15:36 great but December you're lost it
15:39 happens everybody but instead of coming
15:42 in with definitive solutions to correct
15:45 your issues to help you address things
15:47 to give you perhaps the ability to
15:49 manage your own life to have control of
15:52 yourself they program your brain with a
15:55 vocabulary and a way to communicate that
15:58 instantaneously makes you incompatible
16:00 with everyone you know unless they join
16:04 the cult and they drink the kool-aid
16:06 right and if you don't think cults are
16:09 important or real go watch the powers
16:13 Boothe movie on Jim Jones you got of a
16:18 religious cult that's out there and I
16:19 think in South America right they got to
16:22 a point where they convince the elders
16:24 you know the adults in his cult here
16:28 comes the law right they're gonna shut
16:30 him down now I don't remember exactly
16:32 why the law gave a [ __ ] about his little
16:34 gathering down there but they they went
16:38 off and they drink kool-aid that's where
16:40 we get the term and they forced their
16:42 children to drink at first and hey it
16:45 tasted good but it was laced with
16:47 something that killed every single one
16:49 of them and by the time the military got
16:51 there everybody was dead at least that's
16:54 the official story right you remember
16:58 the hell Bob comment that came in the
17:00 eighties that weird group that was
17:03 making websites in some house all killed
17:07 themselves the Colts are very very
17:10 powerful they were told that they were
17:13 going to be elevated into space and
17:15 joined the mothership
17:17 well the leader snuck away right it's
17:23 very very powerful and they're very very
17:29 subtle they prey on your problems on
17:34 your perception of
17:36 and they provide a particular paradigm
17:40 so that you can find a solution we have
17:45 Colts today they don't have they have
17:48 names and the individuals in the Colts
17:50 have names but they don't go to any
17:52 centralized location anymore to practice
17:55 they just go online and read [ __ ]
17:58 all day long and they get fed you know
18:01 complementary [ __ ] propaganda from
18:05 fake news and so when these people wake
18:08 up they literally say once a day I don't
18:13 know how much of this world I can take
18:14 anymore right somehow getting into some
18:18 great despair over issues that have been
18:21 around their entire life the
18:25 disenfranchised being exploited certain
18:28 political groups prey on the
18:30 disenfranchised promising them a better
18:34 era but when their candidate becomes
18:38 president and gets two terms and nothing
18:41 happens besides more and more suffering
18:43 they still don't get it because again
18:46 there's no end to their cult it keeps
18:48 going and going and going and the
18:50 promises if you just keep going a little
18:53 bit longer all that's messed up in your
18:56 life that we've been unable to fix that
18:58 we're not even interested in fixing well
19:00 somehow miraculously one day the angels
19:03 will sing and you get your life back and
19:06 that's obviously a fallacy it's
19:09 obviously a lie and that's what cults do
19:13 they lie to you you are nothing more
19:16 than a cog in a wheel
19:18 you're a resource to help them propagate
19:21 their financial profit right it's funny
19:25 about cults is it is all about profit
19:27 typically right again those eyes wide
19:30 shut things talk about all the money in
19:32 the world they just want to have an
19:33 excuse to kill babies and drink their
19:35 blood right those are different cults go
19:38 see my episode on evil and late elite
19:42 pedophilia if you want to hear all about
19:43 that so the main issue between yes
19:49 cults especially if you're in your 40s
19:51 or 50s in today's cults is that in the a
19:55 long time ago you know we used to hear
19:57 about calls that were satanic cults you
20:01 know like the and super religious cults
20:03 that were either Eastern religions or
20:06 Christianity cults that went nuts
20:08 right and so when we get into cults that
20:11 are more related to your business acumen
20:14 or just your way of life how many
20:18 chemicals you rub on your body sort of
20:20 thing we draw a comparison in our brains
20:25 we see well we're not st. nasai god this
20:28 is just a club of people that get
20:29 together trying to better their lives at
20:32 that point you have to ask the question
20:34 okay fine you think you found something
20:37 is gonna help you out alright great good
20:39 it's awesome does it end is there an end
20:45 to this craziness now I'm not talking
20:47 about someone going back and again
20:48 getting a refresher course 20 years that
20:51 later after you took the first course
20:52 that's just you know I do that for
20:54 screenwriting you know I've taken every
20:56 course that I know of that Robert McKee
20:58 teaches for screenwriting I took his
21:01 first course twice because it is the
21:03 most dense 12-hour day four-day class
21:08 you can possibly take a movie writing
21:10 he's got a book look at the book on tape
21:13 it's a lot of work to remember
21:14 everything that he's said and to keep it
21:16 in your mind every day right but his
21:19 course has been to be consumed and then
21:22 used that's it it isn't all for anything
21:26 else you know every 10 years he writes
21:27 another book big deal the guy doesn't
21:31 call me up and say oh you know a lot of
21:33 you told you no you need to get back in
21:35 this program I got these guys I'll teach
21:37 you this course nope you're in control
21:40 of your life the man takes away all of
21:43 the semantics of creating movies and
21:46 says okay the only thing left that I
21:49 haven't taught you is the good idea that
21:52 you need to bring to film writing right
21:54 leave it in my hands I'm going to throw
21:58 out one prop to Tony Robbins
22:02 because Tony Robbins course has a finish
22:05 line there's this basic course that he
22:08 teaches which is now I don't even know
22:10 how you get it nowadays last time I
22:11 bought it was on DVD or CDs excuse me
22:14 and we can go off and do this $5,000
22:16 walk on coals thing right that's it
22:19 those two like you're so fat you want to
22:21 do it again do it again
22:22 but it's nothing new I mean updates it a
22:24 little bit but it's not like you preach
22:26 it at you at some religion that just
22:28 never [ __ ] stops get in you get out
22:31 and you live life the guy changed my
22:33 life listen to his course on cassette
22:36 tapes from the age of 23 to 24 I've
22:41 never forgotten anything he taught me
22:43 amazing when I bought the DVDs later or
22:45 sorry the CDs later and listen to it
22:47 again it was all the same stuff and I
22:50 just thought wow this how powerful this
22:52 guy is that the cassette tapes I had
22:53 bought 20 years earlier were just as
22:56 good as these CDs the different medium
22:57 and yeah he updated a bunch of stuff and
22:59 they invited me to the $5,000 thing and
23:01 I was like you know what I don't need it
23:02 your first course
23:04 had a finish line and I was done and
23:06 they totally backed off it was awesome
23:07 right but there are similar groups out
23:10 there and they get into you deep a
23:15 psychological level and they have done
23:18 their homework to find out how to make
23:19 you feel as broken as you possibly can
23:22 and regardless of how many courses you
23:24 take and how much money you pay and how
23:25 much you give up your personal time both
23:28 fuelling their organization and fueling
23:31 your own course they will loop back on a
23:34 regular interval to make you feel broken
23:37 all right and the problem is these
23:39 people microtransaction their lives
23:41 completely away any money that they
23:43 could have saved to start a business to
23:45 go on a vacation to really find
23:47 themselves it's all sacrificed into the
23:49 cult and so they have nothing in the end
23:53 and they're always broken constantly
23:55 it's like a perpetual lusion that you
23:59 have found yourself but the second that
24:01 you find yourself you lose yourself
24:03 because the classes loop back around and
24:06 make sure that you are always broken
24:08 and because you have given up so much of
24:12 your personal information through
24:13 sessions with other people within your
24:15 cult
24:16 microphone sessions or couch sessions
24:19 they know exactly where you're broken
24:21 and then we they know exactly what'll
24:23 always be a thorn in your side just like
24:26 Paul from the Bible right so the first
24:30 thing we need to acknowledge is these
24:32 individuals are evil
24:34 they're either evil through intent
24:37 because they're the leaders of the
24:38 organization and you know exactly what
24:40 they're doing
24:41 raping people of their money right maybe
24:46 one in a million chance that some guys
24:48 Pat himself on the back because somebody
24:50 was able to do something they weren't
24:51 able to do before but they go back in to
24:55 break him down right there I mentioned
24:58 this long time ago I don't even know
25:00 what episode the one of Bill Murray's
25:04 best movies he was ever in I think was
25:06 in 1983 it's called the razor's edge and
25:09 you know tiny spoiler alert but there
25:14 were two couples both fiance's you know
25:17 between each other men and woman back in
25:20 the old days when that was the norm and
25:22 the two males had to go off to World War
25:24 one and so were separated and when they
25:28 came back he found out that his fiancee
25:33 had I guess eloped with his best buddy
25:36 they got married or whatever leaving
25:39 this other girl from the other couple
25:40 straggling and she went off and became
25:43 sort of an opium den prostitute and he
25:48 went off and circled the world and went
25:51 to Tibet and you know all these Eastern
25:53 religions and learned all this
25:55 incredible wisdom about life again all
25:58 with the finish line right you might
26:00 argue that being enlightened as a
26:02 Tibetan monk takes your whole life but
26:05 you know what's going on there right no
26:07 one's telling you're broken they're just
26:08 saying keep going keep going but he
26:10 comes back with all this Eastern
26:11 religion knowledge and he approaches
26:13 this girl it was wasted constantly she's
26:18 a prostitute he knows her before she
26:20 sold her body and so he friends her and
26:24 he challenges her and he takes around
26:28 this long journey
26:30 to clean up her life and they become
26:32 lovers and so he gets the other girl the
26:37 one that doesn't have you know the
26:38 cleaning slate while his previous fiance
26:41 has turned into this obnoxious rich girl
26:44 then this is where the spoiler really
26:47 comes in in the third act the girl that
26:54 dumped him and went married the rich guy
26:56 realizes that he's far more interesting
26:59 than who she dumped him for because he
27:01 circled the world and he finds out if
27:04 she finds out excuse me that he went
27:08 with the other girl and sown some little
27:11 event where they're about to have a
27:12 dinner together the rich girl reminds
27:17 the other girl how broke she is she
27:21 ruptures her and breaks her and tears
27:24 down all the progress the bells
27:26 character put in this girl she
27:30 disappears for bills life he doesn't
27:33 know where she is by the time he finds
27:37 her she had gone back to the opium den
27:40 gotten in trouble
27:42 probably for leaving in the first place
27:44 I can't remember exactly the spin there
27:45 and she ends up face down in the river
27:49 dead because she went back because she
27:54 felt she was broken and that's what
27:57 [ __ ] do to normal people right
28:00 there's a lot of us with issues that we
28:04 need to deal with in life we're too
28:06 angry
28:07 we need to chill out maybe an
28:10 individual's of different orientation
28:13 and the biological alignment of our DNA
28:16 and so they have to suffer the slings
28:18 and arrows of judgment and what they
28:22 really need to do is find their place in
28:24 society they really need to do is live
28:26 by example let's say you know what all
28:29 that [ __ ] you say to me that bother me I
28:31 mean it bothers me but [ __ ] you right
28:33 I'm gonna go live my life I'm gonna be a
28:35 good person right in front of you well
28:37 you think just because I have a
28:38 different orientation or whatever
28:40 identity of some sort you're selling it
28:43 you're telling me I'm
28:44 bad person I'm going to show you how
28:47 great I could be but instead of that
28:50 lesson coming to these people they have
28:52 someone walk in and it and get them on
28:56 this cult of the disenfranchised and
29:00 they perpetuate it and they perpetuated
29:02 and they've got more disenfranchised
29:07 things to say to this person such that
29:09 they can never find their identity
29:11 anymore if their 20 year old homosexual
29:16 male it won't matter if they live a
29:18 hundred to be a hundred and live another
29:20 80 years this disenfranchised cult will
29:23 always make them feel a victim every day
29:25 they wake up they hate the universe they
29:27 hate their fellow citizens no matter
29:28 what and then they get a vote for that
29:31 cult right there are so many sub cults
29:36 to society today that most of the fake
29:41 news that we deal with in life I would
29:44 suggest it's probably like 80% cult
29:47 based identities and if let's just say
29:51 that you're listening to this and for
29:53 whatever reason you're giving me the
29:54 time of day to continue listening and
29:57 you're like oh crap I'm a part of that
29:59 situation but isn't it better that I
30:02 fight for what's right and fight against
30:05 what's wrong all right all right I can
30:10 see your side of the game trust me but
30:13 the problem is is if if you came to this
30:15 show in every single episode I convinced
30:18 you how broken you were how biologically
30:20 broken you are how psychologically
30:22 broken you are and you need me to help
30:25 you and the only way you're gonna get
30:26 these episodes is to pay me for them you
30:30 should wake up to the game but I don't
30:31 really care about you I care about my
30:34 bank account I'm trying to extort out of
30:37 you your money so that you can have some
30:40 comfort in the world now what any friend
30:43 or family member or anyone you would
30:45 respect or grant permission to be in
30:47 your life treat you like that then why
30:52 would you allow a political organization
30:54 some sort of you know
30:57 one org to ever do that to you right
31:00 they don't have your rights in their
31:05 mind they have a much higher agenda to
31:09 screw with your life on a level that is
31:10 please help us gain control over you the
31:14 first thing we'll do is just like what
31:16 the was that the the famous phrase in in
31:21 the Nazi era of Germany and it's
31:24 happened many many times and this
31:25 Inquisition errors as well but you know
31:27 they come for your neighbors and you
31:28 don't say anything because their
31:30 neighbors are gypsies and they come for
31:32 your your other neighbors because they
31:34 have a disabled child and they take them
31:37 all away
31:38 and you keep not saying anything and not
31:40 saying anything you to the point that
31:41 come from you they come for you and
31:43 there's no one else to cry foul to save
31:46 your life because you've given it all
31:49 the way through this cultism and that's
31:52 why we have to be extremely careful with
31:54 how we do this you're not broken all
31:59 right you're just trying to figure some
32:01 stuff out and the game is is that
32:03 everybody has stuff to figure out I have
32:07 met the most wealthy people on this
32:09 planet and I will tell you they come in
32:11 the room with all kinds of screwed-up
32:12 personality traits but you know what the
32:16 funny thing about a lots of money is
32:19 well it doesn't make anybody happy
32:21 let me tell you alright I met Kelsey
32:24 Grammer once at a country club he looked
32:26 happy you know that was about it but all
32:29 these kind of no-name millionaires
32:31 gazillion airs oh my god they can't
32:34 stand their children so bad I mean you
32:35 talk about him it's crazy you know they
32:38 are always unhappy they're always on the
32:41 hunt you know that [ __ ] gets old people
32:45 it gets old you don't want to be like
32:48 that do you want to say look life is
32:50 definitely a journey it's not a
32:52 destination it's a journey and we got to
32:56 work with each other to figure out
32:59 solutions and you know what the solution
33:00 today may not be a solution that you
33:03 need tomorrow may not even work yeah you
33:06 know when I was doing this I used to do
33:07 this and it fixed it but now I do that
33:09 old thing that used to fix it
33:11 and the problem is actually more complex
33:14 well the beautiful thing is you have the
33:16 Internet to help you you could go into
33:18 forums and log in anonymously and say
33:21 you know I have this problem what do you
33:24 think of course you're gonna put a bunch
33:26 of jerks here and there depending on
33:28 what what forum you go on but in the end
33:29 you can find a few solutions right maybe
33:33 that's all you need a little grip on
33:34 something right I have friends of mine
33:38 that um they come to me with issues and
33:42 they talk about them and then I'll say
33:44 wow that's interesting you want my
33:46 advice then say yeah I say well there's
33:48 two ways we can do this I consider and
33:51 spend an hour talking to you about this
33:53 over dinner or you can go on my website
33:55 and find this episode that episode this
33:58 episode I am T you get my advice at my
34:02 finest hour right and sometimes they go
34:06 for it and they love it and it fixes
34:08 some part of what you're doing because
34:11 I've made a ton of mistakes in my life
34:12 right I've suffered from my bad
34:16 decisions I'm the kind of person that
34:19 doesn't want you to ever suffer the
34:21 problems that I have suffered ever but I
34:23 don't want you to just I mean what I
34:25 have found is if I tell you how to skip
34:27 around a problem if I think you're never
34:30 gonna deal with that problem again I
34:31 love it
34:32 hey you know don't step there that that
34:34 bricks gonna break and you're gonna fall
34:36 through and die if there's something as
34:38 simple as that then great but if I think
34:41 that you're gonna walk on a lot of
34:42 bricks a lot of stones that are cracked
34:44 and you're gonna potentially threaten
34:46 your life I'm going to teach you about
34:48 how to evaluate where you're stepping in
34:50 life such as you never run into these
34:52 problems ever again you got a mechanism
34:54 in your brain to make it effortless
34:56 because we shouldn't be thinking about
34:58 our obstacles on a daily basis we should
35:00 build into our autonomic system right
35:02 our autonomic brains and say look we
35:05 don't do that we do this because that
35:07 doesn't work and this works right but
35:10 there's more levels to a cult right part
35:14 of the problems with individuals who are
35:16 lost as a lot of times they don't have
35:19 friends that happens you could have a
35:23 ton of friends one year the next year
35:24 you don't have
35:24 you might move or people get married and
35:27 move away from you you're in the same
35:29 place
35:29 maybe you just become enlightened and
35:31 everything you have to talk about bores
35:33 than the death or freaks them out okay
35:36 but what a cult does is it provides a
35:39 family a pseudo family now sometimes
35:43 they are definitely your friends because
35:46 you're lost and they're lost I mean you
35:49 get together you're like [ __ ] this is
35:51 great we're finding out solutions
35:53 together and you go off to dinner
35:54 outside of the Colts and you share
35:56 normal conversation and then all of a
35:59 sudden humanity solves your problem but
36:01 these people tend to give the credit
36:03 back to the cult some people pay to be a
36:07 part of the cults with cash some of them
36:10 pay to be in cults with their blood
36:11 I'm part of a gang the gang says ain't
36:14 gonna kill this guy so their soul gets
36:16 given away to the devil right hell is
36:20 nothing more than creating a list of
36:22 things that you've got to say sorry for
36:24 for the rest of your life after you pass
36:26 into the afterlife you don't want that
36:29 trust me right and so people who are
36:35 paying money to be in cults typically
36:38 find themselves paying money to stay
36:41 inside the group of friends that they've
36:42 created because if they come back home
36:46 in their mind they've been told by the
36:48 cults you were so broken that you can
36:51 never find these quality of friends in
36:53 your own personal life in any other
36:55 communication problem right you lock up
36:58 when someone starts talking to you you
36:59 don't know what to say but when you're
37:01 here doesn't it feel much better get on
37:04 the mic and tell us how your daddy
37:05 touched you as a little girl and then
37:09 we'll hold that against you your whole
37:10 life
37:11 they'll manipulate you with your
37:13 confessions I'm gonna tell you a story
37:16 that I learned from my friends in
37:19 Hollywood I have some friends who are
37:23 homosexual and they are older over 60
37:28 and so I've talked to them and I said
37:30 well you know today being gay is such a
37:33 totally controversial thing you can
37:35 never be happy as a gay person you've
37:37 got to be
37:38 flamboyance you must be obnoxious you
37:41 know you must go to these parades where
37:43 you know public nudity is illegal but
37:47 you can go to a gay pride parade and
37:49 this guy wearing a dildo costume with
37:50 his own junk sticking out at the bottom
37:52 you got your chicks with no tops on
37:55 their tits they're all hanging out it's
37:57 illegal to be like that in public
37:59 but that's what they feel like they need
38:00 to do so I asked him I said why aren't
38:02 you a part of this movement and what was
38:05 it like to grow up in the 50s and 60s as
38:08 a gay person and their comments were
38:13 really interesting they said you know
38:15 what
38:16 everyone knew we were called confirmed
38:19 bachelors back in the day these are
38:20 males right and he said you know we just
38:25 went to our own little parties did our
38:27 things no one bothered us no one
38:29 snickered at us at work we weren't the
38:32 disenfranchised
38:33 we were just slightly different and we
38:36 were very productive in society there's
38:39 no one bothered us in fact they love
38:41 what we did you know and so I said well
38:45 what do you think about today's movement
38:47 and there was this disdain on their face
38:50 to say well we're not a part of that in
38:54 fact from our generation we can't stand
38:57 the way these people behave because we
39:01 now have gone from a normal integrated
39:04 lifestyle to being scared to say that
39:09 we're homosexual because these
39:12 individuals have been so crazy and
39:15 society that they've demonized us as
39:17 much as it's on TV and then a greater
39:19 than every you know television show and
39:22 movie it's everywhere
39:23 right mostly television but the reason
39:26 why I mention that example is that you
39:28 get to see the difference between
39:30 someone who doesn't think they're broken
39:31 and someone who thinks they're broken a
39:34 group of people that didn't have a
39:35 political affiliation chasing them to
39:38 tell them how disenfranchised they were
39:40 - today we're a political group chases
39:44 you to tell you how disenfranchised you
39:45 are I'll give you another example I grew
39:49 up in America and
39:52 that I grew up in Middle America for a
39:54 big part of my life again I always
39:55 talked about living in Massachusetts for
39:56 about three years but there was the
39:59 blacks in the Midwest I never saw any
40:03 personally because I grew up in the 70s
40:05 segregation was over and but the
40:08 interesting thing was there was no
40:10 history of my hometown of two water
40:12 fountains and you had to go in the back
40:14 door and you couldn't ride on the front
40:15 of the bus I mean it was none of that
40:17 crap I never heard any stories of that
40:18 happening right when I was in
40:21 Massachusetts no big deal you were one
40:23 way and whatever your skin's different
40:25 big deal right usually these dudes were
40:27 very charismatic and the kind of friends
40:29 you wanted you know maybe they did have
40:32 to try a little bit harder because in
40:33 their mind they felt like a little
40:34 alienated and you know a predominantly
40:36 white community right and again I'll
40:39 remind everyone who is trying to hang on
40:43 to the racist thing I'm about to release
40:45 an episode called racism I'll probably
40:47 die just before I do this one but I
40:50 apologize if this is a duplicate but you
40:54 know the people who came to America
40:57 99.9% of them never owned slaves
40:59 couldn't possibly afford a slave even if
41:02 the service was available and the people
41:04 who brought them here were the Spaniards
41:06 and the French who bought them off the
41:09 Arabs okay because the Arabs were the
41:11 expert they had thousands of years of
41:14 selling their own people right and we as
41:17 white Americans especially in the late
41:19 1800s we were giving away our children
41:22 to work camps you know I hear people
41:28 talk about you know the the labor laws
41:29 against child labor believe me you have
41:33 no [ __ ] clue the world that we lived
41:35 in when child labor was a problem they
41:37 were snatching up seven-year-olds and
41:38 put them in the factories and and they
41:40 would barely get any education they died
41:42 in the factory it was just this weird
41:44 segment from probably about 1880 to 1900
41:47 horrible era in American
41:49 industrialization horrible but very few
41:53 people in America I mean an infant essa
41:56 mole fraction of a percent of American
41:59 blood in this country has anything to do
42:02 with slavery anything
42:05 and the thing is back in the day when I
42:08 was a kid we just kind of said look the
42:11 whites and the blacks for a gigantic
42:14 portion of the geographical history of
42:17 this country with some Asians coming in
42:19 on the on the west coast helping to
42:20 build railroads and all kinds of
42:22 wonderful things it was black and white
42:24 together the whole time building this
42:26 country making it happen again X out the
42:29 plantations my relatives in the 1630s
42:32 came over here as indentured servants to
42:35 a [ __ ] plantation in Virginia so cry
42:37 me a [ __ ] River men right my
42:40 bloodline has been endangered total
42:43 slave labor made ninety seven I mean a
42:45 buck maybe like a week or something the
42:48 97 cents on the dollar went to the
42:50 plantation three cents went to their
42:51 debt which is about 10 grand a person
42:53 was not fatal escape to get the hell out
42:56 of Dodge right to get out from under
42:57 that thing what's happening today every
43:02 race war that could possibly be fought
43:04 is being sensationalized by cults
43:09 there's cults in Mexico that teach all
43:12 the Mexicans this false history about
43:14 America when the Native Americans not
43:16 only had all control of America but they
43:19 controlled a giant part of Mexico just
43:22 do your [ __ ] history right but they're
43:25 taught that they're the conquistadors
43:27 everyplace the conquistadors set up shop
43:29 that was owned by Mexico right crazy
43:35 disenfranchised disenfranchised
43:37 disenfranchised that's how the game is
43:40 played today those are the micro cults
43:42 they get a lot of money from various
43:44 individuals that want to break America
43:47 right but then you have your extreme
43:51 disenfranchised right this is where we
43:54 get Satanist satanic churches from right
43:59 I'm just going to touch this really
44:00 briefly again again probably in season
44:05 one I talked about this but there's a
44:06 movie called Fright Night it's sort of a
44:09 horror comedy from back in the day back
44:11 in the 80s right mid 80s there's a key
44:14 scene in that movie which is this guy
44:16 moves into town who's Dracula
44:18 moves next door to this kid he lives
44:20 with his mother his father has gone for
44:22 somewhere some reason and he keeps
44:24 looking through the window of his house
44:26 into the window of the other guy's house
44:28 that starts discovering he's Dracula
44:29 just seeing what he does you know
44:32 so he charts trying to blow the whistle
44:34 but the guy keeps you know worming his
44:36 way into his life and there's this
44:38 little nerd guy in the kind of a mutt no
44:41 more not more not exactly an herb he's
44:43 kind of a mutt and he is always the kid
44:48 who's made fun of because he's weird and
44:51 eventually the Dracula character finds
44:55 him in his most depressed state where
44:58 he's been utterly rejected by his
44:59 friends he's been ridiculed by his
45:01 friends who don't mean to be ridiculing
45:03 him at the level that he's taking it
45:05 right but that's why you don't want to
45:06 do it to anybody because you don't know
45:07 and the guy pulls open his cape as a
45:11 Dracula and he goes don't you want to
45:14 have all the power in the world don't
45:15 you want to get back at these [ __ ]
45:16 for treating you badly and he just
45:19 beautifully gives us dialogue this
45:22 little monologue and the kid is bawling
45:24 his brains out and he climbs into the
45:27 cape he gets you know converted train
45:30 gets bit and converted into a vampire
45:33 because for the first time in his life
45:35 he gets control of himself not realizing
45:40 there's a thousand ways to take control
45:42 there's a very famous phrase in the
45:44 world which is control is not given it's
45:48 taken I'm gonna tell you yours truly has
45:52 tested that to the maximum and I will
45:53 tell you that no one came up to me and
45:55 said be confident be confident I had to
46:00 take it take it my whole life being an
46:03 only child they helped me you know avoid
46:05 a big brother or sister taking a [ __ ] on
46:07 me
46:08 right so I was able to kind of stay in
46:09 my own little world I moved around a lot
46:12 so I had to deal with bullies and
46:14 [ __ ] and at some point you just
46:16 stopped taking it in the second you
46:18 stopped taking it from a bully and you
46:20 put it back in their face they crumble
46:22 like [ __ ] matchsticks it's great you
46:26 see these videos online all the time
46:28 some big kid brought it up a little kid
46:30 and a little kid pops them in the jaw
46:31 falls down on his ass I can't see you
46:34 man once that happens to you you will
46:36 not look at bullying the same you'll
46:39 never do it right and you'll never take
46:42 it if you put it out right but let me
46:45 give you some scenarios here what do you
46:48 think the odds are that you're going to
46:49 somehow enact the law give a speech at
46:54 some point and you're gonna convert all
46:56 the racists in the world to not be
46:58 racists all of a sudden it's portrayed
47:00 in movies that way and television shows
47:02 that way and I'm sure it happens every
47:03 once in a while for the ignorant who are
47:05 still racist but there's a lot of bias
47:09 in the world right the only thing I'm
47:15 gonna tell you right now my opinion my
47:17 personal opinion that you can do to
47:18 change people's opinion if ever you
47:20 identify as whether you're identifying
47:23 as a black male black female or you're
47:26 homosexual or transvestite or whatever
47:28 it is the most disenfranchised formula
47:30 that anyone could possibly name that is
47:32 the go-to formula for these political
47:35 parties they try to exploit you right
47:39 the best thing you can do to shove it up
47:41 someone's ass who's judging you is to be
47:44 the most amazing person you can be and
47:48 don't be the victim all right
47:52 you may be a victim you might well be
47:55 there's good reasons for you to be angry
47:57 at individuals maybe a large amount of
48:00 individuals but I guarantee you as long
48:03 as you're a good person a cool cat as
48:06 they might say back in the rat-pack days
48:09 you will convert everyone you ever
48:11 wanted to convert into your fan from
48:15 anyone who's being cynical right I'll
48:19 give you another example again I'm kind
48:21 of leaning on the the examples that are
48:23 thrown in everyone's face at this point
48:26 in history in 2017 you know that the
48:29 orientation of individuals has been so
48:32 exploited that now it's in the
48:33 vernacular of mankind we talk about it
48:36 all the time whereas before we didn't I
48:40 would say 15 years ago [ __ ] even 17
48:44 years ago
48:45 I worked with two transvestites in the
48:49 video game industry one was in a remote
48:52 location I never physically met him but
48:54 I was very good friends with him and the
48:57 other one worked with me I recently had
49:01 a friend of mine change he decided he
49:06 was not a male and I will say that both
49:12 the individuals I work with in the
49:13 gaming industry when I when I go with
49:17 first the one I would always see you
49:19 know we're talking about a man dressed
49:20 in a dress walking around the hallways
49:22 and where I worked he at first was kind
49:25 of scared if anyone he didn't know
49:27 seeing him like that and it was
49:30 interesting because he committed to it
49:31 which I give him all the props in the
49:33 world
49:33 it's tough thing man it must be really
49:36 really tough and I had no idea how long
49:37 that guy particularly had been that way
49:39 you know seemed like it was recent for
49:41 him or something but he was the most
49:43 soft-spoken talented individual in our
49:47 company I mean he was just a really
49:49 solid asset for the company good guy
49:51 right or girl so he lived by example and
49:58 every single person who knew him had
50:01 nothing but great things to say about
50:02 the guy you know I guess I should say
50:04 girl so he was a service to his you know
50:11 identity the other guy worked with
50:15 outside of that where I physically
50:19 worked he was a guy when I first met him
50:21 and I used to help him make his video
50:23 games and test them and write reviews
50:25 for them and that sort of thing he while
50:28 I knew him made the change change his
50:31 name he was a great guy
50:35 he did lots of speeches and talks and
50:38 stuff so I was able to see some of his
50:39 stuff online great guy super mega
50:43 talented mega brilliant never heard a
50:46 soul and so there was not a single
50:48 person who does anything bad about him
50:50 at all ever no one ever I never had
50:54 anyone level any criticism towards him
50:57 right
50:58 a close friend of mine who just decided
51:01 to identify to his insides he has one of
51:06 the most spectacular personal
51:09 reputations of all the friends I know
51:10 who knew him went to school with him
51:13 nary a criticism and most of us have not
51:17 seen him as his new identity right he
51:20 changed his name for a male name to a
51:23 female name alright I know that at least
51:27 anybody went to school with the guy will
51:29 never criticize him ever they may not
51:32 understand what he's doing but they know
51:34 him to be the sweetest human being on
51:36 planet Earth
51:37 right and what's interesting was when he
51:40 was you know identifying as a as a male
51:42 he was a total total male total like
51:45 alpha male kind of guy and he just
51:47 whatever reason made this change alright
51:51 and of course he was cautious about it
51:53 because we're all from the Midwest and
51:57 he was just very careful about who he
51:59 allowed in his circle as didn't want to
52:01 hear any stupid comments from people but
52:03 - I think his surprise he has been met
52:06 with utter support and you know I think
52:10 he had his family already - so he took
52:12 care of his lineage and that sort of
52:13 thing and everyone's happy for him we're
52:17 not in there trying to make him feel
52:18 disenfranchised but depending on how he
52:22 filters his life I know there's groups
52:25 out there trying to get to him to make
52:26 him feel disenfranchised to capture his
52:28 political vote and to basically sell him
52:32 something right so let's let's move into
52:35 this last segment here which is what if
52:37 you find a family member or friend who's
52:39 in a cult what can you do well those
52:44 more social political cults that I've
52:47 been talking about here in this last
52:49 half it's gonna be really tough they're
52:53 just gonna have to hear well you're just
52:55 gonna have to live by example and and
52:58 teach everyone that there's no reason to
53:00 judge you right that's a tough sell
53:04 that's a tough sell so the ones that
53:07 aren't dealing with such acute
53:11 social issues ones that are more related
53:14 to perhaps a religion and again it
53:17 doesn't have to be anything to do with
53:18 formal religions like you know the ones
53:21 that are business religions or you know
53:24 essentially how you live your life
53:25 religions right you can always expect a
53:29 bunch of truth in there but you can also
53:32 expect a bunch of dependency right I
53:35 have had friends of mine lose their
53:37 marriages to cults network marketing
53:41 cults and their selling products and
53:43 they've convinced these people that
53:46 everyone needs their vitamins or
53:49 everyone needs their showers or water
53:52 filters or whatever right and even had a
53:55 friend of mine who was in a cult in the
53:58 90s she lost her husband she lost the
54:04 love of her life a second time because
54:06 of her loyalty to this cult even got on
54:08 a 60 Minutes bust in like 96 or
54:12 something like that with this particular
54:13 cult and in the last month sent me a
54:19 blurb from this guy who started that
54:22 cult saying I knew he was great because
54:24 if somebody really wrote a [ __ ]
54:25 article about himself about how great he
54:27 was I knew everything he sold was great
54:29 towing the cult to this day so this
54:32 person never has to go back and itemize
54:34 her life as being pretty screwed up at
54:36 some point right
54:37 that's how powerful these cults dig into
54:40 your psyche I will tell you the most
54:42 powerful thing I've been able to
54:44 communicate to my friends who have
54:46 gotten involved with these self-help
54:48 cults is to simply say when does it end
54:54 when does this cult end when do you get
54:58 the how to live your life manual and you
55:01 can go off and actually live it right
55:04 could you imagine you know we know the
55:06 colleges around the world are completely
55:08 corrupt today because they found out a
55:10 way to make some money from your loan
55:12 program okay but even the college's let
55:15 you go oh they'll encourage you to come
55:17 back and get more degrees but they know
55:18 you you got to go live your life
55:20 they just physically know it's an
55:21 imperative at 22 you got to go out and
55:24 get a job
55:24 parents are rich enough you're gonna
55:26 work ten jobs at the same time you can
55:27 go get your masters and your PhD on your
55:30 own dime and then get out or you can
55:31 take a [ __ ] ton of loans right but
55:34 because the colleges know you have this
55:35 impending doom to go off and earn money
55:38 to pay for the private for-profit loan
55:41 program right this outrageous amount of
55:44 money that you have to spend to get a
55:45 degree they kick you out on purpose to
55:48 go earn the money they're gonna make off
55:50 you're an annuity to them it's sick
55:53 right
55:55 so my travels it's been comparing formal
55:59 education at least go back 40 years go
56:02 back 50 years when things [ __ ] when I
56:03 moved to California at 87 you could take
56:06 not in a four-year university but you
56:08 could take infinite credits in junior
56:10 colleges and pretty much have two to
56:13 three years of your four year degree
56:14 worked out in a junior college for 50
56:17 bucks a semester infinite credits I used
56:20 to take 20 credits every every semester
56:23 right would you go back to those areas
56:26 and you remind your friends this is a
56:28 way it used to work when America was at
56:29 its absolute peak of brilliance we
56:34 didn't have college education as that
56:35 cost anywhere near even per capita for
56:38 you if you inflate money up from
56:40 whatever area you want to pick 1966 take
56:44 it what an average college degree cost
56:45 and amortize it up to the inflation of
56:48 today we are 10 times as expensive as it
56:51 used to be back in those days
56:53 maybe not Harvard and Stanford in those
56:55 kind of organizations that are always
56:56 going to cost an arm and a leg but if
57:00 you remind them that we used to have
57:01 finish lines it makes a difference
57:05 sometimes but you have to understand
57:08 that as you try to pry them out of these
57:10 these perceptions they have become
57:13 utterly physically and mentally addicted
57:15 to these cults
57:17 and so it's going to be very very
57:19 difficult for you to get a word in
57:21 edgewise you will start to become the
57:23 enemy which is what they've done to your
57:25 loved one from the very beginning by
57:27 changing their language changing their
57:29 thinking you become the problem if you
57:32 so much as say the emperor has no
57:35 clothes on the other one is the deaf
57:38 remind them about the language change if
57:40 there is one in your particular loved
57:42 ones issue and their cult if they start
57:45 to change the way that they speak it's
57:49 weird to have your loved one come home
57:51 start talking weird in the room you find
57:54 yourself using the words just so you can
57:56 talk to them and you're like Jesus
57:59 Christ this is infectious I have to talk
58:02 in gobbledygook speak just to get them
58:04 to understand me to respect me right you
58:09 will also find that let's just say
58:11 you've had an experience you've started
58:13 your own business you made a bunch of
58:14 money whatever so you've done it four or
58:16 five times you're pretty good at it and
58:18 then someone around you your buddy your
58:20 spouse whatever boyfriend girlfriend get
58:23 off in a business cult all of a sudden
58:26 they'll come home and start telling you
58:28 things that you've told them for years
58:30 but all the sudden it's it's correct
58:33 now that they've heard it from the cult
58:34 wasn't correctively heard from you and
58:36 that's one other thing is that it's
58:41 almost a childish thing if you've ever
58:43 heard you've ever seen a kid do
58:45 something wrong maybe you have your own
58:46 children and they do something wrong and
58:48 you try to help them like well you know
58:50 I knew she did that you got that bruise
58:52 on your head if you do this it you can
58:55 you know pitch the ball without smacking
58:57 you in the face and they'll get mad that
58:59 you told them a child we can write a
59:02 blank check it's a child
59:03 angry and they've heard you but they
59:06 don't want you to know they don't wanna
59:07 they want to take credit for it because
59:08 it's all part of being a child and
59:10 learning and proving to yourself you
59:12 have control of your life but as an
59:14 adult that continues for a lot of people
59:17 in fact in my life I would say Derek
59:21 damn near 50% of the world wants to
59:23 learn everything the hard way
59:24 even after ages of 30 or 40 years old
59:28 they refuse to take the simplest route
59:30 they want to get the bumps and the
59:32 scrapes and they want to risk an
59:34 overwhelming preponderance of risk of
59:37 failure just so they can say they did it
59:41 right
59:42 now there's something to be said about
59:43 learning something the hard way you do
59:46 learn a lot when you learn something the
59:48 hard way you learn pretty much every
59:50 detail you could possibly learn about a
59:53 particular subject like if I put you in
59:56 am give you a weird example here if
59:58 you've never painted a car before and
60:00 you got to do it and you know there's
60:02 got to be a sanding process and a primer
60:05 you gonna do a certain number of coats
60:06 and you got to mix the paint a certain
60:08 way if I left you in a room for infinity
60:11 you know you'd figure it out but you're
60:13 gonna have crappy sanding and I get all
60:15 the primer off before you put new primer
60:17 on you're gonna get fish eyes on side
60:19 your paint job and you're gonna be upset
60:21 then you're gonna sand it all back down
60:23 again you're gonna go and go until you
60:24 get this damn thing perfect right so if
60:27 you were to do that yeah you would be a
60:29 master painter by the time it's over but
60:32 then you have to ask yourself about the
60:34 economy of life how many years do you
60:36 have been how many years do you have to
60:39 figure [ __ ] out right I tell kids today
60:43 I say look between kindergarten and
60:45 senior year that's the only guarantee
60:49 law enforced education that you're gonna
60:52 get and of course you can drop out
60:53 depending on what state you're in early
60:55 but that's really the base you know
60:58 education you're gonna get now let's say
60:59 you're gonna go to college you get four
61:00 years minimum so 18 to 22 I've said this
61:05 several times on the show but the idea
61:06 is during your twenties you want to take
61:08 every risk you can possibly take to get
61:10 the dream career you've always wanted
61:11 why well what are your costs nothing you
61:16 can go live in a room when I moved to
61:19 California my first room I rented I
61:22 didn't have any money to pay rent I had
61:25 a mattress on a floor because the
61:27 mattress was already here and I just
61:31 slept on it read books and went to work
61:33 I eventually had to pay the guy after I
61:34 left which is a couple months later then
61:37 I moved into a room a 10 foot by 10 foot
61:39 room with the mattress and all my stuff
61:43 I had like a stereo and a bunch of books
61:45 and stuff I did that for probably I
61:47 don't know half a year then I made a ton
61:50 of money working my ass off and by the
61:52 age of 19 I had rented my own
61:55 two-bedroom apartment and a really nice
61:56 complex and I had two rooms and a whole
62:00 front room in the kitchen and everything
62:01 right I lived in [ __ ]
62:04 then the guy actually agreed to room
62:08 with me about six months later wrote me
62:12 a bad check screwed me over then I was
62:16 back to running a 10 by 10 room from my
62:18 boss then I haven't moved into a garage
62:22 the family I mentioned in a previous
62:24 episode lived on a pullout sofa that's
62:27 where I slept it was a nice you know
62:29 refurbished garage that was a full house
62:32 they put the garage door had to work
62:34 right because it was the law right and
62:37 so you know after that I finally gotten
62:40 some normal housing for the rest of my
62:42 life but you know I sacrificed to get
62:45 there if someone had come up to me and
62:47 said oh you're a victim of society and
62:50 oh my god you deserve to have [ __ ]
62:52 4,000 square foot house and all this
62:54 stuff paid for I don't know how to
62:56 respond sounds pretty good right there
62:58 just promising you blue sky the whole
63:00 time so maybe I get all disenfranchised
63:04 and run around complaining about my life
63:05 but what I would not have done has been
63:08 productive to get what I wanted I would
63:10 have never developed the talents the
63:12 mother of invention to work hard build
63:14 up talents and earn that [ __ ] for myself
63:16 which I ended up doing right there's a
63:19 couple phrases out there that are real
63:21 important and growing up will help you
63:23 avoid cults easy come easy go
63:27 there's a big one if anything comes
63:30 really easy and there are exceptions to
63:32 the rule but if they are exceptions you
63:33 can appreciate them you know as such I
63:36 know friends of mine who are super
63:38 couples they met and were married within
63:40 45 days and died together amazing
63:44 those are exceptions to the rule I was
63:47 been watching the the comedy series
63:50 Cheers and I never really listened to
63:53 the words of the song at the very
63:55 beginning which doesn't really turn me
63:56 on was a sort of a 70s kind of piano
63:59 ballad thing but one of the things you
64:01 said was something the effect of you
64:07 know surviving in the world today takes
64:09 everything you got and he's right the
64:14 the lyricist the singer who wrote that
64:16 is completely correct
64:17 it is very tough to least get your your
64:21 life started it really is and you should
64:23 get as much help as you possibly can if
64:27 your very cognitive of what's going on
64:29 your life you could essentially to turn
64:31 the formula around for a cult and rape
64:33 them the opposite where you determine
64:37 your own finish line right you know I've
64:41 done an episode on the alien promise I
64:42 did on the flat earth promise and the
64:44 whole thing is that most of what our
64:47 religions promise are easy ways out you
64:53 know think about most religions that
64:56 have some sort of salvation
64:57 they say commit as many crimes as you
64:59 want one of the religions says go in
65:01 every Sunday morning and confess and
65:03 you'll be completely expunged the other
65:05 ones just say well if you accept this
65:07 particular fictitious character as your
65:09 you know Savior and God then as soon as
65:15 you die everything you've done all be
65:16 expunged not quite frankly if we're
65:19 really in a universe with an afterlife I
65:21 can't imagine a tremendous amount of
65:24 your life that matters once you've
65:25 transcended I think that the spirits of
65:29 the universe would know that you were
65:30 brought up badly abused and which is why
65:33 you hurt animals and human beings
65:35 eventually right but life is tough at
65:39 first we now teach people less than
65:43 we've ever taught them in the history of
65:46 the world and that is completely and
65:48 utterly by design right again I've said
65:51 it several times but imagine the fact
65:54 that you're given a credit card and even
65:56 if you got a business degree in college
65:59 took every math class you possibly could
66:02 I took all kinds of wild math classes in
66:04 in high school two of them which were
66:07 geared towards understanding personal
66:09 home finance now once once did anyone
66:14 teach me how compound interest works and
66:16 our credit card works never were they
66:18 allowed to simulate purchasing things on
66:20 credit cards to pay your bills I guess
66:23 they were hoping that perhaps in the mid
66:26 80s that you would just not use them
66:28 because they weren't given to eighteen
66:29 year olds the second you turned eighteen
66:31 today their mail to you pre-approved
66:33 five grand
66:34 jet that stuff's been going on since the
66:36 early 90s
66:37 about one of my girlfriends she wasn't
66:40 even 21 yet she was $10,000 in debt and
66:44 this is in 91 92 I said how did you get
66:48 in debt I mean how they I was like
66:50 impossible I had a car loan but that was
66:52 it didn't any credit cards besides a
66:53 Shell gas station card she said well
66:56 they just came pre-approved and I said
66:58 well didn't you realize that was a debt
67:01 machine like when you spent that card
67:03 you had to pay for and she goes no I had
67:04 no clue this wasn't free money I have
67:09 relatives that are you know old
67:11 unfamiliar parents who think the same
67:13 thing until they got bitten and go
67:15 bankrupt how other possessions
67:16 repossessed right so the irony of a cult
67:20 that is making you pay to stay in it is
67:25 that the very thing that puts you in the
67:28 lost state of disenfranchised thought
67:31 especially if you're talking about
67:32 financial success or even financial
67:34 survival which when I was young was very
67:36 easy now it's really difficult is to pay
67:39 a cult to figure out how to pay your
67:42 bills my friends who can't pay rent who
67:46 still pay into a cult to figure out how
67:49 to pay rent they complain all throughout
67:52 the year that they can't take a vacation
67:55 but they have to fly out to chase the
67:58 cult all over the United States of
67:59 America every one of these little fly
68:02 outs is a vacation combine them all
68:05 together Jesus you could stay in Hawaii
68:06 for a month renting a home and not a
68:09 hotel but they'll never ever see that
68:11 destiny because they bought into the
68:14 cult we have to break this cycle all
68:19 right we're ignorant is essentially
68:24 Thor's hammer to turn into bambam and go
68:28 all around the world destroying
68:30 everything because we're not educated
68:32 and the more we become uneducated I'm
68:37 telling you the amount of cults we have
68:38 today there's going to double triple and
68:41 quadruple and it will be used as the
68:42 tool to take away every single sovereign
68:44 right we have
68:45 fought for every single soldier has ever
68:47 died in history in any country around
68:50 the world will have died completely in
68:52 vain every time something like Magna
68:55 Carta was invented or the Constitution
68:56 United States was plagiarized the Magna
68:58 Carta all those people who sacrifice
69:01 their lives and risked everything to
69:03 bring us these inalienable rights as
69:05 defined by the Republic will be washed
69:08 away by pure sheer concentrated
69:12 ignorance and probably a [ __ ] ton of
69:15 stupidity right some of you might ask
69:20 okay well do you just leave these people
69:21 behind well it just depends if your life
69:25 is on a huge up uptick you got plenty of
69:28 money you're plenty you're happy that
69:29 sort of thing and you've got patience in
69:32 time and you know the ability to be
69:34 dragged down a little bit without losing
69:36 your own consciousness then by all means
69:38 try to try with all of your might to
69:43 inform these people and get them out of
69:44 these cults but if you're already at the
69:47 very precipice of your own demise trying
69:50 to yank someone out of this stuff and
69:51 they're yanking you down past that
69:53 little line of total destruction you're
69:57 gonna have to probably cut them loose at
70:00 least for the time being until hopefully
70:02 they might wake up and realize it's not
70:05 worth it that you were right be kind be
70:09 courteous trying to be as understanding
70:10 as possible understand that the second
70:13 you start talking against the cult
70:14 they're gonna start seeing horns go out
70:16 of here out of your forehead and you're
70:19 gonna be the enemy
70:20 you might exit your relationship with
70:23 them labeled as the enemy hopefully
70:26 they're big enough to get theirselves
70:28 out of that problem but to to come back
70:30 and rebrand your friendship as a true
70:32 friendship knowing that you were the
70:34 only person that ever told him the truth
70:35 the capital T but what they were
70:37 involved in you did in a loving way
70:40 perhaps save their life if you are
70:43 caught in the disenfranchised the
70:45 envelope as exacerbated by various
70:48 political groups and I don't care which
70:49 one you want to pick pick any of them
70:52 turn out to be owned you want to [ __ ]
70:56 and moan about slavery of any kind on
70:58 behalf of
70:59 group that you think was enslaved or
71:01 your own group that was enslaved okay
71:03 fine
71:03 stop being one yourself stop being a
71:07 slave to a credit card stop being a
71:09 slave to a cult a religion anything
71:12 that's trying to program your brain be
71:14 your own person
71:15 love yourself look in that mirror and
71:18 say I [ __ ] Rock right because you're
71:23 not supposed to say that because that
71:24 means you're arrogant anybody who tells
71:26 you that [ __ ] them
71:28 okay all right I don't look in the
71:30 mirror every morning and tell myself I'm
71:32 shitty I might say oh Christ you gained
71:34 10 pounds you need to knock that [ __ ]
71:35 off right other than that I'm pretty
71:38 good to myself you should be good to
71:40 yourself - no one should own your
71:43 opinion of you except you especially if
71:47 you're a female
71:48 don't let boys on your opinion of
71:50 yourself and males don't let have
71:52 females on the opinion of yourself make
71:54 yourself interesting make yourself kind
71:57 own your decisions be decisive even if
72:00 it means you're gonna make a couple
72:01 mistakes you'll become better at it but
72:04 don't cower it into indecisiveness to
72:06 somehow avoid problems in your life or
72:09 negativity go in there do it do it all
72:11 by yourself and your 20s if you can if
72:14 you're older experiment find yourself
