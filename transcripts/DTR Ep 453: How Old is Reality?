00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen on this brisk Saturday nights
00:35 or Sunday morning however you want to
00:36 look at it it's about 12:30 a.m. I just
00:40 got done editing episode 4 for 8 it
00:44 looks like we're gonna get half the
00:45 season done before the end of the year
00:46 how awesome is that
00:48 right okay so this is gonna sound like
00:54 some potentially it might sound like
00:56 some cheap little gimmick of an episode
00:59 but I assure you this is one it sort of
01:02 pops in and out of my head in a serious
01:07 way often enough that I'm now making an
01:10 episode about it because I'd love to
01:12 have your thought process on this one
01:15 and it goes something like this what
01:20 gives us the impression that the world
01:22 is any older than us and more
01:28 specifically than calling it the world
01:30 reality right you know if for any of
01:36 you've seen Dark City the premise of
01:39 Dark City is that a guy wakes up and
01:42 he's in this sort of Gotham City I don't
01:46 know it looks like it's in the 30s kind
01:47 of and you know he's kind of going about
01:51 his daily business I think he works for
01:52 a newspaper or something and then you go
01:56 to bed you wake up but he eventually
01:59 wakes up in the middle of well he either
02:03 he wakes up he doesn't go to sleep and
02:04 he starts to see something that's really
02:06 disturbing these trenchcoat guys with
02:10 black hats are moving bodies around and
02:15 so they'll take someone out of a car and
02:17 swap out someone's husband and then swap
02:19 it her out it's part of its a Twilight
02:21 Zone from back in the day but and then
02:24 he finds Kiefer Sutherland he was like
02:26 this nutty weird professor guy and he
02:31 learns that Wow
02:33 something's going on when we go to sleep
02:37 and then he realizes man you know when's
02:39 the last time it's ever been daylight I
02:41 mean I kind of remember daylight but
02:44 never seen it I can't remember having
02:45 seen it but I remember way back in my
02:48 past I got photographs of the daytime
02:50 but I you know he asked his boss who's
02:53 William Hertz like one of the best
02:54 actors in the whole world
02:55 you know once last time remember being
02:57 daylight why are we at work in the
03:00 middle of the of the night and so you
03:05 don't won't tell you the anything of it
03:06 or anything like that but you realize
03:08 that his reality is way different than
03:09 it then it looks and that this whole
03:11 thing is being orchestrated that they're
03:14 testing people in different positions
03:17 now the other side of it is the philip k
03:23 dick book that's called Do Androids
03:26 Dream of Electric Sheep which turned
03:28 into Blade Runner or replicants were
03:33 given memory tracks or memories memory
03:37 checks it was the sixties term for it
03:39 and they think they're real Rachel
03:42 thought she was real until Deckard tells
03:44 her two stories about her childhood
03:47 where her brother and her played you
03:49 know I'll show you mine if you show me
03:51 yours
03:52 he did his and she chickened out and
03:55 left and then the second story was that
03:56 she watched a spider build a web and
04:00 then when it did laid a big egg in it
04:03 and then the egg hatched and the little
04:05 spiders ate the mother very traumatizing
04:07 for a little girl and he says those are
04:09 Terrell's nieces and she had to resolve
04:13 an issue later in the film where she
04:14 remembers learning how to play the piano
04:16 as a child she didn't know she could
04:17 play so she gets on the piano while
04:20 Deckard's taking a little nap and she
04:21 starts playing and then he gets up he
04:24 says I heard a piano and she goes man
04:25 well I didn't know if I could play I
04:29 remember learning so wouldn't it be
04:33 interesting to think just as a paradigm
04:37 shift for your mind it may be see
04:39 something you haven't seen before but
04:42 every day that you wake up might be the
04:43 first and only day that you exist that
04:47 everything before that is just an
04:48 illusion
04:49 I had a major déjà vu tonight at the
04:52 lounge I was using my computer I was
04:56 scrolling a particular image on my
04:58 computer and then I was watching this
04:59 weird movie with David Duchovny and
05:04 Orlando Jones who just so happens to be
05:07 on the front of TMZ today for being let
05:11 go from the show American Gods which wow
05:14 what a complete [ __ ] that is they're
05:17 claiming he's not in the book his
05:19 character Nancy's not in the book or
05:21 Anansi but he is the reason why I
05:24 watched the show I mean I loved the
05:25 other characters I love Ian McShane and
05:29 Richie dude but Wow so anyway it just
05:35 got me thinking about this fabric of
05:37 reality you know how many of you who
05:39 have deja vu after seeing the matrix in
05:41 1999 could never shake the whole idea of
05:44 a glitch in the matrix and I'm literally
05:47 driving home and I mean this was like
05:49 probably 30 seconds of massive deja vu
05:55 nothing predictive but I did feel like
05:57 people were going to come into the
05:58 lounge but that never happened but yeah
06:01 our reality it's based on our acceptance
06:05 of what is but now think about ancient
06:10 history as well what's really
06:13 fascinating about our world right now is
06:16 that when you go back well Jesus take
06:20 the last 100 years and try to find out
06:22 what history is because it is so revised
06:25 by the I guess he used to call him the
06:28 Illuminati back in the day now they're
06:30 called a deep state and all their
06:32 iterations in between they have so lied
06:34 about who's who what's what who's good
06:36 who's bad what is good what is bad that
06:39 we know that we're struggling just to
06:41 just to figure out what the last hundred
06:42 years really was all about and then you
06:46 eclipse a hundred years and you're like
06:47 oh my god what happened in the you know
06:50 19th century 18th century and then all
06:52 the way back to these fabled existence
06:55 of gods walking you know with us and
06:57 doing all those you know crazy wild
07:01 miracles and it's not just
07:03 it's a ton of them and then you know it
07:06 really gets super frayed when you get
07:08 back to maybe the Babylonian time saying
07:12 script and and really having just loose
07:15 artifacts from that time frame we don't
07:17 really go back that far every once in a
07:21 while we'll find a guy buried in the ice
07:23 and they carbon date the dude and they
07:25 think he's 60 oh no like 5000 years back
07:29 and then they'll find out you know a
07:31 mammoth elephant okay there's still not
07:35 much
07:36 and then we perceive ourselves as this
07:40 really infant being on earth we really
07:43 are I mean we're still allowing you know
07:47 ridiculous douchebags to run the world
07:49 telling us that war is good for us the
07:51 killing babies at nine months is good
07:53 good practice you know you don't believe
07:56 in anything to think that shit's
07:57 [ __ ] right so we live in this weird
08:01 world we have churches of Satan going up
08:03 all over the world and their mantra
08:05 internally is to gain power from Satan
08:07 you have to sacrifice a human being
08:09 among other things what we have churches
08:14 like the Vatican that have presided over
08:17 more pedophilia cases revealed to the
08:19 public than any other organization or
08:21 individual in world history but they are
08:23 the proxy to God for a lot of people
08:27 this is our world and so you look at it
08:31 you're kind of like does any of this
08:34 really make any sense I mean does it
08:36 really and if it doesn't make sense is
08:39 this just at a wakening being maybe
08:43 maybe it's just you
08:45 maybe I don't exist maybe I'm maybe it's
08:48 just me and you don't exist I'm making
08:50 you up mm-hmm
08:53 but it seems is almost like I feel like
08:57 at times that my past or the the history
08:59 that I study I should say way before I
09:02 was born is sort of a silly ridiculous
09:06 story I mean think about this they
09:08 landed on the moon supposedly was that
09:10 July 20th so I was born the next month
09:15 about a week and a half later
09:17 after that you know a month in that
09:19 weekend in like 45 days after or
09:20 whatever and so why does the moon
09:23 mission look so stupid but have a really
09:26 idealistic approach because maybe as a
09:30 child looking up at the moon because
09:33 that's one of my earliest memories as a
09:35 baby I couldn't speak and they put me in
09:37 this crib and my mom was pointing at the
09:39 moon and goes there's men up there right
09:41 now which I don't know that would have
09:43 to be the next year I guess I can't look
09:44 up the other mission dates so I can
09:46 memorize him but maybe I invented that
09:50 and so I didn't cover all the details I
09:52 didn't cover you know maneuvers and I
09:54 just created this fantasy story yeah
09:58 right I did an episode on the NPC thing
10:02 right the non-player character thing
10:04 there's two different thought processes
10:06 with that the NPC's that they're talking
10:08 about in the mainstream conspiracy world
10:10 are people that are just sort of project
10:14 mocking Bergin individuals right they're
10:16 told what to say and they say it they
10:18 don't care and they repeat the same
10:19 script on every single Channel yeah
10:22 those people exist nothing really
10:24 remarkable but remarkable about that my
10:27 episode was about are some of these
10:30 people even real you know what if we
10:34 were put into a situation where we
10:37 wanted to toughen ourselves up in a
10:39 holodeck what did Worf always do on next
10:43 generation he would go into the holodeck
10:45 and program up a bunch of enemies and
10:46 just take his bat'leth that was called
10:51 and just slaughter them all right well
10:54 that was right in front of our face
10:55 those aren't real people they're
10:57 characters now we do a really bad
11:00 impersonation of reality with video
11:01 games today because we really don't have
11:03 anything that's really like reality as
11:06 much as virtual reality tries to do it
11:07 it's getting closer it'll eventually get
11:09 there but the other ones that are very
11:12 interesting at these theories that
11:14 people tried to create you know
11:16 conspiracy theories that the the
11:18 pyramids were built in the 1800s by the
11:20 Masons to create god-knows-what history
11:23 you know the idea that these things were
11:27 built and then we can't build them again
11:28 it's
11:29 you know like an an oxymoron right but
11:35 now let's say we go down this I don't
11:38 wanna take any was on the edge of going
11:39 completely insane and push them over the
11:41 cliff on this subject matter so just
11:44 consider this exercise in your mind of a
11:47 well if we're at the deep thoughts
11:50 Institute and this prospect comes over
11:55 the table at some interval where we
11:58 consider new ideas some weekly
12:01 submission meeting that we have
12:04 everyone's invited maybe there's a maybe
12:07 there's an app for that
12:08 right we find out which one's the most
12:10 popular one and then we talk about it
12:12 and whether or not we're gonna start a
12:13 new wing on the on the side of the
12:15 college for it or dedicate some
12:16 resources to it how would we ever prove
12:23 the age of the world because what they
12:26 have done has created all these
12:28 mechanisms that the tell us our ironclad
12:31 methods of carbon dating things doing
12:35 you know what is it some of those uh
12:37 these radio waves and some of the
12:40 different techniques they're trying to
12:43 create a whole new technique that can
12:44 age the valence or estuary age the
12:47 patina on a rock the oxidization of Iraq
12:50 I mean it's just come on come on
12:52 seriously but they'll tell us that these
12:57 techniques are perfect and then later
12:58 someone goes another not why because
13:01 that eyes not dotted that T is in crust
13:04 and this doesn't work you know two plus
13:06 two right there equal three in their
13:08 equation this doesn't work doll gosh
13:11 back to square one right so what if
13:15 everything that we think
13:16 and what's really [ __ ] hilarious for
13:19 me sorry for dropping the f-bomb so
13:21 early in this one but what really blows
13:23 me away is when people will tell me with
13:26 no friction in their mind of doubt that
13:30 the universe is this old the earth is
13:33 that old [ __ ] humans are this whole
13:35 everything's you know dinosaurs existed
13:37 da-da-da-da-da oh it sounds
13:43 most is ludicrous on the religious side
13:44 where someone's like up in the world's
13:46 4,500 years old that's it okay but what
13:51 gives us the perception of time anyway
13:53 we've talked about it several times on
13:55 the show i got whole episodes on it but
13:59 i always say look because we have this
14:02 comparative memory we believe that we
14:05 have stored a previous state of the
14:07 universe our world our sphere of
14:12 observability in a chain somewhere in
14:16 some database right I don't give a crap
14:18 if we want to talk about it being in the
14:19 soul clouds of the universe or and just
14:22 stored in ourselves in our mind and our
14:25 brain excuse me you know doesn't matter
14:28 it's a chain link comparison so what
14:31 happens is we look back into the chain
14:33 which in our perception mechanism says
14:37 well it can't get into the chain of
14:38 history unless it happened whether it be
14:41 we learned about a lie about history or
14:43 we learned about something we believed
14:44 to be true about history you know most
14:48 of us don't have to reach outside of our
14:50 own lives to completely understand the
14:52 feeling of history you remember being a
14:55 child most likely you remember being a
14:58 pre-adolescent than an adult then you're
15:01 20 to 30 to 40 to 50 etc you remember
15:04 things that happen in fact a lot of
15:06 folks remember those moments so well
15:08 that they live in sort of sadness that
15:11 they can't go back and relive those
15:13 times instead of making something out of
15:15 where they are right now
15:17 but okay let's draw a line we're at this
15:21 table that they're at our College right
15:23 the deep thoughts University and we know
15:26 we have to draw a line somewhere with a
15:29 line has to begin at its best right when
15:34 we think we were born everything after
15:38 that our memory track in our mind is
15:43 going to be full of events that we
15:45 partially remember as we're really
15:47 really young and then or vividly
15:49 remember once we hit that threshold
15:51 again for me I've got some memories I
15:55 got that crib memory
15:56 or I didn't know how to speak that was
15:58 another weird one I never talked back
16:00 and ever said anything I'm just looking
16:01 right I was at my great grandmother's
16:04 house and I was outside was worth they'd
16:07 swear they put babies just outside in a
16:09 crib outside it's crazy and I remember
16:12 exactly where that house used to be
16:13 because it was just just down the street
16:14 from the drive-thru but then I remember
16:17 being three and picking my favorite
16:21 color and getting stung by a bee
16:22 remember being 4 and realizing Jesus I
16:25 hate being a kid I want to be a grown-up
16:27 let's get going not too much from 5:00
16:30 not too much from 6:00 just a few weird
16:33 kind of shadowy memories riding in my
16:34 father's motorcycle then 7:00 it's on as
16:39 soon as I hit 7 I remembered everything
16:42 within reason right okay that's my
16:46 memory check of my life now why do I
16:49 think well look but this way how do i
16:52 process history that's before me because
16:55 one feels like a possession one feels
16:58 like an undeniable fact of my existence
17:01 and one is hearsay it's hearsay it's
17:07 just like hearsay from a legal case you
17:11 don't really know do you well you heard
17:13 it from somebody right yeah okay well
17:15 that's not a miscible in court it's
17:16 hearsay
17:17 damn you know well did we go to the moon
17:21 well I heard we did even all the
17:23 missions that happened up to 72 I didn't
17:26 see any Rockets launch I didn't go to
17:29 the moon myself I've never talked to one
17:31 of the astronauts so I really it's all
17:34 just hearsay wasn't it interesting here
17:37 say he's not admissible in court but
17:38 hearsay is how we build up all of our
17:40 hat all of our perception of history
17:43 let's do a little exercise and see if it
17:46 leads to something I have been taught
17:50 that Franz Ferdinand was murdered which
17:54 resulted in a level of friction in
18:00 Europe that resulted in World War one
18:03 starting as I've recently watched the
18:07 documentary twice from two different
18:08 sources
18:10 he drove by this area where I believe he
18:13 was supposed to stop these men ran out
18:16 and threw grenades at him and tried to
18:18 shoot him but they missed but they hit
18:19 one of his buddies he takes the car he
18:23 is a driver and the car goes to the
18:25 hotel drops off his wife he says I got
18:28 to go back from my friend Shirley those
18:31 killers are gone and he drives back and
18:35 some dude walks out of some pub or some
18:39 whatever and shoots him in the head okay
18:43 now there's a whole bunch of that story
18:45 just sounds stupid as hell right that
18:48 form of trying to kill him is absolutely
18:51 ridiculous some some rookie ambush on a
18:55 world leader whatever happens just -
18:58 walking up to the guy and shooting him
19:01 right whatever happened to that have
19:03 four or five guys just get within a foot
19:05 of the dude he is not going to live you
19:08 just pull it waist level
19:10 that's a duh and he goes down cuz he's
19:13 injured and then the second guy finishes
19:14 him off whatever happened to that yeah
19:17 we never killed anybody before
19:18 an assassination surely we had right
19:20 even King Tut had a hole in his head
19:22 right but now imagine because this story
19:25 sounds so weird it seems to defy all
19:28 logic of a man who's smart enough to
19:31 become a world leader of any region of
19:33 the world could have been made up how
19:37 many people believe that the Gulf of
19:38 Tonkin events occurred to catalyze us
19:41 into the Vietnam War well as far as I
19:45 know at least twenty to thirty years
19:47 that story remained and now it is
19:49 debunked it is a fake
19:52 none of those events occurred you know
19:54 the Vietcong Navy you know I should have
19:56 just let everybody know that doesn't
19:59 make any sense right land-based
20:01 individuals who are basically living at
20:04 least a hundred years behind everybody
20:05 else of the first world order they don't
20:10 have jets they don't have like you know
20:13 helicopters they're just you know
20:15 farmers trying to defend themselves they
20:18 had a scuffle with the French the French
20:20 do what they do and they left and then
20:22 we went here and got
20:23 stuck in the war forever you know so
20:27 much of our history is just a story and
20:31 that's the other part that's just
20:32 mind-blowing one of the most popular
20:36 books in the world if not the most
20:38 popular book in the world is the
20:39 Christian Bible I think most scholars
20:42 who still find its value know that a ton
20:47 of this is just allegory and story to
20:50 teach us lessons to say that an
20:52 individual predicted someone to exist in
20:54 the future yeah you know what's
20:59 interesting about the whole revelations
21:02 I was having this conversation with
21:04 another guy at my lounge a few days ago
21:07 and I said to him I said you know the
21:09 most amazing thing about the Bible is
21:11 the revelations prediction that we'll be
21:13 in a one-world currency and it's easy to
21:17 say that a long time ago and then make
21:22 it happen as the bankers the bankers
21:23 could simply read revelations ago oh
21:25 yeah that is a great idea and let's make
21:27 it happen
21:27 but what blows my mind about that
21:29 passage is that someone thought that was
21:31 a threat when the Bible was actually you
21:35 know translated out of all the hidden
21:36 text into the King James Bible which
21:40 allowed it to be read by mortal men
21:42 right that is a threat a single
21:46 one-world currency if we cannot get word
21:48 of world corruption and then put
21:51 something in place to keep it from
21:52 occurring again that would be a really
21:55 bad situation for mankind because
21:57 whoever controls that money just like
21:59 the Rothschild said controls the whole
22:01 place but now how many bogeymen do we
22:05 have from the past that are supposed to
22:10 be real and then how many boogie men do
22:12 we have written into lore that we sort
22:14 of accept aren't real you know there's
22:17 this sort of rebranding everyone's
22:20 always trying to rebrand who are
22:22 interested in vampires they always try
22:23 to rebrand vampires about every twenty
22:26 thirty years right a new writer will
22:27 come out you know and Rice did a
22:30 brilliant job reimagining the vampire in
22:33 a very fictional sense but more recently
22:37 they're saying that the individuals that
22:39 are part of these churches of Satan and
22:42 various other weird sects of similar
22:47 incarnations their desire to drink human
22:50 blood to stay young was was Rhema tabble
22:56 iced up into the modern-day vampire and
23:01 of course they have this thing we can't
23:02 walk around during the day and you'll
23:03 you know you'll burn up if you get hit
23:05 by the Sun that's probably more flowery
23:08 constraints on the character but you
23:12 know we do there's just it's a weird
23:15 thing you know like there's there's
23:16 people in royalty that always make it to
23:18 a hundred years always always always
23:22 so it's interesting you know we have
23:28 stories of Bigfoots werewolf's was it
23:33 that kuba kuba we have to lean on
23:39 hearsay and trust that is also based on
23:44 almost an infinite amount of hearsay and
23:47 Trust for us to have any perception of
23:50 the world and of course we have
23:53 anthropologists and we have
23:55 archaeologists that try to go out and
23:58 find empirical evidence of things and
24:01 they might find some pottery might find
24:03 a shipwreck I find a coin with a year on
24:06 it and so some of those things are
24:09 profound in helping us out right and
24:12 then you have the historian who's
24:15 writing it all down and trying to
24:17 connect as many dots as possible to
24:20 reconstruct the history of the world but
24:23 there are these weird events in history
24:25 that are sort of unexplained you know
24:29 the burning of the Alexander library
24:32 mm-hmm you know it's like there's always
24:36 someone who's smart in the world who's
24:38 in charge the idea that you would burn
24:40 down a library with pretty much the
24:44 pinnacle of man's knowledge at the time
24:48 seems completely impossible
24:50 to believe you would want to put people
24:54 in the library evaluate what is
24:56 duplicitous with what you already know
24:59 in other areas of the world find out
25:01 things that are perhaps the anti dogma
25:04 anti propaganda against your propaganda
25:06 earmarked those to be burned but if
25:09 there's any sort of mathematical
25:10 philosophical scientific medical any
25:14 knowledge that you don't have there is
25:16 no way on planet earth you would let
25:18 that text be burned it might be the
25:22 difference between your own life and
25:24 your own death if you simply knew that
25:26 crushing this flower and putting it in a
25:28 tea and drinking it would save your life
25:30 you wouldn't just get rid of it but we
25:35 love those epic moments in time those
25:37 breathtaking crescendos to a story don't
25:39 we the Bible is full of them the Bible's
25:43 made of them every time a miracle
25:45 happens you're talking about a massive
25:47 turn in a script it captivates your mind
25:50 cures leprosy here's some sort of
25:54 seizure that's going on brings a guy
25:56 back from the dead brings himself back
25:57 from the dead ascends to heaven all
25:59 these things which have been told
26:01 several times are the miracles are those
26:04 things that were supposed to believe
26:06 we're literally supposed to believe in
26:08 fiction to construct some form of
26:11 engaging prowess for our own lives I
26:15 don't think it works like that I asked
26:18 this gentleman the other day who I
26:19 respect greatly but I said what about
26:22 all the other religions before Christ
26:26 that have the exact same virgin birth
26:31 some of them have the exact same stories
26:34 we're at 13 he's talking to all the
26:36 religious authorities of the time and
26:38 he's being tested for all of his
26:40 knowledge and the dude disappears until
26:41 he's 30 and then you know this whole
26:43 thing gets killed for his beliefs or
26:45 claims of who he is and then he ascends
26:47 to the stars or to the Sun what have you
26:50 and the guy said the the cliche the
26:54 massive massive cliche which is well you
26:58 know what I think is that
27:01 those are all put there by Satan to to
27:06 throw us off the path of Jesus Christ
27:10 hmm so it puts them before Christ ever
27:15 existed so that when Christ does exist
27:17 you won't believe in anymore really
27:20 because every single time and the twenty
27:22 seven times before Christ that this
27:24 happened and there's debates of how many
27:27 of stories there are but my last count
27:31 was twenty-seven everyone believed 27
27:35 times so the idea that Satan is putting
27:38 it into the mix to make man deceived so
27:42 they won't believe in Jesus Christ well
27:43 you know if the Satan guy exists who's
27:47 an angel you know there's all kinds of
27:49 problems with that whole theory that
27:50 someone something that's perfect could
27:53 make a mistake then angels aren't
27:54 perfect and whatever all that stuff it
27:58 didn't work because when Jesus came
28:00 around well it's the dominant religion
28:02 that controls what year were on you can
28:05 ask a Muslim what your is it and they
28:07 have to tell you a Christian date in
28:10 history they're going to tell you how
28:12 many years that's been since Jesus died
28:15 isn't that wild you're a Buddhist what
28:17 year is it huh oh it's that many years
28:20 since Jesus died it's like it dominated
28:22 the whole planet okay and I know there's
28:27 I guess some places on earth that use a
28:30 different calendar whatever never seen
28:33 it before I mean I've never seen an
28:34 email come in from start a twenty three
28:37 ninety two point one five mark nine
28:40 mm-hmm you want to earn money with banks
28:45 in Europe you better figure out what
28:46 year it is right but the think about the
28:50 huge insult and I'm not trying to get
28:54 anyone offended or anything or jump on
28:57 that whole bandwagon but it's such a
28:58 gigantic insult from a Christian to
29:01 every other religion on planet Earth
29:03 that says I have created a demon called
29:05 Satan which a lot of religions don't
29:07 have right I've created set or whatever
29:10 it is right
29:12 and my devil of which only exists
29:16 recently in my weird little version of
29:19 fake history major religion which makes
29:23 you in my eyes a disciple of Satan
29:27 because you believed in Ain exact
29:30 replica of my God who in again in many
29:33 cases did everything first like
29:35 thousands of years before Christ like
29:37 4500 BC we have Tomas Ishtar / Queen
29:43 Semiramis and Nimrod that did all the
29:45 same stuff Jesus did right but there's
29:50 local Satan projected into the past Wow
29:54 what about the Native Americans I don't
29:56 have anything like this like I always
29:59 say there is a silly and yours is
30:02 totally true I mean at that level you
30:04 should just go wow I got to meet God
30:06 someday if I believe in God and what am
30:09 I gonna do about this whole thing see
30:12 god I loved you more because I hated
30:13 most the people that ever existed but
30:16 now think about this the reason why I
30:18 mentioned their religious layer to this
30:20 is that it's sort of one of these things
30:23 of our reality is supposedly going back
30:29 to an infinity and then we have this
30:31 problem where we have this Big Bang
30:33 Theory where we have the is theory all
30:37 right something from nothing is pretty
30:38 ludicrous so if you have something from
30:40 something it never ever starts in it
30:42 never ever ends it just is but now let
30:46 me ask you this when's the last time you
30:49 had a really good dream very very
30:52 detailed dream and you worried it for
30:56 one second about how the universe
30:58 started inside your dream now I have
31:01 dreams that are different realities man
31:04 like I go to sleep and I am like like I
31:07 say a million times on jean-luc Picard
31:09 going to this other planet with my whole
31:11 set of family and friends some of them
31:13 from this world sometimes most the time
31:15 not lately it's been my family it's
31:19 really strange but I have to wake up and
31:22 shake off that reality I have to go this
31:24 isn't real like
31:25 or that one I don't really see it's not
31:27 real you just say look I've gotta engage
31:29 in this reality today so get your ass up
31:31 get take a shower and get some work done
31:33 it's interesting but we don't worry
31:37 about the dream world being real but we
31:40 still live it for those of you have very
31:42 vivid dreams I'll think about it
31:46 what do you not get out of a dream that
31:49 you get in this reality I think in this
31:52 reality we have pain and suffering and
31:54 even in our dreams maybe you have a
31:56 nightmare maybe a little spooked out
31:58 every once in a while but overall
32:00 hopefully you're having just normal
32:01 dreams with good dream people and you're
32:04 you're engaging some you know some real
32:08 fleet free-flowing
32:09 reality which is sort of your souls
32:12 world you know I always think it's like
32:14 the day that I die if I can just die in
32:19 my bed and especially if I'm already
32:21 asleep that'd be the best thing right so
32:23 I'm having this massive dream right and
32:25 it's got that dream quality right it
32:27 doesn't have all the instrumentalities
32:29 doesn't have all the senses and then my
32:32 body dies and now my soul goes out right
32:35 100% engagement and now the videogame
32:38 that is my dream all of a sudden goes
32:40 into massive reality right it is like
32:43 you can feel things my arms finally grow
32:46 and I can use my fingers and I learn you
32:49 know maybe the dream people go welcome
32:53 if you can you imagine that you know
32:55 your dream people go they'll just kind
32:56 of look at you funny when you die in the
32:58 real world and you're like what do you
33:01 want to do because you can do anything
33:02 and your relatives show up Elvis shows
33:05 up whatever a good friend of mine I
33:10 won't say his name because I don't want
33:14 him to get pinned down on this later on
33:16 but he sent me a text and he goes man it
33:18 was one that we had that big full moon I
33:20 believe on the 12th of December and he
33:23 lives in a really nice area where he can
33:24 get a really good view of it without a
33:26 lot of light pollution and he's looking
33:27 at the moon and he's sending me a text
33:30 and he's a pretty normal
33:33 believer when it comes especially to
33:36 heliocentric globe
33:38 earth and space and all that kind of
33:40 stuff he's just a very normal guy in
33:42 that sense and he sends me a text he
33:45 goes I'm looking at the moon it's very
33:48 seriously very bright and he goes I'm
33:53 starting to have a hard time believing
33:55 that it's that far away and I thought oh
33:59 wow that's interesting and of course for
34:03 me with knowing all of you I'm thinking
34:07 Flat Earth right off the bat you know
34:08 I'm thinking it Harris up on that thing
34:10 and it's the observatory you know
34:12 there's all kinds of theories about what
34:14 the moon is whether it's a like what is
34:18 the David Icke thinks it's a mothership
34:20 and it's literally has it's got it's
34:22 just literally a Death Star without the
34:24 without the death ray it's got the
34:25 full-blown interior and what have you
34:28 even though Neil Adams will prove to you
34:30 it's a very organic thing but I think
34:33 that what's fascinating about the movie
34:37 The Matrix is that it leaves us with
34:40 several and someone asked me by the way
34:44 to do a whole review of matrix I will do
34:47 that I need to re-watch it I've seen it
34:49 several times but I really need to
34:50 rewatch it to make sure I've got a bunch
34:53 of great things to discuss about it but
34:55 think about it it really showed us this
34:58 amazing vivid virtual reality of world
35:01 that neo started in then it shows us the
35:04 sort of brutal world that he's get
35:07 pulled that it gets pulled out into the
35:09 whole story about us big batteries for
35:12 electronics is phenomenally amazing
35:15 because it reversed the metaphor of us
35:17 using you know acid batteries to give
35:21 our machines power and they'll suddenly
35:24 become the batteries but the other one
35:26 is that the glitch in the matrix when
35:28 the cat walks by twice that's phenomenal
35:32 the idea that people in the virtual
35:35 world could be taken over by what is it
35:38 the was it mr. Smith or whatever it is I
35:41 think for me as well
35:43 you know the
35:46 what's really difficult for me
35:49 personally to accept sometimes I'm sure
35:52 it's hits a lot of you is because you
35:58 grew up with your intelligence and your
36:00 ability to discern facts it to the best
36:04 of your ability and doesn't mean were
36:05 none of us are 100% correct with trying
36:08 to figure out what's true and what's
36:09 false oh it's a maybe or whatever but
36:13 when you look at the world and you see
36:15 the billions of sheep on this planet
36:19 billions of people that do not
36:22 understand they're like you can see
36:25 their virtual reality when you look at
36:28 China you can see their virtual reality
36:30 of communism and it's funny because I
36:32 grew up with that in my mind for Russia
36:35 without any internet to see what Russia
36:38 was really like
36:39 so the lies piled up and piled up and
36:42 now with Russia pulling out of communism
36:45 going full capitalism and then dealing
36:48 with you know car wrecks that are insane
36:51 because they just recently really got
36:54 into everyone having one but they don't
36:57 grow up with the genetic code to drive
36:58 one it's interesting but when you see
37:02 this you kind of wonder it like how is
37:05 this world so upside down from our
37:08 perspective it's so easy to find out
37:11 what is good and what is bad and so why
37:14 is it so easy for something to be stolen
37:19 you know I was someone was telling me
37:21 they'd lost their wallet the other day
37:22 and it got stolen and so that's where I
37:29 always come up with my my take which is
37:32 isn't it fascinating that in almost
37:34 almost every single case I have no idea
37:36 what the odds are but it seems like more
37:39 than nine out of ten it almost seems
37:40 like 99 out of 100 when you leave your
37:43 phone behind when you leave your wallet
37:46 behind something that's very universal
37:48 meaning everybody could use it if you
37:50 leave your glasses behind in their
37:51 prescription someone's gonna go oh this
37:53 is great oh god I'm about to puke and
37:55 they lay them back down or give them in
37:57 this lost and found all sudden they grow
37:59 some
38:00 some morals isn't it fascinating that
38:03 almost everyone's a thief my buddy was
38:07 like yeah everyone's justice closet
38:09 klepto their closet jerk-offs that
38:12 steals everyone's a [ __ ] I think as
38:14 what he said and it's it's like I hate
38:17 to have him take that tack because it's
38:20 it's a sad way to look at the world I
38:24 mean again if you are dictating at all
38:26 this reality then that's the reality
38:29 you're dictating for yourself and that's
38:31 the frequency you were going to which is
38:33 I am a good person living in a world of
38:35 douchebags yeah me believing that I live
38:38 in a world of sheep maybe that's not a
38:41 good way to view things and there's an
38:43 interesting thing about reality
38:45 depending on your childhood because you
38:49 know if I told you look when I was a kid
38:52 you know not everything went right my
38:54 parents got divorced and you know I had
38:57 some [ __ ] friends you know they were
38:59 always wanting to fight all the time and
39:01 you know so I've been through my
39:02 standard-issue [ __ ] as a kid and you
39:06 know plenty of inner-city kids had
39:08 worlds you know there were a thousand
39:10 times more acidic than mine but I had
39:13 like the standard American apple pie
39:16 sort of journey in my opinion I traveled
39:19 wait I've been to ten different homes
39:21 before I graduated high school and I've
39:23 been to 15 different homes since I've
39:25 been to California so 25 different
39:27 locations that's a lot of moving but I
39:31 came to California a super idealistic
39:33 kid now once you just think about this
39:35 in a sense of reality I'm not just
39:36 trying to tell you my history here my
39:38 reality was that I was coming to a place
39:41 that I was in love with and it was just
39:45 falling a pill I mean I worked my ass
39:47 off and I was smart but and I was a good
39:51 good person I didn't you know backstab
39:53 anyone didn't steal for anyone or
39:55 anything like that so I had just this
39:58 blissful life up until I had chosen
40:04 personally to follow a girlfriend to
40:07 Silicon Valley I was leaving the area
40:09 that I loved to go to an area that I
40:10 didn't know and I didn't want to live
40:12 and I think in my thought process I
40:15 thought well we'll just do this for a
40:16 little while and then we'll come back
40:17 down south nope didn't come down for 12
40:21 years now it was very difficult for me
40:24 to find things in the bay area that I
40:25 liked so I found Apple I got a chance to
40:28 work with some legends and got back into
40:30 the game business full-time having
40:32 started down here in Southern California
40:34 but in my perception once I bought into
40:40 the acidity of the world which I've now
40:44 sold all that [ __ ] getting back in the
40:47 total positive realm of the planet you
40:50 know 9/11 happens eventually and it's
40:52 just like we can't be happy anymore in
40:55 the world it's all terrorism it's all
40:58 blah blah blah it's just all sticky and
41:01 gross and we're looking over our
41:03 shoulders and going through an airport
41:05 now is like my version of the Fourth
41:10 Reich you know controlling human beings
41:12 I can't drive down the street sometimes
41:14 without seeing a you know drunk driving
41:16 stop where it's taking 99.9% of the
41:20 people that don't have any alcohol in
41:22 their system having to stop and show
41:24 their papers you know I don't support
41:27 that at all so I found myself almost
41:31 dialing into a universe maybe through
41:33 the through the law of attraction that
41:35 seemed to mold around my perception of
41:38 reality that opportunities seemed to
41:41 change and then once I started my game
41:44 company it all went back the other way
41:48 but still as I started to wake up in oh
41:52 five and then really get into the
41:54 economics of waking up by oh seven oh
41:56 eight I think my mind this is what I
41:59 just suspect if I'm having any control
42:01 over reality it's creating the 2008
42:05 crash because I got all into this super
42:08 negativity and then what happens it
42:11 manifests into this crescendo moment
42:13 where I'm going to crush the economy the
42:16 world says and you're gonna pay for it
42:18 eventually it's weird
42:22 here's what I have not experienced
42:26 my life is fantastic and it stays
42:29 fantastic but the rest of the world is
42:32 in super hardship that has never
42:36 happened to me if the world goes down
42:38 the tubes and you know for me it's
42:40 really United States of America but you
42:42 know this these recessions have been
42:43 global so I'll just say the world for
42:45 this last 20 years but when that stuff
42:47 happens I get sucked into it I'm not
42:50 high enough in the food chain in my own
42:52 mind to stay out of that [ __ ] always
42:55 been a victim of it but was interesting
42:58 when I was a kid you know there was
43:00 living in the Midwest in a tiny town
43:04 there's not a lot of jobs for people
43:06 plenty jobs for me as a teenager but
43:09 Emer my dad struggling to find the you
43:12 know the proper job with the proper pay
43:14 just because you have very few choices
43:16 in a town with 10,000 people you can
43:19 work in that one thing over there one
43:20 thing over this some of this takes trade
43:22 skills that you may not have and we can
43:23 find someone for cheaper with a bunch of
43:27 trade skills instead of you so I'm not
43:29 going to train you because we can get
43:30 someone else so there were times when we
43:32 were broke as [ __ ]
43:33 I mean unbelievably broke but because I
43:37 you know I had what I needed
43:40 especially I had you know a loving
43:41 family and a bunch of good friends yeah
43:44 I didn't pay attention to it
43:46 I don't think I suffered for it at all I
43:49 think it actually made me more lucid to
43:52 the world and when it came time for me
43:54 to do it by myself
43:56 hey if I was broke I knew how to be
43:58 happy when I was broke when I had money
44:00 I really didn't know how to save it and
44:02 I ended up spending a lot of it it's
44:04 been on some good stuff but still you
44:07 know there was a lot I needed to learn
44:08 about that whole thing but think about
44:11 the dinosaur thing you know the more I
44:15 look at it the more I can't accept it
44:17 and part of it has to do with the sheer
44:20 physics of these beings you know
44:22 brontosaurus how it being so utterly
44:24 massive it would have to eat through the
44:26 tiniest head aperture as they've faked
44:29 its design I don't know if the mouth is
44:31 big enough and chews enough to store
44:36 food
44:36 to be alive the tren asaurus rex whose
44:40 physics is completely ridiculous I don't
44:45 believe it the pterodactyl I don't think
44:47 you could fly I don't I just took a bat
44:51 and slimmed it down you know so we have
44:57 these things that are virtual in our
45:01 world today we have organized religion
45:04 which is very virtual you know and let's
45:07 say you're a Christian you're like out
45:08 man my dudes real everyone else's is
45:10 fake ok great so to my point you've
45:13 proved it you believe everyone else's
45:15 fairytales of their gods and their
45:18 miracles and all that others folktale
45:20 stuff is a hundred percent fake and it
45:22 just feels 100% fake immediately but
45:26 yours which is more profoundly
45:29 outrageous than any of the ones that
45:32 came before it's real isn't that strange
45:37 so you know no matter what religion you
45:41 choose to believe there are hundreds of
45:44 religions that came before the one that
45:46 you picked that you don't believe in
45:48 that you think hahaha look how stupid
45:50 those people are believing that raw
45:54 walked the earth with a Hawks head and
45:56 those Native Americans who think that
45:58 your soul turns into a star and those
46:00 Buddhists will God what do they do
46:03 they're all stupid you're brilliant
46:07 maybe maybe that's some brain [ __ ]
46:12 that will keep us from really ascending
46:14 to the next level just saying I got a
46:18 buddy who says that all the time just
46:19 saying I'm just saying it's so funny so
46:23 we're at this university we've parsed a
46:26 little bit of this we've talked about
46:27 our own personal perceptions of history
46:29 and maybe picked out some doozies
46:33 dinosaurs and religion pretty good and
46:36 then we go okay what would we hope to
46:40 find in our experiment of reality
46:43 because the idea would be to prove that
46:47 history happened the way that it
46:49 happened
46:50 so what do we do in this world we
46:54 overlap generations someone was at
46:57 Dallas Texas in 63 when was a November
47:02 26 or something like that
47:03 when Kennedy is assassinated people saw
47:06 that happen live who lived who weren't
47:09 killed by the intelligence agencies who
47:11 participated in the whole thing and so
47:13 they go into the kitchen they go to I
47:16 don't know
47:17 billiard clubs or whatever else collages
47:20 or they go to this Tupperware parties or
47:23 whatever and they say oh my god I saw it
47:25 I saw his head blow up and so their
47:30 memory track is transposed onto your
47:33 memory track and so we have this organic
47:37 sort of memory check of human
47:40 consciousness well now let me throw a
47:43 little wild card in here I used to talk
47:46 about this a lot in season one and two
47:48 and it's called the hundred monkey
47:51 experiment or the ten monkey experiment
47:53 it's actually done with a hundred and
47:55 they took all these monkeys and they're
47:58 in this environment and they have ma
48:01 labeled and they know who's who and
48:03 where they hang out and they took a
48:06 monkey out of that bunch and they
48:07 brought it into this room caged and
48:11 created a little machine that if it
48:13 tapped and pulled on something a little
48:15 pellet would come out but they had to do
48:16 it in a particular method and they
48:20 couldn't leave until they did and the
48:22 story goes is that the first one took
48:23 two weeks and then they put that one
48:25 back in the bunch after it figured out
48:27 how to do it then they observe very
48:31 meticulously which monkeys that monkey
48:34 gets in contact with and what he does
48:35 when he gets in contact with the monkeys
48:38 and they pick out one that never walked
48:41 to his side of the room put him in the
48:43 cage I don't know what the interval was
48:45 when they did the second one they could
48:47 give it some time but then the second
48:49 one does it around half the time then
48:52 they put it back in they run the
48:53 experiment again pull out one that the
48:55 first two didn't have any contact with
48:57 and now it does it in just a few days
49:00 and then it got to the point where no
49:03 matter which monkey you pulled in there
49:04 they all did it instantaneously proving
49:09 not the method but proving that we
49:12 transmit knowledge to each other about
49:15 speaking just keep that in your mind
49:20 that has been done but from what I
49:22 understand multiple times I've had
49:24 someone totally schooled me on that
49:27 experiments who I'd never thought would
49:28 believe in anything like that and I
49:30 thought wow that's cool you actually
49:32 just told me all about it and you added
49:34 all the details but now I take the
49:37 memory track concept what if in having
49:44 physical proximity to another human
49:47 being without knowing them if you know
49:49 them it's even better and let's say that
49:52 you're like me and I never asked my
49:53 grandmother all the questions I wanted
49:56 to ask her or my grandmother or whatever
49:58 but you spent thousands of hours in his
50:02 or her presence you may actually have
50:05 one their immediate trade skills but you
50:09 might have their beliefs because you
50:11 have their rationales for why they
50:13 believe in things but you also might
50:15 have all of the memory tracks memory
50:19 track data they have in some reserved
50:22 not easily accessible area of your mind
50:27 and who knows if it goes all back to the
50:30 soul obviously the universe would know
50:32 everything that's one of the big key
50:36 premises of altered states the movie
50:38 which everybody needs to see so if that
50:42 were the case in any way shape or form
50:44 let's say you had the database let's say
50:48 hit three database tables similar design
50:51 your first database table is your
50:54 immediate what happened today what's
50:56 happening last five minutes your
50:57 short-term memory database then you have
51:00 your long-term memory database very
51:03 easily accessible but it has pretty much
51:05 everything that you've ever done in your
51:07 lifetime - the fact that perhaps
51:11 when you were really young and psychic
51:13 as a child you didn't write into the
51:16 database the same way as when you became
51:18 sentient there's got to be a reason why
51:20 when I was seven
51:21 the light switch just turned on and
51:23 every day was memorable it's strange and
51:26 then why do I have these couple memories
51:29 were I was at my daycare center that's
51:32 why I remember three and four really
51:33 well one I didn't want to be at the
51:36 daycare center when they had all the
51:38 stupid kid stuff and then to someone
51:41 pinning me down about my favorite color
51:42 I was I remember being on a swing set
51:45 thinking I always thought about my age I
51:46 was the weird thing - I was on the swing
51:48 set and they were like well what's your
51:50 favorite color and I was just like yeah
51:52 purple you know and there's only because
51:55 someone had recently taught me that red
51:57 and blue mix together makes purple I
51:59 thought that was cool that's it's not
52:00 because of prints or anything but your
52:03 third database could be the one that is
52:06 written that is in like in some super
52:09 reserved system that is your elders
52:14 could perhaps the universe itself writes
52:16 it in there perhaps you're born with
52:18 Annies preexisting memory check perhaps
52:20 that one's more the sole database and
52:23 the other two are the mind database the
52:25 brain working with the consciousness /
52:27 the soul to create some sort of track
52:30 that you need to live it gotta learn how
52:33 to do things right pull up your pants
52:36 brush your air brush your teeth now why
52:41 talk about three different databases
52:43 with different levels of access
52:45 obviously that third one is at best an
52:49 instinctual reference database you throw
52:52 the query in there for a name you do
52:53 programming you brought a query query
52:56 you put it in your first two databases
52:57 boom you get it back pretty good except
53:00 the mundane gets erased right what'd you
53:01 have for lunch I don't know chick-fil-a
53:04 the third database gets the same query
53:08 but what it returns back is not vivid
53:11 necessarily previous memories what you
53:14 get back is a set of symbols some sort
53:18 of instinctual that sounds like a bad
53:22 idea
53:22 well you should do that that sounds
53:25 remember when Freud broke the mind down
53:30 into the ego the character in the
53:32 persona now again lots people say that
53:36 today that's been hugely deprecated I
53:38 don't think it should be the ego is the
53:41 one that's the big question but there
53:43 definitely is the character in the
53:45 persona small refresher course the
53:48 personas who you pretend to be to your
53:50 friends and people you don't really know
53:52 that well your character is who you
53:54 really are
53:54 regardless of what you put on to the
53:56 outside world it has your frailties your
53:59 strengths whatever you really are is
54:01 your character now the ego was this idea
54:03 that you have some internal you know
54:07 consciousness that is your sort of your
54:10 primal instincts wolf you know they
54:14 always talk about as your a fear fearful
54:16 self which i think is a horrible way of
54:19 describing that because that means
54:20 everyone's afraid in the inside now we
54:24 just have self-preservation algorithms
54:26 that are very binary it's either this
54:30 way or that way there's no other way you
54:31 want to get out of the way of a lion
54:33 coming at you your internals your
54:36 super-super internal turns on wipes the
54:39 character in the persona because who
54:40 gives a [ __ ]
54:41 and it's run run run or grab something
54:44 sharp and hope for the best right but
54:47 here's what's brilliant about what he
54:50 did he took the intangible mind and he
54:55 made it tangible through paradigm
54:58 he gave us some references well I think
55:02 before Freud everyone knew about people
55:06 pretending to be certain people and
55:08 really being something different that's
55:10 something you kind of just all figure
55:12 out as you get old you could never have
55:13 studied Freud you'll figure out those
55:14 two things but isn't it interesting that
55:18 if we were just to overlay what I just
55:21 gave you you have short term as your
55:24 persona your long term is your character
55:27 and your intangible database is your ego
55:30 the ego is just as intangible in Freud's
55:32 world as what I just gave you in this
55:36 reality debate store
55:38 now let me throw this at you if we were
55:42 to accept the fact that perhaps some of
55:44 this is a matrix maybe we do truly exist
55:49 for as many years as we think but we
55:50 don't exactly know the start date the
55:53 start date is said to go back depending
55:56 on what philosophy you're looking at
55:58 hundreds of thousands years millions of
56:01 years or just 4,500 years back okay it's
56:06 a paradigm you figure out what you want
56:07 you're here now I think I'm here now I
56:10 think you're here and so we got to work
56:13 with what's in the now but what if you
56:16 know somebody came up to you that you
56:20 would believe or you have a dream where
56:22 you get this information maybe you take
56:27 an acid trip and get the information who
56:29 knows and they lay on you this idea they
56:32 go well but maybe let's just say it's a
56:34 dream person because dream people don't
56:36 really engage you that much like reality
56:38 right because they don't in my world I
56:40 mean they do and they don't write you
56:42 don't you don't sit down have a
56:43 conversation like this in your dream at
56:45 least I have never had a deep
56:46 conversation in my dream but I have had
56:49 dream people say some pretty weird crap
56:50 sometimes but what if you're in your
56:53 dream and they say to you look you
56:55 you're thinking about waking up aren't
56:57 you
56:58 you know I guess I am and they say I'm
57:03 you know your world is just as malleable
57:06 as this one you're like what are you
57:08 talking about and they say well you
57:11 think your name is this you think your
57:14 gender is that you think your job is
57:15 this you think you can do this and you
57:18 can't do that and you know what the
57:21 secret is you're not really that person
57:24 at all you're just accepting the fact
57:26 that you're that person you've chosen a
57:30 virtual reality configuration as your
57:33 reality you've accepted the paradigms of
57:36 all the restrictions because well you
57:39 guys kind of tell each other that that's
57:40 what you can and can't do it's always
57:43 that thing you're five foot one you want
57:46 to be six foot one
57:47 just make yourself six foot one just
57:50 wake up
57:52 say I'm gonna wake up into a six-foot
57:54 one version of myself you are a male but
57:58 you feel like you're a female well just
58:00 wake up a female make your body however
58:02 you want you're in total control of that
58:04 reality just like you're in control of
58:06 this one if you ever realized the fact
58:08 that they both look photo-real well this
58:12 one's fake then how do you have all this
58:13 rendering capability how do you have all
58:15 this 3d modeling capability how are you
58:17 casting light perfectly in this room if
58:19 this is it's fake and that one's real
58:21 they both look the same this one's a lot
58:25 better because you can do a lot more
58:26 cool stuff you know spaceships and
58:28 aliens and we can have fun with this one
58:29 it's like a video game this is where you
58:31 actually are who you are as who you are
58:34 in your dreams but in reality yeah they
58:40 create a 911 or you allow them to or you
58:43 let your life get really negative to the
58:44 point you manifest your own crescendo of
58:47 some bad event and then you feed into it
58:51 but you don't have to those of us who
58:55 grew up in the 70s and 80s at least
58:57 those of you go back even further you
58:59 have a more profound version of this
59:00 truth I'm about to say when you get into
59:04 the 90s let's say this is a day I die it
59:08 was a negative [ __ ] decade man it was
59:11 negative
59:12 grungy ass music and the music is good
59:15 okay but it's all at the expense of
59:17 dressing nice you know gangster rap oh
59:22 my god I mean this was like kill people
59:25 do as much drugs as you possibly can and
59:29 repeat and every version of music was
59:33 was doing this if you had a positive
59:34 classic rap you were out of the game if
59:37 you had anything positive and rock and
59:39 roll you're out of the game look at Guns
59:41 and Roses Guns and Roses which is an
59:44 amazing band my god listen to welcome to
59:47 the jungle I mean think about it man
59:49 that was the whole thing about coming to
59:50 Los Angeles and how this thing will eat
59:52 your soul if you don't pay attention so
59:56 what ends up happening 10 years later
59:58 11 years later after all this negativity
60:00 starts just splattering all over the
60:03 world as a trend we get the amalgamation
60:07 moment of all that negativity you know
60:11 again man had to get really hard that
60:15 was the big thing you couldn't be nice
60:16 anymore again if you want an example of
60:19 this like I always say go back and watch
60:22 Soul Train but you watch these people
60:26 dance do disco go watch all those old
60:29 movies
60:30 he'll just watch movies in the 80s look
60:32 how silly we were and now all the sudden
60:36 like that again you're a [ __ ] you know
60:38 whatever that's an example of us
60:41 controlling our reality to infect
60:43 everyone in the world with this
60:46 weirdness you know and now since we've
60:49 been at war for I don't know 18 years
60:53 until a drunk kind of shut it all down
60:55 for us it's gonna take us another decade
60:59 to get out of it you know and they're
61:01 the one saving grace that I can't even
61:04 believe this occurred other than
61:06 soldiers were still very scarred from it
61:09 was when we ended Vietnam by 1975 we
61:14 were so ready to be out of that
61:15 negativity that Hollywood blew up and
61:18 gave us just the most idealistic visions
61:21 of the world you know ETS in that
61:24 community poltergeist is in their
61:26 community you know just all these new
61:29 Star Wars Star Trek do all these things
61:32 and have this fun time enjoying it and
61:35 even the later part of the 80s you still
61:37 have amazing movies die our Total Recall
61:40 I guess Terminator was 85 it was just
61:46 tons of good stuff we craft our reality
61:49 no matter what but how old is this one
61:54 there's probably two answers there's the
61:58 answer that we don't really know which
62:00 is the incarnation of man as we perceive
62:04 ourselves to be and then there's the
62:07 answer we probably know which is
62:09 everything else that really makes this
62:11 place occur right the universe as we
62:13 like to say even if we're in a little
62:15 bubble that's our universe
62:17 there's another bubble with another
62:18 universe it still considered the whole
62:21 mechanism of the whole thing that's
62:24 probably infinitely old it's a really
62:28 strange thing for a man meaning mankind
62:32 to think about something that is
62:35 infinite right we've talked about it
62:37 several times on the show but now just
62:41 you know give yourself some thought over
62:43 the next I don't know month or so and
62:46 you know it's like when you're
62:47 contemplating Flat Earth for instance
62:49 and you're brand-new to the theory and
62:51 you know you're you know you're totally
62:54 heliocentric you were you were raised by
62:56 NASA and science classes and books and
62:58 you're really skilled in that knowledge
63:00 but for a second you just kind of think
63:02 about the world being flat you think
63:05 about maybe this place isn't spinning
63:06 and maybe that moon is only 3,200 miles
63:08 up and the Sun is only 32 and all you
63:11 give it a chance in your brain for a
63:12 split second and as long as you're not I
63:15 think all I could say as long as you're
63:17 mentally balanced you can have that
63:19 experience and come back to your theory
63:21 of round earth or whatever globe earth
63:23 and you enjoyed it you enjoyed the
63:26 little possibility that it could have
63:28 been flat well do that for the notion
63:32 that maybe this is sort of a dark City
63:36 except we have light we have a daytime
63:38 in a nighttime but then when we go to
63:40 sleep it's a little bit different the
63:43 interesting thing about dark City on a
63:46 technical level and this is no criticism
63:49 of the movie whatsoever or I think it
63:51 was a book before that would be not
63:54 everyone goes to sleep in a society at
63:57 the same time there's always someone
63:59 who's suffering from some sort of
64:02 insomnia someone who works a late shift
64:05 someone who prefers to work at night and
64:06 so that little game that they were
64:08 playing in the movie would have to rely
64:12 on the fact that everyone has been put
64:15 to sleep at a particular time because I
64:18 think in one of the scenarios there's
64:20 still a car yeah that's what happened
64:22 that's right that's right because the
64:24 cars were still moving downtown and and
64:25 it just everybody went and the cars
64:28 would slow down not hit each other
64:30 I was going to sleep the other day and
64:33 I'm laying on my pillow
64:35 and it's one of those situations where
64:38 you have your eyes closed but you're
64:39 still seeing some sort of reality and
64:43 it's now way bigger than the world that
64:44 you're in it's sort of the ceiling
64:46 doesn't exist and for the very first
64:49 time I'm looking up and I see sort of
64:53 this fractal tree you know like you see
64:56 those 3d fractals so they fly around
64:58 them and they're kind of like wild
64:59 organic you know black and white stripes
65:02 or whatever it is right this didn't
65:04 really have much of a color but it felt
65:06 like four prongs coming down too towards
65:10 the top of my or gets the top over my
65:13 eye sockets and then two below my eye
65:14 sockets on my cheekbones and I all I
65:17 could feel was this programming feeling
65:21 right it was like here's your updates
65:23 and just hold still
65:25 while this update comes down on you and
65:27 I just sat there and I was like it was
65:29 kind of soothing but it also felt like a
65:31 physical pressure on my face even though
65:33 my face had nothing touching it and so I
65:36 thought you know that's been one of my
65:38 thought processes with reality if I were
65:41 to design this reality you would be
65:43 uploading different programs to various
65:46 people because they're in a particular
65:47 position to engage certain opportunities
65:52 you have a certain level of knowledge
65:54 you wouldn't want again anyone to be in
65:57 a stagnant circle unless they're serving
65:59 a purpose with that stagnant circle and
66:02 that happens right you're a good parent
66:04 to your kids well you might be in a bit
66:05 of a static circle when you're raising
66:07 your children because that's just what
66:09 you're supposed to do maybe you have a
66:11 family business of you're self-employed
66:13 you just love it you know it's just you
66:15 go in that circle but every day has the
66:17 nuances that you pay attention to that
66:19 makes anything but trivial for your life
66:21 you know the kids grow up that's the
66:23 beautiful thing it's the difference
66:25 between pets and kids these people who
66:27 replace their kids with pets man are you
66:30 losing out and I love pets trust me I
66:33 love pets but have both of them right
66:35 because your your pets kind of gets a
66:38 little smarter over time right then get
66:40 there definitely loving is crazy
66:41 hopefully but your kid
66:44 my god they'll take you on the biggest
66:46 rollercoaster ride of your life you
66:48 laugh you'll cry you'll but they get
66:51 better right they draw scribbles on the
66:54 piece of paper oh that's you mommy
66:55 then later on it's potato head with four
66:58 little legs off of it that's you daddy
67:00 and then eventually started drawing
67:02 bodies and cars and they start doing
67:04 really cool things and then they start
67:05 having these deep thought conversations
67:07 with you and man you know just seeing
67:09 your own DNA talk to you really smart
67:11 it's it's probably one of the most
67:14 amazing things you can experience I be
67:17 interested in your thoughts man you know
67:19 what you ever well I'll put it this way
67:23 I know a lot of you question reality as
67:26 is just because you're curious and you
67:29 know what I want to do is make sure that
67:31 you folks don't yeah like I don't know
67:35 that you don't get scared or mad at
67:39 other concepts of reality within
67:41 yourself forget what anyone else thinks
67:43 but just have fun like experiment you
67:47 know when people I read these articles
67:48 were some scientists against as well I
67:50 might think we could totally be in a
67:52 computer memory bank because we have you
67:56 know there's there's signs of binary
67:58 zeros and ones everywhere and it's like
68:00 okay all right yeah I totally respect
68:02 that that's great once you can start
68:05 bringing that into a physical model that
68:06 we can really start to use as a
68:08 potential medium to change the universe
68:11 right it's I always go back to that the
68:15 movie Time Bandits where you have a
68:17 perception of reality it's locked
68:19 but these bandits have the the map they
68:21 stole from God which shows them these
68:24 doors where it's sort of the backdoor in
68:26 the software that allows you to jump
68:28 from the 20th century back to the 18th
68:30 century you know to steal things from
68:31 Napoleon and then jump back to the 24th
68:34 century to still a spaceship you know I
68:36 think that's great it sort of breaks
68:39 your mind open to kind of go wow you
68:42 know how much do we subscribe to
68:45 paradigm restrictions in this reality I
68:49 don't think any of us can count that
68:52 high you know and just to put another
68:55 fine point on that
68:57 you've heard me assert this in different
69:00 episodes for different contexts but in
69:02 this particular context we all know
69:05 people that believe that they're never
69:08 gonna succeed people that they're never
69:10 gonna get the person of their dreams and
69:12 never gonna this never going to that and
69:14 the weird thing is they don't but you
69:19 live in a very similar world I mean for
69:22 some of you that got to grow up in the
69:23 same school in the same town your whole
69:26 life god bless you you will have a
69:30 classmate that it's the same gender as
69:34 you the same height as you the same
69:35 athletic build that you have went to all
69:37 the same classes seem to do pretty good
69:40 in school maybe even got slightly better
69:41 grades but they have this negative Nancy
69:45 this debbie downer thing about them and
69:48 you who maybe even struggled more maybe
69:51 that's why you're more intelligent who
69:52 knows but you go off and get all of your
69:55 dreams simply because in your mind you
69:56 were like I'm gonna get these dreams
69:58 this is just what I'm going to do with
70:00 my life there is no other choice but
70:02 your friends over there going I can't go
70:05 oh my god I got this and that all these
70:07 excuses mm-hmm
70:10 how much of the world do we control I
70:12 mean even outside of a matrix computer
70:15 bla bla bla just our attitudes towards
70:18 life changes everything I know this is
70:20 supposed to be an episode about how all
70:22 the reality is but I just have a really
70:26 bizarre view when I look back at the
70:30 hearsay history that I'm supposed to
70:33 believe about every region of the world
70:36 who was the boss who was not the boss
70:39 who was a slave of who you know all
70:42 these stories the fact that the oh my
70:45 god the fact that we have these
70:46 completely made-up characters that
70:51 science tries to proof it just blows my
70:55 mind you know the big flood of Noah come
70:58 on people come on you know in one sense
71:01 you have the Ice Age that's supposed to
71:03 take responsibility for all this and
71:05 then you have you know Noah and they say
71:09 well there definitely was a flood of
71:10 because we can see it in the you know
71:12 maybe maybe what you think is water
71:15 damage is not water damage at all but
71:17 maybe it is who cares maybe that region
71:19 got flooded out and so you know there's
71:22 a bunch of storms there's a there's a
71:24 fill there's a few ill Nino years in a
71:26 row and so you find massive flooding in
71:29 Egypt and some massive flooding in
71:31 England maybe some massive flooding in
71:32 the plains of North America and you're
71:34 like oh my god it's so conclusive the
71:36 whole world must have flooded
71:38 overlooking all of the other theories
71:41 that could make that kind of thing
71:42 happen and so I'm not sure because I was
71:48 gonna do an episode that was sort of
71:50 like this one but it I think this one's
71:53 better which was essentially how far
71:55 back could we go with standard history
71:59 where it just starts to become [ __ ]
72:02 you know we simply can't rely on
72:04 anything past a particular year and my
72:09 sort of studying history and knowing
72:14 some of my friends that supposedly have
72:15 their family trees back to the 1500s
72:18 it's around that time for me the 1500s
72:22 now we know supposedly okay I should say
72:27 no and flying quotes that you know Rome
72:29 existed way before 1500s and we have
72:32 these these coliseums and these giant
72:36 parthenons increase and we have pyramids
72:40 and then we have the rebuilt stonehenge
72:44 in 54 with rocks that are obviously much
72:48 older than 1954 but when you see
72:52 stonehenge rebuilt in 54 and then they
72:54 tell you to this day that's exactly
72:56 where it was found when it's not where
72:59 it was found there's a hundred ten
73:01 photographs of them building the thing
73:02 with everyone there watching the public
73:04 was invited to see it see it be built
73:07 and then to have that cast in this
73:09 timeframe as really being there I mean
73:13 it was down the street and it was down
73:14 the street it was all collapsed for the
73:16 most part there's like one t-joint thing
73:18 going on doesn't that just shake up your
73:21 entire world
73:23 vids you could go to any university and
73:27 go into a history professor I mean any
73:30 viewer still in school do this this is
73:32 hilarious get the video on YouTube just
73:35 look up you know
73:36 Stonehenge hoax 1954 there's a great one
73:42 up there with this Navajo music it's
73:45 just as beautiful just beating drum
73:47 thing and they show you the 110
73:49 photographs this is beautifully collage
73:51 together it doesn't need to be any
73:52 better than that video because to get
73:54 that on your phone maybe even screen
73:56 capture a little bit of it if you really
73:57 want to get fancy with it print a few of
73:59 those pictures out with all those people
74:02 standing around and then go ask your
74:05 history professor when was Stonehenge
74:08 built
74:09 maybe do it in front of the class I'm
74:11 gonna be awesome besides just you know
74:13 for a second here can I get your
74:15 attention I wanna have your permission I
74:16 want to piss you off and ask you this
74:19 question when do you think Stonehenge
74:21 was built he's gonna say 5,000 years ago
74:24 he's gonna say it was built by druids
74:26 and all this [ __ ] [ __ ] right and
74:29 then you can just bring up that picture
74:32 bring up your iPad whatever benefits a
74:35 picture because you could pass him
74:36 around right and say well I have a
74:39 hundred ten photographs that prove that
74:42 this was restored from a previous
74:44 location in 1954 on a completely new
74:48 plot of land that did have a ring in the
74:50 ground from some previous thing but no
74:52 stones but the one you visit in England
74:55 right now was reconstruct in 1954
74:58 so history teacher having proven this in
75:03 the room right now with photographs how
75:06 am I supposed to trust anything else in
75:09 history then you study graham hancock
75:12 and you read ate the pyramids back way
75:16 back and it just starts blowing up in
75:19 your brain anyway let me know what you
75:21 think if you have new to deep thoughts

75:40 or at the number 4 for 3 but with
75:43 special reports and other ancillary
75:45 episodes I think we're way up around 470
75:48 but there's two links for the video
75:50 Brian just updated and they put us at a
75:54 level fifty which allows us to have 50
75:56 video so I'm currently uploading at
75:59 least 50 videos and we'll see if we
76:00 can't earn the other 400 or whatever the
76:02 hell we need to get that going we'll see
76:05 but [ __ ] shoot is fantastic get
76:08 yourself a bit shoot account its Bitcoin
76:10 based and so if you want to tip somebody

76:45 donate to the show there's PayPal and
76:47 there's patreon if you do a patreon
76:49 account what you get for that is you get
76:52 the episodes a second I'm uploading them

76:56 get three or four days access to the
76:58 episodes before anyone else sees them in
76:59 case that turns you on there's a couple
77:01 products I promotes brave browser and

77:33 shows that accidentally deleted I put
77:38 out two new shirts for season five I
77:41 will continue to put out other shirts I
77:42 did take down the believe it was a

78:03 fully branded for deep thoughts without
78:06 a UFO on it at least if it has a UFO
78:08 won't be the main focus of it so go
78:11 check that out if you get on patreon
78:13 there's a 20% discount coupon on there
78:15 again the goal of raising the money is
78:18 just to be able to do the show more
78:19 full-time and to do the research that it
78:21 takes Plus believe it or not some guests
78:24 want money to appear on the show and you
78:26 might hate him for that but time is
78:28 money and I fully respect that so
78:29 there's some people are not even talking
78:32 to because I know they're gonna want a
78:33 little cash out so it might facilitate
78:35 that as well
78:36 so for those of you do contribute thank
78:38 you so much you're paying for the sticks
78:39 you're paying for all my labor so I
78:41 appreciate it

78:45 one you will not find season one
78:47 episodes on this channel that are at
78:48 least active in the feed so go to the
78:50 website everything's up there it looks
78:53 like we're cool with YouTube I don't
78:55 think YouTube took that a single channel
78:57 on the 10th so I think that was all
79:00 hyped up but you know it's good to be
79:04 cautious I guess in certain senses we
79:06 can talk about whatever we want because
79:07 we don't go down those rabbit holes that
79:09 are super dark at least not that often
79:12 Benny Wayne thank you for joining the
