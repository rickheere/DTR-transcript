00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:36 deep thoughts on this surprisingly sunny
00:41 fairly warm day for a lot of you in the
00:45 Midwest stuck in snowstorms well it's
00:49 definitely a summer day for you guys
00:51 it's probably about 70 71 and the breeze
00:55 is about 68 today we're gonna cover sort
01:00 of the back side of the coin that is
01:03 about well it's in the subject
01:07 wheelhouse of afterlife but it's about
01:11 those who believe that when you die
01:14 that's it and you know when you have a
01:17 frequency of truth and and false I keep
01:20 telling you guys this all the time a
01:21 truth feeling if you're really in tune
01:23 with a universe you'll notice that
01:26 everything that it turns out to be true
01:27 in your life that predicts the future
01:29 because it's based on facts that work
01:33 you get a cool sensation in your heart
01:36 like a really congruent beautiful like
01:38 ah this is the truth and then everything
01:42 else has less up to the point of a
01:47 complete bold-faced lie that destroys
01:49 your life hurts you and then you have
01:52 this acidic thing right and contrary to
01:55 the mechanism that most people
01:57 understand it's not someone wanting
02:01 something to come true but they know
02:02 it's not going to come true and that's
02:03 why they have the negative feeling it is
02:06 you're letting it flow through you as a
02:08 fully open mind meaning you're not
02:10 grasping the the thought with any of
02:15 your tentacles of bias you're just
02:16 letting it go right three is the rule
02:18 flat and runs around mm-hm
02:19 it's going through you have this emotion
02:22 right you know anyway any one of us
02:26 could be full of [ __ ] with that but with
02:29 the afterlife being non-existent it's
02:34 interesting when I hear something that
02:35 profoundly does not work with my belief
02:39 system it's very exciting for me to hear
02:43 someone go against me right a lot of
02:46 folks
02:46 the second you talk to them
02:48 I'm gonna tell you story about this dude
02:51 they physically remove themselves either
02:57 by leaving the room or they're sitting
02:59 with you and they simply cannot digest
03:01 any more information from your source
03:05 give you a case in point here about my
03:08 smoke lounge and I forget that people
03:11 don't people are new to the smoke lounge
03:14 and our smoke lounge is known for being
03:16 like deep thoughts man that we dive down
03:19 rabbit holes it is unbelievable and so
03:22 you have to in my opinion if you were to
03:25 come in I'd say if you're a good friend
03:27 of mine it's okay you haven't done a lot
03:29 of research then probably want to stay
03:31 quiet until you figure out where we are
03:35 you know maybe touching a subject that
03:36 you have more knowledge than say other
03:39 pieces of knowledge right unless you
03:41 open your mouth and remove all doubt
03:42 right so we had a new guy he sit next to
03:45 me very friendly man good spirited
03:49 person you know and one of us was
03:55 talking to him about some some of these
03:57 deeper subjects about some of the
03:58 conspiratorial things not too not too
04:01 intense but the guy sat there for like
04:04 three hours then he came back the next
04:08 day sat for another three hours
04:10 I think as I understand he sat there
04:13 hours before I even got there so he was
04:14 there a long time so he's feeling at
04:16 home he's feeling good and so I thought
04:18 okay well you can't just sit here
04:19 forever without hearing what we talked
04:21 about you know but it wasn't like I
04:24 needed to impose myself on him we were
04:25 playing things on the TV and I said oh
04:28 yeah that's about that thing and then it
04:31 got to the moon missions grade school
04:34 [ __ ] right conspiracy 101 something
04:37 extremely simple to discuss whether you
04:40 believe it or not right and so I started
04:45 just just absolutely touching the
04:47 surface and this guy who goes to church
04:51 every Sunday okay ceases to be able to
04:54 pay attention starts to stare off in the
04:59 room as if I am NOT talking to him
05:02 oh but what I'm not talking he's talking
05:05 24/7 and wants you to pay attention to
05:07 everything he has to say and I'll I'll
05:15 give you a spoiler
05:17 it ain't that interesting right and so
05:23 there was actually a new customer that
05:25 walked in the door right in the middle
05:27 of like I was talking to him about
05:28 paleontology and the dinosaur thing and
05:30 the answer is yes we're gonna do a
05:31 dinosaur episode I am in the process of
05:34 confirming the history that Eric Dubay
05:41 put forth and so far so good
05:44 but I'm talking to him and you know
05:46 there's that Asperger's thing where you
05:49 can't [ __ ] pay attention to anything
05:50 that's going on you know you're doing
05:52 things out of formality not as a matter
05:54 of true engagement and conversation is
05:57 one of the things that Asperger people
05:58 have a hell of a time paying attention
06:03 to and so I'm talking to the guy and
06:07 simple shipment simple simple [ __ ] and
06:10 he starts tearing off right well i'ma
06:12 mentioning this guy well he was very
06:16 religious - he was afraid we didn't go
06:20 to the moon he was afraid the dinosaurs
06:22 didn't exist and he was afraid that his
06:24 Lord and Savior the 27th iteration of a
06:28 virgin birth crater that falls from the
06:31 sky through a virgin womb saves the
06:36 planet and Rhea since he's fearful that
06:40 that system isn't true because he's been
06:43 hanging on to paradigms his entire life
06:46 and again even though one is more
06:48 defended than another even though
06:50 perhaps an entire planet thanks to the
06:52 fictional character that never existed
06:54 existed it doesn't mean they existed
06:56 right why is it so easy for people to
06:58 say that dinosaurs didn't exist after
07:00 you study the fact that they found a
07:02 tooth and built a dinosaur around it
07:04 filled a femur found a femur bone built
07:07 a dinosaur around it
07:09 two different paleontologists right I
07:11 don't even know if you can give this
07:12 [ __ ] thing a real name write a
07:14 fiction tala gist
07:16 but sort of what they were so those two
07:18 guys battled out for forty years in
07:19 their career and then they are written
07:22 in the history books as being completely
07:24 fraudulent they're - lying scumbags that
07:29 although they may have found large
07:30 prehistoric teeth and bones they're not
07:34 related to this fictitious [ __ ] thing
07:37 that is called dinosaurs okay now some
07:42 people can't let go at dinosaurs because
07:43 they may like movies right but for those
07:46 of us who quickly say yeah that's
07:48 [ __ ] they're still hanging on to the
07:52 teddy bear that is their Savior
07:54 whatever one that is right so I have had
07:58 two other people in the last two months
08:00 right last 30 days definite last two
08:03 months tell me that they think that when
08:09 you die that is it it is blackness it is
08:12 nothing okay I want to pause the little
08:16 chronology meter the the time phasing
08:21 for one second because I want us to
08:23 understand what we're talking about what
08:24 we're not talking about okay your humble
08:28 narrator does not care if it just stops
08:31 if it is blackness and I cease to exist
08:34 that I don't care because I will not be
08:38 here to care all right all right
08:41 so I have no problem with that if
08:43 kurtzweil is right we're just a bag of
08:44 chemicals although for you know there's
08:48 hundreds of years we can't explain the
08:49 mind that's fine obviously those of you
08:54 who watch the show regularly you know
08:56 that I have experiences that for me man
09:00 I'm sorry it absolutely proves beyond
09:03 the shadow of a doubt that there is an
09:04 afterlife some people live in the
09:07 afterlife and they live where they want
09:10 to live and they look exactly like they
09:12 want to be or like they want to look at
09:15 least when they portray themselves to us
09:16 in a apparition form not that anyone
09:20 else can see them but they're putting
09:21 themselves in your mind's eye they look
09:24 exactly like they want to look go see my
09:27 episode on afterlife if you need to
09:30 those stories retold because my
09:32 listeners are absolutely bored to death
09:35 of those stories I mean their true
09:39 stories but and the funny thing is is
09:43 that the girlfriend that was with me
09:45 when I had this experience of seeing
09:48 someone and that person telling me this
09:51 supposes long-dead telling me where to
09:53 go in his amusement park to find
09:55 somebody there's one of the people that
09:57 is pretty much nine fingers or nine toes
10:02 into the death is final thing and one
10:07 two possibility that it's not and
10:09 they're not angry about it right if you
10:13 start to give them your belief system
10:15 about why you think that's not true and
10:18 that they especially her she is
10:21 definitely seeing something I told her
10:23 the day I said look you were there and
10:25 she was in front of her dad who also
10:29 here adamantly believes it's the end I
10:32 said you were there you know we don't go
10:36 to that part of the music park you know
10:37 that Bob Greer was standing right at the
10:39 top of the hill bump up of a bus and so
10:43 okay so the cliff note teaser trailer
10:47 for those you want to go see the the
10:49 episode all about it is met Walt Disney
10:52 he told me where to go into music park
10:53 to meet one of his Imagineers that he
10:55 hired who I just met two weeks earlier
10:57 was with my girlfriend I take her there
10:59 we meet he used with a buddy of his and
11:02 then I called him ten years later and he
11:04 said yeah it doesn't surprise me at all
11:07 so now this girl got this privileged
11:09 moment to see something that few people
11:12 have ever seen right oh yeah I wish we
11:16 were having a big party big deep
11:18 thoughts trip to Disneyland and there's
11:20 like a hundred of you guys and gals and
11:23 we had this experience wouldn't have
11:24 been awesome would have changed the
11:26 world right would have been those
11:28 moments where the crowd goes oh so then
11:33 I look at this whole thing because
11:34 there's this there's this border okay
11:38 with people that have with the belief
11:41 system the moment of belief whether or
11:42 not you believe
11:43 and after life whether you believe it's
11:45 dead once you go into the afterlife
11:48 world whether or not you believe it's
11:50 Jesus Christ and pearly gates and Cloud
11:53 City and Peter with the big-ass book or
11:56 if you believe it's something else
11:59 something else more nebulous perhaps you
12:01 think we come out of the matrix right
12:04 there's there's room for all the belief
12:07 systems right but now here's the the
12:10 common denominator of folks that I know
12:12 that take the tak that when we're dead
12:14 it's over is this when I start
12:19 interviewing them about what they think
12:22 we are physically and spiritually and
12:26 mentally it would appear as if they have
12:29 never thought about it at all so I've
12:31 had a major interruption they're like
12:33 [ __ ] 10 minutes 10 minutes the
12:35 [ __ ] brain sawing but the common
12:37 denominator I find in folks that need
12:40 you to this death is death and that and
12:44 it's just [ __ ] your end it's it's
12:46 over it's dark it's nothing whatever
12:49 they haven't done a lot of research into
12:51 it but one of the other things I've
12:55 noticed and this became apparent and I
12:58 did an episode about a year ago maybe
13:00 even a year and a half two years ago
13:02 what our friend of mine gave me a book
13:04 they said that essentially if you don't
13:08 fear death then you're a primitive you
13:11 have a low IQ and for me I'm sure that
13:15 that exists in our world perhaps it
13:18 exists in a 51% majority but I think
13:24 that that is incredibly naive and I
13:27 think it's a defense mechanism for those
13:29 who do fear death on an intellectual
13:33 level they need to feel normal that they
13:38 fear death at this debilitating
13:40 psychological level hopefully if you
13:43 watch this show if you came to this show
13:46 with any fear of death you have no more
13:49 fear because even the possibilities that
13:52 we discussed on this show makes sense to
13:55 you there's logic to it
13:57 and you're ready whenever that occurs
14:01 you're also gonna live your life to the
14:03 fullest until that moment in time is
14:07 imposed on you right but now here's what
14:11 I see in the eyes of the people that are
14:14 telling me this spiel that they believe
14:18 and I'm not imposing this on anyone else
14:21 just the people there's this common
14:23 denominator of the folks that tend to
14:25 tell me that it's just the end because
14:28 the guy who gave me the book told me
14:32 once that he had almost died in a boat
14:36 off the coast of Florida and he said he
14:39 was tripping on acid at the time but
14:41 he's in his opinion he was able to see
14:44 something that was going on in the world
14:46 that he thinks is real and he said that
14:52 he saw a river of souls sort of jumping
14:55 out of the water and jumping into the
14:57 water and jumping out of the water and
14:59 being completely free it was a very
15:00 positive thing just like fish do it it
15:04 was the first day I ever met him and
15:05 he's a very intense super brilliant guy
15:07 but he turns to me and mill this party
15:11 he doesn't know me yet really he knows
15:14 of me and he goes he says you know all
15:17 these souls you know jumping in and out
15:20 of the ocean and it was a fascinating
15:22 story the way he told it and he looks at
15:24 me and he goes he goes we don't die
15:27 [ __ ] and I was just like that's
15:32 awesome you know so the gentleman who
15:35 gave me the book doesn't believe that we
15:37 died an end but what I see you know it's
15:41 interesting when you see a child who's a
15:44 little intimidated by the world he's not
15:47 nice to say or he or she is not
15:49 terrified of the world but they're kind
15:50 of like you know they're kind of quiet
15:52 you know and they're I hope nothing bad
15:55 happens kind of thing no bad people show
15:57 up that kind of person it's a very
16:01 endearing quality in the individual and
16:03 you know it's it's almost as if they
16:06 need someone beside them to say it's
16:09 gonna be okay don't worry about it
16:11 and by the way you're not meek and
16:13 you're not weak and you don't need to
16:15 cower down to anything right but that's
16:19 what I get from folks from their 30s all
16:23 the way up to their 70s who tell me
16:27 that's it now I have heard on radio
16:30 shows atheist there's an atheist program
16:33 used to play on the radio and I lived in
16:35 Ventura California for Tara County I
16:36 should say and it was a very interesting
16:39 thing these people would call in and
16:41 what was the fascinating thing I could
16:43 never shake was it this atheist radio
16:48 program these people were so rude and
16:55 angry constantly everybody who called in
16:59 was just pissed off and it was always
17:02 really more about them being against
17:04 religion and almost every single one of
17:07 them I think every single one on the
17:09 cauldron of the show I know this isn't
17:10 the reality of the world but they were
17:13 bit like George Carlin where they were
17:14 like I was raised in a church I was
17:16 abused in the church and so I'm going to
17:20 spend my whole life destroying the
17:21 church and the number one thing is I'm
17:25 going to debate against religion against
17:30 Christianity and the horrible horrible
17:34 short-sighted and afters that British
17:38 guy did this a lot he passed away a
17:41 couple years ago I apologize for not
17:43 remembering his name but he probably
17:48 better I don't remember anyone's name
17:49 and then when this internet turns into
17:52 some [ __ ] defamation lawsuit program
17:55 it'd only be a two-thirds of my episodes
17:57 that'll get deleted the guy would lean
18:00 on Christianity alone I say that's why
18:04 God doesn't exist because Catholics
18:07 [ __ ] it up right he would not touch
18:11 any of the other religions because he
18:13 thought that they were so foolish
18:15 Egyptology buddha never paid attention
18:19 to any Muhammad stuff because that's a
18:23 human being just trying to be a ruler on
18:25 earth Native American stuff too silly
18:27 never got into it but for some reason by
18:32 criticizing Christianity he almost
18:33 legitimized Christianity in his own
18:35 brain instead of saying look we're all
18:39 trying to figure this out some of us
18:42 believe that we feel God some of us
18:45 believe that when we feel the Sun it is
18:47 God I mean it is definitely the
18:50 nourishing thing that happens how many
18:51 of you like feeling completely frozen
18:55 and cold in the winter time right you
18:57 get this hype was a temporary
18:58 hypothermia when you get to take a leak
19:00 at night because your house is a [ __ ]
19:01 cult right we sense God they've attached
19:05 a man-made paradigm to it and no matter
19:09 how much history we find okay about this
19:13 story being told over and over and over
19:16 again and abused and how much history we
19:18 discover where human beings were utterly
19:21 murdered and sacrificed at the tune of
19:24 millions and millions of people
19:28 regardless how much of that history we
19:31 dig up it's still true it's still the
19:33 one it's mind-blowing
19:37 and so people want to take down God and
19:39 take down the afterlife because there is
19:41 no soul there is no afterlife
19:42 nothing could be scientific about this
19:44 right and again I think I've said in
19:47 several episodes the bias for religion
19:50 is just as insane as the bias for
19:52 atheism in my opinion because an atheist
19:58 is ignoring what can be observed in this
20:01 reality scientifically and again if you
20:04 walk around with a closed mind I think
20:07 it's out of pure fear you're afraid like
20:10 the guy in the in the lounge that I
20:11 mentioned with the first of this episode
20:13 he was so afraid he was probably in his
20:16 late 50s mid to late 50s but he's so
20:18 [ __ ] terrified of hearing something
20:20 that he can't digest that he goes pretty
20:25 much borderline rude if not totally
20:27 committed Asperger's rude by just you
20:31 know delving off while you're talking
20:32 again you have to listen to his [ __ ]
20:34 [ __ ] for hours and hours and hours I
20:36 mean we're talking [ __ ] like who
20:39 a flock with this guy saying nothing
20:41 profound wants to hog the [ __ ] TV to
20:44 play his favorite tracks when he was a
20:45 kid
20:47 it's funny and then when you want to
20:49 talk it's like oh wow that's that's more
20:52 than one plus one equals two from my
20:55 brain and hey I go to church so I don't
20:57 have to ever add anything up
20:59 I go to church so I don't have to
21:00 [ __ ] think I just look at this book I
21:03 sing a hymn I listen to the preacher oh
21:05 that's nice
21:06 right again you can do where the [ __ ]
21:07 you want with your life I choose to turn
21:10 it up to 11
21:11 let's [ __ ] live this thing right now
21:14 getting you beat you visit me in 30
21:16 years
21:16 I'll start slowing down and I'll be my
21:18 80s almost I don't know man I got
21:22 friends in their 80s they're not slowing
21:25 down but now what would be the principal
21:28 so now we covered some psychology of the
21:30 whole thing my eye look at my computer
21:32 to figure out how long these episodes
21:33 have gone because mr. shrubbery John the
21:37 shrubbery over there was going [ __ ]
21:39 crazy with his little thingy I had to I
21:41 probably lost a good 10 minutes in the
21:43 middle of this thing so we should be
21:45 around 20 minutes or so but now what is
21:48 the logic of nothing right for me it
21:55 comes down to the brain comes down to
21:58 the brain I was going to sleep the other
22:00 day and there's this big debate in
22:03 America about abortion again because
22:05 they you know the [ __ ] left has to
22:07 bring up the most divisive [ __ ] [ __ ]
22:09 that keep going right make them you know
22:12 let them eat cake let them fight each
22:13 other in the [ __ ] Octagon of social
22:16 debate right you know the the fake
22:19 [ __ ] Vietnam vet douchebag you walked
22:22 up with his [ __ ] Native American drum
22:25 it's a bunch of kids who didn't give him
22:27 any [ __ ] at all we're totally [ __ ]
22:29 cool we got these radical [ __ ]
22:32 scumbags sitting off to the side giving
22:34 him [ __ ] and I'm really sorry that one
22:36 group was white one group was black and
22:37 one day was Native American could have
22:39 been any mix I'd have the same opinion
22:41 right so they keep getting us in this
22:44 thing but anyway there's this bill
22:45 that's been trying to pass I believe in
22:47 Ohio and it's about the
22:53 that the second that a heartbeats in a
22:55 human being that it's a consider to life
22:57 and you can't abort it
22:58 then Cuomo New York this isn't even
23:02 funny he says you can abort your child
23:04 all the way up to the point it's born
23:06 like a Dinant old baby Cuomo says you
23:10 can kill a nine month old baby because
23:13 all those elite [ __ ] Robert De Niro
23:15 spirit cooking [ __ ] harvest
23:18 parts out of kids and put them in
23:21 themselves so they can live longer right
23:24 he's one of many The Young Ones who are
23:28 musicians right now you're Katy Perry's
23:30 and you're Lady Gaga's are all into that
23:31 [ __ ] they're just [ __ ] they're just
23:34 making sure they're on the on the ice
23:36 Wide Shut team so they can have their
23:40 their parts when they need them in the
23:43 future
23:45 hail Satan right but anyway I digress
23:49 we're gonna throw that out for a little
23:51 while to make sure that you repeat that
23:53 you look it up
23:54 spirit cooking Lady gaga spirit cooking
23:57 Robert De Niro spear cooking lady look
23:59 her up it's time we exposed these piece
24:02 of [ __ ] [ __ ] humans all right
24:04 hate to even call them humans it's an
24:06 insult to our whole [ __ ] species
24:07 right remember we live by do no harm
24:10 well those people are the epitome of do
24:13 harm do extreme harm at the cost of
24:16 other people's lives that's what they do
24:19 but anyway I did this episode on vacuums
24:22 and ether I'm going to bed the other
24:24 night I'm thinking how the hell does the
24:25 heartbeat start right that's the
24:28 Frankenstein question a little
24:30 electrical pop that you go oh yeah wow
24:34 that little muscle a couple couple cells
24:37 Devine and all sudden there's this dump
24:40 dump dump dump dump dump and I thought
24:43 well I believe that we are a symbiotic
24:45 being between a soul and a body and so
24:49 obviously the heartbeat is the
24:51 definitive moment it might happen prior
24:54 to the heartbeat but it's the definitive
24:56 moment where according to my theory the
24:59 spiritual force that is us that is
25:02 untrackable by geiger counters and
25:04 [ __ ] electrical currents so there
25:06 or it doesn't exist right the hubris of
25:09 man is always so entertaining ly stupid
25:12 but there's an attachment there and it
25:16 was almost like when he's philip k dick
25:17 river of truth moments where it all
25:20 became a thousand percent clear doesn't
25:24 mean it's right this is what i felt and
25:25 this is how i felt about it right so get
25:30 ready to pack your pipe because you can
25:31 smoke this after i'm done what it was in
25:35 my brain was the fact that ether all
25:40 winds that manifest our currents that
25:43 are that eventually turned into higher
25:47 constructs which are our cells and our
25:49 body and all this other biological
25:51 matter that at one point like a kink in
25:56 a hose for instance imagine had a hose
25:58 that wasn't completely rough and tough
26:02 and so the kink doesn't stick but even
26:05 if you had a hose that is got a kink in
26:07 it and you could put enough pressure in
26:09 that hose just for to the kink
26:12 eventually the pressure is going to
26:14 potentially overwhelm the hose and
26:16 you're gonna get a kink to go flip a
26:19 transverse wave of water is gonna go
26:21 through this thing it might wreak ink
26:23 right it's gonna flop reduce the
26:26 pressure and a kink might come back
26:28 right let's just go with that
26:30 imagine if the magical configuration of
26:33 cell matter versus spiritual attachment
26:37 / ether winds was a bit like the brain
26:41 in a squid the brain in a squid is a
26:45 50-foot squid has a brain about the size
26:47 of my pinky it's a tube it's all it is
26:50 they think that the brain tissue may
26:53 actually be part of the legs as well but
26:57 I I doubt it because they can get their
27:01 arms and legs cut off or their tentacles
27:04 cut off and they grow back new ones
27:06 right but maybe it's still there but for
27:09 the most part it's this little tube
27:12 so I thought well we know that there are
27:15 creatures with tubes for brains okay
27:18 what is our brain our brain is a bunch
27:20 of tubes constructed out of this green
27:22 matter stuff right we just have a big
27:24 tube that's all condensed okay
27:27 stick with me on this what if the
27:30 artbeat is nothing more than the the
27:34 beat of e throw winds pushing through a
27:37 condensed configuration of cells and it
27:41 is merely flopping through a tube
27:44 lymphoma thump thump the first pop is
27:47 the biggest one because it is the
27:50 pressure that has to push hard enough on
27:52 the sale of matter or even the Eastwind
27:54 matter on electrical level right because
27:56 either is gonna make electricity it
28:00 flops and that it hits another bump down
28:04 the road just just down the road me get
28:05 the second flump it's less than the
28:07 first I believe that's the way it works
28:08 on the EKG it's boom-boom it's high low
28:12 right just like electrical circuit when
28:15 that occurs you're gonna get dielectric
28:17 magnetism and electromagnet magnetism
28:19 and you get your waves of electricity
28:22 that then start to galvanize all the
28:26 tissue into a reflexology of of
28:30 ventricle walls that become the heart
28:33 but now let's think about it if there's
28:35 any if there's any big bang to a human
28:38 being it's this moment when this heart
28:39 beat doesn't exist and then it does
28:41 exist right flop once you get the one
28:45 pop you're on you're on until you're
28:47 dead but everything is so condensed what
28:52 cell is actually getting that little
28:55 flop well naturally we think it's the
28:58 heart because the heart is what actually
29:01 has that rhythm for the rest of your
29:02 life blump blump blump lung right and it
29:05 very many very well maybe but all the
29:08 sudden in my brain when this was given
29:10 to me this association between the
29:13 spiritual and the physical again the
29:16 Infinity project right the distinct area
29:19 of the body that became apparent to me
29:22 was the brainstem
29:25 which we now know many cultures have
29:28 identified as the third eye your pineal
29:33 gland your essentially your extension
29:37 cord to the rest of the universe again
29:39 you can have your body absolutely
29:41 destroyed head-to-toe but if you hurt
29:43 your brainstem
29:44 you are dead you're dead instantaneously
29:48 my physics teacher told me once he goes
29:51 if any of you ever kill yourself he goes
29:53 put the gun right back through the back
29:55 your roof of your mouth or right the
29:57 back your roof of your throat and he
29:59 goes I'll blow your brain stem away and
30:00 you will not live no matter what happens
30:02 you had a cabdriver tell me once he was
30:04 a liar he was a stolen valor guy about
30:07 Vietnam he may have been there but I
30:10 don't know we can't find anything out
30:12 about this dude he's long gone but he
30:15 used to tell us that dudes used to take
30:18 a big swig of water these guys have one
30:20 commits suicide and V another take a big
30:22 swig of water put a shotgun in their
30:24 mouth and he said when you pull the
30:25 trigger it boils the water and blows
30:27 your head completely up and I said dude
30:29 just try it without the water I'm sure
30:31 the same [ __ ] thing will happen
30:34 there's a morbid tale from the limo
30:38 drivers of the world so there's
30:41 obviously something going on here I'm
30:45 gonna make an episode that's going to be
30:47 about how the human body processes
30:50 electricity we're based largely on
30:52 epigenetics as a foundation and they
30:54 were going to get into a lot of
30:56 different analyses about the senses of
30:59 the human body but in this particular
31:02 conversation about the afterlife there's
31:08 a reason why you were you and I am me
31:10 right we know that our bodies contribute
31:14 greatly to our eventual outcome right
31:17 you become your father and your mother
31:19 and your other relatives you do you
31:21 become your grandparents now some of
31:23 that is most likely due to growing up
31:27 with them but for those that have
31:30 studied mono goseck twins they end up
31:34 marrying the same type people
31:37 male female whatever they end up getting
31:40 the same jobs so this is a tremendous
31:43 amount of genetic encoding that travels
31:45 between human beings we've proven this
31:47 but that may simply be the biology of
31:50 the brain right for anyone who wants to
31:54 dispute genetic intelligence they have
31:57 to look at these studies and realize no
31:59 there's definitely some intelligence
32:01 okay that is going with and preference
32:03 with the genetic patterns in a human
32:05 being now to say it's racial
32:09 intelligence
32:10 well that is strictly a matter of
32:11 oppression and repression and oppression
32:14 I should say that keeps education out of
32:17 a particular geographical strand of
32:20 human beings therefore they've never
32:23 heard of things they can't pass it down
32:25 to their kids
32:26 genetically right but if you take any
32:29 level of science especially physics you
32:33 know that you can't hide energy in the
32:35 universe you can't do it
32:37 okay so if you have any level of well if
32:42 you have any any quantifiable I don't
32:46 want to say mass but we could say mass
32:49 but not the mass that is e equals MC MC
32:51 squared mass you know I'm sitting with a
32:54 patio with my computer recording the
32:56 audio a bunch of stuff in my back yard
32:57 if someone said make this disappear the
33:02 only thing I could possibly do is say
33:03 well relative to your eyesight you think
33:06 it's there now and so I can relatively
33:08 move it to a new location such that it
33:10 seems like a disappear like a magic
33:12 trick but in the end I'm palming the
33:14 card right so when it comes to your
33:17 spiritual existence and again the
33:20 problem that we're dealing with is the
33:21 chicken and the egg and the idea that an
33:23 atheist might say well Jesus look at you
33:25 you're claiming to be open-minded and
33:32 you know have your two feet on the
33:34 ground but you're talking about a soul
33:35 right there has to be a reason why
33:42 I'll go with my grandmother's example
33:45 that my grandmother had died and then I
33:49 woke up about 12 o'clock
33:51 she died of I think the previous day and
33:56 or early that morning or something and I
33:58 got the message several hours later in
34:02 California at 12 noon I woke up I'm in
34:06 bed got my eyes shut but you know I'm
34:09 waking up and I see her hovering over me
34:13 and my mind's eye and she says to me my
34:15 name and then she says it's grandma and
34:19 I saw her I always used to see her at
34:21 night in her gown all the grandmas were
34:24 these gowns right totally different than
34:25 when we were today and she's just sort
34:29 of floating up there like she's under
34:30 walking underwater go shut or something
34:32 right and she says I just want you to
34:34 know I'm on the other side and I'm okay
34:36 it's all good two o'clock that day
34:39 McGinnis is 4 o'clock been Western time
34:42 so by 12:00 it's 2 o'clock by 2 it's 4
34:44 o'clock my mother calls me and says
34:46 grandma's past okay so there's two ways
34:52 you can look at this in my opinion two
34:54 main ways you can look at this one let's
34:57 go with the least obvious in my opinion
34:59 which is someone one of my relatives
35:00 found out that she died and they
35:02 telepathically transmitted this message
35:04 to me in bed at 12 o'clock okay why the
35:08 hell would they use the words that they
35:09 used I'm on the other side I'm okay they
35:15 wouldn't tell it to me like that they
35:17 were told to me like they told me at two
35:18 o'clock that day which is in a cry boys
35:22 grandma passed away yesterday that's the
35:27 way they would say it it's a personal
35:30 loss for them my mother called me her
35:31 mother died right and that's it so the
35:37 other side of the game is my grandmother
35:40 is already gone in terms of an atheist
35:42 she is in the nothingness okay so how
35:48 the hell am I getting this message did
35:49 she leave behind a tape recording in
35:51 some non spiritual world that got to me
35:54 hmm
35:55 okay now the other interesting thing
36:00 that we need to put together is that one
36:04 again this happened to me
36:06 and so these things if you saw a UFO you
36:10 know you did you weren't on any drugs
36:12 you were in a very solid state of mind
36:14 you got a good rest at a motel in and
36:17 you saw a UFO and then I come and tell
36:22 you that you didn't see you focus I'm
36:23 some [ __ ] Project Blue Book Guy or
36:26 I'm your cynical neighbor who wishes I
36:28 had seen one so if I don't see one you
36:30 can't see one and I keep telling you
36:31 that it didn't happen and you're like
36:35 [ __ ] you man
36:36 I saw it I got in the [ __ ] thing
36:38 right had some guy at some [ __ ] come
36:41 up to episode 26 the moon hoax episode
36:44 and he was accusing me of being a
36:46 pathological liar and claiming that I
36:48 talked to NASA scientists and at first
36:50 I'm thinking scientists like when the
36:52 [ __ ] that I say I talk to scientists
36:53 oh yeah my two buddies who work for NASA
36:56 I guess they're scientists like yes
36:59 right but that was funny to the guy in
37:02 the lounge I said to him I said I was
37:04 debriefed by a guy who was a prodigy
37:06 child work for NASA from the age of 16
37:09 and uh seven patents at NASA for
37:11 satellite technology ended up being I
37:14 don't know I've known about this guy's
37:16 worth he's a small Elon Musk Nell with
37:19 his money because he made something on
37:22 the internet that sold really really
37:24 well and I went looked him up and he
37:26 actually chatted with him in the last
37:27 two years he doesn't even acknowledge
37:29 working for NASA in his in his LinkedIn
37:35 page it's hilarious but this was the
37:38 legend of this guy and he talked to me
37:39 all about all this stuff right so this
37:41 guy's like sitting next to me going well
37:44 I think anyone who says that I just
37:45 can't even listen to him anymore and I'm
37:47 like this [ __ ] god I'm like and who
37:49 the [ __ ] are you like you're a complete
37:51 [ __ ] nobody in this world telling me
37:54 that one I didn't have this experience
37:55 and to the guy that worked for NASA for
37:57 I think almost 15 years doesn't know
38:02 what the [ __ ] he's talking about why
38:04 it's just unbelievable the defense we
38:06 have against the situation right
38:09 but again I do your I digress when you
38:12 come back to this idea that my
38:15 grandmother was able to communicate with
38:18 me from the other side which is really
38:20 just an almost on metaphor right there's
38:23 no two sides necessary there's two forms
38:25 of life right the interesting thing is
38:28 is that one she was allowed to do so I
38:31 certainly didn't get any sense that she
38:34 had centuries to both her sides and say
38:36 okay lady yeah talk to your other kids
38:41 but she knew I was open-minded to see it
38:44 no one else in the family said that she
38:46 came to them and said that on the day
38:49 she passed away
38:50 right so if you believe we're in a
38:53 simulator for instance that would mean
38:56 that your program ended your purlins off
39:00 the goggles yeah your hope god that was
39:03 wild yes sir really great now come over
39:06 to the break room we're gonna have some
39:07 fun here and you helped a couple months
39:11 or so you can plan where you're gonna
39:12 reinsert yourself into this human
39:15 simulator well what's interesting about
39:19 that is that it would seem that she
39:21 didn't pull the goggles off before she
39:22 had a chance to communicate with me my
39:25 question to myself is I wonder if she
39:28 attempted to communicate with anyone
39:30 else one I wonder if she actually did
39:32 and someone saw it and there my family
39:34 on that side of the family that side of
39:40 my family is very conservative very very
39:43 conservative would not want to be known
39:44 as saying anything out of the norm it's
39:47 all about being a part of the club right
39:49 and I'm sort of in the middle of you
39:54 know truth with a capital T rules my
39:57 life and everything else can go [ __ ]
39:59 itself right stand for something people
40:04 but now if someone were to say oh oh
40:06 hallmark you know you you made that up
40:09 in your brain it's like okay how how
40:13 would I do that
40:13 how would I say something I'd never say
40:15 you know one thing that's very
40:17 interesting about dreams is that a lot
40:20 of the times dreams will say things that
40:22 you
40:22 really would have thought up and when
40:26 your dreams start saying things that you
40:28 wouldn't say that's when you really
40:30 really really remember them but that
40:32 almost never occurs for me believe me I
40:34 have some damn good dreams now I
40:37 apologize but I've got to lay this out
40:39 here when I met a certain individual at
40:43 Disneyland it warmed my heart in
40:47 obviously more than one way but one of
40:50 the best ways that won my heart was that
40:51 the notion that you can live where you
40:54 want to live for as long as you want to
40:55 live after you're gone you don't have to
40:58 come back right away right again I think
41:01 time is obviously a complete construct
41:03 of our reality our perspective machine
41:06 our relativity machine that we have to
41:09 live by it's just you know if you took
41:12 memories away from human beings and
41:14 we're all a bunch of Nemo fish the Ellen
41:18 DeGeneres fish that doesn't remember
41:19 anything like ever we have short term
41:21 buffers in the front of our mind but
41:22 even if we took those out there would be
41:25 no concept for time for men right you
41:29 wouldn't remember being small you
41:31 wouldn't remember being young you
41:34 wouldn't remember who your mom and dad
41:35 are everything would just be constant
41:37 well that'd be a word [ __ ] wouldn't
41:39 it is my hope that if anything this show
41:42 has proposed or submitted enough
41:45 episodes that those who are interested
41:50 in hearing non-religious takes on the
41:54 afterlife and what it could be and the
41:58 logic gates that surround it
42:00 you get to hear options that you've
42:02 never heard because in this world in
42:04 this show you're not in trouble for
42:08 having your thoughts right and again
42:13 I've talked more on this show about the
42:16 afterlife than I have ever had another
42:18 human being talked to me about the
42:21 afterlife right and their shows on TV
42:23 that exploit these ideas to sell
42:27 advertising you know those shows do not
42:31 give a [ __ ] whether or not you get
42:32 enlightened at all they're trying to to
42:35 entice you they
42:36 they fudge facts they fudge stories to
42:39 make them interesting and it's just a
42:41 business rights it's profit and it's
42:44 entertainment right for me personally
42:47 when I look at the scenarios where it's
42:52 it's the paranormal because in Los
42:57 Angeles you'll meet a lot of people who
42:59 believe in the paranormal now part of
43:01 that could be that this is a tremendous
43:06 area of the world that is sort of like
43:08 the definition of the shining the shine
43:12 in the shiny the book the Stephen King
43:14 wrote the Stephen Kubrick made into a
43:16 movie but in the book it was all about
43:20 the fact that the more that something
43:22 happens in a particular area it leaves a
43:24 little bit of itself behind like when
43:25 you burn someone burns toast you can
43:28 smell it long after the toast is gone
43:31 and so Los Angeles has millions and
43:35 millions of people and so as millions
43:37 and millions of people come here and die
43:39 they leave behind or stay behind and
43:42 therefore give us an opportunity to swim
43:45 in what is the afterlife also you have a
43:52 lot of dreamers who come here to follow
43:55 their careers and so you have some
43:57 fairly open minded folks because who
43:59 dreams not close-minded people
44:01 open-minded people dream they get their
44:04 dreams they live more life they're more
44:06 happy now they tend to have either more
44:10 money in the bank than everyone else so
44:11 they have less money than anyone else on
44:13 the block it's just the price you pay
44:17 you got to be adamant stay at it right
44:20 but you also have that person that I
44:24 tend to call it the Whitley Strieber
44:26 person maybe Whitley Schreiber had an
44:30 experience with gray aliens this is his
44:33 claim that the book I couldn't remember
44:36 the other day in an episode was
44:37 transformation so it was communion
44:39 transformation and breakthrough I
44:41 believe of the three books that went in
44:42 a row he's probably written several
44:44 since then but those are the three that
44:45 got released in about a two to three
44:48 year span
44:49 and this guy got to a point when I
44:53 started reading I think transformation
44:55 it was it was ludicrous the format of
44:59 the book which was he would tell you
45:02 about a person that he went he traveled
45:05 the world to talk to some old lady or
45:06 some old dude and they would tell him
45:11 this unique experience with an alien and
45:15 then he would finish their story and
45:17 then immediately claim that he had had
45:19 that experience
45:20 and it was one experience after another
45:22 after this like if this [ __ ] couldn't
45:24 meet anybody that it had an experience
45:26 that he hadn't had as well almost like
45:28 that kind of one-up chick that kristen
45:30 wiig used to play on senate live right
45:32 no matter what you say they've got more
45:35 oh I did that too and and mine was
45:37 better than yours you start to
45:40 understand theirs in a sort of a nerdy
45:44 me too meaning all-inclusive I am I'm
45:48 part of your crowd too but I'm your
45:51 leader I'm better I got the better one
45:53 which is all built out of insecurities
45:54 right and so I have met folks in Los
45:59 Angeles that are a bit like that they've
46:03 had every single experience that they've
46:04 ever heard about on the Internet
46:06 I had that too I had that too I had that
46:08 too and it's like well then you should
46:12 have your own show right John Edwards
46:14 had a show where he read people's minds
46:16 in a town hall format on a set okay
46:19 because for him the occurrence of
46:23 hearing folks from the other side was
46:26 according to him far more common than
46:31 the rest of us and so he developed skill
46:33 sets of discerning what they were saying
46:38 because it's a little foggy when they
46:40 talked to him and so he works with
46:43 people in the room and again I've had
46:44 friends that went to the recordings of
46:45 his show and he said we sat there for 12
46:48 hours he goes when I watched on TV it
46:52 was only like two hours worth of the
46:54 twelve so they really cut the hell out
46:57 of that show to make it look like he's
46:58 just [ __ ] nailing it every two
47:00 seconds right
47:01 but again maybe the guy is a master
47:04 [ __ ] cold reader or maybe he does have
47:09 these experiences but it's not frequent
47:11 enough to actually sit in the room and
47:14 hit it out of the park like Babe Ruth 12
47:16 hours in a row so he's sitting there
47:18 going oh my god what the help I've got
47:19 myself into I've got this skill that
47:22 allows me to communicate with folks on
47:24 the other side
47:24 not everyone's relatives care to
47:27 communicate with them maybe they decide
47:29 it's it's not appropriate maybe they
47:31 decide it's not something they're
47:35 interested in maybe they've moved on
47:37 I've been reborn and so they're not
47:38 there but what does he do with the cold
47:41 reading he he says I'm getting a vision
47:44 of a red scarf is anyone someone in here
47:46 know someone who always wore red scarf
47:48 and then of course the odds are in a big
47:50 enough room in a big enough Town Hall
47:52 someone's like dude okay well then you
47:54 know I have they passed already he
47:57 starts going to a warm reading mode
47:59 right so random fishing trying to warm
48:01 turn to absolute coincidence right but
48:07 again I've seen some the most the most
48:11 the most convincing episode of John
48:14 Edwards show I don't think it's on TV
48:16 anymore was there was a little boy who
48:19 passed away I mentioned this once before
48:20 and there was a Bambino I think this was
48:24 all Jersey or New York and he recalled
48:27 this kids funeral with great detail and
48:31 this Bambino dude was like he was
48:34 brought there by his wife he didn't want
48:35 have anything to do with this he thought
48:36 this was all [ __ ] and they
48:38 interviewed him after the after the show
48:41 I think he's sucking on a some hard
48:43 candy or something it was really creepy
48:45 man he was like some [ __ ] gangbanger
48:47 right or back from the day like a
48:49 gangster tough dude you could tell man
48:54 I've got friends like this and they
48:56 don't mess around boy but he it was his
49:00 little nephew I think it was his nephew
49:03 all right no his grandson excuse me this
49:05 was grandson who passed away and I think
49:08 he got hit and
49:09 all right his bike or something and they
49:11 had this gigantic ceremony down the
49:13 street and everybody was there cuz
49:15 everyone loved this kid and this guy
49:18 choked up on camera needs to slack man
49:21 he goes there was just way too many
49:24 details that this guy Neil without me
49:26 saying [ __ ] cuz the guy wouldn't talk to
49:28 him the Bambino dude would not say [ __ ]
49:30 he's just like [ __ ] you dude you know
49:32 you're gonna get this right you're gonna
49:34 get it right all all on your own I'm not
49:35 helping you I know how this game works
49:37 and a guy after the show was over he was
49:40 doing his best to choke back the tears
49:43 let me tell you and he just his last
49:45 words I believe are something to the
49:47 effect of this guy's for real so that
49:52 was the one I was like I was [ __ ] man
49:54 maybe John's got some skills right thing
49:56 I liked about John was that he was very
49:58 humble with his approach he wasn't like
50:00 some of these sleaze ball old ladies
50:01 that get out there and you know they say
50:05 that was it the famous one that was
50:08 shown a photograph of a little girl and
50:09 she's like oh man not only she dead but
50:12 she was raped savagely before she died
50:15 she died horribly she was tortured and
50:17 it turns out it's the baby photograph of
50:19 the woman interviewing her she goes no
50:20 that's me you [ __ ] actually they used
50:24 to hosted a male host showed it to her
50:26 first and then she came and hold held
50:28 her own photograph hilarious but the
50:32 thing I want you to think about is at a
50:35 minimum you are an organized energy ball
50:38 even if you believe that we're just a
50:41 bag of chemicals in the brain the
50:44 general consensus of those who believe
50:47 the death is final is that we simply
50:49 dispersed into the universe we diffuse
50:51 like all chemical reactions and that we
50:54 are just simply reconstituted into
50:56 someone else okay maybe that's true then
51:01 there's folks that believe in the the
51:05 more intellectual side of the afterlife
51:08 which is if you contribute to this world
51:11 then you sort of are living forever
51:13 because you have contributed your sense
51:15 of being to others and even if you're
51:18 not remembered like King Tut with a gold
51:20 bust in some mummy
51:23 and some wild a story of your family and
51:26 what-have-you which may or may not be
51:28 true
51:29 you are still being remembered by your
51:34 family if you ever taught a kid how to
51:36 do something then that kid could could
51:39 grow up and be that professionally and
51:41 they teach their kids and kids and kids
51:43 and kids and it all came from you right
51:45 you figured out something the family had
51:47 never figured out or you rediscovered
51:49 something about your family again the
51:51 Pharos believe that if your name is
51:53 spoken by the public at large then you
51:57 are still remembered that's a very
52:00 interesting thing as well you know
52:02 there's the it's really interesting and
52:06 fascinating that we get information from
52:08 the weirdest places sometimes and
52:10 there's always multiple places you can
52:11 get the information from but I tell you
52:14 one that came to me through I think a I
52:18 don't want to say a regrettable source
52:20 but it's definitely one that I do not
52:23 participate in believing in currently I
52:25 have no reason to believe in it and that
52:29 is a David Ickes belief in reptilian
52:33 people and you know over the years he's
52:36 been he said his balls busted a million
52:38 times for this thing and he always gets
52:41 really angry and as much as he pretends
52:46 to have composure over this
52:48 he's totally busting at the seams and
52:51 Jesse Ventura interviewed him once about
52:54 the whole thing and I supported about
52:58 half of the way Jesse treated him but
52:59 this whole hostility thing like if I had
53:02 David Icke on this porch and we're doing
53:04 an interview face-to-face I would treat
53:06 him with the utmost respect for his
53:08 beliefs and I might ask the same
53:10 questions that Jesse asked him but I
53:12 wouldn't ask him like an [ __ ] right
53:14 where jesse was like where are they
53:16 where are they where are they you know
53:17 it's like okay well he's gotcha David's
53:22 got you Jesse because what David said
53:26 was he goes look we estimate that
53:29 mankind can only see at the highest
53:31 level 3 percent of the visual
53:34 frequencies that are in
53:37 the universe meaning the various
53:39 frequencies of light that exists that
53:41 are created through all different means
53:42 right x-rays ultraviolet light and all
53:46 this kind of stuff right we feel the
53:48 effects of them may suffer from the
53:49 effects of them here and there
53:51 but we can't see them and so he said
53:53 look they live and the other 97% of the
53:56 visual spectrum that you can't see yeah
54:00 I don't find any value and really
54:02 getting into the reptilian debate
54:04 personally if I see someone transformed
54:07 into a reptilian I'll let you know right
54:09 I will we've had at least a dozen people
54:12 in the comments over three and a half
54:13 years say emphatically in the comments
54:17 well I've seen them transform into a
54:19 seen someone transform into a lizard or
54:22 whatever routine then I say as politely
54:25 as I can please explain your story share
54:28 your story tell us what happened and not
54:30 a single one of these people reply okay
54:34 okay well you go to the zero book for me
54:40 because you've got nothing you've got an
54:42 attention-seeking fragile soul that
54:46 needs to feel special and so you're
54:48 throwing this around well I've been on
54:49 an alien spaceship oh you have there
54:51 Jeffro came in tell me all about it well
54:55 you know I was drunk at the time I don't
54:57 really remember that much okay mm-hmm
55:01 you were with the Big Foot weren't you
55:03 well funny you'd mention that yeah that
55:06 works no thanks but the interesting
55:10 thing about the truth that we obviously
55:12 can't see the majority of the light
55:14 spectrum whatever the percentages help
55:16 maybe 99.9 percent of the spectrum is
55:19 that it the truth that I personally
55:23 believe in and feel okay is that it's so
55:28 simple and so remedial and if mankind
55:30 were to ever take this seriously and I
55:32 think they have at the intelligence
55:33 level again there's been billions of
55:36 dollars spent researching this exact
55:40 thing in that both in the Russian side
55:42 and the American side don't know about
55:44 all the other countries I'm sure they've
55:45 done their little part as well but the
55:49 second that we can't
55:50 you something or see something through
55:52 mechanical means be a biological
55:54 mechanical means your eyeball is your
55:56 brain metabolizing electricity to say
55:59 this is here this isn't here or again a
56:04 Geiger counter they can't see it well
56:06 there is the inability of man to accept
56:10 the fact that perhaps in our great
56:12 hubris our arrogance of knowing all
56:16 things right we know how the [ __ ]
56:18 universe was created don't we mm-hmm I'm
56:22 gonna wager that the last thing the man
56:24 would ever discover if we don't kill
56:26 each other will be how the universe was
56:29 or how it exists or how it started
56:32 that'll be the last thing we ever figure
56:34 out right when you write a book a novice
56:39 writes the introduction first and then
56:42 once you finish it you go back and you
56:44 read you introduction you're like oh my
56:45 god what the [ __ ] was I thinking
56:46 I don't know what the hell I was talking
56:47 about I don't even know what this book
56:49 was really about until I finished it so
56:52 you don't get that privilege it usually
56:56 but the soul and I don't mean to create
56:59 a faith-based system either right
57:01 it wasn't faith I didn't go to
57:03 Disneyland and go Walt Disney's gonna
57:05 walk up to me and tell me where to go to
57:07 me an Imagineer that he hired a long
57:08 time ago 1954 right I had I had a very
57:14 amazing feeling just before it occurred
57:17 I got this sort of light euphoric burst
57:25 just before this apparition came up and
57:29 said something and walked off it was
57:30 like two seconds buh-buh-buh-buh boom
57:32 walk off right Bob burns over there used
57:35 to go say hi to walks past me I had
57:39 forgotten that my grandmother was ill I
57:41 forgot that she was so ill that she
57:43 could pass away in fact I look back on
57:46 that and I'm actually a little ashamed
57:48 that my life got busy when she passed
57:52 away because I think the last thing I
57:55 had heard I mean this is the God's
57:57 honest truth last thing I had heard was
57:59 that my grandmother who I had visited
58:01 every year I definitely noticed she was
58:04 suffer
58:04 from dementia because she'd walk around
58:07 at night turning the heater on when it's
58:09 already hundred degrees outside it's
58:11 like midnight you know in Kansas
58:13 she'd look for a purse but she already
58:14 had it on her arm that kind of stuff
58:16 right she was slowly losing your mind my
58:20 aunt's and their utter brilliance god
58:22 bless him said oh you should get in your
58:25 car and come visit us a hundred miles
58:27 away
58:27 now perhaps despite almost all my family
58:32 being involved with the medical industry
58:33 at some level didn't know that she was
58:36 actually suffering that badly from from
58:39 Alzheimer's or whatever dementia
58:41 actually thought they thought it was
58:42 dementia but she shows up in my aunt's
58:44 house with her car completely totaled
58:47 down the right side because she had
58:49 apparently run into a big rig on her way
58:52 up to my aunt's and there's like you
58:55 know big-rig tire marks all the way down
58:57 the side of her car yeah maybe a woman
59:01 in her late 70s shouldn't be driving
59:03 North a hundred miles I don't remember
59:06 if it was winter or summer but maybe
59:10 they shouldn't have baited her into
59:12 potentially killing herself and other
59:13 people at that stage in her life right
59:16 but that was the last story I heard of
59:19 her I think I'd heard one teeny tiny
59:22 update that they had moved her in with
59:24 one of the aunts or something I don't
59:26 even remember them ever saying she moved
59:27 into assisted living so that was my last
59:30 recollection of my grandmother before
59:32 she drops in one morning to say she's on
59:35 the other side so for me it was like oh
59:36 oh wow I guess yeah I guess you are in
59:41 that later stage of your life I think
59:42 she died at 79 my father grandfather
59:45 died at 76 I believe so there wasn't a
59:50 predictive element to my subconscious
59:52 that would have said what grandma's
59:54 gonna die anytime now grandma's gonna
59:55 die anytime now and then I wake up it's
59:57 like the guy who predicts an earthquake
59:58 every single day and eventually he's
60:01 right and then he goes and tries to
60:02 start a a book tour because he is such a
60:06 [ __ ] genius right if you believe that
60:10 death is it and you're more than welcome
60:13 to that belief system okay
60:16 then please please make sure you have I
60:22 would say watched every episode in this
60:24 series I should probably make a
60:26 different playlist for afterlife because
60:28 it says something that comes up a lot in
60:29 the in the comments section a lot of
60:35 requests for the for the afterlife to be
60:37 covered which is very interesting
60:38 because what I find almost a backhanded
60:42 compliment from anyone asking me to do
60:44 those episodes is that through some
60:47 other narrative that I have put in an
60:49 episode right there getting this this
60:53 epiphany of like this dude should do one
60:55 on the afterlife I like the way he talks
60:56 or whatever and it's a it's I consider
60:59 that a privilege that anybody would say
61:01 I'm gonna trust you with my mind in my
61:04 heart and my soul with your perspective
61:07 on this very very delicate coveted
61:13 undocumented unspoken about thing right
61:16 and again luckily the internet has now
61:19 turned the world inside out and so
61:22 instead of having three channels right
61:23 there's this weird thing that a
61:25 girlfriend always talked about which is
61:28 there are 1983 there's like three
61:35 channels on TV and then by 1985 we used
61:39 to have these sliders in our house these
61:41 little boxes there was over 100 channels
61:43 it's like Jesus how the hell that
61:45 happened now as I said extra 97 channels
61:48 and hell that was just in our region
61:50 there's another 200 someplace else and
61:52 now we've got what you know potentially
61:55 thousands of channels okay so we used to
61:58 have a couple sources of information now
62:01 the YouTube and podcasting and blogging
62:03 has turned it up to be hundreds of
62:05 millions of people who knock talk about
62:07 things so the only thing I want to make
62:10 sure well I'm saying it the wrong way
62:13 the only thing that concerns me I don't
62:18 think this is true it's sort of petty
62:20 for me to mention it but I've also had
62:23 this weird feeling and I've said it once
62:25 before
62:27 what if you got what you wanted what if
62:31 God simply said well I want you to have
62:32 everything that you want and you're a
62:35 firm believer that death is final
62:36 and so I will arrange for your utter
62:41 erasing your D rezzing as it were intron
62:45 when you die it's over all of your
62:48 relatives will never know you begin
62:50 perhaps I even erase that you even
62:52 existed which I don't know how that
62:54 happens because someone's got a mommy
62:55 and her daddy so one of the final
62:58 questions I want to pose is what if you
63:01 believed it was nothing and then you
63:04 died and it was something in fact it was
63:08 actually pretty damn cool would you be
63:10 okay with that
63:12 think about that the British philosopher
63:15 who again I'm sorry cameras name but
63:19 some of you guys are gonna shout it out
63:20 the screen there but if that guy died
63:23 and all sudden it's a wonderful place on
63:25 the other side he realized but he spent
63:27 a fair majority of his life preaching
63:30 against something that wasn't true
63:32 how many preachers of Christianity will
63:34 die and find out that Jesus never
63:36 existed they find out the message was
63:39 beautiful and they didn't hurt anyone by
63:41 using fiction to help inspire now again
63:45 there's truth and the parables but those
63:47 parables were written by Egyptians a
63:49 good five to fifty thousand years before
63:52 Christ ever repeated them and he never
63:53 said that he wrote them he just gave us
63:56 the story of the particle son and all
63:58 those different analogies for why we
64:01 should treat people good right as the
64:03 Douglas had said two thousand years
64:07 after one man was nailed to a tree for
64:11 suggesting that we should be nice to
64:12 each other
64:12 I do want to reshare something with you
64:16 to that is uh came to be in the last
64:19 year which is a good friend of mine said
64:22 that she had had two male friends of
64:26 hers died and come back to life they
64:31 were in accidents they were in medical
64:33 procedures they died they had the whole
64:36 floating above their body thing they had
64:39 the flu
64:40 coming up and into a world experience I
64:44 believe she said that at least one of
64:46 them had no faith whatsoever but they
64:50 were they were restored and sent back
64:55 down right their bodies were fixed and
64:57 they were sent back down to earth and
65:00 she said to me that both of them were
65:04 angry they described her to guys that
65:07 don't know each other
65:08 describe to her the same thing that they
65:10 were very angry they were put back down
65:13 on earth and I saw it stopped her in the
65:18 middle of telling me this story and
65:19 suspecting what the answer might be and
65:21 I said well why and she said because
65:25 where they went was painless and
65:29 wonderful and they wanted to stay but
65:34 they were put back down in their broken
65:35 bodies to suffer through the healing
65:38 process now of course it might be that
65:41 both of them find out that there's
65:42 wonderful things that they are were yet
65:45 to experience that they will finally
65:47 enjoy life as we know it as human beings
65:51 but both of them felt this place either
65:55 one of them saw Jesus Christ neither one
65:57 of them saw a tunnel of light I think
65:59 that's fascinating I think that's the
66:05 most illogical take on a near-death
66:09 experience or life after death
66:12 experience that I've ever heard told
66:16 because there's all these specials on
66:18 the internet again one's been done the
66:20 last five years it's all HD and there's
66:22 just some amazing freakin stories with
66:25 doctors dying and going up very logical
66:29 minds going up that wouldn't normally
66:31 believe that any of this is possible
66:32 right and they came back to life and
66:35 they had these incredible stories being
66:36 on the other side no one sees
66:38 Christianity that's what's interesting
66:39 sure some people have I just haven't
66:41 heard about it and again just to button
66:44 it up at the end here the individuals
66:48 that are born that the children that are
66:50 born that know about their previous life
66:54 and they get taken to villages and their
66:55 name and names and they know who's who
66:57 and that's a little conclusive for me
67:01 that there's a recycling going on as
67:04 well you can come back you can come back
67:06 right away you can come back whenever
67:08 if waltz truly in Disneyland that he
67:11 hasn't come back in my timeline right or
67:13 maybe he has maybe we're one like I
67:17 always say right if you were sitting
67:20 with me and you were ill and you feared
67:22 potentially the illness that you have is
67:25 going to take your life I would
67:28 definitely go through this with you and
67:31 try to comfort you into realizing well
67:34 first and foremost maybe you're okay
67:37 maybe you're gonna pull through this
67:39 whole thing so don't worry too much
67:41 about the end because let's concentrate
67:42 on being alive we've had absolute I
67:46 think unequivocal proof that your desire
67:49 to live contributes greatly to your
67:51 survival it's almost as if gods like are
67:55 you done yet no man I'm not done yet
67:57 okay just checking
67:58 because as long as you're not done I'm
68:00 gonna give you the healing power that
68:02 you need which I gave you when you were
68:04 born to manifest the immune system to
68:08 fight something the regeneration that
68:09 you need to heal yourself etc etc the
68:14 second chair ready I know it's gonna be
68:16 a little freaky it's like being born you
68:18 go through that bad aperture of your mom
68:21 it's a little weird you're going from
68:23 this warm state of being inside your mom
68:25 for however many months and then you pop
68:28 out and it's cold and there's much
68:30 people looking at you there in light
68:31 there's all kinds of new senses turning
68:34 on whole new paradigms you have to learn
68:36 or relearn but I think that the
68:39 afterlife is or the passage to the other
68:43 side is very well manicured it seems to
68:48 please people you don't get a lot of
68:52 life after death experiences being
68:55 documented there's that one Satan guy
68:57 saint worshipper in New York that talked
69:01 about having a really bad experience I
69:03 don't I think he was dying he just
69:06 thought he went to hell and met Jesus
69:07 who saved him from the devil or whatever
69:09 but again that that dude is swimming
69:12 24/7 inside of his religious paradigm
69:15 right in believing in the devil and
69:18 thinking that he was becoming super
69:20 important and powerful believing in the
69:23 devil he acknowledged the existence of
69:26 Christ inadvertently because he's he's
69:28 adhering to a discipline that has both a
69:32 yin and a yang
69:33 and so by him worshiping perhaps the
69:36 yang the yang was forced to exist right
69:38 so it might have been a metaphor given
69:42 to him by a celestial intelligence this
69:47 is okay we got to teach this guy a
69:48 lesson
69:49 he really doesn't want to be involved
69:51 with all this Satan worshipping [ __ ] we
69:53 can just look into his soul and we can
69:54 see how terrified he is of the world in
69:56 general which is why he went with the
69:58 tough-guy [ __ ] and worshipping the
70:00 devil right it gave this tender little
70:03 childish soul power in his own mind and
70:06 so we're gonna speak to him in the
70:08 metaphors that he understands he
70:10 believes in Jesus and he believes in the
70:12 devil there we go there's the characters
70:14 in the movie that he needs to see to be
70:16 persuaded one way or the other where his
70:18 loyalties lie if you think about it it's
70:21 very simple it's good and it's evil we
70:24 define those things as human beings
70:26 right by the way one of my proudest
70:29 episodes is called good and evil
70:32 and the theme of it is is that and
70:36 everything that is perceived to be evil
70:39 there's an amazing thing that happens
70:42 that goodness can come out of those
70:43 things right one of my old analogies
70:47 when I was 19 years old and working on
70:49 this book about that exact subject
70:52 totally fictional but I debated in my
70:55 church group with the guy that was very
71:01 into those paradigms and I said well
71:03 maybe the devil doesn't exist because
71:04 what are you talking about and I said
71:05 well think about it I said because we
71:08 had just had the 89 earthquake in San
71:10 Francisco I was still in the South
71:12 Southern California Ventura County area
71:14 and I said you know when that freeway
71:17 dropped and killed all those people
71:19 you know it's an act of nature it's not
71:22 like the devil came down and went whoo
71:23 everyone dies right but I said there are
71:27 stories already that people have met
71:29 each other and become romantically
71:31 involved as a result of the rescue you
71:34 know they're first responders there's a
71:36 man that met his wife who was a
71:38 paramedic and they at the time we're
71:42 starting to live happily ever after
71:44 and so I said everybody who lost someone
71:47 is grieving and thinking perhaps this is
71:51 some act of an evil force and then the
71:54 other folks are thinking this is the
71:55 best thing that ever happened to them
71:57 because out of the strategy tragedy came
72:00 bliss and almost instantaneously I saw
72:05 this guy he's probably by 28 at the time
72:06 and he's like oh my god you're right
72:08 he's like and he started debating with
72:11 his best friend who was the new youth
72:13 minister he turned into a pedophile and
72:16 he said well maybe he's right man maybe
72:18 the devil doesn't exist
72:19 it started pissed on off his buddy
72:21 because his buddy was again so terrified
72:24 of life that he had adopted these
72:26 paradigms to solve all of his problems
72:29 right not very not very unique in that
72:32 story arc right but now one last thing
72:36 before we totally closed off because I
72:38 want to speak to those of you who at the
72:40 end of this episode still believe that
72:42 life is over when you die
72:44 all right that's nothing wrong with that
72:46 you have your own beliefs it's cool now
72:49 depending on what kind of person you are
72:51 I will speak from my own perspective if
72:56 I thought this was it I'm gonna die and
72:59 that's it
72:59 I would probably live my life a little
73:02 bit different because this would be the
73:04 first and last time that I would ever
73:07 exist ever now I do tend to to treat it
73:12 like that because I I believe in
73:14 reincarnation but I still believe that
73:16 I've been constructed out of extremely
73:20 fortunate events to be Who I am today I
73:24 think I've been very lucky I think most
73:27 of us are right I would live life to the
73:31 absolute
73:33 some the pinnacle of everything that I
73:37 would ever have strip strove to achieve
73:42 and against the way you see it and I
73:45 hope that any of you that do believe
73:46 that this it are pumping life for
73:49 everything it has right regardless of
73:53 that eventuality of the finality of
73:56 having nothing after this life I I know
74:00 that you have touched people and that
74:03 despite perhaps a goal of not wanting to
74:07 live after this life that you will live
74:10 after this life because of your
74:11 contribution to humanity so just keep
74:14 that in mind as you think about your
74:17 passing and perhaps you've never doubted
74:19 that but that's a cool little mechanism
74:22 that's sort of built into reality I
74:23 think will help you feel me for those of
74:27 you who haven't been to deep thoughts
74:29 radio.com please go it's where you can
74:31 change formats from audio to video video
74:33 to audio there's a lakh Facebook group
74:35 which is a lot of fun you ever just
74:37 wanted a feed in your Facebook that's
74:38 just fun to read or having more fun with
74:41 anything so as we debate our belief
74:44 system we use memes that are very funny
74:46 to do such a thing so it's a really soft
74:49 way of seeing other people's belief
74:51 systems and we just have a really really
74:54 good group of folks so I definitely
74:56 encourage you to get over there for
74:58 those of you want to get sort of the
75:01 inside scoop or the previews to the show
75:04 you can donate a dollar or more to
75:06 patreon there's a link up there for that
75:08 there's also a little store and that's
75:12 about it so until next time take care of
75:15 yourself and someone else and I will see
75:17 you in the next deep thoughts over now
75:19 [Music]
75:28 you
