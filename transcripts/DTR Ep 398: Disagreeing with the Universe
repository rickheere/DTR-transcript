00:00 [Music]
00:26 oh man looks like we're gonna have
00:35 another one of these super shadowy
00:39 episodes it's the only drawback of this
00:43 filter let's shut the old cellphone up
00:48 so today we're gonna have an episode
00:51 that's gonna go pretty existential but I
00:55 have to tell you guys and I think some
00:57 of you are just like me these are the
00:59 episodes you love to get into real life
01:03 becomes a little less mathematical you
01:07 know being right and wrong it's such a
01:09 pain in the ass to figure out and
01:11 sometimes we want to go to a place where
01:13 there is no right or wrong it's just a
01:14 discussion it's a discussion about how
01:17 to perhaps live our lives and welcome
01:22 back to deep thoughts so I got these
01:25 episodes ready to go for the last 10
01:28 here and I'm down three it's gonna be
01:31 one of the last three I'm gonna end on
01:34 the Einstein one but this one comes from
01:38 a very smart man some of you might roll
01:43 your eyes but you shouldn't
01:45 his name is l ron Hubbard and I have
01:51 friends that are very versed in his
01:53 teachings I have some friends that are
01:59 part of his thing and what's cool is if
02:02 you have an open mind it's pretty
02:06 orgasmic to listen to some of the
02:08 concepts this guy harvested because the
02:10 way that it's documented even by him is
02:13 he went out he researched everything
02:16 that made sense to him
02:17 pull it up put it all together and then
02:20 drew his own conclusions and wrote his
02:22 own writings about the connections of a
02:24 ton of Technology mental technology
02:28 mainly fully that guy had invented some
02:31 hardware that would be cool that way
02:34 people probably lay off a little bit
02:37 maybe next season we'll do a
02:40 little episode about him but I heard
02:42 this phrase that came out of his journey
02:46 and it just struck me as beyond
02:49 brilliant and it's called disagreeing
02:52 with the universe
02:54 and you know it's what I love about this
03:00 thing that's about to happen right now
03:02 is that you hear these kind of profound
03:05 statements disagreeing with the universe
03:07 people will string together words I know
03:10 a few folks that post you know they try
03:12 to post extremely profound things on
03:15 their Facebook feeds and you can just
03:20 see them trying so hard to be super deep
03:24 and it's good because they will get deep
03:25 trying to be deep they'll eventually
03:27 succeed and you know you swing at the
03:30 bat so get the ball excuse me with the
03:31 bat enough times and you're gonna hit a
03:34 home run you're gonna hit a ground ball
03:36 you're gonna hit everything that's
03:38 awesome you will do it so definitely
03:39 keep going but what this means at least
03:44 as I have interpreted it is when you
03:48 disagree with the universe that's when
03:50 creation happens and I've often said to
03:54 you guys because like way back in season
03:57 one I definitely season two the phrase I
04:02 use is doing a 90 degree turn on the way
04:06 that you think and that's really a
04:09 physical version of saying disagreeing
04:12 with the universe now we've talked about
04:15 the whole Joseph Campbell thing when it
04:18 comes to him uncovering one of the first
04:20 stories of creation which was described
04:23 as God waking up and then a nervous
04:25 explosion and we are all the pieces of
04:28 God that floated all over the universe
04:29 and if you think about walking in unison
04:34 or being together in some phalanx you
04:38 know thing we're all together covering
04:41 each other's backs and if we had just
04:45 simply decide if we do decide at some
04:47 point to walk away from that formation
04:49 in perpendicular directions
04:54 then we have this sort of explosion of
04:58 creation of change and here's what's
05:03 interesting because I have had numerous
05:07 conversations with listeners and
05:08 obviously my own personal friends and
05:10 family mostly friends and people will
05:14 say mana you know I'm in this rut I'm in
05:16 this rut in life and I'm trying to
05:17 figure out how to get out of it or I
05:21 guess someone going I'm totally content
05:23 but I'm bored to death or someone is
05:27 further out into the universe and an
05:28 existential manner going what do you
05:30 think we are men what do you think we
05:32 are what do you think the purpose of
05:33 this place is and it may have dawned on
05:36 me during this show or a little bit
05:38 before but you know my answer to myself
05:41 these days is to say we're not here to
05:46 be trivial would you go to a rock
05:49 concert with or a concert of any musical
05:52 quality whatsoever a composition with
05:54 one note you just walked in to the
05:57 theaters just off
05:59 and it's just that and it never changes
06:02 and you just sit there and there's I
06:05 don't know maybe 50 people on stage
06:08 they're all playing the same note with
06:10 the same instrument perhaps you're
06:13 standing some weird weird thing from
06:16 rotschild party now we don't we want to
06:19 hear variety we want to hear a brand new
06:22 combination of attack indicate decay new
06:26 melodies new setups etc etc because we
06:32 are creatures that have been designed to
06:35 cancel out patterns walk into a room and
06:39 it smells bad and after 2 3 minutes you
06:44 can't smell it anymore because your mind
06:47 is canceling out the pattern take a drug
06:49 over and over and over and over again
06:51 and you'll need more and more and more
06:52 to the point that it doesn't work
06:55 anymore
06:56 because your body's canceling out
06:58 repetition and so how do you stop
07:02 repetition how do you stop the mundane
07:04 existence the Nirvana of hell how do you
07:07 stop it you disagree with the universe
07:10 to continue down that path it's a
07:14 definition of insanity keep doing the
07:17 same thing expecting something to change
07:19 doesn't work many people been down that
07:21 road before right I love the notion of
07:26 disagreeing with the universe and the
07:29 reason why is it as extremely tangible
07:32 for the brain in my opinion if I told
07:34 you that thing back I used to say in the
07:36 second season or whatever that 90 degree
07:38 return in thinking there is a point to
07:42 that because this statement was made you
07:48 know it was my interpretation of my oh
07:50 my buddy said me designs futuristic
07:52 stuff the dude looks at normal reality
07:55 which is that that single note at the
07:57 concert and he looks at it and he looks
08:00 at and he thinks about it and he sees he
08:02 tries to completely understand why a
08:04 certain design principle was endorsed
08:08 and then he goes okay I'm gonna go in a
08:11 different direction
08:13 but I want this to be a direction that
08:14 is new that blows your mind a little bit
08:17 and so he experiments again before he
08:20 finishes
08:21 even his thumbnails he's done a thousand
08:23 little thumbnail drawings usually
08:26 probably about ten super-intense
08:29 drawings to figure out which ways the
08:31 best way and when he finds the best way
08:34 he takes it now what you think about
08:37 that for a second and think about
08:38 disagreeing with the universe for a
08:39 second what do kids do when they hit the
08:43 rite of passage
08:44 they disagree with their parents they
08:47 changed the vector of behaving into a
08:49 vector of absolute chaos that's where we
08:51 got you know all these different things
08:54 you know usually it was funny as I think
08:56 America had gotten to a point where they
08:58 were able to repress a lot of the rite
09:00 of passage changes because I don't have
09:03 I don't have stories from my
09:07 grandparents or didn't have stories of
09:08 my grandparents about them misbehaving
09:11 in their teens and and doing things
09:14 crazy I'm sure it happened but I do have
09:18 that from kids in the 60s a little bit
09:23 lots of kids in the 70s I was in the 80s
09:25 and so you know we had punk rock and you
09:29 know just hate the establishment because
09:31 it is the establishment it's time for
09:33 renewal it's almost a not a permanent
09:37 thing where it is um we're going to stay
09:40 change forever but it's like we must
09:43 disagree with you to determine whether
09:47 or not there is something better out
09:48 there because the kids were raised into
09:52 the single note concert of their parents
09:55 the pattern just keeps repeating and
09:57 repeating and they're like look man no
09:59 no offense but my genetics for Mike
10:04 Reider were designed to change but if
10:08 evolution was partially true and it was
10:10 it was fueled simply by the need for
10:13 things to evolve and change and it was
10:15 not it's not a change by the the day
10:21 Lamarck epigenetics formula of your
10:26 you'd think your way into a different
10:28 thing and because we have to change you
10:31 think your way into a different state of
10:33 physical being and mental being but it
10:36 is something that's rudimentary into our
10:38 design because the universe is a very
10:41 fluid thing disagreeing with the
10:47 universe now just you know riffing an
10:50 essay here with you guys what I wouldn't
10:54 personally do with thinking about that
10:56 and again I haven't jumped into any of
10:58 his element Hubbard's
10:59 super detailed concepts about that it is
11:03 sometimes possible to disagree with a
11:07 universe and try something brand new
11:09 that is absolutely chaotic because you
11:11 can't get hurt sometimes messing around
11:16 get you killed like instantaneously so
11:19 you'll want to assess your world and
11:22 find out where you can be exploratory
11:27 without losing something very valuable
11:30 to you it could be your life it could be
11:32 your money
11:33 it could be loyalty and respect from
11:35 someone like if you went on to a dance
11:39 floor and you're like hey I'm tired of
11:41 all this stuff that we do I'm just gonna
11:47 dance funky funky and just do something
11:50 totally brand new whatever it is you're
11:53 probably alright and do it yourself then
11:55 the two-dimensional plane that is the
11:57 dance floor knock yourself out if you're
12:00 like oh I hate my state of mind and I'm
12:03 gonna start taking drugs to really you
12:07 know go to different states of being I
12:10 mean definitely do your research as
12:12 ayahuasca okay is acid okay you know
12:15 what are the repercussions talk to
12:17 people that have done a lot find out
12:19 which people are how many experiences
12:21 that people have in certain drugs and
12:23 then you can say of the descriptions I
12:27 have heard this particular experience is
12:32 the one that I think I want to have to
12:33 and you know you'll find people I met a
12:36 guy
12:38 who runs a big ayahuasca situation down
12:43 here in Los Angeles he actually lives in
12:44 the Bay Area it's interesting but he's
12:47 been on thousands and thousands of trips
12:50 and he's fine he's very brilliant guy
12:53 but now is there an inverse value to
12:57 this algorithm of sort of explosive
13:02 change to your life you know and and
13:06 let's let's be honest you don't have to
13:08 go ninety degree turn to something to
13:10 create a significant amount of change in
13:11 your life you could simply change a
13:14 degree half a degree something super
13:17 tiny and you know like we always say you
13:19 know one of the reasons why we don't
13:20 think nASA has ever been anywhere they
13:22 say they've been outside of low orbit is
13:24 that when you launch yourself towards a
13:27 planet or someplace in space it's so far
13:32 away you know over a hundred million
13:35 miles away in some cases that if you
13:37 were off you know ten decimal places or
13:42 ten places beyond the decimal by the
13:45 time you get there you're not there it's
13:47 not there you're not there you're in the
13:48 wrong place and we simply do not have
13:50 that level of precision in any of the
13:53 instrumentalities here on earth
13:54 therefore throwing a giant bus at Mars
13:59 is probably not going to work Plus Mars
14:01 is going way faster than we can ever
14:03 catch up with the slingshot theory no
14:08 slingshot theory so you don't have to go
14:12 completely crazy but now think about
14:13 this there's a lot of pressure and I've
14:16 criticized a lot of the pressure to
14:18 change society simply because it's a
14:21 norm that we do it what we hurt in now
14:25 is an atrocious 10-year cycle thing
14:28 every 10 years everything has to change
14:30 drastically your clothing is supposed to
14:32 change although it doesn't you know your
14:34 music is supposed to change you know it
14:36 does it just gets worse and worse right
14:38 we the [ __ ] studios it's unbelievable
14:41 they get more and more tone-deaf singers
14:44 that have no ability to write a melody
14:47 sing to a melody write any lyrics that
14:50 have any meaning it's
14:51 just really super sad I had a kid to set
14:54 next to me other day 28 years old and he
14:55 goes he goes man it was like I think
14:59 that all the best musics already been
15:01 written I think it's all in the 70s and
15:05 I said man I know that's not true but I
15:08 understand why it feels like it's true
15:10 man will prevail gins II might pause
15:13 some pretty awesome stuff I have a lot
15:15 of high hopes for them and a 14 year old
15:18 girl shredding guitars I believe
15:20 something's coming but you could stay in
15:24 your lane as Shadowmoon would say you
15:30 could stay in your lane and by looking
15:33 at change and the potential change that
15:36 you could have done and because you
15:39 disagree with that path you say I
15:42 strategically chose the path that I'm on
15:45 and I will not be guilted guilt-tripped
15:47 into changing my path simply because the
15:49 10-year mark rolled around I don't need
15:52 to change this or change that now you
15:55 know it's your philosophy as to why you
15:57 would choose that some folks believe
15:58 well I need to move up with the times
16:01 because I don't want to find myself some
16:02 fossil that is hated by all the kids and
16:04 all the people and dah dah dah and you
16:06 know the way I do it is just add another
16:09 chapter to your book don't start heating
16:13 Led Zeppelin because you dig Kanye
16:16 West's next thing
16:18 just keep your Led Zepplin chapter and
16:20 keep your other chapters and go this I'm
16:23 actually benefitting more because I have
16:25 more chapters to my book more things
16:27 that I love I jump deep into it you know
16:30 you can do
16:34 michael jackson off the wall and then
16:37 jump into prodigy and then whatever do a
16:41 little bit of devil worshipping katy
16:42 perry stuff right what we're always
16:46 trying to do is figure out what path
16:47 that were on and whether or not when you
16:50 started becoming awake and awake is
16:53 obviously multiple definitions you could
16:55 become sentient and enlighten to your
16:57 own existence and sort of an existential
16:59 way it's you and the universe and you're
17:02 becoming more aware of what you are in
17:05 respect to the universe and then there
17:07 could be this whole political you know
17:09 cabal thing wake up which is the truth
17:12 movement that kind of stuff we don't
17:15 have to worry about the truth movement
17:17 in this conversation at all this is
17:19 between you and the universe but
17:22 sometimes you wake up and you're like am
17:24 i doing the right thing am i doing the
17:26 best thing I could possibly do sometimes
17:30 you'll feel certain that you are and
17:32 sometimes you'll be utterly excited that
17:36 you're not and you'll be like oh I got
17:40 time I got a brain and you know I got
17:44 people who love me and resources and
17:46 what I want to do doesn't necessarily
17:48 cost a ton of money it's just me
17:49 researching something a lot of times
17:52 it'll be how do you manifest a thought
17:54 in your brain you know I went through
17:56 the whole thing with I think therefore I
17:58 am from decart it's a huge little thing
18:01 you know the more you can contemplate it
18:06 it's fun it's fun to sit and think and
18:09 come in one you could be the next to
18:12 cart you could be the next philosopher
18:15 you know what I think is really really
18:17 strange in all my travels and all my
18:21 readings and all the conversations that
18:23 I've ever had with anyone I don't know
18:27 and please help me if this is something
18:30 you know about where are the great
18:32 female philosophers of the world they're
18:37 the female the right brain native isn't
18:42 philosophy tremendously reliance on a
18:45 right brain interpretation of the
18:47 abstract
18:48 of reality why wouldn't females be
18:51 cranking out philosophy books with I
18:55 mean for years I mean no one can stop a
18:57 woman regardless if she's repressed from
18:59 sitting at home and writing down her
19:03 thoughts we have all kinds of amazing
19:06 female authors scientists Madame Curie
19:12 the first woman to find a moth and a
19:14 switch in an old computer she was the
19:17 reason that we call a software bug
19:20 because she put a little piece of tape
19:22 on it and wrote bug trying to bug in the
19:24 computer
19:26 there's the women that helped the
19:29 Manhattan Project help the Apollo
19:32 project I mean they're there everywhere
19:35 so there's no shortage of genius women
19:37 throughout history but where are and I I
19:39 dunno I wouldn't say they're
19:43 philosophers but I know some some old
19:47 writing there's the woman who used to
19:48 hang out with I think it Aleister
19:50 Crowley used to study her and she was
19:54 sort of eugenics lady but you know at
19:55 least we can look at her and you're
19:57 smart you know don't don't agree with
19:59 your philosophy of what to do with
20:00 humanity but whatever but that whole
20:03 saying if you don't know where you're
20:04 going if you don't know where you've
20:06 been and I think that disagreeing with
20:09 the universe is a beautiful summation of
20:11 that entire thought process which is to
20:13 say what change would you make if you
20:15 didn't know what you've been doing
20:18 like let's just say remember the concert
20:21 analogy there's a concert going on in
20:23 the next room and it's a one-note
20:24 concert now I've got you in a soundproof
20:29 lobby you can't hear that note and I say
20:33 to you there's a one-note concert going
20:36 in in that room next door your
20:39 responsibility is to change the note now
20:43 I in this room without hearing what's in
20:45 that room I want you to write the next
20:47 concert and you might sit there and go
20:50 well what's the note I'm not gonna tell
20:54 you that's the past I'm not going to
20:58 tell you but you better not use that
21:00 note
21:01 you only get one note to write the new
21:02 concert and it would be this logic loop
21:05 of like I have to know what's in that
21:06 room so that I don't repeat it and
21:08 that's a crude crude analogy of if you
21:12 don't know where you've been the past
21:13 you don't know what to do with your
21:15 future history is now in a profound
21:19 level of utter ignorance and repeating
21:23 itself we have these [ __ ] leftist
21:26 socialist people the extremists running
21:31 around pitching you everything the Nazis
21:34 pitched you everything every major
21:37 dictator has ever done in history which
21:39 is to take away all of your abilities to
21:40 protect yourself with weaponry and
21:42 promise you all these social programs
21:45 that are never going to work
21:46 they're never gonna work the Bernie
21:50 Sanders the aoc s they're nuts
21:52 they're [ __ ] nuts people they're
21:54 stupid you know supposedly again she
21:57 graduated in this huge level of academia
22:01 and doesn't know what a garbage disposal
22:03 is I mean seriously it's not because she
22:06 was poor she wasn't raised poor okay she
22:09 just like so didn't like pay attention
22:10 to like the world and stuff but that's
22:13 why this is occurring again and the
22:16 people and the thing is is we have nuts
22:18 all over the world you know crazy people
22:20 people who are stupid people who are
22:22 ignorant but if we don't have a whole
22:24 society of these morons then they just
22:28 stick out like a sore thumb they're just
22:29 the person talking to themselves
22:31 screaming and yelling and walking down
22:33 the street and everyone's just like oh
22:35 gosh I wish I could help that person but
22:36 I can't but we have people following
22:39 these people in the millions and that
22:41 means at the level of education that has
22:43 been around now for the last 20 years is
22:45 so absolutely poor and the benefits of
22:51 being an adult and getting an education
22:52 and the jobs have been so scarce at
22:56 least in America that the suffering is
22:59 really high and so they're willing to
23:02 attach themselves to these perceived
23:05 life vests these parachutes that say oh
23:08 god I can't figure out how to pay my
23:10 rent so sure socialistic programs and
23:12 mandatory [ __ ] incomes
23:15 just just gross and I have friends of
23:19 mine that believe in some of this stuff
23:21 not the whole kit and caboodle and
23:23 they're extremely successful people they
23:25 have never sucked the Ted of anybody but
23:28 now they're talking about universal
23:29 income and all this other stuff and I'm
23:31 liking really how do you get there man
23:34 how do you [ __ ] get there from here
23:37 they don't know their past so now we're
23:41 sitting here repeating reprehensible
23:44 segments of history part of what I think
23:47 we might use with this saber because I
23:50 promised we wouldn't go off on current
23:51 affairs but this whole thing about
23:53 disagreeing with the universe to bring
23:56 it back down to you personally is you
23:59 want to effect change on your life you
24:03 want something wonderful to happen
24:04 I want something wonderful to happen for
24:06 you too I mean if tomorrow I was broke
24:10 as a joke I'm living in a ditch I can't
24:13 even afford to make a show but I got
24:16 little postcards from you guys saying
24:17 life is great I just sit there and die
24:21 in a ditch with a huge smile on my face
24:22 and go hell yeah
24:24 whether I contributed to your posit you
24:26 know your new positive state or not
24:28 wouldn't matter to me the fact that
24:30 you're happy means that the world is
24:33 gonna go on and the world is gonna be
24:35 great and I totally have my belief
24:38 system worked out for the afterlife it's
24:40 got a big slice of unknown and it's got
24:43 a big slice of probably in my brain but
24:46 it has zero suffering I think it's gonna
24:50 be potentially more challenging than we
24:53 think but I do hope there's a green room
24:55 up there where we can kind of just chill
24:58 it's like you know when you see these
25:00 concerts from these musicians for me the
25:03 analogy might be you know van Halen back
25:06 in the heyday and they just pulled off a
25:08 two-hour concert another going backstage
25:11 they're sweaty and they're just toweling
25:14 off and they're done for the night the
25:16 audience is going nuts they know they
25:19 performed all their songs to the best of
25:21 their ability now they're just gonna
25:24 crawl into a bus and go home
25:27 enjoy the
25:29 fruit or go to the next location or
25:31 whatever it is maybe it's the end of the
25:33 tour maybe that would be a good analogy
25:35 for the end of life they know they're
25:38 gonna write another album they know
25:39 they're gonna go back out on tour but
25:42 they get a bit of a break I sort of hope
25:46 that's what the ends like from becoming
25:48 you know from being a human to protect
25:50 potentially coming back in as a human or
25:52 whatever no fears no fears at all so I
26:00 you know I've had several episodes over
26:02 the last four years talking about us
26:06 forging the universe my old episode
26:11 creating the universe there's the other
26:14 one origins of man and the answer these
26:19 are all based on the notion that we
26:22 created the universe that this was an
26:25 imperative that something like this
26:26 occurred and we're always interested in
26:29 you as human beings in perceiving things
26:32 or at least spectating things that are
26:37 just precise and beautiful how chaos
26:40 came together to create a wonderful
26:41 thing or experience you know some of you
26:46 have been to events in your life could
26:49 be a concert a wedding an amusement park
26:53 whatever a date you spend the night with
26:57 somebody you love and those moments
27:00 become those cherished moments in your
27:02 life for like my god everything came
27:04 together perfectly you know you could
27:07 have been your first love could been
27:09 yesterday and so we have this weird
27:13 appreciation for those moments without
27:15 anyone telling us hey okay here kids
27:18 what you do you're gonna get yourself a
27:20 good gal and you're gonna be you know
27:23 chivalrous to her you're gonna open the
27:26 door and do all this other stuff so this
27:28 one exact moment can occur you're gonna
27:30 fall in love with you're gonna
27:31 appreciate her and whatever the hell she
27:33 wants whatever the hell you want you're
27:34 gonna go to a cool location you set it
27:36 up and just have these amazing things
27:37 and whatever says that they say bits and
27:41 pieces of that but they don't put it all
27:42 the other such that you have these
27:44 historic honeymoons anymore I'm not sure
27:49 the honeymoons really have the punch
27:52 they used to have maybe in other parts
27:56 of the world but I mean lots of parts of
27:58 the world honeymoons are arranged
27:59 weddings how weird is that
28:02 yeah I never met you before now I'm
28:05 gonna pork you isn't that a little weird
28:07 well maybe that's a huge turn-on because
28:11 the thing is is how could you make me
28:12 call it making love you ever you met
28:14 this person before I love you cuz my
28:17 parents said so and your parents said so
28:20 I talked about it's funny I found the
28:23 hill episode where I mentioned driving a
28:25 Lamborghini for almost six months
28:29 and from time to time and I kept saying
28:32 hurricane
28:33 it's a Huracan but I got a chance to
28:35 drive one of those cars on and off and
28:39 again I'm not a big car guy I'm just not
28:43 you know I definitely had my mind
28:45 changed a little bit in terms of at
28:47 least that particular vehicle but the
28:50 first time I got behind the wheel of a
28:53 2016 Huracan it was it was a religious
28:59 experience and it wasn't because hey
29:02 look at me I'm driving a fancy car at
29:04 all in fact that made me a little
29:06 nervous first time I ever drove when I
29:09 drove it right through la traffic and I
29:11 drove it for like 35 miles in GM traffic
29:15 in LA and just imagine you know you're
29:17 worried about making making a personal
29:20 mistake to hurt the car it's like a
29:22 $250,000 car but then you're worried
29:25 about other people hitting you because
29:26 they're looking at you so there's
29:27 there's kind of a love-hate relationship
29:31 with that old thing but I'm looking at
29:32 the precision of this vehicle I'm
29:34 operating this vehicle I am feeling it
29:37 go from 40 to 80 in a matter of split
29:43 seconds it felt good it you know it
29:46 hugged the Road perfectly the command
29:48 center inside this car was a spaceship
29:52 that's all I can say I mean it was like
29:54 you know flip switches in the
29:56 goes underneath to start the car to back
29:58 up you know and it just just the the
30:01 freakin controls for the blinker which
30:03 are a little bit like a motorcycle
30:05 everything was amazing
30:07 plus I was dropping I was driving in
30:09 like the basic mode don't you punch it
30:11 up to the race mode it's like you know
30:13 the engines gurgling and this is oh my
30:16 god it was a tremendous experience and
30:18 it was very inspiring for me personally
30:21 to say okay maybe you do want to make
30:23 enough money to have something of this
30:26 utter perfection in your life and again
30:29 it's not a boastful thing is you want to
30:31 be around a keystone of this level of
30:35 perfection created in Italy by master
30:39 engineers master designers master
30:41 thinkers such that when you sit in this
30:45 it harmonizes its frequency to you such
30:50 that you will then exude that frequency
30:52 to the outside world if everything I did
30:54 in my life from a personal relationship
30:57 to a technical invention exude the
31:00 perfection of this car I would be famous
31:05 for being amazing you know and so that's
31:08 a very rare thing to have something that
31:10 inspiring and it was very inspiring for
31:13 me but now let's let's back up that
31:16 whole experience and look at what it
31:20 would take for me to achieve that kind
31:23 of wealth I would have to disagree with
31:26 the universe to create that change in my
31:29 life to go well I go into this you know
31:34 got this cycle of things that I do and
31:37 so you know one of the things I do
31:40 obviously is I screen right and so for
31:42 me if I come up with another script that
31:45 just blows everybody's mind then I can
31:48 go back into what I do
31:50 it's like prints writing music he still
31:52 wrote music and blew our mind album
31:54 after album after album a single after
31:56 single after single so you could be in
31:58 sort of this machine but the machine
32:00 itself cranks out a new fortune cookie
32:03 and the fortune cookie is different
32:04 every time and it will take you down a
32:06 different path
32:08 but I think the following this is one of
32:12 the reasons I want to get into this
32:14 episode in the subject matter is that I
32:16 don't think or excuse me I think that
32:18 people believe or don't know that they
32:22 can disagree with the universe and I
32:26 think if I said that to young people it
32:29 might just go right over their head
32:30 although hopefully the new generation it
32:33 doesn't but they may believe that I'm
32:36 talking about disagreeing with their
32:38 parents instead of just philosophically
32:42 engaging the universe at a different
32:44 level now obviously as a child you have
32:46 massive influence from your parental
32:47 units and hopefully you have good
32:49 parents and respecting what they say
32:52 benefits you greatly and then you're
32:55 disagreeing with the universe is merely
32:57 building a wing on the side of the house
32:59 that's already really valuable to begin
33:01 with because you've got a good
33:02 foundation that some folks it seems to
33:05 be a growing thing in Gen X and
33:08 Millennials where their parents are
33:11 shitty parents I know of situations
33:16 where one parents got their crap
33:18 together the parent doesn't they're not
33:20 together and the parent that doesn't
33:22 have their crap together is envious or
33:25 self-loathing and then demonizes the
33:27 other parent so that the kid who spends
33:31 most of time with that parent starts to
33:33 adopt that you know that infantile
33:36 thinking and then they cut themselves
33:40 off from a parent that's actually
33:42 willing to give them the knowledge that
33:43 they actually seek and to the degree
33:46 that they adopt this stupid theory I've
33:49 seen kids really suffer everything that
33:53 they want to achieve the one parent
33:56 could give them the keys to their life
33:58 not the parents personal goals for them
34:03 but their own goals for themselves it's
34:07 a vicious cycle which is why when you
34:09 break society it's rough you know when
34:13 you see well any of you have ever heard
34:16 an engine that's really got serious
34:18 issues in a car
34:19 and most of you have heard an engine
34:22 that's clanking they're making a weird
34:23 noise that's usually how you bring it
34:25 into the the service centers it could be
34:31 a little tiny thing that starts
34:32 destroying the entire engine back in the
34:36 day we used to have problems with
34:37 radiator caps radiator caps lose their
34:40 seal meaning their ability to hold the
34:42 pressure in the radiator the entire
34:44 engine can blow the tower engine can
34:47 vapor lock because it overheats badly
34:50 that piece that little part the little
34:53 caps about 15 bucks but it can cause
34:55 easily eight thousand dollars worth of
34:58 damage in your car depending on what
34:59 kind of car you drive my old partner he
35:04 had a car he hit it intrepid and he we
35:11 were gonna do a what we did a conference
35:14 up in la mercy I opened a San Francisco
35:17 excuse me from LA and he neglected to
35:22 repair his engine and it was running
35:24 super hot and so he said oh you know I'm
35:28 gonna drive up visit my parents and then
35:30 we'll go to this these meetings to go to
35:32 this conference and then we'll save
35:35 money and drive home in my car I said
35:39 but doesn't your car abyss you so yeah
35:40 well I just have water in the car and
35:42 you know we just keep having to just
35:43 have to watch the heat and then I poured
35:45 who water in it we're about I don't know
35:49 it's about 450 miles between us in San
35:53 Francisco I think we were 200 miles from
35:57 LA and his engine just stops and we had
36:01 been you know trying to service it and
36:02 I'm sitting I this is [ __ ] man we'll
36:05 cut you a bonus check you're a founder
36:07 of the company get your engine fixed
36:09 what's gonna cost us a grand total well
36:13 we drove the car until it utterly melted
36:16 itself it was I think 4,500 dollars
36:20 worth of damage it completely melted his
36:22 engine all the seals and rubber gaskets
36:26 melted and so it's we're on the side of
36:30 the highway the interstate 5
36:33 it's dusk and I mean it's late dusk like
36:36 we got maybe 10-15 minutes of light on
36:39 the side of the frickin highway trying
36:42 to call a wrecker
36:43 we got towed to this dealership it's I
36:46 think it was like a Friday or something
36:48 it was like they weren't gonna be open
36:50 anytime soon and I can't remember how we
36:55 got home no crazy
36:56 I just mapped it out I was like oh my
36:59 god this was the stupidest thing ever
37:01 and he personally ate the debt and it
37:06 was just you know whatever he needed to
37:09 disagree with the universe system he
37:10 needed to do right but to go back to the
37:14 point I was making 20 minutes ago
37:15 a lot of times I get approached by
37:19 individuals and the thing that they
37:22 haven't figured out is that they need to
37:24 make a radical change to their life they
37:28 will tell me all these circumstances in
37:30 their life that don't work and for those
37:33 of you who are single and you're not
37:35 married with kids boy your solution is
37:38 right there in front of your face and it
37:40 could be so exciting it doesn't matter
37:42 if you're 25 18 or 65 if you're
37:46 completely nomadic by yourself I mean
37:48 you got loved ones and friends in the
37:50 world but you know you don't live with
37:52 them you can do anything that you can
37:56 physically pull off you could say look
37:58 I'm gonna look for the job that I do in
38:01 Hawaii in Liechtenstein
38:04 you're going to look wherever the hell
38:06 you want to be just make a change maybe
38:09 just go down to the next town over maybe
38:13 you don't maybe you'd stay in your town
38:14 but you change completely what job you
38:17 work for maybe it's just changing the
38:18 company work for but you do the same
38:20 thing if you got a roommate that's a
38:22 super pain in the ass so you change what
38:26 worked before it doesn't work anymore
38:28 and so it's just time to disagree with
38:31 the universe
38:33 imagine that you're in this major
38:35 argument with somebody and it's just
38:37 getting to that pinnacle thing where
38:38 usually you flip off somebody or you say
38:43 something bad you regret instead of that
38:46 you say I think it's just time I
38:48 disagree with the universe and you walk
38:51 off but hitting the person's like I
38:53 can't even get mad at that but what the
38:55 hell does that mean you know whatever
38:57 and you're off on your new journey get a
39:00 pad and paper and a pin and design your
39:02 future I have this and I'll see if I
39:06 can't dig this out this will be kind of
39:08 a funny little thing for you guys every
39:11 time I referenced putting an image into
39:12 it one of these videos links later when
39:15 I get in the editing BAM I go god I
39:17 can't just edit this together I gotta go
39:18 find the photograph when I was a kid
39:22 let's say kid being defined as maybe 14
39:25 15 years old I drew I think it's like a
39:31 prospective drawing of my dream bedroom
39:34 and it was all based on 1980
39:38 you know perception of things but I put
39:40 a stereo in there a keyboard a computer
39:43 a bed I can't put my dresser in there
39:47 whatever and a desk it was this just
39:52 total cool laboratory and so I drew it
39:56 and I was like my fantasy thing and I
39:59 started you know I felt like I could get
40:00 it but I sort of felt like I couldn't
40:03 get it to or I was worried maybe I maybe
40:06 I'm biting off too much maybe I can't
40:08 pull this off and I probably had that by
40:12 1993 so about 10 years later I had
40:15 everything that I ever wanted and more
40:19 and that's how powerful it is to write
40:22 something down with your hand not in
40:25 some computer and another old fart you
40:29 know I live in digital worlds for too
40:32 much 99% of the time but writing it down
40:34 on paper is the manifestation of reality
40:38 because digital bits and some silicon
40:40 chip are not reality at least as we
40:44 manifested into existence
40:47 get yourself a patent paper you know
40:50 I've got these little notebooks that
40:51 have no tons of pages in it but no
40:54 writing my little journals and I always
40:57 have a pen in there and they usually
40:59 come with a little wrapper cord a little
41:02 spongy cord that holds it together and
41:05 what's funny is the ones that I have
41:07 that are like maybe a 5 by 7 I find
41:12 those a little harder to carry around
41:13 and fill up but the little tight tiny
41:15 ones that are just like I don't know
41:17 four by fives or even three by four
41:20 words whatever they are my god I'll fill
41:23 that thing up just to the point it's
41:26 finished so sometimes a little tiny
41:27 books are the best ones to carry around
41:30 find the size that works for you my
41:33 suggestion is to find one that's got
41:34 either a leather back or a faux leather
41:37 back it's got some sturdiness to it make
41:40 sure the pages inside us I'm certain is
41:41 to it and just carry that thing around
41:43 with you constantly decorate the outside
41:45 or don't whatever the hell you want it's
41:49 yours to tear up to do what you want
41:51 with write all over the place there are
41:54 no rules amen
41:56 one page you might doodle a picture and
41:59 the other one your philosophizing about
42:01 how to create a UFO or what gravity
42:03 might be your the Flat Earth and all
42:05 that kind of stuff have fun it is your
42:08 life is your creation and the more that
42:11 you express yourself into a book
42:14 personally one you're creating a really
42:16 cool little heirloom for your family or
42:18 for yourself but - what are you doing
42:21 you're experimenting with creativity and
42:24 your thought process isn't that cool
42:28 isn't that the bone in your brain you
42:29 want to actually manifest skills into if
42:32 you're creative on paper and these two
42:35 dimensional planes of ink and and
42:37 whatever paint you mean you could get
42:41 paint on paint in your book who gives a
42:42 [ __ ] right it's yours it's your life men
42:44 it's your little world you see it all
42:47 the time in movies
42:48 you're probably like oh that's really
42:49 cool he or she had this diary and isn't
42:53 that neat and then you get home and
42:55 you're like I don't do that do it
42:57 disagree with the universe do something
43:00 new manifest and you know I listen to
43:06 these episodes back and I have to say
43:08 the thing I rarely mentioned I do
43:12 mention it from time to time but if you
43:16 are absolutely content with your life
43:18 the way it is please feel no pressure by
43:20 these episodes to make any changes it's
43:23 cool if you're cool man is that you're
43:25 not part of the you're not out of the
43:28 in-crowd in your brain because you don't
43:31 do all these crazy existential things if
43:33 you don't go to the South Pole to find
43:34 the dome wall you're not uncool it's
43:37 just not your thing and you're totally
43:39 happy with what you have in fact if
43:42 anything you're the victors of life you
43:44 know you're the ones that live in bliss
43:46 so feel no pressure but again I don't
43:49 know how much those individuals reach
43:52 out to shows like this to listen to some
43:54 guy blather in his backyard I think if
43:57 you're listening to me you're on a
43:58 journey doesn't mean you have to change
44:00 anything to be on that journey but
44:03 sometimes you'll just sort of reach out
44:05 and do something different I have this
44:08 I'm gonna share this with you guys since
44:10 we're deep inside the episode and
44:12 usually only the deep followers get get
44:14 past the 30 minute mark and that's one
44:17 of the secrets of this show what I do in
44:19 this show just so you guys know I put
44:22 things after the 30 minute mark about
44:24 the 35 minute mark for you chronic
44:26 listeners and it pays off a hundred
44:29 percent it's so funny but I learned that
44:32 I wouldn't have a bunch of douche bags
44:35 commenting on the channel by making
44:38 things more than 10 minutes I doubled
44:40 down on everything being over an hour
44:42 it's fun but I had I think I told you
44:46 guys that my writing mentor
44:51 screenwriting mentor and I both went off
44:55 on a little journey I think I said this
44:57 in an episode I know I mentioned this to
44:58 a friend of mine in the last couple
45:00 months but we we experimented with
45:03 writing novels because neither one of us
45:07 had done it in a really really long time
45:09 I don't even know if he had ever done it
45:11 we went off and you know we're working
45:14 on something together as well and and so
45:16 we came back and we were doing lunch and
45:18 it was like we had this funny moment
45:21 driving to lunch and I was looking at
45:23 him and I said well how you doing with
45:25 yours and he goes well you know it's
45:28 slow going man I said isn't it and I
45:32 felt like so I get into this short story
45:34 which I'm gonna share with you guys cuz
45:36 it's kind of fun some of those things
45:39 where someone could take your story
45:41 whatever mine's pretty us at Eric but I
45:46 started writing my short story and I
45:48 felt like I had labored for hours on
45:52 what I was writing and I think when I
45:55 was done I don't know I was under 7
45:58 pages but I felt like I had run for
46:03 writing marathons in a row with that
46:05 much effort into those 7 pages I
46:07 probably would have written 45 pages in
46:10 a screenplay and part of it was because
46:13 I didn't sit down and scope out the
46:16 entire novel I was just kind of going
46:17 with the flow and letting it happen to
46:19 me but my story is this and this kind of
46:24 dovetails with the subject matter which
46:26 is why I'm sharing this with you it's
46:29 about a guy who lives inside of a cube
46:32 and for him he has never seen anything
46:36 but the interior of this cube it's sort
46:41 of unknown what his past is how we got
46:43 to this point he's probably let's say in
46:45 his early 30s he's not like us because
46:51 he's always been in this cube and I'd
46:52 say the cube is probably 12 foot square
46:56 no more than 15 foot square and it has
47:00 everything that he had it would ever
47:01 need it has a little bunk bed
47:03 it has a workstation like a desk it's
47:06 all kind of gray inside and super smooth
47:08 has been brilliantly designed and so you
47:11 have this notion that okay whoever put
47:13 him in this thing is really trying to
47:16 industrialize this existence his food
47:20 comes through this dispenser this sort
47:24 of like TV dinner
47:25 sort of dispenser over by his sink I
47:28 didn't get to the point where I had him
47:30 bathing or anything
47:32 obviously something would have to happen
47:34 I guess but what I do is I I you know I
47:40 don't get a chance to talk in a sort of
47:44 third-person voice in screenwriting
47:46 right I don't get to say he's thinking
47:48 this he's thinking that but that's what
47:49 I did and so I'm taking that perspective
47:52 it's not a first-person thing but he has
47:57 a ritual and he gets up and he does this
47:59 ritual every single day and there are
48:01 sounds and tones and and information
48:04 that comes up on displays within his
48:06 cube that tell him when to queue up for
48:08 the next thing and talk about a guy
48:11 that's not disagreeing with the universe
48:13 but one day he wakes up and he's going
48:18 through his routine and he's working on
48:20 his computer I you know I can't remember
48:23 what the hell I made him do on the
48:24 computer he's sort of unimportant maybe
48:27 just like does data processing who the
48:29 hell knows right but here comes the food
48:31 and it's kind of a evening dinner thing
48:35 and in pops a cookie a really bright
48:41 pink cookie and he has never seen color
48:48 outside of his gray world in his entire
48:51 life he is never eaten sugar in pure
48:57 form in his entire life his taste buds
49:00 which are fully functional to process
49:02 that taste have never delighted in that
49:05 flavor before and he's actually scared
49:10 of the cookie for him there is no sense
49:15 that that is edible
49:16 because it doesn't match any food pellet
49:19 dinner he has ever had it's not the
49:22 standard like meat cake that he might be
49:23 getting and there's a slow moment where
49:27 he is going at this cookie it's a great
49:29 black mirror let me tell you and eating
49:32 this cookie takes a long time for him to
49:36 even remotely touch it to his
49:38 tongue and feel this amazing sensation
49:41 and that's what he does at first he just
49:44 touches it to his tongue because it's
49:45 got this crystallized sugar on the
49:47 outside I like a sugar cookie
49:49 but he's terrified of it as much as he's
49:51 intrigued by it and what I'm trying to
49:57 do is to demonstrate when you are
50:01 introduced to a new paradigm it could be
50:04 the most intoxicating thing and the most
50:07 terrifying thing all at the same time
50:10 you know again I've shared with you guys
50:13 friends of mine that no specific detail
50:17 because I only have maybe one friend
50:19 it's really done this in any tense way
50:21 and she was completely done with this
50:23 phase in her life by the time I talked
50:24 to her like 10 years 11 years past this
50:26 moment but imagine you see these people
50:31 with like tracks in their arms from
50:32 drugs don't you think it's terrifying to
50:37 poke yourself with a needle and inject
50:39 yourself with the drug because you might
50:42 be able to put something in your mouth
50:43 and and that's why a lot of people were
50:45 afraid to acid because they put this
50:47 piece of paper or they put a droplet on
50:49 their tongue and when they start having
50:51 this thing about an hour later they
50:54 can't just turn it off when you get
50:57 drunk you can't just turn it off you got
50:58 to go through it puke your guts out
51:00 whatever it is you're gonna do which is
51:03 why it's you be mentally prepared for
51:04 these things and so this guy's just got
51:06 a little sugar cookie and now of course
51:09 is the reader you're gonna start
51:11 wondering where this thing come from
51:13 what is going on here
51:16 if this thing for 35 years has only been
51:19 dispensing them the greatest you know
51:23 Orwellian food who made the cookie where
51:28 the recipe come from where did the
51:29 ingredients come from how was this thing
51:31 in existence are we in a reality reality
51:35 or in some virtual reality so by eating
51:38 this cookie he changes and evolves his
51:40 brain won the high of the cookie when he
51:45 finally starts to nibble on it and
51:47 realize oh my god this is like
51:51 in my mouth right he lays down in a
51:56 sugar high he sees his world differently
51:59 now I haven't decided exactly whether or
52:02 not I want to give him any
52:02 hallucinogenic experience but it's for
52:05 him it is a hosting a genic experience
52:07 just having sugar in its pure form who
52:10 knows what that would be like maybe some
52:12 Amish kids know what it's like to move
52:14 to the big city and you know bite into a
52:18 mrs. Fields cookie just to have like
52:21 some crazy a DeeDee moment right but to
52:26 uh this is like it's as far as I got was
52:28 this obviously once he eats the cookie
52:33 he's now super addicted to it and he
52:37 goes through a mourning phase meaning
52:40 he's sulking in the fact that there's
52:42 not one the next day or he's fearful
52:44 there won't be one the next day and the
52:47 next thing that comes through is a
52:50 little mouse and he has never seen any
52:53 life of any kind he's not quite sure
52:56 what the hell that thing is he's also
53:00 not pre indoctrinated to fear it and so
53:05 there's a bit of a taking care of
53:07 another being face for him and the way
53:11 I'm writing the story is that someone is
53:14 feeding him this stuff to condition him
53:16 so that he can leave to give him like
53:20 I'm giving you the cookies so you pay
53:21 attention that something is different I
53:24 need you to start disagreeing with the
53:26 universe and changing your paradigm of
53:28 thinking I'm going to let you have a
53:30 mouse because I need you to realize that
53:33 there are other things in this universe
53:34 you don't understand but things that
53:37 could use your help
53:39 eventually starts feeding this little
53:41 guy and then eventually of course the
53:44 mouse dies because it's a natural
53:46 process so what we're doing and what I'm
53:49 doing in the story is I'm slowing down
53:51 every sense that we take for granted
53:53 such that the reader can get how much we
53:57 take for granted how much of the
53:59 paradigm is your existence is this
54:02 mundane OneNote concert
54:05 and I have a whole adventure for this
54:07 dude once he gets out of the cube what's
54:14 interesting for me to just I'll visit
54:16 this in the most metaphorical fashion I
54:18 could possibly do it is that we are
54:20 seeing folks big giant groups of the
54:23 world being conditioned into bad things
54:27 but in order to change from a good thing
54:30 to a bad thing they have to have
54:31 disagreed with the universe as it exists
54:34 and adopt a new thing well imagine you
54:38 got a one-note concert as I keep saying
54:40 but it's a fairly decent note I mean it
54:43 doesn't hurt your mind and then imagine
54:45 the concert is a real sawtooth synth
54:48 keyboard that is playing essentially
54:51 what sounds like a saw blade cutting
54:54 wood and it's not that nice sound it's a
54:57 really just ran sits down in your brain
55:00 you want to get out of that concert as
55:02 much as you possibly can because it's
55:03 hurting everything that is your brain
55:07 and so what I want to highlight with you
55:11 is that there are individuals that are
55:13 obviously in control of which note is
55:15 being played what paradigm is your
55:17 normal mainstay substrate of existence
55:20 and they can play a good note or they
55:24 can play a bad note they can crash your
55:26 economy crash your future I mean it is
55:30 so unbelievably creative today that they
55:33 have made you know heterosexuality a bad
55:37 thing they make women not like men men
55:41 not like women and so for anyone who's
55:44 following their genetic code to
55:45 procreate depending on where you live in
55:48 the world the more first world you live
55:49 the more you're in this state of
55:51 horrendous cognitive dissonance with
55:55 your own genetics
55:56 you've got building I had the douchebag
55:59 guy up there trying to confuse your kids
56:00 he is trying to change the frequency
56:02 from a good frequency to a sawtooth
56:05 frequency so that your kid rebels
56:08 disagrees with the universe except that
56:13 the deep state that controls all of the
56:15 options the perceived options that your
56:17 kid my follower
56:18 you might follow you essentially go up
56:22 to a vending machine and everything in
56:27 that vending machine is your doom some
56:30 of it looks sexy because it's in a nice
56:32 little wrapper but if you eat it you go
56:37 down the tubes you lose your mind you
56:40 lose your freedom you lose your destiny
56:42 you catch a disease that they've
56:44 prepared for you a cancer and you have
56:48 to you're hungry that's the other thing
56:51 too you're super hungry and you're
56:52 looking at all this and you're thinking
56:53 geez I got to put something in my belly
56:56 I am like two seconds from going
56:58 absolutely feral and you might you know
57:03 let's just keep it in some really
57:04 metaphorical analogy here some deep
57:07 thoughts Fantasia cartoon what if you
57:12 look off to your left and for whatever
57:14 reason you can see a hundred miles away
57:16 or fifty miles away and you see the
57:20 other vending machine
57:21 maybe even put a telescope on it you're
57:24 like oh that stuff's not so bad so I'm
57:27 gonna eat this crappy stuff just to
57:29 satiate my stomach so that I can make it
57:31 to the next machine and perhaps get
57:34 something better and your hope is well I
57:38 hope what I'm eating right now doesn't
57:39 kill me before I get there and to your
57:43 surprise you pull the lever you get a
57:47 little snack out of this doomsday
57:50 machine and you don't die as a matter of
57:55 fact maybe you're coked out of your
57:56 brain and you get to that other machine
57:58 as fast as possible but by the time you
58:02 get to the other machine your thought
58:03 process has changed so much because of
58:06 the poison you ingested that it you're
58:09 looking at totally healthy non-gmo
58:11 options for your brain and that's a
58:13 metaphor for positivity in your life not
58:15 exactly nutrition but now you're looking
58:19 at your your salvation in the second
58:22 machine everything in there's the
58:24 destiny that prior to eating from that
58:25 other machine this is what you wanted
58:28 there's your career in that there's your
58:32 you know happy life right there there's
58:33 your perfect children your perfect
58:35 spouse but because you ate the poison
58:39 you believed all these people trying to
58:41 confuse your gender identification they
58:44 tried to talk you into transhumanism
58:47 they try to talk you into denying who
58:51 you are as a human being and hating your
58:52 own race your eyes have changed your
58:57 perception has changed and even though
58:59 you're looking at something you need to
59:00 ingest you need to ingest it to prepare
59:02 yourself it no longer looks appetizing
59:05 and the only thing you want to do is get
59:10 back to that previous machine and eat
59:11 more poison now imagine we have some
59:14 Greek theater narrator that shows up at
59:19 the other machine and he or she is
59:20 standing there looking at you and
59:23 they're telling you you need to eat from
59:27 this machine you need to because you're
59:32 full of poison right now they're telling
59:35 you the truth they're telling you
59:36 exactly what you need to hear because
59:39 but because you ingested the poison the
59:42 indoctrination in your mind perhaps a
59:45 physical poison a mental poison you
59:49 think this person standing next to the
59:50 machine that will save you from your own
59:53 demise is lying to you and so you double
59:57 down on your distrust for the healthy
59:59 things in life and even though you're
60:03 hungry you go back to that first machine
60:07 you get some more poison and this time
60:10 when you see that first machine it's no
60:12 longer threatening to you there's no
60:14 longer any perception that this is bad
60:16 for you in fact it's like a bunch of
60:20 little packages of crack cocaine in
60:22 there man and you just got a Jones for
60:25 there's meth right there there's heroin
60:27 and now you're like oh god I'm so glad
60:30 I'm back at this first machine you know
60:32 I'm gonna do I'm gonna sit right outside
60:33 this machine I'm just gonna just take
60:36 this until I die and you take it and you
60:40 feel good but your Destiny's long gone
60:44 that is sort of my thought process for
60:47 the way that the world is working which
60:50 is why you know when you see people in
60:53 many stories of life get addicted to
60:57 drugs and I don't really mean to make
61:00 this a drug thing because this is really
61:02 more subtle than drugs it is even
61:05 indoctrinated into a paradigm of
61:07 existence that is super unhealthy for
61:09 Humanity and yourself it may be so toxic
61:14 that you lose your own life prior to
61:15 even joining a society to participate in
61:17 some horrible social you know credit
61:21 system or whatever it might be you die
61:26 and that's sort of who made the machine
61:30 and made that first machine that's sort
61:32 of the goal is to get you stuck in that
61:35 the virologists in the 90s who studied
61:38 aids and said there's no such thing as
61:39 AIDS guys HIV doesn't kill if you get
61:43 your blood tested and you have HIV then
61:45 you're safe because that would have
61:46 killed you if it was going to kill you
61:47 you will never destroy your t-cells and
61:50 so they asked the virologist they said
61:52 well what's causing this immune
61:53 deficiency thing and they looked at the
61:55 camera and they said drugs and
61:56 malnutrition for Africa it's
61:59 malnutrition for Americans it's drugs
62:01 and they said don't you didn't you ever
62:04 think for a second that there would be a
62:07 repercussion for doing drugs in your
62:10 body didn't you think at some point
62:12 getting high constantly messing with all
62:14 the chemistry in your brain what they
62:16 said was introducing chemistry in your
62:17 body which they mean drugs they said
62:21 didn't you think it would have an effect
62:22 at some point did you really think you
62:24 could do heroin constantly and they tell
62:26 people they catch aids from you know
62:28 passing around dirty needles and these
62:31 virologist these world experts who said
62:33 show me the piece of paper that links
62:35 HIV with immune deficiency problems and
62:37 no papers exists as according to these
62:39 guys and they said you're not catching
62:43 anything besides destroying the
62:46 chemistry in your body your T cells
62:48 start to die off the more that you do
62:49 heroin especially and whippets whippets
62:53 are the worst the the poppers
62:57 they're the worst they destroy t-cells
62:59 exactly what they do is it go and just
63:01 annihilate you but then you put you know
63:04 the medicine to cure this this phantom
63:07 condition is it kills you like almost a
63:11 hundred percent at the time like I think
63:14 it's at this point it is 100 percent of
63:16 the time it kills you the notion is that
63:19 life can get off balance and that we
63:24 have these vices that we develop with
63:26 things that help us supposedly get past
63:29 with the bad stage in life unfortunately
63:33 a lot of the vices start to injure the
63:36 brain start to kill up brain cells and
63:42 of course medicine is being turned into
63:45 this as well as we vaccinate ourselves
63:47 with aluminum and Mercury it's the
63:50 machine it's the first machine oh I
63:53 definitely need a vaccination bring my
63:56 kid definitely needs a vaccination
63:57 better and then your kid just loses
63:59 their mind before you know it and
64:01 they're unable to deal with any minor
64:03 complexity in life and so then here
64:06 comes the other chemical vices to deal
64:10 with not being able to handle life if
64:13 you are blissfully living every second
64:15 of your life then I guess this episode
64:20 has very little value to you whatsoever
64:22 if nothing else that maybe hopefully
64:24 confirms it that you've done the right
64:26 thing for you it's good if there areas
64:31 of your life where you're like you know
64:32 what it's okay it certainly could be a
64:36 lot better you know when I was a kid
64:37 they said life would be a lot better it
64:39 seems like when I was a kid my
64:40 grandparents overall frequency was a lot
64:44 more positive and happy than mine maybe
64:47 it's time to disagree with the universe
64:49 and what I want to make sure that we
64:55 distill out of this statement and I
64:56 don't know what l ron Hubbard's whole
64:57 thought process again I had this
65:00 conveyed to me in a sentence and it blew
65:02 my mind and that's all I've got I don't
65:05 I didn't go into Dianetics and read
65:07 about it I didn't look up anything
65:09 before I made this episode which is all
65:10 the apparent to those who study him but
65:14 usually when we say we disagree with
65:17 each other that's a negative connotation
65:20 we are trying to agree on the best way
65:24 to live life and the best way to
65:26 manifest our destinies right when I say
65:30 disagreeing with the universe and I
65:32 would assume I would put money down if
65:34 Ellen ron Hubbard was right there in
65:35 some ghostly form or whoever he took
65:38 that from which he he his claim as I
65:42 understand it was that he meant at other
65:44 peoples processes but I would imagine
65:47 whoever came up with this notion that's
65:49 that statement whether it be him or
65:50 someone else this isn't a negative at
65:53 all disagreeing with the universe
65:55 I have lamented in episode after episode
65:58 for four years that I think the universe
66:01 wants us to become exceptional beings
66:05 why else go in the loop of reincarnation
66:08 forever yet again if you're a Christian
66:11 or some person who believes that this is
66:14 it you're an atheist by God disagreeing
66:18 with the universe if you're not happy
66:20 should be a guiding principle of every
66:23 second of your life because in your mind
66:25 this isn't going to happen again this is
66:28 gonna be it I tell you if I ever believe
66:32 that for one second I mean it's proof
66:33 that I don't although I try to live my
66:35 life is profoundly as I possibly can I
66:39 don't know that I would do anything
66:41 trivial in my life at all except to
66:43 experience what I might classify as
66:45 trivial as a pure experiment let's go
66:48 out tonight and do something trivial
66:49 just to feel what trivial feels like but
66:52 it would be an intentional experience
66:55 but I don't live with any you don't
67:00 acidic worry in my life that I'm not
67:04 doing those things because I think this
67:07 is sort of a marathon this whole thing
67:09 with massaging your soul with trying to
67:13 ingest things and accomplish things and
67:15 see things from all dimensions some
67:17 people get really worried if they get
67:18 angry because later they look back and
67:21 go oh my god that wasn't
67:22 see and it is sometimes and you say
67:24 things you shouldn't say I have been an
67:26 expert at that in my lifetime but it's
67:29 those previous moments that I lived
67:31 where I called someone a name that I
67:33 shouldn't have said you know or I did
67:35 something that was very brutal you know
67:38 I mean I don't again I don't I don't
67:40 backstab anybody I don't step on
67:42 anybody's head to get ahead I'm right in
67:45 your face man if we disagree up to a
67:48 point I'm gonna be patient and then
67:50 there's this flippin point where I go
67:52 you know usually my tact for being
67:56 coarse and rude is to say stop being a
68:00 [ __ ]
68:01 stop letting life tell you what to do
68:04 stop telling people that you dislike and
68:06 you disagree with to control your life
68:10 be fair be good make sure that you're
68:14 not you know worshipping this first
68:16 vending machine that you believe the
68:18 grass is always greener on the other
68:20 side sometimes that's true a lot of
68:23 times it's not true the percentage of
68:25 which one
68:26 that's totally dependent on the way
68:28 you've structured your life I truly
68:31 truly believe for those that aren't
68:33 mentally ill by ingesting too much from
68:35 this first vending machine we all want
68:39 the same things we want to be left alone
68:42 in terms of people doing us harm we want
68:46 people to be happy around us because we
68:48 know that when you go to a party with
68:49 people that are happy you tend to absorb
68:52 that frequency whether or not you came
68:53 in grumpy or not last night for instance
68:57 I was I worked all day long trying to
69:01 crank out these episodes get them all
69:03 edited up there but I was you know doing
69:05 some more engineering and I'm having a
69:07 blast but it's it's brutal [ __ ] man it's
69:09 like it totally takes down your energy
69:12 levels and I got to about I think about
69:15 10 o'clock or so and I will sing at this
69:19 karaoke joint down the street and it's
69:22 like a family inside this place is
69:23 beautiful
69:24 and I really in my heart I didn't you
69:27 know my chest I didn't have the energy
69:28 level like I couldn't really conceive of
69:30 getting on stage and singing cuz I sing
69:32 some pretty intense stuff but I went
69:35 anyway
69:36 and I stepped in that door and I sat
69:39 down and then my family's there and
69:41 we're all shaking hands and we're so
69:43 happy to see each other we see each
69:45 other every week but it's still like
69:46 it's just fun to see these people and
69:48 all of a sudden their frequency infested
69:51 my frequency their energy infested my
69:53 energy and within ten minutes I was so
69:56 glad I went and this has happened to me
69:58 a million times I'm sure it's happened
70:00 to you too the day I met my high school
70:04 sweetheart back when I was in the 80s I
70:06 remember I'd spent the entire day inside
70:08 it was late in May I school II just let
70:11 out I'm at home programming a new paint
70:15 application on my cocoa computer version
70:19 two my cousin called me up he was like
70:23 dude let's go to the pool yeah you know
70:27 it's still nice out it's about four
70:29 o'clock on the day that where the sun's
70:31 gonna go down around nine o'clock and I
70:34 kind of you know powdered around a
70:36 little bit and then he's like just get
70:38 your ass out the house would you and so
70:40 it's probably only cool things this dude
70:42 has ever done in my life and so I went
70:44 with him went down to the pool he and I
70:46 separated immediately and I just found
70:49 myself swimming in the pool and I'm
70:50 micros it's cool man this is like kind
70:52 of what I needed I needed this water
70:54 around my body to kind of just pull the
70:58 cork out of my butt of being inside for
71:00 the entire winter which is always brutal
71:03 in Kansas I look straight ahead and
71:05 there's this super cute girl with her
71:07 best friend and I knew her didn't know
71:11 her best friend and that was it man
71:15 her and I ended up dating for a year and
71:17 a half after that it was blissful I
71:21 disagreed with my own universe you know
71:23 I disagree with being cooped up inside
71:25 I spent the almost the entire summer at
71:28 that at that pool or gigantic pool
71:31 I still pounded out my software at home
71:34 but I had a new level of invigoration
71:37 because life was good I was in love man
71:40 I was in love jeez for a year and a half
71:43 so take a look at your life remember
71:47 this is a game
71:49 and it's like a video game in that when
71:52 you pass away you just it's just like a
71:56 video game you get another life but
72:00 unlike most video games it's like an MMO
72:03 it's more like World of Warcraft you die
72:07 your own to that Ghost World
72:09 you got to go back to your body and your
72:11 resurrect well we don't go back to our
72:13 body
72:13 we'd make a new one or someone else
72:15 makes a new one and you crawl inside it
72:18 and you attach to it who knows if we're
72:22 always human who knows who cares
72:24 whatever we're doing it's probably our
72:27 choice in the first place I have a I
72:30 don't know I'm kind of torn I think that
72:33 once your soul reaches a certain level
72:35 of sophistication I doubt you going to a
72:38 housefly I doubt you going to a little
72:39 spider I doubt you do that because I
72:42 don't know seems like it'd be a waste of
72:43 your faculties maybe if you're a big
72:47 jerk that's the only option you got yeah
72:50 but I think it'd be okay even if you did
72:52 I think we stay an upper an upper
72:57 construct of life not sure I'd want to
73:00 be a tree for a few hundred years but
73:04 maybe that's blissful who knows but take
73:06 a look at your life and see if there's
73:08 anything you disagree with and again it
73:11 doesn't mean your life is miserable
73:12 maybe it's just boring that maybe again
73:17 you don't do these 90-degree turns maybe
73:19 you don't do an acute angle backwards
73:20 you just do a little tiny coarse
73:22 adjustment but if you're surrounded by
73:26 bad energy that's an imperative that you
73:29 get away from that bad energy so plan
73:30 don't just run out and do something
73:32 right away
73:33 sometimes you can do that but that's
73:35 sort of like you know closing your eyes
73:37 and jumping off a cliff and hoping
73:39 there's water down there it's probably
73:40 not the best plan look down make sure
73:43 there's something there throw a big rock
73:45 down there and see if it hits something
73:46 that's only six inches down in the water
73:49 because you might crush yourself make
73:52 sure it's good maybe not jump from
73:53 someplace so high do something
73:56 interesting for you based on your
73:58 interests maybe you do something to
74:01 benefit someone else
74:03 because you don't you don't have any
74:05 needs anymore or at this current point
74:07 in time you're good but your spouse
74:10 needs something your kid needs something
74:12 your friend needs something the world
74:14 needs something I don't know where I
74:17 gained the opinion that life was a game
74:19 like a video game but I think I was in
74:20 my 20s and there's just something about
74:24 that paradigm shift in my brain that for
74:25 me made life wonderful it made it like
74:28 oh yeah you know I can do a lot more
74:31 than I thought I could and that's always
74:34 the case again when I teach students
74:37 that think that they're not creative
74:39 I'll just share this last thing with
74:42 your I share this once before but people
74:46 who can't watch scary movies
74:49 often will say to you in a different
74:51 conversation completely out of the
74:53 context of film watching that they're
74:54 not creative and I'll look at them and
74:57 say that's not true
74:59 you are invariably creative you are
75:04 actually probably extra creative in that
75:06 when you see a scary thing the reason
75:10 why you don't watch scary movies is that
75:11 when you go to bed at night or whatever
75:14 usually it's bed at night sort of thing
75:17 you were thinking about the scary movie
75:19 and it's still there it's still freaking
75:21 you out if you're watching a zombie show
75:23 on TV you think zombies are in your
75:26 closet underneath your bed when you go
75:27 to the bathroom they're gonna pop out of
75:29 nowhere as irrational as that is you
75:32 know that they don't exist but you're so
75:34 creative you live in almost a day time
75:37 dream state of creativity whereas I
75:40 think you know when I go to bed my
75:42 wild-ass dreams start to occur I live in
75:47 a whole nother world for me it's very
75:49 realistic
75:51 you know if in it you know for some
75:53 weird reason in my dreams if I do bump
75:55 into something that's a monster which is
75:56 very very rare I'm almost like looking
75:59 at it really close oh dude you're a
76:01 zombie you know it's like don't go away
76:03 hold still I'm gonna look at you a
76:04 little bit you know but we underestimate
76:09 ourselves all the time and if you really
76:13 think it through think about this
76:15 are you an alien that's completely
76:18 different species than me personally I
76:21 don't I'm not gonna bet on that it might
76:25 be true
76:26 maybe all the races of the world all the
76:29 different colored skins and hairs and
76:32 whatever on everybody's head and the
76:34 different potty types maybe we're a baby
76:35 we are all from a different
76:37 constellation in the universe and they
76:39 all kind of got together and put us down
76:40 here in this petri dish and we're
76:42 started watching us with from UFOs and
76:44 going Wow look at that you know not
76:47 indoctrinated to hate each other these
76:49 people actually got along without
76:50 indoctrinated each other these two
76:52 people manifested a man-made religion
76:54 and started killing each other that's
76:56 weird maybe they're experimenting with
76:58 how stupid we are
76:59 or instinctually out of alignment that
77:02 we are but let's just say we're all part
77:07 of that group that wants to get along
77:08 which i think is generally everybody
77:10 - indoctrination to change your mind but
77:14 now how can one human being be super
77:17 left brain and be able to do calculus on
77:19 the first day and get a straight-a and
77:21 the other person can't figure it out and
77:23 that person who can't figure it out can
77:26 paint photo real paintings by hand this
77:29 Leonardo Monalisa capability we're the
77:34 same species and so even if your family
77:40 or your race or whatever your nation
77:44 didn't offer you the education and the
77:47 arcs to get onto that if you can hear my
77:50 voice and understand what I'm saying
77:52 right now then you have all the mental
77:55 faculties and capabilities to go learn
77:57 calculus if that's something you want to
77:58 learn and you've always been crap yet or
78:00 you don't even know if you're good at it
78:01 there's so many great courses on YouTube
78:04 or you want to learn how to paint oh my
78:07 god look up YouTube painting faces
78:09 photo-real how to tutorial watch the
78:13 video you don't have any heart supplies
78:14 right watch the video see what they're
78:15 using to paint stop the video go to your
78:18 local art store grab a little kit you
78:21 have these kits for like 20 bucks oil
78:23 paints acrylics watercolors sketch
78:27 pencils pin
78:28 whatever the hell you need you can get
78:29 into it for less than 50 bucks get
78:31 yourself a canvas or a piece of paper or
78:33 canvas board or whatever the hell you
78:36 want to get into I'm just using art as
78:39 an example because it's the fastest way
78:42 that people underestimate what they can
78:44 do and then go back home set everything
78:47 up get your little self a little easel
78:49 or a book you can back something up
78:51 against and one by one just copy what
78:55 they're doing and eventually you'll get
78:57 your own desires to paint something
78:58 different than what's in the tutorial
79:00 like me and screenwriting you'll come up
79:03 with your own techniques of shading and
79:04 doing gradients maybe you jump into
79:08 acrylics in which it really wants oil
79:10 paints maybe jump into oil paints and
79:11 you want to go into gouache maybe you go
79:13 into painting and you really want to be
79:14 a sketch artist I mean whatever the hell
79:15 it is don't stop just because one
79:17 doesn't work out just keep going it's a
79:21 fun experience you give yourself enough
79:23 time to go through the torment of
79:25 learning see if you've got it disagree
79:29 with the universe change things anyway I
79:33 think that's about all I got on this
79:34 hopefully you felt me on this one
79:36 this kind of stuff drives me every
79:40 single day and there's so many frontiers
79:43 for the mind it's when you really
79:45 realize how many frontiers there are
79:46 which is infinite and you even can
79:49 quantify things down to a countable
79:53 numeric value of things you could
79:56 possibly do it's still more than you can
79:58 do in a single lifetime so with all
80:01 things you prioritize things that are
80:03 more exciting than other things go do
80:05 the things they're the top of your
80:07 pyramid of interest improve yourself
80:11 have fun experiment find people like you
80:16 find people that I already do what you
80:17 want to do and just be real
80:19 straightforward with them say look man I
80:21 have always had this desire to paint or
80:24 write music or whatever learn math but
80:27 I'm really crappy at it right now it's
80:30 never clicked in my brain could you help
80:31 it click in my brain and you know
80:35 arrange sessions with them you'll
80:37 usually find these people in your family
80:39 or your your
80:39 friend/family Cirque circles in life and
80:43 they're more than thrilled to death to
80:46 share with you their love because
80:47 they're good at it
80:48 I just prepped the pump by saying look
80:51 I'm probably gonna be a frustrating
80:53 person for you at first but please don't
80:55 give up on me let's do this what I've
81:00 tried to do with this series is put
81:01 enough things into episodes that either
81:04 you're learning it directly from the
81:05 episode or I am juicing your brain in
81:08 your heart so much there's a lot of
81:10 season one stuff that you're just
81:13 chomping at the bit man you're ready to
81:14 go because I'll tell you what if I ever
81:18 had this show when I was a kid I would
81:21 have avoided I don't know 30 to 50% of
81:24 the wasteful do it myself do it wrong
81:27 learn it the hard way techniques and I
81:30 would be much further in my life as much
81:32 as I might say I would never change a
81:34 thing in my life yeah that's sort of a
81:36 defense mechanism for the way that you
81:38 know you would change a few things
81:42 especially all the pain in the hurt you
81:45 would you would moderate it a little bit
81:47 it's it's it's obviously very good to go
81:51 through some some uncomfortable things
81:53 in life to learn what you're made out of
81:56 like I always tell soldiers you know
81:59 whether they be 92 years old and the
82:02 invaded Omaha Beach or whether or not
82:06 they just came back from some deployment
82:08 over overseas in the Middle East they
82:11 knows they know so much more about
82:12 themselves having gone through these
82:15 eyes of the needles you know but that
82:18 happens here at home too without a gun
82:20 and ever in their hand without ever
82:22 firing a bullet and anger or fear life
82:25 kicks your ass 24/7 anyway if you have
82:29 mid to deep thoughts radio.com please go
82:31 that's where there's audio and video so
82:34 you can change your feed back and forth
82:36 you have a couple social media outlets
82:39 Facebook has a locked Facebook group
82:42 come on in make sure you answer the
82:44 question or just say something human is
82:46 what I say so just say something human
82:48 when you apply because let us block you
82:51 if you don't
82:52 and then you can't apply again so that's
82:54 why it's a finite thing there a couple
82:57 ways to contribute to the show
82:58 financially there's patreon and PayPal
83:01 you can install the brave browser from
83:03 my link brave browsers browser is
83:06 awesome well we try to say that several
83:08 times and there's a new link to season
83:10 one which is much better remastered
83:14 better audio lots of pauses and weird
83:18 things fixed in it so it's starting to
83:20 pick up actually the viewership is every
83:22 single day and there's several people
83:23 viewing episode several several times a
83:26 day so that's a big difference
83:27 it'll only ever have probably about 97
83:31 episodes in it because I've turned some
83:33 of them off but there's some special
83:35 reports there so maybe it hits 100 I
83:36 don't know I'm not there yet
83:37 but until next time disagree with the
83:41 universe take care of yourself and
83:44 someone else and I'll see in the next
83:45 deep thoughts over now
