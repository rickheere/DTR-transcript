00:00 [Music]
00:34 good evening and good morning ladies and
00:37 gentlemen so one of the areas that I
00:40 study a lot when I analyze history and
00:47 most importantly recent history talking
00:49 about the last hundred years of whatever
00:51 country you live in
00:53 for me it's America obviously is to look
00:57 at the curves of progress and the curves
01:02 of the degradation of progress the seem
01:08 to occur in our countries that were
01:11 completely aware of although you know
01:14 you got your young people feeling very
01:17 enthusiastic because they know no other
01:19 world and then you got the older folks
01:21 of all ages looking back on their era
01:25 and they're going holy [ __ ] we screwed
01:27 up our country right where America is
01:31 utterly littered with that history over
01:36 the last I guess 119 years so go back to
01:38 the year 1900 and what I'm going to
01:42 cover in this episode has to do with
01:45 sort of a catch-22 almost a ironic
01:54 reality to societies that the tougher it
01:58 is to live in a particular society
02:00 meaning you don't have amenities you
02:02 don't you know maybe even have running
02:05 water I mean I there's a piece of
02:06 history I studied from some German
02:10 professors that were publishing their
02:13 lectures online and it was dealing with
02:17 vaccinations and how insane they are and
02:20 I was just being taught over there was
02:22 great but one of the things that was
02:24 mentioned in this course was that we
02:30 didn't have running water in all the
02:32 cities in America where people bathe
02:35 regularly and clean themselves off thus
02:38 reducing bacterial cultures that grew
02:40 outside and inside the body creating
02:42 things like polio and you know things
02:45 that
02:46 penicillin fixed eventually and they
02:49 said it wasn't until 1943 that we
02:53 finally kind of got it conquered now my
02:57 mother was born in the late 40s and she
03:00 said that they lived on a farm in Kansas
03:02 and she said that she had four siblings
03:06 eventually but she was about nine years
03:08 old before they started showing up so
03:10 she had a good memory of life before
03:12 then and she said that my grandfather
03:15 was a big farmer I mean all kinds of
03:19 stuff but that was one of his main
03:20 staples when she was young because he
03:22 was a young man as well and he would
03:25 come in and they would fill the bathtub
03:27 with warm water which I think required
03:31 trips from outside from a pump and he
03:35 would bathe first because he was the man
03:36 and he's the most filthy of course it's
03:39 gross then his wife and then my mom it's
03:43 like Jesus grandpa grandma my mom and it
03:47 just you know it was like she was trying
03:49 to tell me how much better it was that
03:51 we could just turn on the faucet to get
03:53 hot water and bathe right when I was a
03:54 really young kid but that story
03:56 horrified me and stuck with me my heart
03:58 my whole life like really didn't that
04:01 seem stupid wouldn't it be the child
04:02 who's barely dirty then the the wife out
04:05 of pure respect and then maybe both of
04:07 them can go together until the kids old
04:09 enough and then grab all dirty old
04:11 stinky grandpa goes in there in terms of
04:12 water gray you know mm-hmm I mentioned
04:16 that example because we have a false
04:19 memory when or we have a false
04:22 recollection of things that we didn't
04:24 experience meaning we weren't there and
04:27 then all of a sudden we think we
04:31 remember things that didn't happen you
04:33 know are things that we didn't
04:34 personally experience because we've been
04:36 told so much BS on television from
04:39 Discovery Channel to History Channel to
04:41 any specialty you've seen movies that
04:43 portray the past and it's sometimes
04:46 incredibly incorrect and that is going
04:50 to get at the heart of why what I'm
04:53 gonna propose in this episode it ludes
04:57 us
04:58 now if you think about things we have to
05:01 set a foundation for the human mind
05:04 before we get into this because it's
05:06 going to give you a paradigm to look
05:08 back in your past and start sifting
05:10 through what might have been more
05:12 hearsay storylines and then things that
05:15 you think you remember so I was born in
05:18 69 and so I don't remember 1969 very
05:22 well but sure enough in the early 70s I
05:25 had recollections of the house I lived
05:27 in by the age of three I was having
05:30 total memory recall of going to my
05:33 daycare and chilling out and just being
05:35 asked you know how old are you I'm three
05:38 you know what's your favorite color
05:39 purple yeah so I have a loose a looser
05:46 memory of being you know say three to
05:50 ten of course it gets better and better
05:51 and better every single year but then
05:54 again I'm only engaging reality as a
05:57 preteen I'm not traveling the world
06:01 technically speaking I'm not seeing
06:04 anything from a business perspective now
06:07 I go back and do a lot of questions to
06:09 my parents and and everyone I know so I
06:12 will sit and drill a person who's 70 on
06:15 what it was like to be in the 70s and be
06:17 in your 20s right or your 30s or what
06:19 have you and so but I'm you know taking
06:23 that person's personal experience trying
06:27 to figure out where they lived what they
06:29 didn't see and what they did see now
06:32 I've got a very good stash of friends
06:34 that have travelled the world
06:36 to extents that most people haven't
06:39 they've seen things that most people
06:40 haven't and so I've got a really good
06:42 rounded perspective for my money on a
06:46 lot of those events but still I you know
06:49 as much as I might have interviewed my
06:51 grandparents about the 50s and 40s and
06:53 30s it was more anecdotal kind of
06:56 stories about you know I worked at the
06:59 store I brought your uncle to work
07:01 because I didn't have daycare and we
07:02 didn't you know we weren't expected to
07:04 have daycare you could bring your kids
07:06 to work and they just all play in the
07:07 backroom or what
07:08 and so it is dawned on me that there's
07:16 this gradient that the further I go back
07:20 in my life whether it be through my own
07:24 personal experiences which are very
07:26 significant especially growing up in the
07:29 Midwest but the stories that you're told
07:32 that formed those people that I'm going
07:35 to start mentioning and start itemizing
07:38 their skillsets and according to me
07:41 they had this gradient that I am talking
07:45 about that I'm gonna make this whole
07:46 episode about continuing as well and it
07:50 was that the death of the hero the death
07:54 of the male doesn't have to be an alpha
07:58 male certainly is not a beta male but
08:03 I'd say normal to alpha if you will it's
08:08 a direct proportion to how tough it was
08:10 to exist in this country
08:12 and tough by tough I don't mean you know
08:18 the 1800s when they're crawling across
08:21 the country and and fighting the natives
08:24 and building cities but there's a lot of
08:28 truth to that as well we can go back a
08:30 little further the nineteen hundreds to
08:31 prob about the 1850s was some pretty
08:33 decent accuracy but you know like it
08:36 when I wanted my my mother was born in
08:39 the 40s there were a ton of farmers in
08:42 my region of the country lots of farmers
08:47 not just the couple farmers that exist
08:49 today all right today there might be
08:51 like ten farmers for about a 50-mile
08:56 radius off of my hometown because they
08:58 just simply acquired land bought land
09:00 and they're the guys they consolidated
09:03 everything but back in the day you would
09:04 have a few fields and that was your
09:06 whole you know market cap for the year
09:10 but you also had some animals because
09:13 you lived off the land if you wanted
09:15 eggs you bought chickens and got a
09:16 chicken coop if you want to bacon you
09:18 bought pigs you know if you wanted to
09:20 save some money on gas you'd buy a horse
09:22 I mean it was just all kind of factored
09:24 into the way they lived their lives and
09:27 I think all of us know especially with
09:31 these privileged [ __ ] white
09:33 snowflakes right that the more
09:36 privileged you get / spoiled to death
09:39 you get your parents cutting your checks
09:41 because they don't have any idea how to
09:43 raise you or get you inspired because
09:45 they're hanging on for dear life trying
09:46 to buy the next RV or [ __ ] boat on
09:48 the street that those kids are just they
09:56 really are cattle for the harvesting
09:58 right there was an interesting special
10:02 on North Korea I can't remember exactly
10:04 which one vice did a couple there was
10:08 one on North Korea where a gentleman
10:10 went over like an older documentary
10:13 filmmaker I think he was British but he
10:16 does the big orchestrated to her over
10:18 there and then he comes back to South
10:21 Korea and one of the first things he
10:24 said when he crossed the border to South
10:26 Korea is you know extremely modern they
10:29 are you know they have more boy bands
10:31 and anywhere else in the entire world
10:33 and you know just really interesting
10:36 cool culture that's where psy came from
10:39 it's going to style right
10:40 but this guy goes over there and he
10:43 starts looking at all these beta males
10:45 in South Korea he's sort of hybrid I
10:48 can't tell what sex they are kind of
10:50 guys right and he looks back at the
10:53 camera he goes if those North Koreans
10:56 ever came down here they'd wiped these
10:57 [ __ ] out in one day and his comment
11:01 it's something to that effect but his
11:02 comment is these kids aren't hard they
11:05 couldn't possibly engage in a war they
11:08 couldn't defend themselves and that was
11:11 his comment now it's obviously
11:12 unfortunate that you would ever have to
11:14 say we got to keep males being super
11:16 strong so we can fight wars I mean
11:18 that's a sad reason to be everything you
11:22 could be let's just split that way
11:23 unfortunately in some cases is necessary
11:26 it'd be interesting to see how many
11:28 people we would hate if we could get rid
11:29 of all the bankers off the earth would
11:32 that be interesting monarchies and
11:34 [ __ ] politicians
11:36 or people that whose job is to go to
11:41 work right but this episode's gonna be
11:44 more subtle than that
11:44 right when I grew up in the 70s and you
11:51 wanted to have an extension on the side
11:54 of your house you did it yourself most
11:58 the time you wouldn't necessarily build
12:00 your house but then again about one in
12:02 five guys in my hometown could and did
12:05 build their house they bought a plot of
12:08 land they just quit work for so many
12:11 months and it was like [ __ ] magic
12:14 these guys would just go buy lumber go
12:17 go get you know rent a backhoe and
12:20 they'd you know they contract a little
12:21 bit of it out they wouldn't pour their
12:22 own submit necessarily although probably
12:24 about a third of the time they would and
12:29 it was just amazing and these guys you
12:31 know I had a my best friend who died of
12:34 cancer at about 2002 he was a at least
12:40 10 years older than me and he was just a
12:44 man's man he was his name's Keith and he
12:46 was just just the coolest dude and the
12:49 funny thing was I work with his wife at
12:50 Walmart as a young kid and she invited
12:53 us a bunch of kids over to do something
12:56 heat a picnic or something the first
12:57 time I met in my he'd been driving a
12:59 truck all night and I walked in the room
13:01 and woke him up it was like you know
13:05 this is really funny and then I grew to
13:07 be really good friends with the guy but
13:08 the dude could do anything with his
13:11 hands like he had old Harley Davidsons
13:14 from the 30s that he would restore in
13:16 his garage he'd buy an old pickup and
13:18 just [ __ ] restore the thing but
13:20 before all that he built his gigantic
13:22 garage with all the tools in it and
13:26 you're sitting there cuz I'm never
13:28 asking him I said you'd you just you
13:30 just built that garage right it's big
13:32 [ __ ] garage probably 30 or 40 feet
13:36 square you know a real big roof top and
13:38 he goes yeah yeah I did that I'm like
13:41 well like how did you know how to do
13:43 that you know it's like you didn't say
13:45 you knew how to do this it's not quite a
13:47 house but the guy could probably do that
13:49 too
13:50 he said I just picked it up man when I
13:51 was young I just hung out with old guys
13:53 that did this or guys that did this and
13:55 I picked up how to do it now we all went
13:57 to high school and junior high were they
13:59 in junior high and my junior high you
14:01 had to build the corner of a house it
14:05 was like a team of like three or four of
14:06 us and it broke the whole class apart
14:08 but we built the foundation we didn't do
14:10 cement but we built the whole you know
14:13 wall with them I think a window in one
14:16 side and then we had to build a roof top
14:17 and put the shingles on it and stuff so
14:20 we've all had kind of had a crash course
14:22 but you know pulled it all together
14:24 something different I asked him how he
14:26 figured out how to restore an old Harley
14:28 well I just picked it up everything he
14:31 just picked it up and he's like one of
14:36 10,000 people living in my hometown I I
14:38 would wager in 1975 you have at least
14:42 5,000 guys in the town and 2,500 could
14:46 probably do everything this dude did one
14:49 of my great uncle's used to drive around
14:52 the town and really go yeah Ralph but
14:54 built those five houses there he built
14:56 that whole street right there he built
14:57 the house he lives in you know it's just
14:59 like that's cool man and you age a kid
15:02 when you hear these things you suddenly
15:05 lift your ceiling of what you what you
15:08 could do in your own mind and my family
15:10 again was really big on genetics you
15:13 know they were like look if we work
15:16 really hard and make our brains more
15:17 intense than when you're born your brain
15:21 will be more intense and more dense and
15:23 then you do the same thing so your kids
15:26 have denser brains and it just will help
15:28 out the whole way right you know there's
15:30 not a there's not a necessarily a
15:34 predisposition for your genetics to be
15:36 smarter it's just when you're not
15:38 oppressed and education is accessible
15:42 then you can read and learn and pass
15:46 things down word-of-mouth and your brain
15:48 for any race on earth will get more
15:51 dense and therefore the children get
15:53 more dense and as long as you keep
15:54 raising your children into these new
15:56 paradigms which is a part of this
15:57 episode you will have a distinct
16:00 advantage over other families that don't
16:01 pay attention to any of this stuff right
16:03 but in the 80s the 80s was this not
16:08 necessarily for little towns but for big
16:10 towns it was a sudden transformation of
16:13 change your own oil to go get it change
16:20 to Jiffy Lube because it's super fast
16:23 right and you know they do a good job
16:25 you know most the time unless you just
16:27 have a really bad branch and so you know
16:34 as well as I do society is now subbing
16:37 everything out people some people don't
16:39 even go to the grocery store anymore
16:40 they have it brought to them you know we
16:45 have a lot of fast food that's replaced
16:46 the old idea of buying ingredients
16:48 bringing in at home cooking it making
16:50 the cooking experience a family
16:51 experience and then setting up the
16:53 dinner to dining room table sitting
16:55 together learning about your days which
16:57 is important to communicate with your
17:00 family members because it develops a
17:03 rapport it develops a connection such
17:06 that when you need help you like one
17:08 reaching out to my mom reaching out to
17:10 my dad I reached out to my little
17:11 brother or whatever because I know them
17:13 we have shared all these different
17:15 trials and tribulations together at the
17:17 dinner table and so therefore we know
17:18 each other and you know if the
17:21 conversation goes dry one night someone
17:23 will just reach back into history and
17:26 start telling stories my father and I in
17:28 the summertime used to have my friends
17:31 over and we play hearts you know the
17:34 playing card game and while we're
17:39 playing my dad's telling stories then we
17:41 get really bored of that and he'd just
17:44 get up set up you know lean up against
17:47 the counter and our little tiny maybe 10
17:49 by 10 kitchen and he'd tell me story
17:53 after story after story about him being
17:56 a young guy in the 50s and the early 60s
17:58 and you know how they broke into the
18:02 high school to get answers to a question
18:04 answers to a test they used to go in and
18:07 take the tapes that were language tapes
18:10 and they'd record a bunch of dirty words
18:11 on them so the kids would come in and
18:13 they'd all laugh and they wouldn't tell
18:14 the teacher but just all kinds
18:17 of wild stories and because we have had
18:21 that culturally stolen from us your to
18:26 eat out all the time right I am horrible
18:29 at this right I mean I I like to be in a
18:32 real communal process if I'm gonna eat
18:34 you know and it my friends are so busy
18:37 it's really really tough right it's a
18:40 bummer now you know I mentioned the No
18:44 Country for Old Men concept and for any
18:46 of you are really young and you just
18:47 have heard that you're not quite sure
18:48 what the hell that means just a super
18:50 recap super fast recap it's when you get
18:55 old enough that the only thing that you
18:57 respect and like about society is the
19:00 way it used to be and so your country
19:04 ceases to become anything you're proud
19:06 of because it changes so much that
19:08 you're not proud of it anymore so you
19:09 have no country and for an old man right
19:12 so that's the way that statement goes a
19:14 very butchered paraphrase we have an
19:18 absence of heroes and heroes are by the
19:25 way one of the listeners made a great
19:26 point that what was a Tina Turner song
19:28 she did for a road warrior which is not
19:31 done for road wires
19:33 sold to the movie for road warrior to
19:35 play which is we don't need another hero
19:39 what a shitty thing to say he like yeah
19:44 we always need heroes and we need them
19:46 to be reborn constantly because a hero
19:50 to the a 70s is trying to solve
19:53 seventies problems hero in the 80s tries
19:55 to solve 80s problems right so you need
19:57 new groups and because culturally
20:00 speaking we unfortunately like to listen
20:04 to our own race tell us what to do you
20:08 need a black hero for a black culture a
20:10 white hero for a white culture an Asian
20:12 hero for an Asian culture very few folks
20:15 want to listen to someone else tell them
20:16 what to do right and I would assume that
20:20 in a magical world the heroes themselves
20:22 are our heroes enough that they could
20:26 talk to each other across those racial
20:27 Plains and hopefully come to agreements
20:30 about how
20:31 keep us all loving each other etc out of
20:34 war right but I've never heard it said
20:37 maybe it said maybe there's a ten books
20:39 on it I don't know but the softer a
20:41 society gets the less we have strong
20:48 personalities to guide us within our own
20:51 cultural you know groove in America I
20:57 put in one day cultural bucket you know
20:59 we are the quintessential melting pot of
21:03 the planet of course recently the EU is
21:07 trying to catch up there and surpass us
21:08 so they may actually end up doing that
21:11 but the other thing that disappears is
21:14 the are are the group of people that
21:17 would dissent and say that the emperor
21:19 has no clothes on it gets replaced by
21:23 obviously serfdom folks that are just
21:28 looking for the next socialistic handout
21:31 and you know if you're selling socialism
21:35 you're trying to find the stupidest
21:37 humans on planet earth right or I should
21:41 say in many cases I think American
21:43 citizens that go for socialism we can
21:45 just call them stupid right they've been
21:47 taught better they were raised better
21:49 but now they're failures and so they
21:52 want socialism to be their [ __ ] you
21:54 know mommy and daddy and pay all their
21:55 bills for them when you go South America
21:58 you're talking about ignorant people who
22:00 simply have never enjoyed democracy
22:02 they've been inside usually
22:03 dictatorships and so coming to our more
22:07 free less dictator socialism is just the
22:11 next best thing so I don't blame them
22:13 for wanting those relief valves right
22:17 which again always relates back to
22:20 education education education right if
22:23 you want to change the world you got to
22:26 figure out how to speak another language
22:28 and push your message into those regions
22:30 of the world and the form of poetry song
22:34 movies well written blogs nicer
22:40 responses inside conversations right
22:44 say and you so and so racial slur you
22:48 are so stupid done it uh so they run
22:51 away from your comments right like well
22:53 I hate these [ __ ] right so here's
22:55 the question which is if we hit learn
23:00 conclusively and I think an
23:02 anthropologist or sociologist could
23:04 prove this in a week's worth of
23:07 analytical data analysis which is if you
23:11 brought in the metrics for the average
23:14 income the average services that were
23:16 provided to an individual or a family
23:18 how many services those individuals in
23:21 the past actually owned in terms of I
23:25 got my own water I changed my own oil on
23:32 my car I built my house I painted my
23:34 house I mowed my own [ __ ] lawn but
23:37 the quality of life goes up for that
23:42 society right there's a saying that's
23:45 going around and our president recently
23:48 repeated it he certainly didn't write it
23:50 but the I think most people know that
23:54 when you work really hard during a day's
23:58 cycle at the end of the day you are so
24:02 absolutely satisfied with your life and
24:07 I mean it could be in a normal
24:10 circumstance you're an accountant you're
24:11 some technician doing all kinds of
24:14 little fiddly work and your buddy says
24:16 hey will you help me you know shingle my
24:19 roof will you help me clean up my house
24:21 or fix my car and you kind of don't want
24:24 to what'd you do to anyway maybe you get
24:27 into that manual labor thing but you you
24:31 get up there and you work your ass off
24:32 and at the end of the day you can look
24:34 up at that roof
24:35 look at the side of the house and you're
24:37 like man it looks so much better and I
24:39 did that I did that with my own hands
24:41 and the to the dish what I found out is
24:44 to the degree you've never done it
24:45 before you feel even more intense and so
24:48 you hop in your bed at night and you're
24:50 just sore you know you got a couple more
24:52 days worth of work to go you feel so
24:56 good
24:57 you know and that's why everyone working
25:01 is better than anyone standing around
25:04 waiting for a [ __ ] handout because
25:06 the second you have to grab a handout
25:08 your self-esteem goes down a little bit
25:11 no not if you're a little bratty kid in
25:14 America but the triggers that develop in
25:17 these kids who have to grab money from
25:19 mommy and daddy constantly because they
25:20 won't get a [ __ ] job is that they
25:24 simply cannot do any of those things for
25:27 themselves they've been so coddled right
25:31 the other thing that I remember as a kid
25:33 is when remarkable things needed to be
25:36 done the men and women didn't complain
25:39 they just did it right I don't know if I
25:45 how many if I ever told this story there
25:48 was a my grandmother was probably about
25:51 74 and she told me to come over for
25:57 lunch again in tiny little town no
26:00 problem got over to her house and the
26:03 front door's locked
26:04 I'm looking in there and it's like yeah
26:06 there's some table-setting going on look
26:08 some stuff on the oven I'm like okay so
26:10 I go I'm back and I'm looking around I
26:13 can't find her and I'm trying to get in
26:14 the back door it's locked
26:16 just like Jesus Christ what's going on
26:17 here maybe she had to go the restroom
26:19 and got freaked out in her hometown we
26:20 just don't lock things until nighttime
26:22 right and so I'm walking around and I
26:27 hear her voice call out my name and I'm
26:30 like yeah where are you you know she is
26:33 like 20 feet up in this tree clipping
26:36 some branches 74 years old and polyester
26:40 pants with the polyester blouse on and
26:42 just up there climbing around you know
26:46 and she wasn't crazy she's the most
26:49 lucid woman till the day she died man
26:51 and she just repelled down and she's a
26:54 also petite woman I mean she's probably
26:56 about prob about five five five six
26:58 somewhere in there but just totally
27:00 proportional you know she's got some
27:02 rough tough grisly out of his wife would
27:06 that set a bar in my brain what you can
27:09 do at 74 all the
27:10 went way up well now what if my
27:12 grandmother was completely taking care
27:14 of her whole life write checks cut
27:18 everywhere left a huge inheritance just
27:21 you know bring me my tea ring ring ring
27:25 with the bell right do you think she
27:27 would have ever climbed up on that tree
27:29 hell no she probably would have done any
27:32 manual labor and then what would my
27:34 ceiling of what I can do happened to me
27:37 oh well I've got to earn enough money to
27:39 have people that I'm gonna suddenly call
27:41 peasants take care of me
27:44 not my family doesn't work like that
27:46 doesn't work like that for most of us
27:48 right my dad's best friend
27:54 he had a station wagon it had an engine
27:57 that was just a fact I think he
27:59 purchased it he had to he went through a
28:01 bad divorce and his wife got a lot of
28:03 the money and so he had to buy kind of a
28:05 shitty car he bought the station wagon
28:07 and it ran but it ran poorly so he goes
28:10 you know hey Chuck can I use your garage
28:12 to rebuild the engine my dad's I guess
28:16 sure whatever so he backs this thing in
28:19 and it's just my kiss my dad has all the
28:22 tools at the time you know big giant
28:25 craftsman sets and so I just got home
28:27 one side of the car between the wall in
28:29 the car about a foot and I just sat and
28:31 watched this guy tear this engine down
28:33 right down to the cylinders he was pre
28:37 placed in a rings and all kinds of stuff
28:38 and I'm just like what's that what's
28:41 this what's that that's what he was just
28:42 having a blast explaining everything to
28:44 me but what did that teach me well you
28:48 can learn how engines are at work and
28:50 replace them yourself
28:52 obviously on today's cars it gets a lot
28:54 more complex and they did that to stop
28:56 guys from actually being able to easily
28:59 open up engines you know they'll put
29:01 parts in places that are a pain in the
29:05 ass just so you can't get your
29:07 screwdriver in there you know or your
29:09 ratchet or whatever in there to get the
29:10 engine open you had to buy a special
29:11 tool at like five hundred dollars right
29:13 I watched my dad rebuild a Mercedes
29:16 engine once and literally 1979 he had to
29:20 buy a tool that I think was like a
29:22 hundred and thirty
29:23 bucks to go down and around this little
29:25 curve to undo this screw and I'm just
29:29 gonna throw a few more examples out
29:30 where I personally did things I never
29:32 thought I would do which set the bar for
29:34 me right and you guys have your own
29:36 stories right
29:38 we had a big hail storm move through my
29:40 town like two or three in a really short
29:43 period of time but the hail at one point
29:45 was as they say no exaggeration baseball
29:49 sized in fact I think some were softball
29:52 sized but it just blew up a ton of
29:55 windows in the town like thousands of
29:57 windows broke windshields destroyed cars
30:00 you know these Part D poor dealerships
30:02 they'll be out like three or four car
30:04 dealerships in the town and just imagine
30:06 every single car just pitted by these
30:09 things and so now we have insurance
30:14 claims coming in for I don't know how
30:17 many houses are in my hometown but it's
30:18 got to be several thousand now there all
30:21 filing claims and I have to say some of
30:24 these impacts on these roofs I mean it
30:27 looked like just some of these things
30:30 were probably damn near six inches in
30:32 diameter the impact on these things but
30:37 my dad and his buddy we're just kind of
30:41 sitting there with sometime in the
30:42 summertime and they they decided to go
30:45 ahead and start taking these rebuilding
30:47 contracts and we must have replaced I
30:50 don't know half a dozen routes before
30:51 the summer was over I never done a roof
30:54 before but here I show up my dad's like
30:56 hey I want you show up and you know do
30:58 some stuff I'm like okay and you carry
31:01 these 75 pound bags of shingles up this
31:03 rooftop when I probably weigh about a
31:04 buck 30 but he learned me you know he
31:08 taught me he learned to me he taught me
31:10 how to you know snap a line and and
31:12 start at the bottom and work your way to
31:14 the top how to overlap the shingles how
31:16 to do corners how to do the end caps
31:19 across the top not to walk on your work
31:21 how to bring sunglasses every day so I
31:24 forgot him on the very first day and had
31:26 an eye twitch for probably a month and a
31:28 half afterwards from squinting but it
31:31 was hard labor not stuff that you
31:33 normally sign up to do but I was nice
31:35 and young how my father and his
31:37 but he did this in their 40s I will
31:39 never know because it was like it was
31:41 like probably 95 on the ground and about
31:44 130 on the rooftop but that set the bar
31:50 and I came to California and I didn't
31:54 have to do anything because everything
31:56 was an amenity you know there was a
31:59 service for it I did change my l4 two or
32:02 three years eventually I just stopped
32:05 doing that because it became illegal it
32:07 wasn't illegal for you to change the oil
32:09 but I want there's no place to do it
32:11 around here cuz all the driveways are
32:13 slanted and the streets are curved and
32:15 so you just you know if you spilled oil
32:17 you were in major trouble if they caught
32:19 you lots of fines and stuff so it just
32:21 wasn't worth it but when I travel back
32:25 to my hometown for a reunion or just
32:27 just to chill out and then I come back
32:29 to California it's an interesting change
32:33 in the conversation in Kansas I hear
32:37 people to this day and if I was eating
32:39 lunch today in my hometown I would
32:42 overhear conversations about people
32:44 repairing their houses repairing their
32:46 cars changing the oil doing anything
32:48 helping each other out right but if I
32:51 come back to California it's you know
32:54 it's all about the complaint of
32:58 scheduling an appointment to have
32:59 everyone do it for you when outlook
33:03 where we are we're in 2019 the Great
33:06 Awakening is in full effect and sort of
33:11 the intellectual heroes that we have now
33:13 are you guys you truthers you haven't
33:18 suffered necessarily slings and arrows
33:20 of what the settlers had to go through
33:22 and pioneering the West you have
33:25 suffered the slings and arrows of their
33:27 offspring allowing America to be duped
33:31 or Europe or wherever you live being
33:35 duped back into tyranny the kings and
33:38 queens who should be long gone still
33:41 preside over the world there's a story
33:46 of this family called the pursuers
33:49 and I'll probably end up doing an
33:51 episode on him it almost seems like hard
33:56 to believe again the the movie usual
33:59 suspects had a character called Keyser
34:02 söze and for those of you who know what
34:05 that means from that movie if you
34:06 haven't seen usual suspects you have
34:08 robbed yourself of one of the best
34:09 cinematic experiences although it does
34:12 have the boy touch or Kevin Spacey in it
34:16 it's his finest work ever but you know
34:20 the Rothschilds definitely have a lot of
34:23 pictures and a lot history of their
34:25 existence so we think they exists we
34:27 know all the kings and queens of Europe
34:30 and England still exist and of course
34:32 they've duped the people to worship them
34:36 and because they own the press they make
34:39 sure that they are worshiped on a
34:41 regular interval you know how many of
34:44 you really [ __ ] care about the kids
34:45 coming out of the Windsor family I mean
34:48 you don't wish him any harm but you know
34:50 who cares so you're having a [ __ ] kid
34:52 big [ __ ] deal I don't need to read it
34:53 on the front page of the [ __ ] news
34:55 your kids no more special than mine
34:57 right liked a bit mine could outwit
35:01 yours any day why because they've had a
35:04 harder life that those other kids right
35:07 and that creates knowledge which becomes
35:11 wisdom which becomes power right it used
35:15 to be when I grew up you'd have the
35:18 majority of the kids have their families
35:20 altogether mommy and daddy we're still
35:22 married which is great and then around
35:26 1980 just like clockwork when the
35:30 feminist movement moved out when credit
35:33 cards rolled out when the me generation
35:38 you know turned a bunch of people into
35:40 yuppies you have a explosion in divorce
35:49 TV writers TV shows were all about
35:52 divorced couples and and just the
35:55 hardships of this is just the way it is
35:57 man nobody's families on TV were married
36:00 more but in the 70s it was all it is
36:03 enough and happy days and you know Leave
36:06 It to Beaver before that and Brady Bunch
36:09 before that you know it was like
36:10 everybody was married and everybody was
36:11 going through their hardships together
36:14 but in addition to all that they were
36:17 starting a lot less [ __ ] in their life
36:19 too so there was a lot a lot less to
36:22 deal with right you didn't buy anything
36:24 unless you could afford it right so by
36:29 the 90s in America you have nearly an
36:33 80% divorce rate
36:35 I mean if someone's married to someone
36:37 it's their second or third spouse and by
36:39 the way I'm not knocking you if you've
36:41 been divorced by any stretch imagination
36:43 it was bred into us that our standards
36:46 are much tighter now and if anything
36:48 goes wrong a lot of people just divorce
36:51 immediately because they're so terrified
36:53 of it getting worse and worse and worse
36:54 and they fantasize in their brain before
36:57 they allow the situation to to mature
37:00 and perhaps heal itself right but now we
37:04 have a bunch of kids that were born in
37:07 what they traditionally called a broken
37:08 home that was my situation as a kid well
37:12 what happens when you lose that family
37:14 unit well one of the parents is going to
37:16 have to work to pay the bills well if
37:19 they're working then you're not going to
37:20 see them that often if you see them
37:22 they're so freaking tired there's a
37:24 limited amount of engagement for anybody
37:27 who didn't have that and he had a single
37:28 parent and you should call your pairing
37:30 up right now and say you were awesome
37:32 and you still are because it's really
37:35 hard right but now we have millions and
37:40 millions of what I like to call mutts
37:43 that's just like me and some of you we
37:47 have been abused by the system we have
37:51 started our careers well into the
37:54 boom-and-bust cycles that are now just
37:57 there they literally started I think
37:59 when George Bush Senior crashed the
38:02 economy hard core now we had plenty of
38:04 recessions before that but you know it
38:07 wasn't so cyclical you know Jimmy
38:11 Carter's problems in the end of the 70s
38:13 with
38:13 not because they were trying to hurt the
38:15 citizens they were trying to get rid of
38:17 that guy
38:17 by hurting the citizens right to fake
38:21 oil embargo the Iran hostage situation
38:24 they just made him look as horrible as
38:25 possible getting him out of there as
38:27 quickly as possible
38:28 the Savings and Loan scandal of the 80s
38:31 was horrible but it didn't take money
38:34 out of anybody anyone's pocket it just
38:36 was this thing we knew happened we knew
38:38 that the value of our money was probably
38:42 reduced because of the inflation that
38:45 was created to repair that problem but
38:48 people had jobs it was the wrong 80s man
38:51 I mean in American history the 80s are
38:54 probably one of the most prosperous war
38:58 free decades we have ever had in history
39:00 because even in the 50s you know the
39:03 nuclear scare and you had Korea the
39:06 police action that was actually a war so
39:10 for a while there the mutts the
39:12 brand-new tribe of mutts which would be
39:15 I would consider myself a kid of the 80s
39:17 however my life started in the 90s
39:20 fairly quickly after I got to California
39:22 I was here three years and it was 1990
39:25 so I'm growing up in this world and I
39:28 was fortunate enough to have really
39:30 high-paying jobs during that time so I
39:32 prospered like a mofo in that era but I
39:36 definitely had friends that weren't
39:37 doing as well and when you get beat up
39:41 what happens what doesn't kill you makes
39:44 you stronger right well a ton of us got
39:48 really strong now unfortunately at the
39:51 same time the mentorship was at a very
39:56 it was at a absolute all-time minimum
39:59 because the parents again were all split
40:02 up and therefore your parental unit that
40:04 would normally mentor you is working so
40:09 hard that they can't see you half the
40:11 time right or like in my case I moved
40:15 away from my hometown and within within
40:18 the first year I was so beyond anything
40:20 my parents had ever experienced in their
40:22 lifetime that it wasn't their fault
40:24 it was that they with
40:27 to do what I did for living and just was
40:29 like okay that sounds great
40:30 not exactly sure what that is but that's
40:32 great so you can do that accidentally as
40:36 well but now we've all been abused for
40:39 at least 25 nearly 30 years there's
40:45 varying levels of Ages in those
40:46 generations but this is why we're waking
40:48 up because of why or mad as hell and
40:52 we're not gonna take it anymore right
40:53 but if you haven't seen the movie
40:55 Network you must see it it will blow
40:58 your mind and make sure and get to the
41:00 end of the movie because there's a
41:02 speech at the end of the movie that is
41:04 that will blow your mind that someone
41:06 wrote it back in the 70s that someone
41:10 greenlit the script and that it was
41:13 spoken so clearly about how we are
41:16 controlled as citizens of the United
41:18 States and probably most of Europe I
41:21 won't run it for I'll let you see it
41:23 yourself but what is the big thing now
41:26 I'll give you an example of what I'm
41:29 going next we know now without a shadow
41:33 of a doubt that wireless technology
41:36 promotes all kinds of horrible things in
41:39 a human body even low amperage low
41:44 frequency waves the generation 4 and
41:51 generation 5 cell towers the generation
41:53 5 cell cell towers are going to increase
41:57 this damage to the human body on a level
42:00 that is going to be epidemic it's going
42:02 to be looked at I think in hopefully a
42:06 lot sooner than later but if it's the
42:08 same thing as cigarettes in the 20th
42:10 century we're looking at another 30 40
42:14 years before the telecommunications
42:17 companies are absolutely sued out of
42:19 existence they won't have enough money
42:22 to pay for the damages that they will be
42:23 doing to humanity and it's already
42:25 starting but you know wireless
42:27 technology promotes things like leukemia
42:29 I just learned recently that it actually
42:32 promotes and has been proven to create
42:35 diabetic state statuses in human body
42:39 because it messes with the blood sugar
42:40 levels
42:42 nuts hoping that smoking cigars which
42:46 does regulate my blood sugar levels is a
42:49 little defense mechanism we can
42:50 fantasize about that can't we
42:52 but now if I go up to any person in the
42:55 world and said okay wireless technology
42:58 is completely bad for you
42:59 we need to outlaw it as quickly as
43:01 possible until we can come up with a
43:03 safe alternative but we need to get rid
43:05 of it now because it is happening to
43:07 your body while you're asleep while
43:09 you're awake wherever you are in the
43:10 world unless you go off to a remote
43:11 island but even remote islands have cell
43:15 phone towers now right would anyone
43:19 agree with me well a few of you would
43:23 but 99.9% the world's gonna say no way
43:29 well if it creates cancer I'd already be
43:32 dead a cancer if it creates a diabetic
43:33 I'd already be dead of a diabetes you
43:35 know you know I have friends of mine
43:38 that eat a lot of shitty food and I've
43:43 warned them that this stuff causes
43:44 cancer and you shouldn't be consuming it
43:46 and they gave me that line well if it's
43:50 gonna cause cancer we already have it by
43:51 now and now some of them are dying of
43:54 cancer and the food is still in the
43:56 refrigerator or in the cupboard just
44:00 like you know it's a weird thing that
44:03 people just want their vices so bad that
44:04 they're willing to die for them but
44:08 they'll tell you right to your face I
44:09 don't want to die I want to live I want
44:11 to miss everything it's like well act
44:13 like it man act like you care but nobody
44:17 would agree to get rid of cell phones
44:19 would they no one's gonna want to have a
44:21 router with an Ethernet cable in their
44:23 house right there I don't know they
44:28 probably don't care about the smart
44:29 meter on the side of the house because
44:31 they don't want the the meter guy to
44:34 come back and you know come into your
44:36 yard every week to read it it's pretty
44:39 amazing how that used to be the case
44:40 just recently and so we're kind of
44:45 doomed because the overall masses are
44:47 let's face it some pretty stupid
44:49 [ __ ] aren't they it's really
44:51 sad so we are chained to them
44:55 because they don't care yeah some people
44:58 are ignorant about it because no one's
45:00 ever told them which is why you got to
45:02 tell everyone that you know about these
45:04 things and do it very gentle you might
45:08 just say the old-fashioned lead-in well
45:12 you know you know I've read this funny I
45:13 read this really interesting article
45:14 today and it said this this and this and
45:17 this and maybe you did read that article
45:18 then maybe you didn't but what do you
45:21 call watching a youtube video where
45:23 you're looking at science journals being
45:27 read that are admitted in peer-reviewed
45:28 same thing same quality of data right so
45:33 we don't want to go backwards in our
45:35 luxury table and our amenity table we
45:38 want to keep everything that we have and
45:41 just I guess pray for the best
45:46 in California there's this big thing
45:48 about you know well I can say right now
45:52 I don't know a legal American born I
45:56 would say Caucasian and make a better
45:59 example out of it that mows lawns in
46:02 California I have actually have one
46:05 neighbor that has his own mower god
46:07 bless him right but even I I use a
46:12 family you know I don't know their
46:14 status necessarily they do a great job I
46:20 know the previous group that I let go of
46:23 they spoke so little English that I had
46:26 a hard time pointing out things which is
46:29 why my yard went to [ __ ] because they
46:31 just go yeah yeah yeah go told I get it
46:34 I get it and then they [ __ ] do
46:35 whatever they wanted to do so we have to
46:40 find a solution in my opinion before we
46:44 well let's put this way I would like to
46:47 find a solution before we go nose-diving
46:50 straight into the ground and I think
46:53 that the thing we have to remember in my
46:55 opinion is the nosedive is being
46:58 orchestrated now there's some things
47:01 that are orchestrated like you know
47:04 moving Walmart's into every single
47:06 little town in America
47:07 and just bleeding the [ __ ] place dry
47:09 and they don't give a [ __ ] if the
47:11 Walmart does well they just want
47:12 everyone to be out of their own business
47:15 and to forget how to do that right I
47:18 have a my own little theory I call it
47:23 the three-generation rule and I'm sure
47:24 other people have mentioned this in time
47:27 I haven't heard anyone talk about it but
47:29 in my opinion it is nearly impossible to
47:34 carry your family traditions and
47:38 qualities and skill sets three
47:41 generations I think that it is now in
47:45 2019 in America almost impossible to go
47:49 to generations now we all know of these
47:54 families that have taken it for
47:57 generations and sometimes they usually
47:59 skip one but truly sticking with a
48:02 particular skillset that the family
48:03 perfects is rough I have an Italian
48:06 buddy of mine his family owns 65
48:09 pizzerias between Jersey and New York
48:11 City legendary Pizza legendary food but
48:16 I'm telling you the pizza was it was
48:19 unbelievable he was the first born
48:21 American generation of his father and he
48:26 was sent to California to start the
48:28 chain here in California because
48:29 Sbarro's was killing them in the East
48:33 Coast you know that horrible cardboard
48:35 pizza was killing this amazing New York
48:38 Pizza Brooklyn style pizza and so he
48:43 came out here and he opened up a couple
48:45 pizzerias brought the family yeast out
48:48 here and had all the pepperoni ship from
48:50 New York I even think they had water
48:53 shipped out from New York and I happened
48:55 to bump into his food and literally had
48:58 a religious experience taking a bite out
48:59 of a piece of pizza and I mean a
49:02 religious experience and I've seen it it
49:04 was several of his patrons before he had
49:06 to close down but then eventually he
49:09 partnered with a guy who tanked one of
49:12 the pizza joints but they were linked
49:14 through the tax code to both of them and
49:16 so because he screwed up his taxes that
49:19 came and seized my buddy's property in
49:20 the middle of the night
49:21 he came to his restaurant with chains on
49:23 the [ __ ] door it's over man that
49:28 pizza may never be maize mostly has a
49:30 cousin in Glendale I need to go taste
49:32 but you know hopefully that cousin pulls
49:36 it off but we're not even at the third
49:39 generation and the heartbeat of that
49:41 amazing creation is gone
49:45 by the way if anybody wants that recipe
49:47 he's willing to start a franchise
49:49 wherever the hell you are I would just
49:52 love to eat it begin so then then we
49:55 have to ask the reverse question is it
49:58 okay if we create a completely automated
49:59 society where we don't have to do
50:02 anything
50:02 it's the Third Way third act of wall-e
50:04 we're on floaty chairs we have no more
50:07 bones that connect to each other in our
50:09 bodies we have very little use for bones
50:12 because we just lay there and the food
50:14 is put in our mouth and the chair takes
50:17 care of all of our other bodily needs is
50:23 that where we want to go the last Star
50:27 Trek movie the the utter [ __ ] train
50:33 wreck of a last Star Trek movie that was
50:35 ever made had a very interesting bad-guy
50:38 dialogue I mentioned this once before in
50:41 a totally different context but let me
50:42 throw it out here because I think it has
50:44 a tremendous truth to it and then we'll
50:49 throw another zinger out there but it's
50:52 one of these standard boring [ __ ]
50:54 Star Trek movies the new ones the old
50:57 ones are awesome but it's bad guy that
51:00 wants to hurt earth what an original
51:04 [ __ ] thing that is but they locate
51:08 him actually doesn't really want to hurt
51:09 earth he just wants to [ __ ] up the whole
51:10 universe and destroy it so they they go
51:13 over and they get to appointment of
51:16 having a face-to-face conversation this
51:17 guy and somebody says why do you want
51:20 war why do you want that
51:22 and the dude said well the universe
51:27 doesn't give a [ __ ] whether or not you
51:30 exist or whether or not you die
51:32 and if you don't stay strong then you're
51:37 gonna be wiped out by somebody else who
51:39 is more barbaric and once what you have
51:42 or the universe will just tear you apart
51:45 and so what are you saying is because if
51:47 you get too many amenities you're gonna
51:49 get weak if you don't fight enough Wars
51:51 you're gonna get weak your troops won't
51:54 know how to fight it's all theoretical
51:56 now thank God with virtual reality
51:59 systems not all the ones where you have
52:02 to work
52:03 big giant goggles on your head but other
52:05 systems that are being developed we can
52:08 keep our soldiers training without
52:09 having to actually go to war but
52:13 nothing's quite like shooting another
52:14 human being right you're taking
52:15 someone's life that's got to be way
52:17 different than a little digital
52:18 character now maybe artificial
52:23 intelligence will catch up and they'll
52:25 be able to simulate a really gurgly
52:26 death and the soldier will actually have
52:28 some remorse for a virtual kill we're
52:31 not there yet
52:32 so I think there's a tremendous amount
52:34 of truth to hardship creating a better
52:37 life that's sinful to the guy in the
52:43 capri pants trying to get his latte
52:45 right they can barely handle getting
52:48 their order wrong right so now let's
52:51 look at the world it's being run by what
52:55 definitely looked like some evil POS is
52:58 right but now what if someone's
53:02 philosophy up the chain of command is
53:05 simply that simply what I'm saying and
53:09 they look at this whole thing and they
53:11 go okay we got to toughen up our society
53:13 because this this world where everyone's
53:17 smoking weed and sitting at home
53:19 marathoning shows and not going to work
53:21 and in getting an employed living off
53:23 everyone who is working right the whole
53:25 the whole joke with socialism is
53:27 eventually you run out of other people's
53:29 money who the [ __ ] gonna you know make
53:32 food and build shelters who's gonna work
53:35 anymore if the whole thing turns into
53:36 everyone sit at home
53:38 it doesn't work even then in the
53:41 apocalypse
53:42 you got to work if I got to work a
53:44 shitload harder than you do right now
53:45 right but what if they're trying to
53:48 toughen up societies by creating these
53:52 ridiculous chaos ridden situations I
53:59 hate to give them any fuel to create a
54:01 narrative at one point when I couldn't
54:04 figure out the Arab invasion of Europe
54:07 and why Europe would ever allow such a
54:09 thing right there's all kinds of
54:12 theories there's a theory because you
54:13 know they're military level males who
54:17 are not bringing wife's with them in
54:19 most cases which is why they're raping
54:20 the [ __ ] out of everybody and in Europe
54:23 but even the European police right
54:26 imagine you swear an oath to protect
54:28 your people and the European police
54:31 allow themselves to be told not to serve
54:35 justice against someone who just raped a
54:39 kid the judges are all manipulated so
54:43 that they let these people off under
54:45 religious pretenses are you kidding me
54:48 right it's happening everywhere if you
54:51 report we're a sanctuary city is in
54:54 England they can come to your [ __ ]
54:56 house and arrest you and put you in jail
54:58 for a hate crime or something right it's
55:01 out of control in Europe man no but
55:03 thank God those [ __ ] yellow vests are
55:05 fighting back with even the France baby
55:09 but at one point I had this just this
55:12 bizarre feeling that you know imagine
55:16 like an eyes wide shut party without as
55:18 much sex and it's maybe I should say
55:21 something like a Bohemian Grove or I
55:24 can't really picture it in a Bilderberg
55:26 meeting because that's a little too
55:28 invaded by outside resources but some
55:31 really weird coveted meeting where you
55:34 have the those clubs like Club 300 in
55:37 the Club of Rome and just a bunch of
55:40 different groups getting together but
55:41 the the literally like one of each of
55:44 the various regions of the world being
55:47 represented
55:50 and they just simply do some math or
55:52 they flip a [ __ ] coin or whatever it
55:54 is and they decide that whoever wins
55:58 this little straw pulling game your race
56:03 is going to get a gigantic boost or
56:06 maybe you even just win the race war and
56:08 we all support your race spreading all
56:11 over the world and so be it because
56:14 there can't be maybe they decided
56:16 there's too many too many lions in the
56:18 kingdom and there's it can only be won
56:20 and so they know they really can't
56:22 probably convince us to do a world war
56:24 so they just do a soft push and the
56:28 Arabs won and so the like okay this is
56:32 gonna be a hundred two hundred year
56:33 thing but we're going to push all of you
56:36 guys around the world you Arab leaders
56:40 you're to teach your folks to screw
56:42 screw screw I get a bunch of kids going
56:45 your way of law your Sharia law is gonna
56:48 be the way of the worlds it's gonna take
56:50 a while to to peel all that equality out
56:54 of people's hands but it'll happen don't
56:56 worry about it cuz you're just gonna
56:57 outnumber everybody we'll do everything
56:59 we can to pump Planned Parenthood the
57:02 the eugenics group that is anything yet
57:06 Planned Parenthood basically stops
57:08 Parenthood right that's its whole
57:10 [ __ ] purpose passing out birth
57:12 control free abortions all this other
57:15 stuff it's basically to to keep you from
57:17 doing that and I know some of you ladies
57:18 use it because it's a very inexpensive
57:21 way to get health care and I don't blame
57:22 you for that at all
57:23 I don't blame anyone from using
57:26 contraceptive I'm just saying that it's
57:28 not a it should be called like you know
57:33 plan birth control that's what it should
57:36 be called right plan stayin unpregnant
57:38 so this should be called right but what
57:42 if it was just that simple it's just
57:45 that simple and at the same time they
57:47 know that they're gonna create a lot of
57:48 hardship around the world because of all
57:50 the differences and the wars that will
57:51 eventually break out because at some
57:53 point that everyone's gonna pop but
57:56 what's going to happen anything popped
57:59 it's like that North Korean documentary
58:02 I told you about
58:03 these kids coming out of the Middle East
58:05 have lived in towns with [ __ ] sorties
58:09 going over their towns and bombing the
58:11 [ __ ] out of like their neighbors and
58:13 their uncles and their fathers and
58:15 weddings going home you know after the
58:18 ceremony everybody dying they have seen
58:21 things that no first world kid has ever
58:24 seen things I have never seen in my life
58:26 I've never been sitting in my house and
58:28 a thousand-pound
58:29 missile blows up the building across the
58:32 street because there's some suspected
58:35 terrorists there because they want to
58:37 fight for their home country right there
58:38 insurgents in their own country I love
58:40 it so these kids are hardened they're
58:44 battle-hardened they are super months
58:47 right as we were describing ourselves
58:49 previously so man they can grab an ak-47
58:54 and empty the clip and their brains are
58:57 completely normal
58:59 whereas we would be all panicky and
59:01 crazy like what are we doing can you
59:02 believe I'm shooting things in my own
59:04 hometown it's never happened before not
59:06 these kids because women have very
59:10 little equality in those societies
59:12 there's not a there's not a kind of
59:17 Alpha Omega negotiation for what the
59:20 family does or what the father does
59:22 because there is no participation from
59:24 the female she can't turn down sex or
59:27 she'll get killed you know she can't
59:29 disobey her man or she can get killed
59:32 and once that Sharia law moves in whoo
59:34 right I don't mean to turn it into that
59:38 subject but those are just some examples
59:40 of I think hardships that might be
59:43 coming we know that there's a lot of
59:46 European families that are already
59:48 feeling that hardship they worked really
59:51 hard to create amenities and protection
59:54 so that they wouldn't have to have
59:56 armies you realize that most of the
59:59 countries in Europe don't have armies
60:00 that's why they want to pull in the the
60:03 EU army the blue helmets or whatever it
60:06 is but now what if you're a new family
60:10 you're a parent or a soon-to-be parent
60:14 or you want to be a parent fairly soon
60:16 in your life
60:16 and you listen to this show is there
60:20 something that you can do to make your
60:21 family more resilient against this
60:23 formula well I would say one stick
60:29 together with all your might
60:32 you know if your relationship goes
60:35 through super hardships you know I found
60:38 it very healthy to sit down when times
60:41 are good and say to your loved one you
60:46 know well what do you think we would do
60:47 if this happened to us you know I got
60:50 laid off in the middle of the night or
60:51 whatever and I you know we have to live
60:54 off unemployment on my end of the game
60:55 and you know hardships what if this
60:58 happened it'd be really hard to say what
61:01 if I slept with somebody else but
61:04 sometimes that happens too and families
61:06 survive the idea is that a lot of
61:10 families can start doing things for
61:12 themselves that were there are amenities
61:15 in your world when I was a kid my aunts
61:19 would make their own clothing I think
61:21 I've said this once before I used to
61:23 hang out with my aunts because I had a
61:25 ton of them and it's funny I hung out
61:28 with all my aunts at the same time and
61:30 my uncle who was their brother one on
61:32 one it was really funny but we go down
61:35 and they pull out these patterns they'd
61:37 have like pictures of what clothes would
61:40 look like and they buy the pattern we
61:41 take by the fabric and that was a cool
61:43 thing you got to buy a pattern you got
61:45 to get your own fabric and then they you
61:47 know pin it all down and then he cut it
61:48 out and he started sewing it all
61:50 together and they'd have a new outfit
61:52 for the week that they built with their
61:54 own hands you know was it as good as the
61:58 stuff in the store sometimes sometimes
62:01 it was way better just depends on what
62:03 they were making right now whether or
62:04 not they'd made it before but boy they
62:06 kept getting better and better and
62:07 better right I mean what if you went to
62:10 a party and it's fairly difficult for
62:15 men to do this but you go to a party and
62:16 you look better than anyone else and you
62:18 made the clothing ladies isn't that when
62:21 that just be awesome and you know no
62:23 one's gonna have this clothing at the
62:25 party because you made it yourself where
62:28 I am in this Southern California region
62:30 in LA all the way down to Orange County
62:34 there's a lot of cosplay because I'm in
62:38 I'm going in and around the video game
62:40 industry and there's a lot of girls in
62:41 the industry now I thank God and I I'm
62:45 friends with them because of the gaming
62:47 industry first of all and then I see
62:49 them making their cosplay outfits and
62:53 it's unreal what some of these girls do
62:56 they create stuff that's like better
62:58 than any Hollywood movie outfit I've
63:01 ever seen
63:01 or as good as at a minimum but now the
63:07 other thing I see out of their Instagram
63:08 accounts is a lot of other things that
63:12 they do they get involved with art
63:16 projects and you know the husbands are
63:19 doing the same thing if they want to
63:20 dress up like a knight in shining armor
63:23 at the next cosplay or you know Comicon
63:27 or some Renaissance Faire these dudes
63:29 will run out and create their own armor
63:30 right we used to have a listener who
63:33 dabbled in creating armor it's cool you
63:37 know there's a movement in America and
63:42 Europe I don't know how far it stretches
63:44 hopefully its global
63:46 but it's the make group a lot of you
63:50 know what this is for those of you who
63:51 don't it's simply called mate there's
63:53 actually a magazine and a website for it
63:56 but you call yourself a maker and it's
63:59 teaching kids of all ages of all genders
64:02 and everything too but well that they
64:07 can make things and a lot of it has to
64:09 do with robotics so the Arduino circuit
64:12 is a really cool 15 dollar little IC
64:15 board and you can buy regular chips that
64:20 go into your television set censors of
64:23 all kinds light sensors sound sensors
64:25 you can put speakers on it and play
64:27 synthesizers and Ethernet cards and like
64:31 a hundred bucks and you'll starter kit
64:33 and you are creating real stuff a bunch
64:37 of people are replacing items in their
64:38 house they're replacing their garage
64:41 door openers their sprinkler systems
64:42 their thermostats
64:44 instead of going down to do Lowe's or
64:46 Home Depot and paying a hundred and
64:50 eighty dollars for some digital you know
64:54 Bluetooth or wireless thermostat they're
64:57 just going online looking up the recipe
65:00 the little schematic for the Arduino
65:02 version of it and you get little teeny
65:04 tiny are doing those too once you've
65:05 figured out on your big board you get
65:07 the little tiny microscopic woman has
65:09 the exact same components on it they're
65:10 just miniaturized and then you can buy
65:12 your own case and do whatever the hell
65:13 you want to do and the features will be
65:15 exactly what you want it to do and you
65:19 just type it all in and you end up
65:20 learning how it works by doing it right
65:23 you know they give our president a bunch
65:25 of [ __ ] you know for having had his
65:31 own television show on TV and I
65:33 mentioned this once before
65:35 he's written you know at least three
65:38 books one is a joint effort with Robert
65:42 Kiyosaki but he had a television show
65:45 and he gets a bunch of [ __ ] well we got
65:47 a reality television show guy for a
65:49 president this is obviously spoken by
65:54 someone who doesn't get it but what they
65:56 don't get is that the books were all
65:57 geared towards your financial success in
66:00 this world to say I don't want to be the
66:03 only rich guy in town I want to be
66:05 entertained as well so I want you to
66:07 succeed
66:07 so I'll have something to look at when
66:10 you're leaving my towers and going off
66:13 and being entertained right you do your
66:16 job I'll look at your job you look at
66:17 mine and then the television show what
66:19 was it about it's called The Apprentice
66:22 well what is it about it's a reality
66:25 show that teaches people that starting
66:28 your own business requires serious
66:29 tenacity a fair amount of intelligence
66:32 and you know it just taught the
66:38 archetype which has been lost in this
66:40 country but now what's interesting is
66:42 before he brought any celebrities on to
66:43 try Jack up readings people were
66:47 furiously fighting to be on this show in
66:49 the citizen pool well some guys were off
66:52 trying to get in Survivor
66:55 to prove that they had physical
66:57 capabilities to exist in the wild which
67:01 has its own lure right you know it's
67:04 it's going back to the stone Age's and
67:06 succeed you know you got a build your
67:07 own shelter hunt your own food it's a it
67:11 has its own benefits right but financial
67:15 success is really really tough making
67:17 money is hard and if it wasn't hard
67:20 everybody would be rich and so again
67:23 when you ever ask an investor for money
67:25 that's probably a really smart thing you
67:28 should open up with at some point and
67:29 you're beginning sentences is to say
67:31 look I know that it was very difficult
67:34 for you to make your money and I know
67:36 that it's still difficult for you to
67:38 make your money and by me asking for
67:41 your money please understand that I
67:43 respect the the path that you had to
67:48 travel to get every single dollar that
67:51 I'm asking you for and so I'm not
67:53 willy-nilly saying you're rich you you
67:55 should be able to give me money you'll
67:58 you'll succeed a lot more in your pitch
67:59 meetings if you have that one little
68:00 quality in your understanding right but
68:04 now we have Shark Tank everyone's
68:07 fighting to get on that show so that
68:09 they can pitch their idea right works
68:14 like a charm baby so what I what do I
68:17 want you to take away from this episode
68:19 I want you to understand that there's a
68:22 direct correlation between the
68:24 prosperity and happiness of a culture
68:27 and the level of difficulty it is to
68:30 live in that time it is counter
68:35 instinctual for us to want to go
68:36 backwards in our amenity table but if
68:41 it's at the cost of turning into those
68:43 characters in wall-e you know that was
68:46 portrayed in the movie as a cautionary
68:49 tale they were showing you these lazy
68:53 fat people and these floating things
68:57 these floating chairs to warn you
69:00 against ever turning into those people
69:03 now let's imagine we didn't quite yet
69:05 all the way to that movie
69:07 as that was be ludicrous mankind might
69:09 even cease to exist we bunch would be a
69:11 bunch of Daleks right but what would we
69:14 do if we found out that we had been
69:16 pampering ourselves so much that it
69:18 almost gets to the point where you know
69:22 Skynet it's gonna happen
69:24 that robots are actually the the next
69:27 logical life form on this planet or you
69:29 picked picking insects here pick a pick
69:31 an animal and they were supposed to be
69:32 the next super hyper intelligent being
69:35 who's actually still working for a
69:36 living right it might be very
69:39 interesting for all of us to do a little
69:41 inventory on what we were having other
69:43 people do for us and start trying to do
69:45 it for ourselves you know for instance I
69:49 had a lot of skill sets as a kid because
69:53 one I was an only child and I was bored
69:55 to death but there wasn't any other show
69:59 in town unless I made the show myself so
70:03 I learned art at a really early level
70:05 really early age and got extremely good
70:09 at it when that became it almost became
70:14 boring at the same time that I started
70:18 learning how to program a computer and
70:20 of course I was walking into arcades
70:22 from 1978 to you know whenever in the
70:26 90s when it stopped being at something
70:27 that existed but by the time was like
70:29 1982 and my uncle starts teaching me how
70:32 to program and draw in binary and all
70:35 this other [ __ ] it's like 11 years old
70:37 and it was super duper exciting because
70:42 I wanted to make my own games and now I
70:45 had I had the art background to draw on
70:48 graph paper I had the binary translation
70:51 technique to turn a bunch of blocks into
70:54 art and I knew how to layer them on top
70:56 of each other to create multiple colors
70:57 for a single sprite and then programming
71:00 was programming right and back in the
71:02 day you could load a game that you loved
71:04 and then hit a break sequence at the
71:06 beginning in the hit list and you could
71:07 look at the code that actually made that
71:09 game possible and so you learned by
71:12 looking under the hood and I had a I had
71:16 a great mentor who's also his name's
71:19 Keith different guy
71:21 I have to leave out last names for the
71:22 sake of them getting angry but I'm sure
71:26 you would take it as a compliment and
71:27 the funny thing was I looked him up 20
71:30 years ago and I was living in the Bay
71:32 Area we're both from Kansas Chanute
71:34 Kansas turns out he lived in Fremont he
71:37 lived like I don't know ten miles from
71:40 where I worked unbelievable but this guy
71:43 was a super genius and I mean this guy
71:47 built in his own voice voice synthesizer
71:50 and voice recognition system on a trs-80
71:56 computer the all-in-one unit that was
71:59 more professional unit and then he
72:01 ported it to the Apple 2 and these
72:04 computers have like 64 K and so he wrote
72:08 he had it all on floppies such that this
72:11 thing would learn your voice and you
72:14 know it was like this was phenomenal and
72:16 I told him I said look I want to create
72:17 games on the Apple 2 because I just got
72:22 access to one and he goes okay if you're
72:24 gonna do that then you're gonna want
72:25 this sprite editor and I'm like really
72:27 and he goes yeah you just launch the
72:29 sprite editor you draw your asset and
72:33 then you save it and it becomes a sprite
72:35 and this little grid in the disk and
72:38 then you read it and then you can move
72:39 it around the screen it's all black and
72:41 white but I immediately started creating
72:46 a little Tron game for myself that was
72:47 super cool
72:48 my father was into Heath kits and for
72:52 those of you don't know what that is you
72:54 would buy a Heath kit for a particular
72:56 electronic component so you could build
72:59 a television the power amplifier
73:00 anything that they sold and you just get
73:04 all the parts in a schematic and you'd
73:06 have to get your own solder and
73:07 soldering iron and follow the schematic
73:09 and solder everything down to the boards
73:11 and but each board in and wire it all up
73:14 with your buttons on the front and
73:15 everything and it was an amazingly
73:17 high-quality product when you got done
73:19 it wasn't as gorgeous as professional
73:21 products out there that spent a lot of
73:23 money on the thinness of the outside but
73:25 in watching my dad build Heath kits and
73:29 asking enough questions
73:32 I started learning electronics it's a
73:34 couple years later he realizes he had to
73:37 replace a belt kid on his VCR and VCRs
73:41 for those of you don't remember what
73:42 those are they had a lot of belts in
73:44 them you know like just pulleys that
73:47 made things turn around and they would
73:49 always get loose after a while and then
73:50 your screen started in the picture it
73:51 started looking weird and and so he
73:54 ended up telling everybody in the town
73:56 you know if you need new belt kits or
73:58 repairs on your VCR just send them over
74:00 to me and I'll fix them for you and so
74:02 about 80% of the cases it was just a
74:04 belt replacement but Here I am in high
74:06 school and junior high doing some of the
74:09 belt repairs right and then we started
74:12 having like severe injuries to VCRs
74:15 people who had smashed them with their
74:17 fists and shattered the motherboards and
74:19 then we created little jumpers across
74:21 the cracks and believe it or not the
74:23 damn things would still work so I had
74:27 this fundamental knowledge of
74:28 electronics and then I came to
74:29 California I enrolled in this
74:31 correspondence course robotics
74:33 correspondence course which I did for a
74:36 couple years and learned all the basics
74:40 about you know how electrons move
74:42 through circuits so all this all these
74:44 components that have been staring at
74:46 that I'd know what a coil did a
74:48 capacitor a resistor a diode I didn't
74:50 know what these things did and then I
74:53 started learning how those worked I got
74:55 involved as computers soon enough that
74:58 are early enough that I just understood
75:03 the anatomy of what it takes to run a
75:04 computer all the little chips even
75:07 though I did know exactly what was
75:08 inside I knew that chips the sound chip
75:10 that's the digna little signal
75:11 processing chip
75:12 it's the CPU but but as things
75:15 miniaturized now I look and I go oh wow
75:18 that's that old chip look how teeny tiny
75:20 it is you know and you look at a cell
75:21 phone circuit board you're like juice
75:24 unbelievable how teeny-tiny of these
75:26 these computers that are like again up
75:29 to a million times faster than your
75:32 computers from the early 80s style just
75:34 in my hand you know I mentioned all
75:38 those examples that you guys will start
75:40 seeing perhaps your own past where
75:43 you've actually dabbled
75:44 making things you've dabbled in hands-on
75:47 instead of buying the solution you
75:50 bought part of the solution and you
75:52 finished it yourself
75:54 but overall the heroes disappear with
76:00 amenities and heroes I want to put in
76:03 another work is it's actually what I
76:04 wrote on my phone when I put this topic
76:06 in it has to do with bravery as well
76:11 it's no mystery that the guys that join
76:13 the military in the United States of
76:15 America are our alpha male contingency
76:19 they're the natural-born soldiers that
76:23 are willing to die to protect their
76:25 country that's not every single soldier
76:28 some of them just need money to go to
76:30 college or something like that or they
76:31 had nothing else that they could think
76:34 of but those are really rare people and
76:37 they end up usually turning into you
76:39 know great men and women and they live a
76:41 better more organized life because the
76:43 military gave them structure you know if
76:47 you needed to change your country and
76:49 you needed to arrest a bunch of
76:52 criminals that you know exist you know
76:55 that they're responsible for dozens if
76:57 not hundreds of deaths anyone who gets
77:00 in their little social circle if they
77:02 don't go along with everything and they
77:05 end up dead we know who these people are
77:08 we need to apprehend them we need to
77:10 charge them in a due process situation
77:12 make sure that we're right about our
77:14 hunches right using evidence and
77:17 what-have-you but if we don't have any
77:20 brief individuals because society got so
77:24 pussified then what are we gonna do but
77:28 these folks who are my age Revere their
77:32 parents in fact today because they can
77:36 see all the GMOs and horrible food
77:38 cancer-causing foods they know their
77:41 parents were way ahead of the curve
77:43 because in the 70s you didn't need to
77:46 say hey may I please have the organic
77:49 food but not the GMO food there were no
77:51 GMO foods there were hybrid foods that
77:54 we made but they weren't genetically
77:56 modified to not procreate right
77:59 in the end I think that as a parent and
78:04 as a sentient human being you want to be
78:07 as self-sufficient as possible right and
78:10 let me throw this at you while we're on
78:12 this point before I close off here how
78:15 many of you enjoy watching shows like
78:21 The Walking Dead you like playing video
78:24 games like fallout because a part of you
78:28 says man I'd like to live in that world
78:32 not to be eaten up by zombies or
78:34 anything but to just have the ability to
78:38 test my skills could I survive in this
78:41 situation what's the whole survivor show
78:43 is all about it's that a lure of can I
78:45 do it I think I could let me try to
78:47 apply to the show buh-buh-buh and
78:48 there's that a lure that you have to go
78:51 on to a reality show or envision
78:53 yourself and a fictional show on TV or a
78:55 video game to get this I think a lot of
78:58 Preppers are getting off on the idea
78:59 that there will be some sort of
79:01 apocalypse and they're gonna be able to
79:03 survive no more taxes number bills no
79:06 more police you're just in the woods
79:09 shooting deer and eating your venison at
79:11 night right there's an allure and you
79:18 don't need an apocalypse you don't need
79:20 a video game or a television show to
79:22 start taking back the things that you're
79:25 relying on other people for is it more
79:28 work yeah of course it is is it more
79:32 satisfying of course it is how many
79:36 times have you seen the surveillance
79:37 video someone robbing a liquor store and
79:41 you have one of two things happen or
79:44 both one the clerk has been a clerk at a
79:47 convenience store for 20 years he's got
79:51 a revolver underneath the counter he's
79:54 not supposed to have it there but maybe
79:56 he does maybe he's a gun permit you know
80:00 dude and the kid comes in and points a
80:04 gun in just that way that makes you
80:06 think he's never done this before
80:10 or some people just don't give a [ __ ]
80:12 they just grab that [ __ ] revolver and
80:14 put it right in their face I take the
80:15 gun out of the other dudes hand or the
80:17 other scenarios there's a cop retired
80:19 her sorry not retired an off-duty police
80:21 officer who's caring and he's just in
80:24 the back of the store and the front
80:26 stores getting robbed I just saw one the
80:27 other day where there was a kid who
80:28 tried to rob a convenience store and
80:31 there were two cops in this place and
80:35 they descended on this kid in seconds
80:37 man and he just [ __ ] all over himself it
80:39 was over baby
80:40 but why because there were two heroes
80:43 there what made them heroes
80:46 well they've been through the eye of the
80:49 needle of law enforcement or they've
80:51 been through the eye of the needle of
80:52 running convenience store and being
80:55 robbed in the past and they just simply
80:57 said I'm not taking this [ __ ] anymore
80:59 now again the cube movement it's a very
81:03 real movement whether or not Q is real
81:05 or not we're all waiting to see he seems
81:07 to be a pretty bad [ __ ] teller at this
81:09 point but for whatever reason it's
81:11 inspiring the yellow vests they're
81:13 wearing a lot of Q material there you go
81:15 that's where an idea starts to become a
81:18 reality
81:18 the Q guy whoever they are or whoever he
81:22 is they do an amazing job aggregating
81:26 the data that proves that people have
81:29 broken the law they become traitors and
81:32 they've committed treason and Sedition
81:33 well that gives us enough information to
81:36 take our own standards of how we want
81:38 our countries run and we can fight back
81:40 we can fight back legally we can get in
81:42 the streets of Paris and burn the place
81:43 down you know you know maybe some of you
81:47 from Europe can tell me but the news
81:49 that we're getting here is that the even
81:51 the police of Paris are no longer
81:53 willing to to go against the yellow
81:56 vests that they've had to bring into the
81:58 EU army or maybe it's the UN army or
82:02 whatever it is to get rid of these
82:04 people that's some big change folks when
82:08 the police say you know what these
82:11 protesters are actually right and I'm
82:14 one of them when I take this badge off
82:16 and I go home I'm one of them I live in
82:18 the same country and I don't want it to
82:20 be this horrible socialistic thing but
82:23 it's been for too
82:24 I think it's funny that we have this
82:27 movement in the world where everybody
82:29 wants to be independent females
82:31 since the 70s have had this desire to be
82:34 independent they don't want to be
82:36 married just some guy that makes all the
82:38 money and then as soon as he divorces
82:40 her to marry some young girl cuz that's
82:42 what culture says to do
82:43 she has no bank account she has no
82:45 skills and so they broke that formula
82:47 and the women are like you know I'm
82:48 gonna stay in this relationship as long
82:50 as you're not an [ __ ]
82:51 you know and that started making
82:53 families sadly blow up but for the ones
82:57 that sustained the guys you know they're
83:00 being kept in check because they can't
83:02 create this dependency on themselves
83:05 right and then extort whatever they want
83:07 on other wives right but isn't it funny
83:11 that the irony is and trying to be so
83:14 independent our world has become utterly
83:16 dependent on services making us all
83:20 [ __ ] right I think the only thing
83:23 that's gone backwards is we used to be
83:24 able to pull into a gas station until
83:27 about 1990 and you could have full
83:30 service someone would come out and put
83:31 the gas in your car check your oil
83:33 because we didn't change our oil every
83:35 thirty five hundred miles like a bunch
83:37 of morons you just kept putting new oil
83:40 in the car and then about every ten
83:42 thousand miles you'd clean out the pan
83:44 because it has a bunch of shavings in it
83:46 and some dirty old oil but your oil
83:47 burned off you know and you just put
83:50 more in right I think you feel me I
83:52 think we just need to open up discussion
83:56 on this because there's probably a
83:57 billion solutions and I've given some
84:00 coarse brush movements on this I'd be
84:05 interested in your standards if they
84:06 match some of the things I've talked
84:09 about like you you kept it real wherever
84:11 you live and however you raise your kids
84:13 and however you manage your life and
84:14 your relationships your business
84:16 ventures you're working for other people
84:18 ventures for those of you who are
84:21 parents and you've been able to pull out
84:23 any level of success and what I'm saying
84:25 and keeping the household a much more
84:30 manual transmission I'd be interested we
84:34 have to start comparing notes folks I
84:36 mean this is
84:37 this is a little stupid show on YouTube
84:39 but let me tell you what I'm talking
84:41 about I think is of utter paramount
84:43 importance
84:44 you know socialism never went down the
84:49 throats of Americans and probably I
84:53 would say 1985 and before and why
84:57 because we would look at that formula
84:59 and go what do you mean you'll take care
85:02 of me I take care of myself
85:05 I'm not some tool of the king and queen
85:08 [ __ ] that
85:09 that's what the Revolutionary War was
85:11 for you know it freed the entire world
85:14 for Christ's sake but it's because we
85:18 were educated on these subjects we felt
85:21 the satisfaction of a job well done
85:23 there was no you know you collect trash
85:27 and so you're a lower human being
85:28 someone that [ __ ] I don't know builds
85:31 cars it was like you do your job I do my
85:33 job you feel good yeah you want to have
85:35 a beer after work yeah let's do that
85:36 we're all in the same level at one point
85:39 now we're all skewed we have class
85:41 structure now anyway if you haven't been
85:46 to deep thoughts radio.com
85:47 that's where you can change feed types
85:49 so if you're coming in through video
85:51 because you just found it but you like
85:53 to have it in podcast form go there
85:56 click the podcast there's a link to
86:00 iTunes and a link to Google Play so you
86:02 can find out whatever device you have
86:05 there's also a locked Facebook group
86:07 again we have just been increasing the
86:10 quality of the conversations and the
86:12 posts we just have some fantastic
86:14 listeners who some post every single day
86:18 other as opposed to every other day but
86:20 we're just all over the map and a really
86:22 cool homogeneous way so what we're
86:25 talking about is usually within the
86:27 wheelhouse of what you liked about the
86:30 show and so it's cool we're all kind of
86:32 on the same wavelength before the show
86:34 existed in the first place right there's
86:36 also a patreon page and for those of you
86:39 don't know what that is you can donate a
86:41 dollar or up a month to the program what
86:46 you gain by doing that is that you get
86:47 behind the scenes and you get to see
86:50 these episode
86:51 before they're officially released on
86:53 YouTube so if you're into that early
86:55 release program that's for you and again
86:58 you'll go there there won't be anything
87:00 on there if you're not a member of the
87:02 group but as soon as you put a buck in
87:04 you'll start to see all of the previous
87:06 post and you get an idea of what you're
87:08 going to get for your money there's a
87:10 store up there with a couple shirts
87:12 knock yourself out
87:13 I need to make a season four shirt
87:15 anyway take care of yourself in someone
87:18 else and I'll see in the next deep
87:19 thoughts over now
87:20 [Music]
87:29 you
87:29 [Music]
