00:30 all right so it's about 3:00 in the
00:35 morning and I've been experimenting with
00:38 this with the cigar with a big hole down
00:42 the center yeah I read a book and I
00:45 forgot what its name is I probably could
00:47 go in my other room and pick it up and
00:49 look at it it wasn't I didn't buy it for
00:53 this specific thing and I don't even
00:55 know if I bought it or someone gave it
00:56 to me what the deal was I tend to
00:59 remember I bought it the book said that
01:02 if you and I mentioned this once an
01:04 episode a billion years ago
01:08 yes I'm immortal
01:10 so deal with it the book said that
01:13 scientists have figured out that the
01:15 longer you stay up the more you're right
01:17 where you're right brain takes over and
01:19 your left brain goes to sleep and that
01:21 creative things happen more when you're
01:24 tired then when you're lucid meaning
01:28 less logical things if you want to think
01:31 logically get a good night's sleep drink
01:33 your coffee you're all Bing Bing Bing
01:34 Bing and you can do all that hard math
01:36 stuff but if you want to be creative get
01:39 really tired and then you forced your
01:41 brain to think and amazing things happen
01:45 so I'm experimenting with that every
01:48 once in a while because I'm definitely
01:50 tired I definitely wanna do the show now
01:54 if the longtime listeners you know that
01:55 I have a series on dreams and all I'm
02:00 doing is I am and have been for several
02:04 years now especially because of the show
02:08 not only having bigger and better dreams
02:12 but then analyzing them on the show with
02:15 sort of a you know a charter a topic a
02:19 theme which then results in the title
02:22 I'm not exactly sure what to call this
02:24 episode but you do because it's on the
02:26 front of the of the video I experimented
02:30 with the idea of like calling it dream
02:32 Chronicles but that doesn't quite nail
02:34 it perhaps weren't into the titles
02:37 so where am I going to come from today
02:40 I've been having these dreams for the
02:43 last probably two weeks that are unlike
02:47 any dreams I've ever had especially
02:48 starting a week ago you know I always
02:53 tell you guys that I dream in real time
02:54 and that if I dream and I feel like I've
02:59 dream two hours I wake up literally two
03:01 hours later go P whatever rollover check
03:05 the time and it's two hours has passed
03:07 it's more easy in the morning when I'm
03:10 you know sleeping in because I stayed up
03:13 late making episodes for you guys and
03:15 then the time is a critical thing I want
03:17 to get up before noon or at noon at the
03:19 latest right I hate getting up late and
03:21 I hate going to bed late but I hate
03:23 sleeping even though I love my dreams
03:25 because even though I enjoy my dreams
03:27 nothing's happening in this world and
03:29 that's why I'm alive we're probably
03:31 about a week ago little less than a week
03:33 ago I think I can categorically say I
03:36 had the longest continuous dream in my
03:40 life and it was as close to because and
03:44 it's funny because I said two episodes
03:47 ago that I was having incredible dreams
03:49 I need you to know that the one I'm
03:50 talking about happened after that
03:52 reference this one was epic and it's
03:57 been going on now for probably three out
04:00 of five days I've been having these
04:02 types of dreams I may have another one
04:03 tonight and I don't know what's causing
04:07 this I'm dreaming full episodes same
04:13 characters same general storyline even
04:17 though the locations do change I'm not
04:18 traveling that far away from where I am
04:20 but the places that I'm traveling are
04:22 very quaint and interesting and it's a
04:27 different City it's a different town
04:28 it's all different circumstances I am
04:31 NOT my name and I don't do this show and
04:33 I don't live in California I am
04:35 someplace else but it's nice the people
04:40 are interesting and we're friends and
04:43 every once in a while like my father was
04:46 in one of the dreams he's probably the
04:49 most reoccurring care
04:51 I have in my dreams I've just noticed
04:53 which is very strange he and I stop
04:55 living together when I was 16 he and I
04:59 have been emailing recently so perhaps I
05:01 that's how he injects himself in my
05:03 dream but he's just there chilling out
05:05 and he chills out of my dreams exactly
05:07 how he chills that at my house he digs
05:10 movies you know he digs TV shows and we
05:12 just sit and watch him and have fun and
05:14 talk and one thing that happened has
05:17 happened in the past and it's a sad it's
05:21 a sad thing that happens to my father's
05:22 character and dreams which is if I'm in
05:25 a dream and for whatever reason I got to
05:27 really take a a big leak you know you
05:30 got a brick the bathroom sorry ladies
05:33 he's the he's the guy who's sadly
05:37 burdened with pissing me off in the
05:39 dream so that I wake up and poor guy you
05:44 know he and I have been getting along
05:45 since geez forever and but he gets the
05:49 duty of like coming in and something
05:50 gets riled up and it's sometimes this
05:52 irrational nothing happens I fly off the
05:55 handle something that I point my
05:58 discontented him which I hate when I
06:00 wake up I'm like I'm trying to race that
06:02 on my mind you know I'm like god I love
06:03 my dad you know the problem poor guy but
06:07 he's not even remotely the subject of
06:10 this video I guess I'm trying to figure
06:13 out how this is starting to increase and
06:19 it's you know my dreams have been very
06:24 very detailed to the point I feel like
06:25 it is sort of another world but when
06:28 they're cut to two and maybe three hour
06:30 increments and then the next two or
06:33 three hours is different than the
06:35 previous two when you wake up you
06:39 typically can't remember all the way
06:41 back to the first dream you had for that
06:44 evening because it's so distant so much
06:46 has happened and because there's no
06:48 continuity in the experience you know
06:52 like if I if you went to Disneyland for
06:54 instance well you you have to stand in
06:57 line for the tickets you got to wait in
06:58 line to walk in the door and have it
07:00 punched and then there's the first
07:01 experience I can experience first right
07:03 second right
07:04 at least even though the rides are
07:06 different there's this sort of common
07:09 thread through the experience even if
07:10 you go to California Park it's still
07:12 part of your day because you come back
07:14 over to Disneyland and watch the
07:16 fireworks and do whatever the hell you
07:17 got to do it's it's sewn together
07:21 well my non-sequitur dream segments sort
07:25 of topple each other and I only really
07:27 remember the last one as you can piece
07:29 together here what I'm having now is
07:34 sort of the equivalent of going to
07:37 someone's house for eight hours going
07:38 into some of you know taking a vacation
07:40 somewhere for eight hours or most likely
07:43 less but it it feels like that episode
07:48 in next generation where Picard gets
07:51 zapped by a satellite just out in front
07:54 of the ship and he ends up living an
07:55 entire lifetime inside the simulation
07:58 inside the satellite and the satellites
08:01 entire purpose is to educate those that
08:03 find the satellite to know that this
08:06 particular society which is long gone
08:07 due to a natural disaster existed and
08:12 Picard is playing a characters this old
08:15 boy plays a gentleman of his own age and
08:19 then he ages all the way up to his 70s
08:21 or 80s or 90s or whatever it is and then
08:22 he punches out and so he wakes up and
08:26 he's like oh my god I lived a whole life
08:28 and that other thing I mean like not
08:30 figuratively he 100% lived this life so
08:34 he has a an adjustment phase of becoming
08:37 jean-luc Picard again and running a
08:40 starship I mean it's it's a beautiful
08:43 episode and it's the only episode that
08:46 doesn't end with the credit music those
08:50 of you have seen it no I'm just going to
08:51 digress on this for split second more he
08:55 had this flute at the other universe and
08:57 he learned how to play this song on the
08:59 flute so when he came back to the it's
09:02 like a piccolo flute sort of thing when
09:04 he comes back to the ship he gets it out
09:05 and he plays it as the credits roll it's
09:09 this little heartfelt song you know and
09:11 he's sort of saying goodbye to this
09:12 world that he got to experience
09:17 so mine don't have any negativity
09:19 attached to them they have pretty much
09:22 all positivity and I had this dream that
09:28 this scene in my dream that I've had the
09:34 feeling a couple times before but for me
09:37 there's something very special about
09:39 this feeling very special about the
09:42 scene and it has to do with walking into
09:46 a room in this sort of office building
09:51 and we're always in these office
09:55 buildings sometimes it has a mall kind
09:57 of feeling sometimes it just has a
09:58 amphitheater feeling it's like that old
10:02 book they wrote I think somebody wrote a
10:04 book about a tower and I think it even a
10:09 poltergeist 3 did this were Society
10:12 lives in a building like your whole life
10:15 is in a skyscraper and you never leave
10:17 everything's in there like these
10:19 gigantic monolithic buildings had never
10:21 been built but you've theorized you know
10:25 if you built the building a mile high a
10:26 mile wide and mile in all directions you
10:28 could fit everyone and planet Earth in
10:29 it so you build one of those you put a
10:32 tiny portion of Earth in there and you
10:34 could live in it forever
10:36 it's sort of at times what my dreams
10:39 feel like but I do go outside quite
10:41 often as well because I travel between
10:42 buildings this is the weirdest thing
10:44 right but I walk into this room and I
10:48 have a gigantic feeling and it's I'm
10:53 gonna try to put this into words it was
10:57 I you know I'm in a dream so dreams you
11:00 have a loose version of your senses
11:04 right you barely have touch you
11:07 definitely have sight and sound you
11:10 never usually have that much taste
11:12 although I have had taste in a dream as
11:14 I've reported before but it's a very
11:17 unique thing it's a very unique instance
11:18 for me personally I just don't have a
11:20 lot of taste I think I'm not eating food
11:22 in my dreams that often I'm not having a
11:24 taste to it but I walk into this room
11:27 and I get the distinct sense
11:30 that I am in the architects room there's
11:34 plural because there was probably 20 to
11:37 30 scientists in this room all wearing
11:40 white coats of some kind the room is
11:44 incredibly designed the room has big
11:49 giant cubes for desks probably about
11:54 three and a half feet four feet and
11:56 everybody four feet or so just so your
11:58 elbow is kind of rest on the top of the
12:00 desk usually about 36 inches is the
12:02 minimum desk but these are standing
12:04 desks and I walk into this room there's
12:08 two parts to the vision one I walk in
12:12 the room and I walked past the
12:14 scientists and in the backroom they're
12:19 all these cube tables and they're all
12:20 different sizes and it looks like a
12:26 blender 3d model of a six-sided room I
12:30 pray as more in six sides like just the
12:33 right wall was turning inward and had
12:36 another little Junction to it no big
12:38 deal it's all enclosed probably just
12:40 standard 8 9 foot ceiling and it's a
12:46 mist in the room like you turn on the
12:49 mist filter and blender 3ds so you have
12:51 like a you know it's breaking down the
12:53 light as it goes into the distance and
12:56 it's only probably about 15 20 feet for
12:59 me the back of it I'm not the center of
13:01 the room at this point but as I walked
13:04 in the room I got this epiphany as if
13:07 someone was sending it to me you are in
13:10 the room of either the dream architects
13:14 or the architects of the reality that
13:18 you're in as if I stepped behind the
13:21 curtain and it was this incredible
13:24 feeling that that was true and that I
13:27 was being allowed and to see it and so I
13:31 turned around because I know I've walked
13:33 past what I really want to see which is
13:35 what are they doing what are they
13:37 working on what does an architect of
13:40 this whatever they do do
13:42 and so I pull back about a third into
13:46 the room and I'm still facing like I
13:49 turned around I walked back 20% turning
13:52 around and now I'm standing next to a
13:54 bunch of scientists and there's like
13:56 these weird little like desk lights I
13:59 can't remember if it was projecting down
14:01 or I think it was almost like the top of
14:03 the cube seemed to have a backlight to
14:05 it
14:05 so they could see what they were doing
14:07 and they had everyone had instruments
14:10 and white paper and in front of me is
14:15 the guy he's bout five foot four or five
14:18 kind of a pudgy guy he had a big smile
14:21 on his face and I got the distinct sense
14:23 he was new to the room because he had
14:27 brown glasses on he had the lab coat
14:30 right up to his neck and it looked too
14:34 big on him like he's not big enough to
14:35 wear this thing but it you know fell
14:40 down about his knees or so and he is
14:43 turning around and he's got one of those
14:46 little compass things used to draw
14:48 circles right sort of like the thing in
14:50 the mason doodad right and he is turning
14:54 around and he's got it up and the room
14:56 is kind of laughing and he's laughing -
14:58 and it's as if he is trying to
15:01 illustrate something on a piece of paper
15:03 like it's the piece of paper in a second
15:05 and he's just he's like its first day at
15:09 work you know something like that
15:10 towards the beginning of his career and
15:12 whatever the hell they're doing here and
15:15 there's a definitely taller guy to the
15:16 right seems like a senior director kind
15:18 of guy and then there's a bunch of dudes
15:20 at all these cubes and some of them
15:21 still have their heads down and their
15:23 work and some of the people are closer
15:25 to whatever event occurred here are
15:27 laughing and so now I look down at the
15:31 paper because I'm kind of like what's
15:34 going on you have to know I have this
15:36 euphoric feeling that won't stop it was
15:39 super intense when I walked halfway into
15:41 the room and I looked at the room by
15:43 myself I got this distinct feeling of
15:47 like oh my god I'm here it was like I
15:51 always well it's like
15:54 I can't say I ever wanted to go here
15:59 it's just I'm here and I know what this
16:02 is and this is special I remember in the
16:05 dream I was thinking there's the woman
16:08 who died at eight years old in the 50s
16:11 like 54 and she said she died and went
16:16 to this place and she walked into this
16:19 office with glass walls which is what we
16:22 have like the west-world kind of place
16:23 and she said she looked in and saw
16:25 things that look like flat TVs keyboards
16:29 that were backlit so like a computer she
16:33 described this in the 50s to her parents
16:36 and to the doctors and they were like
16:38 yeah she said yeah the keys were lit up
16:40 - you could see the letters on the keys
16:42 and she said I was looking around
16:44 everyone was looking at me like I
16:47 shouldn't be here but not in the fact
16:50 that I'm in trouble but just yeah you
16:52 know someone come get this little girl
16:54 and then an older gentleman came up to
16:57 her and grabbed her and took her further
16:59 in and so she's looking left and right
17:01 looking left to right seeing things that
17:02 don't exist in the real world yet like a
17:05 backlit keyboard didn't exist for almost
17:07 another 50 years flat-screen monitors
17:10 mean another 50 years right with this
17:14 guy supposedly told her look you're not
17:15 supposed to be here and go back down no
17:18 big deal you're not in trouble just you
17:21 know not supposed to be here so I didn't
17:24 get any sense I wasn't opposed to be
17:25 there I got the sense I was being
17:28 allowed to be there and this probably is
17:31 just a dream
17:32 probably just a dream but look down -
17:34 piece of paper and I saw this beautiful
17:38 draftsman work and they were drawing
17:41 sort of mechanical schematics of
17:43 something and I take it that the paper I
17:48 was looking at which was where this
17:50 seemingly new recruit was trying to
17:55 figure out his tool that was the joke I
17:56 think he was holding up this tool and it
17:59 was like he turned around to say how do
18:01 you get this thing to do it again what
18:02 I'm trying to do and they'll laugh and
18:04 he's holding it up and he's kind of like
18:06 yeah he's laughing like yeah I don't
18:08 what I'm doing exactly and but I looked
18:11 down it was his beautiful illustration
18:13 of this sort of pipey curve and it had
18:19 like if you're like a Photoshop person
18:21 or illustrator person imagine like a a
18:23 ten point stroke outside line move in a
18:28 few millimeters and now you have like a
18:30 one-point stroke on the inside and then
18:32 inside that there were certain symbols
18:36 inside which may have been like
18:38 mechanical fittings or something and
18:40 there's just a ton of paperwork there
18:42 drawing on paper it was interesting and
18:46 just seeing this bustling room kicked
18:51 off this amazing dream now I told you in
18:56 the couple episodes back that had fallen
18:58 in love with the girl and that it was
19:00 getting intense but still that was a
19:01 fairly segment to dream maybe two or
19:03 three hours long as this particular
19:06 dream progressed it took on the texture
19:10 of really well I should say this it's
19:16 like um let's say that this reality that
19:20 we're in that you can hear me in for
19:21 this video let's say that that's 100%
19:24 reality as we commonly agree as we
19:28 concede probably an average dream I'm
19:32 gonna estimate is maybe twenty-five
19:37 thirty five percent of that hundred
19:38 percent at best but the thing I'm
19:42 starting to have now it's still missing
19:45 senses it's still missing my body
19:51 obviously feeling my body move around
19:53 it's like clothing in every step I'm
19:56 taking I'm not getting tired if I stand
19:58 up all day in this dream there's none of
19:59 that but the interactions are much more
20:06 detailed the dialogue in the dream is
20:08 much more detailed and much more close
20:10 to reality than anything I've ever had
20:14 before I feel like for myself to myself
20:19 that's a big statement
20:22 because my dreams have been so detailed
20:24 and I have very close friends in my life
20:26 and I share my dreams with them and and
20:28 they've heard my dreams for years and
20:31 they just I can't believe you have all
20:33 these dreams I can't believe you dream
20:34 more than anybody I know and it's just
20:36 getting nuts getting crazy you know and
20:40 I tell my dreams so I can remember them
20:42 as soon as you tell a few dreams it's
20:45 like crazy and now I I use a dictaphone
20:48 a lot because my running mentor told me
20:51 to buy one the second that I told him I
20:53 was you know super duper serious about
20:57 writing which was 12 years ago and as I
21:01 tell you guys you know speak things out
21:02 loud because your brain remembers them
21:04 better and it's good for you to hear
21:07 your own voice read your scripts out
21:09 loud to yourself read them to other
21:11 people I just sat on this patio and read
21:13 half of my latest film to a close friend
21:16 of mine I found a couple typos like
21:20 ridiculous typos and my father just went
21:23 through the script twice to clean up you
21:26 know some basic stuff hint like I'm so
21:29 shamed I'm like oh my god
21:30 stupid spelling you know the word bottom
21:33 instead of bottle in just cheese rookie
21:37 crap and so these dreams when I wake up
21:45 it is disorienting what my dreams are
21:49 real the more it's disorienting because
21:53 I'm having a bit of that Picard anxiety
21:58 it's not really anxiety in terms of true
22:00 anxiety the emotion anxiety but it's
22:02 sort of like I have to peel away from
22:06 having been in this other reality and if
22:10 it's a day I don't need to do anything
22:12 like this is Saturday and I go to sleep
22:14 tonight maybe I have one of these maybe
22:15 I don't so I don't need to get up you
22:18 know I don't need to police myself I
22:20 mean I should but I don't have to and so
22:24 sometimes I sleep in further than I
22:26 should simply because I can't convince
22:28 my mind I'm not in this freaking dream
22:30 that I'm in some I feel like I'm in
22:33 reality even though my
22:35 whole since tree my five senses are all
22:38 stunted when you're in a dream you're
22:43 not necessarily you don't have this
22:44 point of reference unless you're going
22:46 lucid I've had very few a few lucid
22:49 dreams but when I was in that room with
22:52 the cube desks I had that vision that
22:57 sorry that memory of that girl was an
23:00 out grown woman talk about her weird
23:03 dream seeing computers that didn't exist
23:05 I'm in that room going him am I in the
23:09 same world that she was talking about
23:10 very lucid but not like oh yeah I live
23:15 in California and I'm this old and I do
23:17 this for a living indebted uh none of
23:19 that I can only assume and I'm passing
23:23 this on to you in an episode because
23:25 maybe this works for you as well
23:27 now we've had probably handful listeners
23:31 over time coming you know coming to the
23:34 comments and say I dream lucid dreams
23:35 constantly for me if I could have lucid
23:40 dreams constantly as they are told to me
23:42 by various listeners here's what I would
23:44 assume if I never had to go to sleep
23:48 because I was lucid dreaming you know
23:52 you go to sleep you're getting your rest
23:54 but your lucid dreaming one I wonder if
23:56 you really feel relieved when you get it
23:58 when you wake up but two I would
24:01 continue working and solving problems I
24:04 we continue writing my scripts I will
24:07 tell you this right now and I've said
24:09 this once before when I work on music in
24:11 my dreams
24:13 the music is unbelievably amazing
24:16 whatever I'm trying to do the beats are
24:19 good the melodies especially the
24:20 melodies might godlike if I could
24:22 transcribe half the music I hear when I
24:25 go to sleep at night I would be either a
24:28 writer for other musicians or whatever
24:31 if I could figure out how to make it
24:31 work with my style of voice and
24:33 instruments would be a very wealthy man
24:38 and so I have my doubts about how lucid
24:42 people dream I think it's a boast that
24:45 sounds unbelievable it's like people who
24:47 think people who tell me they have
24:48 Autobody spray
24:49 he says every single night I go okay to
24:53 find that gym well you know I lift out
24:54 of my body and I go anywhere in the
24:55 house I want I go okay have someone put
24:59 something in a dresser drawer that you
25:01 don't know what it is and then go to
25:03 sleep
25:04 wake up be honest what's in that drawer
25:07 you should be able to push your head in
25:10 there oh yeah it's a sweater it's a
25:12 coffee mug it's whatever and I did this
25:14 to a guy a long time ago who said that
25:17 his girlfriend was telling him this that
25:19 she was having other body experiences
25:21 every night and she could walk around
25:22 the room and I gave him that little test
25:25 they said well put something in there
25:26 put something in your top dresser drawer
25:28 and have her look in it and tell you
25:31 what it was and that was last time I
25:33 ever heard about that and he thought was
25:34 funny as hell because he was tired of
25:35 hearing it himself but what's really
25:38 interesting about dreams and this has
25:42 been completely serendipitous because
25:44 again I don't go into a dream and then
25:46 immediately wake up and realize I'm
25:47 doing it and then I can consciously test
25:49 things about myself but one of the
25:52 things I've realized about dreams is
25:54 that you can architect why should see
26:00 this you end up sometimes being yourself
26:04 100% and then you end up being this sort
26:08 of more interesting version of yourself
26:11 almost as if you had a witness witness
26:14 relocation program
26:16 and let's say you've been a jerk to
26:18 people and you've been testy and it
26:21 never worked out and everybody hated you
26:23 or you just didn't talk to you with a
26:25 fear G or whatever and you hated that
26:27 you wanted to be that way because you
26:29 serendipitously became who you were
26:31 right
26:32 you just accidentally become who you are
26:35 and now you want to intentionally
26:36 reinvent yourself and it's you're like
26:39 it's like the old story about Jesus from
26:41 Nazareth you could never be the Son of
26:44 God in his hometown because they're like
26:46 we know you and you're a little kid and
26:48 so in a dream you can become anything
26:51 that you want and we we tend to I think
26:57 serendipitously practice
27:00 a better version of ourselves it's like
27:03 lieutenant Barclay that his name in Star
27:06 Trek who would go into the holodeck he
27:08 was a really nervous nel in the real
27:11 world stuttered all the time this actor
27:13 is amazing he plays this guy and there
27:16 was an episode where they couldn't find
27:18 him and he kept hiding in the holodeck
27:20 because in the holodeck he was a
27:22 swashbuckler and he would take out the
27:24 three musketeers and he was just a
27:26 ladies man and he was always macking
27:29 down on counselor Troi I would too and
27:33 he had to practice who he was and so
27:36 they were trying to convince him dude
27:37 why don't you bring that amazing version
27:39 of yourself out into the real world and
27:41 for whatever reason he couldn't I think
27:45 they gave him a little scene where he
27:47 was a little bit more that way for a
27:50 little while but then he regressed back
27:51 into his sort of weird cowardly mousy
27:56 personality which was extremely
27:58 endearing again that actor played that
28:03 role so well that when I first bumped
28:05 into that that character lieutenant
28:07 Barclay but they come saying his name
28:09 right I was annoyed as hell with this
28:12 character because that whole weakness
28:14 thing anytime there's a character that
28:15 plays a weak who's not mentally ill in a
28:17 movie or television show it just bought
28:20 like the kid in Saving Private Ryan that
28:23 let his buddy get killed by the Nazi
28:25 upstairs I mean I can't tell you how
28:28 much I hated that guard to the et kid
28:31 but of course that's part of what the
28:33 script was written to do he played it
28:34 perfectly so to the degree I disliked
28:37 him as a character in the movie well
28:39 that means he got an A+ for the day
28:41 because he did exactly what he was hired
28:43 to do so hats off to him but sometimes
28:49 you know I don't know what it's like to
28:52 be I mean I this sounds like a boast I
28:56 hate the way this is gonna sound but
28:57 I've always been very confident always
29:00 whether I'm full of [ __ ] or not I'm
29:03 always very very confident have been in
29:06 my life and I cuz I kind of think you
29:09 know look I can only do my best I am
29:11 going to do my best
29:12 I don't tell lies and backstab people so
29:17 I don't have to keep track of all that
29:18 crap I can just be myself constantly
29:20 always helping people so I don't worry
29:22 about that yeah you know I've had times
29:25 I've been betrayed and my version of
29:29 being pissed off is extremely bad it's
29:33 like he didn't want to be around me when
29:34 that kind of stuff happens cause we're
29:35 like oh it's a different person
29:37 but takes a lot of betrayal to even
29:39 trigger that at me you know so
29:43 practicing in a dream you know for me
29:47 it's probably being less intense just
29:49 being chill you know that's the fact
29:50 that is the arc that is actually what's
29:52 happening to me in these dreams is I'm
29:53 just like in a dream there's no bills
29:56 there's no taxes there's no nothing
29:58 right
29:59 no one is not experiencing jealousy or
30:04 envy or anything like that I mean I'm
30:06 that's probably happened in my dreams
30:08 that point is a point in time but man as
30:11 of last several years it's all been
30:14 chilling out relaxing you know I did
30:17 have my car got towed in a dream the
30:21 other day and boy you know you think of
30:25 like a million ways to kill a person
30:27 when you think about someone tow in your
30:28 [ __ ] car especially it was like I was
30:31 there three minutes or something in this
30:32 dream and my car got towed and I was
30:36 like it's one of those [ __ ] things
30:37 where you know they told me that bill
30:39 was gonna be $2,000 in my dream it was
30:42 like man what is this scam you know this
30:45 little parking lots or they just
30:46 literally vultures they know you're
30:48 gonna park there the signage is really
30:50 shitty and they're gonna pop you for 160
30:52 bucks or something like that it's all a
30:55 huge scam the government looks the other
30:57 way I mean it's like come on you can't
30:59 change the price of milk but you can
31:01 [ __ ] tow me and make up the price I
31:03 mean seriously come on
31:05 anything like the repo man you know it's
31:07 not like you didn't pay the bill and
31:08 repo man just get shorter in the stick
31:11 right the repo man is between the bank
31:13 and the person and they have to be the
31:14 messenger and it's just a horrible
31:16 situation right but anyway these dream
31:20 lives that maybe that's what you call it
31:23 you know it's like you're living a whole
31:25 life in a dream
31:26 I think I got there by continually
31:30 continually analyzing my dreams for
31:34 their beginning middle and end narration
31:39 after I woke up thus every time I go
31:42 back to sleep it ceases to be this
31:46 chaotic experience it becomes a full
31:49 story and so what ends up happening
31:52 nowadays is I have many chapters which
31:55 each chapter has a beginning middle and
31:57 end except instead of being a complete
32:00 non sequitur transition where the
32:03 location changes and all the people
32:05 change so drastically that my mind
32:08 thinks is a different dream these are
32:11 being very consistent and people even
32:14 rotate in the dream but here's the key
32:18 my dream is keeping at least two to
32:21 three people in the dream the entire
32:25 dream so it's becoming threaded the
32:28 location is very organic and consistent
32:33 so if I were to park my car at the
32:35 beginning of the dream everything's fine
32:37 because I got to go in for a party you
32:38 got to go to meet people we're gonna do
32:40 something together I mean I've gone to
32:41 movies in dreams and watch movies spin
32:43 and the movie theaters always designed
32:46 really bizarrely like completely
32:49 ridiculous theater seating and and I
32:53 don't know it's just weird my mind isn't
32:57 completely perfect with that then I
32:59 think okay am I really
33:01 visiting a non reality or am i visiting
33:04 a different reality I hope this is
33:07 interesting I could see how this episode
33:09 would be extremely boring for some
33:10 people I don't know if I wish this on
33:13 you or not I think because you can
33:19 practice a different life it's very
33:24 interesting you know I here's something
33:26 that I get out of these dreams now that
33:28 I think about it I haven't thought about
33:30 this before I recorded the episode but
33:33 you know I tell you guys in many
33:34 episodes that the the compatibility
33:37 between two people is typically a very
33:39 juvie
33:40 process when it's evaluated when you're
33:42 young you'd be like you like handy huh I
33:45 can't eat do you like movies I like
33:48 movies you know do you like to breathe
33:50 well me too you know you have all these
33:52 weird associations that make you feel
33:54 like you're compatible with somebody and
33:56 then you move in with them better you
33:59 get married or you just do that you know
34:01 try it out before you buy a thing and
34:05 you find out who they really are are
34:08 they lazy are the doers do they believe
34:11 they should contribute equally to the
34:13 household chores if food needs to be
34:16 prepared are you the one always doing it
34:17 or they are the one always doing it are
34:19 you the freeloader you know you never
34:21 know and that's why I always tell you
34:24 folks like it's the theme of your
34:28 existence that determines whether or not
34:30 you are compatible with another person
34:32 easiest question you can ask another
34:33 human being is what is your purpose here
34:35 on this planet it doesn't matter how
34:39 crazy the answer is if both of you have
34:41 a crazy answer and it seems compatible
34:44 then you're probably compatible if
34:49 you're both lost and you both have
34:51 crappy answers well there you go you may
34:55 end up being compatible and you may not
34:57 be into being might not end up being
35:00 compatible because you both haven't
35:01 decided what kind of person you are if
35:04 you're clever and you're older in the
35:08 mind at least you can fish for things
35:13 that they have done that turned them on
35:15 you know do they go to old folks home
35:18 and visit people that are absolutely
35:20 isolated do they talk to Alzheimer's
35:22 patients and pretend to be their
35:24 children do they look at a child and
35:28 think I will do anything to save that
35:29 kid's life and I don't even know that
35:30 kid you know that kind of stuff the
35:33 theme of who they are as a person the
35:36 things that are reoccurring arcs and
35:37 their personality it's very powerful and
35:41 sometimes we change and we're not aware
35:44 of it example
35:48 you get stuck in a relationship it's not
35:51 good for you but you hang on for
35:53 tradition for nostalgia whatever the
35:56 person you're with is drifting away from
35:58 you or you're drifting away from them
36:00 they're remaining who they've always
36:02 been and been really sort of being true
36:04 to you even though you may not be
36:06 compatible with it and you're listening
36:08 to shows like this you're growing and
36:10 maturing and you're becoming whatever
36:12 you decide you want to be and it's
36:13 different and it's so different you
36:16 don't really have any business hanging
36:18 out with the other person so when you
36:21 have dreams I think at least for me it
36:24 was provided not having some weird
36:26 nightmare or something I guess I could
36:28 probably indicate something as well if
36:31 you have nice pleasant dream you should
36:34 be able to analyze your own dreams and
36:36 say what was I doing in my dream because
36:38 I really enjoyed it I think why I did
36:41 this and I did that I did this and what
36:44 am i doing in my real life
36:45 I can oh I'm working too much I'm not
36:50 spending time with my loved ones I
36:52 haven't left my hometown and wherever
36:55 you live sorry
36:56 John you live in for a really long time
36:58 and in my dream I'm always someplace
37:00 else maybe I want to travel and you find
37:04 out in your dream that when you relax
37:06 you're a pretty cool person even cooler
37:08 than you are in real life all right that
37:12 might be an indicator who you're
37:14 becoming your insides are definitely
37:18 contributing to your dream we know that
37:19 for a fact and isn't it interesting that
37:23 in our dreams our our life can dictate
37:27 what's in a dream now I do feel like
37:28 okay I just mentioned this and I think
37:32 my writing episode that I'm editing
37:35 right now if you let go of your creative
37:38 endeavors while you're doing it you tend
37:40 to do a better job for instance here's
37:44 another example I gave a writing example
37:46 when you sort of let go and you let the
37:48 writing happen the most incredible stuff
37:50 happens you come back to it the next day
37:52 next week whatever like I wrote that oh
37:53 my god that's good stuff the very first
37:57 time I finally figured out a guitar neck
38:00 enough to do a solo
38:02 one of these instrumental records I did
38:04 in the 90s I let go I let go with a
38:08 guitar I mean I was playing it but I let
38:11 go of the controls and it was as if I
38:14 was possessed by someone who was trying
38:16 to say you need to relax
38:18 here's how it works I had no idea what
38:21 key I was in you know I'm like Dave girl
38:24 I have no idea what key I'm in ever
38:25 right I just learned the notes that go
38:29 together if I transition into a
38:32 different key for the break or for the
38:35 you know the more tagging istic feel the
38:37 song I just pick a slightly different
38:40 set of notes and I come back and I just
38:43 memorized the neck you know and I let go
38:47 this guitar from controlling it and boom
38:50 I was flying all over this neck and it
38:52 was no problem
38:53 it was like oh my god and it felt
38:56 spiritual it felt like I was connecting
38:57 with the universe and so we all have
39:01 like these dreams where there's sort of
39:03 frustration dreams with something was
39:05 sort of annoying us in the real world or
39:06 it could be as simple as you played a
39:08 little video game and you're in this
39:10 loop in this loop in this loop and your
39:11 your dream becomes a mechanic of the
39:15 game and you really don't do anything in
39:17 the dream you're sort of in this weird
39:18 loop and sometimes the symbology is
39:21 completely ridiculous you know you'll be
39:23 playing some strategy game or something
39:26 and then all sudden it's your kitchen
39:27 and you're just going a circle trying to
39:29 cook and it feels like the game it's
39:31 weird I don't really acknowledge those
39:33 as dreams I feel like those are almost
39:35 bizarre mental exhaust pipes for your
39:41 brain they just you need to blow out the
39:43 carbs of your mind typically if I have
39:46 those dreams
39:47 so typically wake me up because I can't
39:50 I can't relax while I'm ever in the
39:53 dream
39:53 so what I'll end up doing is I'll force
39:56 myself up go the restroom if I have to
39:58 I'll pick up my phone and look around on
40:02 the web or something so just filter out
40:03 my brain to something else like reassert
40:06 myself in reality and then it usually
40:10 always works and I don't can't remember
40:11 ever going back into back into one of
40:15 those
40:16 rheems the the we dream I used to have
40:19 as a kid that was a really uncomfortable
40:25 frustration dream and I don't know why
40:29 cuz I was extremely young I mean I did
40:31 wasn't I wasn't paying the bills my
40:34 burden was maybe homework which I didn't
40:35 give a [ __ ] about and they didn't give
40:36 us homework like they do now in fact I
40:38 don't even remember getting homework
40:40 until maybe high school and it wasn't
40:43 that much read this and you know we're
40:46 had a report on it was a very infrequent
40:49 thing there's maybe a couple book
40:50 reports every nine weeks not like you
40:52 know kids today but I used to dream but
40:56 what happened was that I would close my
40:58 eyes in a second my lids came down was
41:02 kind of ironic here in this storyline I
41:04 felt like I was a subatomic particle and
41:09 probably more in the line of an atom and
41:13 I was just being pushed around by all
41:15 the other atoms and I just was so out of
41:19 control my own existence because I was
41:22 just this thing in the universe bouncing
41:24 around and and I would open my eyes I
41:28 remember it was this thing I would open
41:29 my eyes and I'd be in reality and I
41:31 closed it I would turn into this
41:32 infinitely small particle it was very
41:35 frustrating I don't have this anymore
41:38 I guess maybe every two or three years
41:41 I'll get that that eyelid thing and I
41:44 started feeling that I'm going okay we
41:45 need to get up we need to do something
41:47 different here because I'm not gonna
41:48 have those dreams anymore and I guess
41:51 potentially one of the requirements of
41:54 some of this continuous dream stuff
41:56 would be that you do have a sense of
42:00 control of your life I mean you know you
42:03 can be unemployed and still feel like
42:05 you have total control so what can you
42:06 do you can apply for jobs God tends to
42:11 provide at some point you know you know
42:15 it's in my experience it'll go down to
42:17 the wire and then boom the phone rings
42:19 and something happens never stop trying
42:23 because you know you'll always increase
42:24 the zeros on your check the more that
42:26 you apply yourself sort of thing
42:28 but I want to put another bumper in here
42:34 about nightmares I'm not going to go
42:35 back into my personal nightmare thing
42:38 with much detail but you know yours
42:41 truly had nightmares from God probably
42:44 three to four all the way up to seven
42:47 and I had one more 12 this reoccurring
42:50 character my dreams and like I said when
42:55 I was seven at this reoccurring
42:57 character and was a female it wasn't
43:04 human it was a mannequin yeah it was me
43:07 seeing those mannequins with the necks
43:08 that are pinched and sliced so there's
43:10 no skull and that just freaked me out
43:12 when I was a kid when I saw it so that
43:14 became anthropomorphised in my dream and
43:16 it became this character that were just
43:18 kind of psychologically torture me in a
43:20 dream that I was also threatening me
43:22 physically and eventually I grew up I
43:25 was like oh seven and I was like it was
43:28 like a few man and I attacked this thing
43:31 and just attacked it physically in my
43:34 dream and beat the [ __ ] out of it and I
43:35 was done you know and I left the dream
43:40 and it was okay and then when I woke up
43:42 the next morning I felt like a million
43:44 bucks I was like I'm not gonna be afraid
43:47 of anything anymore and then I've had
43:49 several weird spooky moments and dreams
43:53 from zombies breathing on my neck
43:55 because I'll accidentally left the sheet
43:57 off my neck and it was really cold in
43:59 the room my body brought that feeling
44:03 into my dream but even that I was sort
44:05 of like enjoying the fear that was going
44:10 on I had another dream a couple years
44:12 back I can still remember it like it was
44:14 yesterday felt like it's real right now
44:16 where I was going into this dome in the
44:19 middle of a desert where we were going
44:21 to have a liaison with an alien race and
44:26 I felt like one of those scientists like
44:28 in like the translator in Close
44:31 Encounters of the French guy in Close
44:33 Encounters where I was the intellectual
44:35 that was supposed to contribute to the
44:36 conversation and and be empathetic
44:39 towards what they were really saying in
44:41 Papua blood
44:42 you know the military went in and the
44:44 commander was just not ready for this
44:47 moment he barks at this being because
44:51 it's almost like one of those stupid
44:53 scenes and I don't mean say stupid it's
44:55 bad but it's why these scenes that they
44:57 play the characters dumb in Star Trek
45:00 where they have to deal with the race
45:01 that the thinks that if you're not
45:04 assertive you're a wimp and they don't
45:06 want to do any business with the wimp
45:07 and they'll roll over you and so the
45:09 there was a Star Trek episode where
45:13 jean-luc Picard was swapped out for this
45:15 other dude and this other dude who plays
45:17 he's in Robocop and he's in Total Recall
45:19 he's the guy in charge of Total Recall
45:21 anyway he lets this alien have it you
45:24 know and he's playing all these games
45:26 the art of the deal kind of games where
45:28 he fakes it he's stomping out of the
45:30 room it's just funny as hell but this
45:35 dream goes bad and these aliens start
45:37 [ __ ] to place up bad and shooting
45:39 guns and and I have to jump down
45:41 underneath I'm on the outer rim of the
45:42 it's a two two layered dome and so the
45:47 inner layers about a five to six foot
45:51 mezzanine between the two and I had dive
45:54 underneath this desk and I hide
45:57 underneath it it's a bunch of cables and
46:00 all kinds of equipment around so I think
46:01 I've hidden it away in a weird place
46:03 that it's gonna be hours before they get
46:05 done killing everyone outside and I have
46:08 no weapons of any kind I'm not supposed
46:09 to be there for any militant reason and
46:11 this alien comes up behind me and very
46:15 quickly finds me and I'm laying down and
46:18 I'm staring down it like cables like I
46:20 can see the lights it's nighttime and I
46:22 can see all the searchlights and
46:23 whatever lights they kind of set up just
46:25 kind of peeking into where I am and I'm
46:26 so they're going oh my god this alien is
46:29 right over my back and I can hear them
46:31 breathing and it's so I mean to this day
46:34 feel so realistic and you know in real
46:38 life I guess I would say that maybe in
46:43 the realistic version of the dream it
46:45 would be that he was sympathetically
46:49 realizing I'm not the problem I'm not
46:51 I'm not there to hurt him or anything
46:52 but anyway he's over me breathing him
46:54 and I'm thinking god
46:56 he's gonna grab my legs you gonna yank
46:57 me somewhere and something's gonna
46:59 happen right didn't touch me he moved on
47:01 but I woke up very shortly after the
47:04 dream after he hit that point and I'm up
47:07 and I'm thinking wanna make an awesome
47:11 that dream was awesome I would have
47:13 loved to see what happened and would
47:15 have loved have stayed in the dream and
47:16 just suffered whatever Sling an arrow
47:19 that dream the aliens would have had for
47:22 me just to experience it you know cuz
47:24 it's alien you know it's like it's some
47:26 weird thing that you know some of us
47:29 have or were kind of like you know there
47:32 was a question that went around a lot
47:33 when I was a kid which is you know if an
47:37 alien spaceship came down and said you
47:39 know come on in man let's go and you
47:40 look inside there's really nothing in
47:42 there for you to eat or drink or
47:44 whatever you could be signing your death
47:46 warrant going in the thing I got possums
47:49 behind me in there falling from high
47:51 places it sounds really weird and you
47:54 know one of these things they're saying
47:58 look you know if you believe in
47:59 reincarnation especially you might just
48:01 go yeah all right you know I'll go up in
48:04 their ship and we'll see what happens
48:05 maybe get a little bit of probing you
48:07 know who knows it's gonna be
48:08 uncomfortable but you at least be going
48:10 like me they taught me back on earth
48:12 like that hippie in the 60s or 70s or
48:14 whatever it was you have a story to tell
48:17 your kids you know one troponin time had
48:21 a lamp shoved up my whole butt it's wild
48:25 of dreams will give you this dimension
48:27 of exploration because we're gonna be
48:30 all right I don't know what would have
48:32 happened and this guy grabbed me moving
48:33 around there was a dream I had I mean
48:35 I'm going on the nightmare thing to kind
48:37 of get you through it okay so the thing
48:42 I realized and it has to do with real
48:43 life any of you guys have dealt with
48:45 bullies I was moved around a lot as a
48:46 kid and always the dude that you know
48:49 the stragglers would always pick on as
48:52 soon as you get there and so first
48:54 couple times you're a little Meeker cuz
48:57 you don't know you don't even know you
48:58 guys are bad till it starts happening to
49:00 you like okay we're gonna do our thing
49:02 we're all children you know what did you
49:05 get as you get older
49:08 I don't know you tend to get wise eyes
49:10 after a while you know there was this
49:13 but there was a scene I'm trying to
49:16 think of what movie it was in I think it
49:17 was in Full Metal Jacket where there's a
49:22 scene where these guys are in a bunk or
49:24 in a bunker together or like sorry their
49:28 barracks those kind of half dome there
49:31 sorry um half cylinder
49:33 you know versions from I Gomer pile but
49:36 they're in Vietnam and one of the
49:39 soldiers is like you know it's ribbing
49:43 one of the journalists saying look man
49:45 you've never been in it you've never
49:47 seen it look at your eyes man I can see
49:49 it you've never been in it because you
49:50 don't have to stare and he's like what
49:52 the hell you talking right well after
49:53 you killed a bunch of people you get
49:54 this stare and we know you've been in
49:58 the in the deep of war and I can only
50:02 assume that's completely true but
50:05 there's a much subtler version that can
50:08 happen to you in real life and it's
50:11 really sort of this thing that you're
50:13 not a [ __ ] starter you're you're
50:17 empathetic to whatever's going on in the
50:19 room and people who are angry or
50:21 thinking they're being disrespected or
50:23 ignored which is the same thing right
50:25 your dreams can give you that if you're
50:28 having nightmares the whole thing is try
50:31 to remember to the best of your ability
50:34 that you really are in control this is
50:36 your world and when you realize that
50:39 nothing can touch you and I had I had a
50:43 dream was a darkroom there was some
50:47 mysterious creature in the room couldn't
50:50 see it and I don't think I ever saw it
50:51 but it's trying to do its best to make
50:55 me he's afraid and you know um Ice Cube
51:00 said he picked the wrong dude to mess
51:02 with brain and so I'm in this dream and
51:04 I'm just like I'm definitely feeling
51:06 that adrenaline of oh my god [ __ ] could
51:10 happen to me like I'm feeling that
51:11 goosebumps head to toe in the dream I
51:13 could remember that part at the same
51:17 time I'm like I am not budging man
51:20 so I remember standing up in this room
51:22 it was like this weird room just that
51:24 like weird beams and stuff is all dark I
51:26 couldn't really see what the hell I'm
51:27 doing he's definitely an archway but he
51:29 was in this archway and it just kind of
51:31 went back in there sort of like being in
51:33 a diablo 3 level and i remember just
51:36 thinking i went from being like
51:39 surprised that there's something dark in
51:41 my dream i didn't bring that in there
51:43 wasn't trying to do anything that i
51:44 don't know what it was and i'm ever just
51:46 saying out loud in the dream I'm like
51:49 come on let's do this like where are you
51:52 and then I remember running up to the
51:54 arch to see if I could find the thing is
51:57 I'm like I'm in control and I'm gonna
52:00 tear you from limb to limb I don't care
52:02 how strong you think you are I'm in
52:03 charge and I woke up and I felt okay and
52:09 that was again it's just over so the
52:12 reason why I mentioned the nightmare
52:14 thing is that I think that you have to
52:16 get rid of that possibility of a dream
52:19 by taking charge and just having fun
52:22 with it and I guarantee you if you are
52:24 suffering from a villain in a dream
52:26 especially a reoccurring villain or even
52:29 a reoccurring species of a villain and
52:31 you nail it you're gonna wake up if you
52:35 have any villains in your life someone
52:37 is abusing you at work or at home or in
52:39 your neighborhood you're gonna be a lot
52:41 different of a human being you'll start
52:44 having the stare most likely not the
52:46 combats there but the civilian version
52:49 of the same thing
52:50 right and I was at a party with some
52:52 friends of mine across the street and
52:56 you know Orange counties all alpha males
52:58 I mean there's a put this way my street
53:00 is all heavy-duty alpha pills and their
53:04 friends are too and so the women are
53:06 alpha you know of beta females I guess
53:09 you could say or Omega females excuse me
53:11 and so they like Minton and so that for
53:14 me it's great it's like being in the
53:15 Midwest but being in California which we
53:17 don't count Orange counties like and so
53:20 you know it's couples everywhere
53:22 husbands and wives some but two couples
53:24 I'm a couple of eight kids it was like
53:27 crazy we started having a conversation
53:30 about just Bravo
53:33 watch Onis and how when you're young you
53:37 do all your scrapping either you're an
53:40 [ __ ] and you started or you're just
53:42 sensitive and you get into it or you're
53:45 being beat up and you got to defend
53:46 yourself that whole thing from the
53:47 bullies and the villains in your dreams
53:49 are just like bad bullies once you stand
53:51 up to a bad bully they back down they
53:53 move on they don't want to fail and they
53:57 tend to mature out of bully stage once
53:59 they get their ass kicked because it
54:00 makes them mortal in their own mind now
54:03 in real life you might have an MMA
54:05 fighter and some other big bruiser and
54:07 there's nothing you can do to physically
54:09 do any things up or maybe get a chin
54:10 shot you know maybe but we all agreed
54:14 that you know operating from a
54:16 perspective from a keystone of respect
54:21 diffuses all the situations in the world
54:23 and it really keeps you out of trouble
54:24 and it makes you have some great friends
54:27 you might even be an argument with
54:28 somebody and eventually they're your
54:30 best friend so you can use your dreams I
54:32 think to get through that without
54:35 getting into any true physical disputes
54:39 of course but you also practice like
54:41 training wheels you practice who you are
54:43 and that's cool right you don't just
54:46 spend any money on to get hurt you know
54:47 you're bruised you don't they have any
54:48 healing broken bones you don't lose your
54:51 life you know and so I would say get
54:56 your practice in as early as you
54:57 possibly can
54:58 because that will reflect in your life
55:00 and you'll gain more control in your
55:02 life and your dreams will start to chill
55:04 out because your brain is like a I could
55:07 bring another villain in but that only
55:08 lasts a couple seconds because all he
55:10 does is go after the villain like it's
55:11 funny he just chases them down until
55:13 they disappear and a lot of times here's
55:16 what I think a lot of times your brain
55:17 has no idea how to really create a
55:19 villain because it doesn't know what to
55:21 do if you chase it you're supposed to be
55:23 chased by it and if you turn around and
55:25 go you're gonna have to think about how
55:27 this thing's supposed to rip me to
55:28 shreds because that's what I'm about to
55:30 do to it and boy I can't conceive that
55:31 Andy day of the week can you conceive
55:34 ripping me apart when I'm in control
55:35 it ain't allowed in a dream sorry half
55:40 the time I have I have a couple friends
55:41 in mind that said that they believe
55:44 they've died in a dream
55:46 only a couple and here's the interesting
55:49 thing about dying in a dream it's
55:52 because they were running from whatever
55:54 it was that was chasing them and then
55:56 they fell off a roof they jumped out a
55:58 window okay you see the solution don't
56:01 run don't run and if you run and you
56:04 have to jump out a window
56:05 just remember neo from the matrix and do
56:07 whatever the [ __ ] you won when you jump
56:09 out of that window and the world world
56:12 will seem like a cakewalk when you wake
56:14 up because the world doesn't have
56:16 monsters under the bed doesn't it
56:18 monsters in the closet doesn't have
56:20 monsters down the hallway I mean you
56:23 have bad human beings from time to time
56:24 but you know you know and you'll have
56:28 crazies every one small I can't really
56:30 give you any advice about that besides
56:33 buy a gun have a close to you at night
56:35 and try to be as a judicious as possible
56:40 and I'll shoot your [ __ ] kids right
56:42 turn the lights on yeah so I'm having
56:47 these continuous dreams my whole night
56:51 turns into this other reality and it's
56:54 fascinating and I'm trying to dissect it
56:56 as quickly as possible to see if there's
56:58 any additional information then I can
57:02 pass you guys the trouble about talking
57:06 about dreams and by the way we've had
57:07 some amazing comments about dreams
57:08 people take time out and write these
57:10 whole you know chapters in the comment
57:13 section about a dream they've had and
57:15 boy it's fascinating to listen to
57:17 because it takes you a couple it for if
57:19 you like me it takes you a little while
57:21 to read a dream and appreciate what the
57:24 person put into one writing it but to
57:27 having it so I almost have to read this
57:30 those kind of comments twice and read it
57:33 like a movie and then put myself in it
57:34 and be the main character the person
57:37 type in the comment is is has lived you
57:42 know I think my let's put this way
57:47 I hope the going through some of the
57:50 semantics and in the steps and the
57:53 evolution that I have gone through
57:55 personally in analyzing my own dreams
57:57 breaking it down
57:59 and I would I would suggest if this is a
58:02 subject you're interested in this is
58:04 your first video definitely go to
58:05 youtube and look up the playlist for
58:07 dreams or go to deep thoughts radio.com
58:08 and click on the category dreams and
58:11 watch it from the beginning of episode 1
58:14 or sorry season 1 all the way up to the
58:18 recently going that order
58:19 chronologically and you may find that
58:23 there's a lot of interesting epiphanies
58:25 in those episodes that will help you
58:27 personally get to the point if you're
58:32 not already at this point or you can
58:34 have these dreams that I'm talking about
58:35 and maybe we could compare notes because
58:37 we can compare notes then it's more than
58:40 happy to entertain you with my own thing
58:42 but would it be more interesting to
58:43 share these experiences because I'm
58:46 looking for someone to run way past me
58:49 and again if you're having lucid dreams
58:51 every night then you are having dreams
58:56 completely beyond my average dream when
59:00 I the thing that's maybe flip over to
59:03 lucidity again my first lucid dream I
59:06 ever had I was at the I think it was
59:10 called farmers market I think it might
59:13 still be there it's on the Main Street
59:14 in my hometown literally in the center
59:16 of the school senator the town across
59:18 from the junior high and it's like an
59:22 old 50's grocery store small but big at
59:27 the same time for the 50s and I was in
59:30 line to pay for something and that the
59:32 cat checkout girl was really pretty and
59:34 I was probably I don't know I think I
59:37 was in my mid teens late teens and I
59:40 just had this amazing epiphany that oh
59:42 my god I'm dreaming and I'm totally in
59:44 control and I wanted to ask this girl
59:46 out it was funny but I was so excited
59:48 that I gained lucidity I woke myself up
59:51 son of a B so my other dreams that make
59:59 me and I haven't had a flying dream in a
60:01 really long time when I I would do this
60:04 and it's probably as I humbled myself a
60:06 little bit but I was in my dreams I
60:08 would be in a dream and I'd be in a
60:09 crowd and it's some sort of party that's
60:12 going on
60:13 times it's like I'm a festival kind of
60:15 setting where you're at a fair and so
60:18 there's all kinds of little you know
60:19 kiosks and tents and stuff so on food or
60:22 whatever and as a show-off I would fly I
60:28 just go feels a girl or something I try
60:31 to impress her and so watch this and I
60:33 would decide I can fly and it would be
60:36 this very believable beginning it wasn't
60:39 like I just flew off like Superman but I
60:41 just her flying a little bit and the
60:43 whole audience is like oh my god this
60:44 dude flying in the middle of it like
60:46 what is this is this a show and the more
60:50 I fly and the more I do things just like
60:53 10 or 15 feet above the air and huh I'm
60:55 would usually get to about maybe 30 40
60:57 feet up and it was funny my brain is a
60:59 practical [ __ ] thing it's like well
61:02 you know there's powerlines watch out
61:04 for those you know they have to fly
61:05 around power lines like I'm some hot air
61:07 balloon I've had hat I've had one
61:10 superhero moment I was on top of like I
61:13 was in the future it was really
61:15 interesting I was in some sort of Buck
61:17 Rogers future here on earth but this
61:21 building was fully capable built in the
61:23 real world but it was just looked at it
61:25 looked advanced it looked interesting
61:27 the whole city looked advanced I know
61:29 where the hell I was but there was a
61:30 giant park down below in a square sort
61:34 of like half of Central Park
61:36 very modern it's like dusky and on top
61:40 of this building and I remember jumping
61:43 off the building and then doing this
61:45 wild swoop and Alain's just like a
61:47 superhero boom and that was it and I
61:50 remember you know having the lucidity
61:53 field because every time I fly I feel
61:55 pretty lucid about what I'm doing and it
61:58 always tends to wake me up and I after I
62:04 woke up because I was like damn I wanted
62:06 to see more that city you know I'll tell
62:09 you this one of the one of the dreams I
62:11 am dying to have which I have never had
62:15 I mentioned one I won't repeat again but
62:17 it's not the same thing I would love
62:21 love love love to go to a dream and
62:25 travel the universe
62:27 not necessarily the journey I don't
62:29 necessarily want to sit a spaceship or
62:30 anything but I want to wake up
62:32 overlooking a city of aliens
62:37 sophisticated ones like us that have
62:38 methods of travel lodging they're super
62:43 techie I want to see what kind of thing
62:45 first I don't know what it look like you
62:47 know I don't I don't know I never they
62:49 got grey aliens or anything like that I
62:51 think about some totally wild like you
62:53 know out of the cantina in Star Wars
62:56 right and I want them to sometimes I
63:00 think about when I want them to be I
63:02 don't want them to be able to see me I
63:03 just want to fly around a god mode and
63:05 observe them and just see what kind of
63:08 like if they have three arms like when
63:11 four eyes or they're all weird on their
63:13 face or some bizarre thing obviously
63:15 within their realm there's beauty
63:18 whether I think they're beautiful or not
63:19 I don't know there's gonna be women
63:21 there's gonna be men potentially they're
63:23 not asexual and how does that work do
63:27 they do they sound weird do they sound
63:29 interesting do they even talk
63:31 did they slobber all over themselves so
63:34 they disgusting you know it's like do
63:36 their face look like armpits like what's
63:37 the deal I want to see that world and
63:40 just be there and and my dream is to
63:44 have it be truly not about experience
63:46 where when I wake up I'm like dude I
63:48 just saw the other planet I saw other
63:50 creatures never happened ever just like
63:53 I can't dream a space and generally
63:55 doesn't matter how many sci-fi movies
63:57 I've seen I have never dreamed of being
63:59 in space
63:59 ever ever ever and neither is any of the
64:03 special effects artists I know make all
64:05 those shows on TV something about space
64:08 that's weird which is why I have an
64:09 episode this space exists and it all
64:13 catalysed out of an in kala episode all
64:15 right ask I'll that cuz he does special
64:17 effects and he's on the episode and he's
64:20 like he's like no that's weird I've
64:25 never had a dream of being in space
64:26 because this guy's like a - Emmys for
64:28 space special effects he's the cameraman
64:30 for all space television shows and it
64:35 was like he did Battlestar Galactica I
64:37 did some Star Trek he did
64:40 the Serenity movie in the series before
64:43 that I mean did all kinds of stuff right
64:45 and so he's lived in that we'll see he
64:48 went to work and asked all of his
64:51 buddies as any of you guys have any guys
64:53 a dreamed of space they're like no you
64:57 thought you think that's weird guys I
64:58 mean you know we're in fictional world
65:00 their dreams are fictional why not be
65:02 able to dream being on a spaceship we've
65:04 had a few listeners coming after the
65:06 fact and say they had I've never been in
65:08 a human being in real life who says they
65:10 have I mean a real tin four stars
65:13 Star Trek ship or whatever the hell you
65:15 like the the Galactica nothing in your
65:20 own little space balls camper in space
65:23 your little Winnebago space never had
65:24 that dreams are a weird thing I think
65:29 man I feel like they're an imperative of
65:35 mankind for some reason a playground of
65:37 the gods you know you can do all kinds
65:40 of things in those dreams there seems to
65:43 be limiters why we don't have our five
65:47 senses in the dream is interesting the
65:51 body tends to disappear even though it's
65:54 there in pictorial fashion like I told
65:59 you I fell in love with a girl in the
66:02 recent dream and then a couple days
66:04 later I had this big dream the first big
66:05 dream I had
66:06 maybe that's we call them big dreams and
66:09 I had a girl that I had bumped into this
66:14 one of those love-at-first-sight moments
66:15 when you just have that you know you got
66:17 a party like oh my god she seems to dig
66:18 me a dig her it's all good and you know
66:21 I don't even know this person in real
66:22 life doesn't exist and there was a
66:25 moment I was sitting on a sofa with
66:26 those those like Ottomans right the
66:30 cubes is sitting in front all kind of
66:33 80s sofas and there was a girl to my
66:36 left like everyone was kind of laying
66:38 down I'm sitting down like I am right
66:40 now and one girl is that the girl he was
66:45 really hot for kind of walked out of the
66:47 room and was kind of gone another girl
66:49 kind took her spot and said this girl
66:51 laying on my lap
66:52 and there's no they go to the right and
66:54 they're kind of laying on top of each
66:55 other and everyone's fully dressed the
66:57 girl in front him is wearing like yoga
66:59 pants like the black yoga pants she's a
67:01 little thicker and I remember touching
67:03 her thigh and that just felt good you
67:07 know it was like you know we're all just
67:08 relaxing and I remember feeling her leg
67:12 and I didn't have any sense of her
67:15 weight on me but I could touch her and
67:18 it I felt it was interesting it was just
67:21 my dream coming up with something
67:23 interesting to entertain me with you
67:24 know I guess so I'll be interested in
67:27 the type of dreams that you guys are
67:29 having these days and I would be
67:31 interested a lot of you have reported in
67:33 having real time dreams and we've had a
67:35 nice moment on the show where you're
67:37 like yeah people tell me you dream in a
67:39 few seconds and you're REM stage that's
67:43 BS okay maybe that happens as well I
67:47 think that the thing that science has
67:53 wrong about dreams is they think they
67:54 can track it by looking at our brains
67:57 and somebody needs to tell these
67:59 scientists we have souls and the souls
68:01 run off with the silver cord and we have
68:03 these experiences off machine sensory
68:07 and then we come back and we have more
68:11 dreams to report I would love to go to
68:12 dream clinic because I think that they
68:16 would rewrite the books if they believe
68:18 we have dreams in a little bit of time
68:20 because I could literally wake up look
68:21 at the scientist to go I'm still going
68:23 I'm in this place and I go back to sleep
68:25 and I could wake up and go and now we
68:27 did this as an Asst and I go back to
68:29 sleep and it just keep going and then
68:31 after the dream session is over I would
68:35 be able to sit down at a table and drink
68:38 my orange juice and tell them the whole
68:40 thing and they could compare notes of
68:41 all the little things I said that was
68:43 going on as I woke up and then it would
68:44 be a continuous screenplay and maybe
68:47 it's because I write screenplays that
68:49 this is all becoming easier for me
68:52 because again when you are architecting
68:56 a screenplay I write in the format right
69:00 so I will have like one and two complete
69:03 memorizes one picture in my brain
69:06 maybe I have four half figured out
69:09 because I know how the ending works and
69:10 then three and half a four it's like a
69:13 void you know it's like a bunch of like
69:15 groceries in your bags all mixed up and
69:18 it doesn't make any sense and the flows
69:19 not right but once you sort it all out
69:21 and you write the first draft it's in
69:24 your brain the whole thing is one
69:26 picture worth 10,000 words or whatever
69:29 so in closing let me just remind you of
69:32 something kind of silly but perhaps
69:34 valuable you know when they ask you
69:38 about your life well but this way you
69:40 listen to a celebrity that you that's
69:43 doing the job that you wanted to it
69:45 could be a celebrity scientist it's
69:46 gonna be an athlete could be someone
69:48 entertainment actor musician whatever
69:51 can just be a business person you admire
69:54 and when they ask him that age-old
69:57 question you know how do what would be
69:58 your advice for somebody new in the
70:00 world you know wanting to get into your
70:02 line of work obviously I can tell you to
70:05 get educated and work hard sort of thing
70:06 cuz that's what luck is usually they
70:09 will come on to a metaphor it's very
70:12 traditional which is follow your dreams
70:14 and never ever ever stop no matter how
70:17 logical it feels to you at any point in
70:19 time or how exhausted you are how much
70:21 you feel like you're not good at what
70:22 you're doing never ever stop and you'll
70:25 get good at it that is the absolute
70:29 truth of this planet period right
70:31 there's so many people that were no good
70:33 at what they were doing and they got
70:37 good eventually and there's some that
70:39 are pretty damn talented right out of
70:40 the gate but you'll have was a Don
70:43 Knotts I just watched an interview with
70:45 Zach Galifianakis giving an interview of
70:48 him I think he's passed now but right
70:53 know wasn't telling us it was Don
70:54 Rickles excuse me Don Rickles and you
70:58 know he's this brilliant quipping
71:00 comedian I mean the guy could take
71:02 anything that was said a second ago and
71:04 flip it just like Groucho Marx I don't
71:07 know if anyone asks croucher this
71:08 question but Don Rickles said look I was
71:11 going to this open mic night thing and I
71:14 was awful because I was just bombing you
71:17 know all the time until
71:19 joke it and I started building on that
71:24 joke and I started figuring out a
71:25 technique and then I became a
71:27 professional I've heard many times the
71:31 lead singer Kevin Dubrow
71:32 who was the lead singer of Quiet Riot
71:35 somebody said that when he first started
71:37 singing he was awful
71:38 and that somebody I forgot who said they
71:41 mentored him but they said they mentored
71:42 him into what he what ended up being of
71:46 course he's fortunately took his life
71:48 took his own life in 2006 or something
71:50 but he had to work hard at it and
71:53 eventually mastered enough to be a
71:56 legend and so there are ton of people
72:00 and probably the majority of all people
72:02 that you know I had moments where they
72:05 were gonna give up and they kept going I
72:09 think if you take if you if you record
72:14 your dreams
72:14 meaning you dictate them write them down
72:17 draw them whatever and start to read
72:21 more into your accomplishments and your
72:24 dreams and what you are in your dreams
72:26 pull it into this real world because
72:28 you're practicing from your own mind
72:31 which you could be you know the artist
72:35 known as Prince who's long gone now he
72:38 said look you know I was very insecure
72:39 as a kid and eventually just decided to
72:43 pretend in the real world that I wasn't
72:45 the other guy the super charismatic guy
72:48 the guy that could get any woman he
72:50 wanted and eventually that bled into his
72:53 music and he made it happen look at all
72:56 the rappers man that her broke as a
72:57 [ __ ] joke and rapping about how rich
72:59 they are and gun darnit they get rich
73:02 you know it's that confidence in their
73:05 lyrics was a dumb riff-raff right he's
73:08 sort of not what he used to be but he's
73:11 just a kid he made a bunch of YouTube
73:12 videos but it made I think
73:14 unquestionably horrible music at one
73:17 point and then he started making great
73:19 music because he got great producers
73:20 behind him and he's got talent you know
73:24 yeah so you know winners and some losers
73:27 but the dude just believes in himself I
73:30 used to watch his videos where he would
73:31 brag about how
73:33 he was succeeding he taking out his
73:34 little crib tours of these like normal
73:36 houses but he would he would make a
73:38 normal house feel like it was a MTV crib
73:41 man it was really funny and you have to
73:43 give it to him so this is a quarter sort
73:47 of stuff we can do with ourselves and I
73:49 think that there's any byproduct of your
73:52 dreams is positive maybe it's that I'll
73:56 just say if you haven't been at deep
73:57 thoughts radio.com
73:58 it's much more functional now there's a
74:00 bunch of categories of all the videos so
74:02 if you like space videos or space
