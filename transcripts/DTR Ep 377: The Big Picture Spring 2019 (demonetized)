00:00 [Music]
00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:35 deep thoughts tonight I thought I would
00:39 take a break from all of the cerebral
00:43 stuff and go after some very specific
00:46 content that I think might help everyone
00:50 sort of get on the same page that
00:52 doesn't mean you're gonna agree with me
00:53 a lot of this is gonna be my
00:55 interpretation of what's going on in the
00:59 world I do a big-picture episode every
01:02 once in a while that's gonna be a big
01:05 picture let's say spring 2019 because I
01:09 think summer might be different than
01:12 falled and winter so let's just keep it
01:14 specific so the world is it's a big
01:20 place and it's a small place and it
01:24 would appear that things are happening
01:26 at a rapid pace now and it just makes me
01:30 think about the the first person I ever
01:34 heard say it and quite frankly he's the
01:37 only person I've heard say it is David
01:39 Icke of all people I really respect
01:43 David and I respect his different
01:46 beliefs I don't agree with him
01:48 completely
01:50 he hates the President of the United
01:53 States right now he thinks the president
01:54 knighted States is a complete puppet and
01:55 some of you think that too so we're
01:57 going to talk about that as well for a
02:00 guy that is a puppet of the deep state
02:03 they can't attack this man enough from
02:06 every global press in the world nobody
02:11 attacked Obama like they attacked this
02:14 guy and no one would have attacked
02:17 Hillary had she made it into office
02:19 except for maybe Fox News playing hit
02:23 piece but they're there in the camp -
02:25 maybe Rush Limbaugh did go after her and
02:28 stayed true to his his word as to who
02:32 he's affiliated with but very few people
02:36 would go after Hillary
02:39 and every single one of these people
02:41 every single newspaper in the world
02:42 every single magazine in the world ever
02:45 seen news every single news agency every
02:47 publishing companies publishing books is
02:49 going after Trump like crazy and the
02:51 only deviation in the book industry is
02:54 someone just trying to make a buck off
02:55 everybody who likes the guy something is
02:58 up
02:59 something is up there has been a change
03:03 in my opinion now it's I think a little
03:08 ridiculous to think that these changes
03:12 are somehow going to stick that it's
03:18 going to be a cakewalk that the 17
03:21 movement is going to somehow be 100
03:27 percent victorious without any other
03:29 opposition occurring now again when I
03:32 say 17 it's so that I can stay out of
03:36 the the key word system of the
03:40 censorship mechanisms of YouTube and
03:43 Google because they are massive deep
03:46 state operatives okay founded by DARPA
03:49 and quickly usurped and commandeered and
03:55 controlled by the intelligence agencies
03:57 and the deep state in general the five
04:02 eyes they are one of the five eyes
04:04 within the spider that is our eight eyes
04:07 you know when I say 17 look up the
04:11 letter in the alphabet that is the 17th
04:13 letter in the alphabet and that's who
04:14 we're talking about if you don't know
04:17 just type that letter in the Google
04:20 search and say that letter and then
04:22 space and the word movement and you'll
04:24 be completely informed I only make that
04:26 distinction because we had a listener
04:28 that was like man I don't know what
04:29 you're talking about and fair enough you
04:32 don't have to know all this stuff I
04:34 can't stress enough that when I started
04:36 really waking up in 2005 as a result of
04:39 loose change and dear Alex Jones before
04:43 I think he started moving over to some
04:45 other agenda I don't know what that
04:47 guy's doing these days
04:48 I don't trust him anymore and I don't
04:51 like the fact that I don't trust him
04:53 I want to trust him but I don't I don't
04:57 trust him at all i think david icke
05:01 regardless if i don't believe in what he
05:03 says
05:04 I think he's his own man so when we
05:07 disagree I respectfully disagree with
05:09 him I don't think he's being controlled
05:11 by anyone but what David I said was when
05:15 you see all of the agencies in the world
05:17 slash press governments all going after
05:22 one agenda on one day you know it's the
05:25 deep state inaction now there have been
05:29 these montages cut together the of all
05:32 the news agencies saying exactly the
05:35 same thing all around the world down to
05:38 the word and pretending like it's their
05:40 own thing that's a sign that's proof not
05:44 a sign but that's proof that they are
05:46 entirely controlled they're getting all
05:48 of their feeds from the same location
05:52 again anytime you see international news
05:54 report at least in the United States of
05:56 America it's always credited towards AP
05:58 and Reuters it is not until AP and
06:01 Reuters break the story that they choose
06:03 to put anyone on the ground to see if
06:05 anything's true and that's usually
06:07 subpar information it's CNN on the top
06:10 of their building in Los Angeles with
06:14 fake palm trees reporting that they're
06:15 in Baghdad it's the the duty reports the
06:19 weather pretending like he's in a
06:21 torrential storm and the winds are so
06:23 strong well three guys walked by in the
06:24 background I think it's actually two but
06:27 whatever they're going after Donald
06:29 Trump because he has never been a part
06:31 of their society they've always kind of
06:33 kept him at bay I don't think they like
06:35 the guy and what's very interesting
06:37 about it is all this hatred towards the
06:39 guy from people that they don't have a
06:41 clue about what's going on in the world
06:42 it's a similar hatred that they had for
06:45 him because they knew he just called his
06:47 own shots from the very very beginning
06:50 and he has enough money to cause
06:52 problems but he never did cause any
06:54 problems he wrote a few books teaching
06:56 people how to become successful co-wrote
06:59 one with Robert Kiyosaki who's been
07:03 trying to solve this problem since he
07:04 started writing Rich Dad Poor Dad
07:06 but there are big things going on in the
07:09 world we have never seen more pedophiles
07:12 and human traffickers arrested in world
07:14 history as we do right now and when you
07:18 woke up in 2005 there was no hope it was
07:22 deep state all the way all the way
07:23 around George Bush then Obama and then
07:27 we saw Hillary coming and we're like oh
07:29 my god what's God waiting for you know
07:33 Second Coming cuit we're ready to go so
07:38 when I view the world I look at the big
07:41 picture especially back in 2005 you saw
07:44 micro agendas they were big agendas but
07:47 they're moving in snail's paces trying
07:51 to give vaccinations to be mandated in
07:52 every state trying to destroy the
07:54 educational system of every college on
07:56 planet Earth especially in America
07:59 printing money as if it's just you know
08:02 Leafs on trees with quantitative easing
08:07 watching Joe Biden get rid of the m3
08:09 aggregate report out of the Federal
08:11 Reserve so that we couldn't figure out
08:12 where our money goes when we give it to
08:14 them claiming that it was a redundant
08:16 report and then the subprime loan
08:19 scandal happened about five years later
08:21 and he was cleaning the slate Biden
08:24 [ __ ] everybody he also [ __ ]
08:28 everybody with bankruptcy laws he led
08:31 the movement to make sure you could
08:32 never run away from a debt serves the
08:35 bankers serves the bankers and not our
08:37 bankers the European bankers now since
08:40 Trump's been in office we've seen John
08:42 Kerry go down he is he was running
08:46 around trying to negotiate behind the
08:48 president's back let me talk about
08:51 full-on treason you don't go running
08:55 around outside of your authority in your
08:58 jurisdiction trying to undermine
09:00 something that was going to steal
09:01 billions if not trillions from the
09:04 United States of America give it to the
09:08 greatest axis of evil that supposedly we
09:10 have in the world which is Iran now
09:12 again there's two different things going
09:14 on there the government maybe not so
09:17 good the people probably are just normal
09:20 aside from those are indoctrinated but
09:24 isn't everyone indoctrinated as to who
09:27 the enemies are in this world go see my
09:29 episodes demonetised called fake enemies
09:32 john mccain another guy republican
09:36 formed isis as part of the transfer of
09:40 uranium to your iran through their
09:43 uranium one deal hillary clinton running
09:48 around for eight years a Secretary of
09:51 State doing a pay-for-play model give
09:54 her foundation money and she grants you
09:57 anything you need to know and if you
10:00 can't give it to her through her
10:00 foundation you give it to her husband in
10:02 the form of a half a million dollar
10:04 speech fee and Russia general Flynn is
10:08 fighting some court case that he's not
10:13 guilty of they won't sentence the guy
10:16 but he you know and what is it mad off
10:22 did the same thing the Podesta brothers
10:24 did in fact the pedestrians to deal in
10:27 the Ukraine illegally meaning they
10:30 didn't tell the State Department and the
10:31 United States of America that they were
10:33 doing dealings with a foreign country
10:34 and then in order to get immunity they
10:36 turned in one of their own employees and
10:40 got immunity a plea deal you know
10:43 unbelievable so we have organic world
10:47 outside the seventeen movement then we
10:49 have the seventeen movement which is
10:51 claiming that they have all the
10:53 information just a matter of time now
10:57 that the Mueller reports out boy
10:58 everyone's going to get arrested I'm so
11:01 sick and [ __ ] tired of hearing the
11:03 seventeen dude say that everyone's gonna
11:04 be arrested and trust the plan and all
11:06 this other horseshit
11:08 we got fatigue dude you mean to tell me
11:12 you can't arrest a single person what
11:15 I'm very glad to hear is that the deep
11:18 state is the phrase we say it's huge all
11:22 of these you know leftists who are
11:26 coming late to the party and trying to
11:28 act like they have an IQ it's very funny
11:33 you know had my one side of my parental
11:38 family was like trying to say that Trump
11:41 worked for the bilderbergs they want to
11:45 accuse him of being deep State and I'm
11:46 like what the [ __ ] do you know about the
11:48 deep state and by the way 1012 years ago
11:50 you said the Bilderberg Group didn't
11:52 exist because that was part of your
11:54 stick in your head in the sand and now
11:56 you're such a de [ __ ] Authority about
11:57 the Bilderberg Group that now you know
11:59 that Trump's working for them everything
12:02 that can be exposed about the Bilderberg
12:04 Group I guarantee I get a copy of it and
12:07 there hasn't been any big reveals that
12:09 party is almost completely shut down but
12:14 they'll come in as FOA thora T's because
12:15 it makes it feel better because they're
12:17 going from complete [ __ ] loser that
12:19 didn't have any information and as a
12:21 giant [ __ ] not actually following the
12:23 truth because they can't [ __ ] handle
12:25 it to trying to make themselves some
12:27 authoritarian on the subject isn't that
12:29 [ __ ] hilarious spare me dude when it
12:34 came time to step up to the plate and be
12:36 a man you didn't make it buddy and you
12:39 can't jump in late and you can't take
12:41 the one of the greatest signs we have of
12:44 some some movement here and then claim
12:47 he's a part of the group that you're a
12:48 part of now most of my information is
12:52 going to be from the United States but
12:56 we do have a little bit going on outside
12:58 of the United States and I would say
12:59 what's interesting is is that almost all
13:02 the listeners that report in from the EU
13:04 or the UK or Australia or Canada you
13:08 guys are completely awake and you know
13:09 that things are going wrong in your area
13:12 now I'm gonna tear the United States and
13:14 new ones so don't worry you're not
13:15 picking on you guys but the EU needs to
13:17 fall brexit has to occur New Zealand and
13:24 Australia I don't know I don't know it
13:28 seems like they're in a contest together
13:30 to prove to the Queen how much they can
13:32 bury their you know lips and her butt
13:36 crack it's unbelievable it's almost like
13:42 if you you know you abuse a child the
13:45 child might
13:46 ever talk to someone that allows them to
13:48 be self-confident and so it's it's
13:52 bizarre to me that it seems is to me
13:55 like the New Zealand immigrants from
13:57 Europe and the Australian immigrants
13:59 from Europe are suffering from this
14:01 age-old psychosis that no no no Queen
14:03 Elizabeth were really good I know that
14:06 they said we were prisoners which I
14:09 don't even buy that anymore one of our
14:13 listeners reported in a really
14:14 interesting thing years ago he said you
14:16 know they told a bunch of the Brits that
14:19 they were delivering humans to this
14:20 place called Australia is a penal colony
14:23 at all they were doing is taking him out
14:26 in the ocean and throwing him overboard
14:27 and later they colonized the land with
14:31 normal citizens and then told them the
14:33 story but you're here and it used to be
14:35 a penal colony and everyone kind of felt
14:37 weird but that mostly digitus people of
14:40 Australia New Zealand are not from a
14:43 penal system it's a big facade of guilt
14:47 Christ the Catholic Church has been
14:49 using it for 2,000 years man why not
14:52 keep it going the reason why the EU has
14:56 to be destroyed is that you're you're
14:57 creating a government that's completely
14:59 run by the bankers a thousand percent
15:02 it isn't controlled by anything else any
15:05 politician who's in favor of the EU is a
15:09 banker shill and just like the article
15:13 are this video that came around one of
15:16 our listeners posted on his personal
15:17 account and I posted it on the locked
15:19 Facebook group go to deep thoughts video
15:22 calm to get to that the students Evan T
15:26 five or something like that he stood up
15:28 in the British Parliament it seemed some
15:31 sort of British he was in Parliament but
15:33 it was some meeting with a lot of people
15:35 listening to him and he laid it down he
15:37 goes
15:37 do you want some foreign government to
15:39 tell us how we're gonna run Britain we
15:42 have 55 million people here at the time
15:46 and he says I don't want someone else
15:48 telling me what I need you don't know
15:50 what I need and he was dead on he was
15:53 dead on lucid and of course all these
15:56 you either have two types of people
15:57 listening to a guy like that that don't
15:59 follow up on his
16:00 his assertions and his wisdom you have
16:04 banker shills they're usually ones with
16:07 the gavels and the ones with positions
16:09 and then you just have ignorant people
16:10 in the room no sir sounds mad I don't
16:15 like mad people because he's wrong cuz
16:17 he's mad so much of that [ __ ] going on
16:20 it's crazy
16:20 you're mad so you're stupid that's weird
16:27 okay so let's come back to where I live
16:29 in America we have had some pretty
16:34 insane [ __ ] going on here
16:36 even during the president's
16:38 administration and I'm not sure he can
16:40 solve everything by executive order
16:42 it's sad that any president has to use
16:44 executive orders but it's good that
16:47 exists because otherwise we would be in
16:49 an absolute tyrannical cesspool right
16:51 now we would have human trafficking and
16:56 child abuse at levels probably greater
17:00 than Obama's administration which was
17:02 pretty high but going on for decades
17:05 it's not just that dude but it'd be easy
17:08 to look the other way wouldn't it where
17:11 do you start with America where do you
17:14 start
17:15 well we're pulling out of a lot of
17:18 theatres of war thanks to our president
17:19 we don't have an existence tax called
17:21 the Obama care plan so that's amazing
17:25 human trafficking well it's a hell of a
17:27 lot harder these days immigration
17:30 illegal immigration excuse me is down a
17:33 wall is being built now there's a whole
17:37 layer on things if you believe
17:38 everything that 17 is telling you
17:42 according to 17 they tried to kill the
17:44 President of the United States as he
17:46 left Canada to go to Singapore to meet
17:48 with Kim Jong according to him a bunch
17:51 of the training accidents quote-unquote
17:53 that have been going on where people
17:55 died in the military are actually war
17:57 activities fighting this huge huge war
18:01 we haven't seen jacob rothschild in a
18:04 very long time he disappeared the time
18:07 that there was a helicopter slash plane
18:09 accident on his estate I've heard it
18:13 reported into play
18:14 so I'm not going to try to tell you
18:15 where it is George Soros hasn't been
18:18 seve seen alive and a moving video since
18:21 October last year that's a good sign
18:23 maybe he's alive maybe he's not they
18:25 report that he's doing stuff but when
18:27 you look at the photographs are all old
18:29 but they've been posted photographs of
18:32 him ten years younger its word trade
18:34 deals are getting better and this thing
18:37 with China will blow over though it's
18:40 kind of funny about China is that their
18:41 whole thing was that they developed a
18:43 really sour taste for Europe during the
18:46 opium wars and you can't blame them but
18:50 now when it comes to the United States
18:51 trade they are the opium dealers and we
18:55 are the Chinese we have been getting
18:57 screwed by their people
18:59 the lack of honor is on their side this
19:02 time around and I'm sure they'll restore
19:04 it but they're smart they're playing a
19:08 tough game President Roh says it all the
19:10 time I can respect that you know you get
19:15 a bunch of stuff for free and now
19:16 someone's saying we're not going to give
19:17 you all the stuff for free and well if
19:19 you're open to negotiations which is
19:21 sort of the problem I think that if you
19:23 really want to just do it right you say
19:24 all trade is over all trade is over
19:29 until you come back and you just sign
19:32 this [ __ ] deal we got ready for you
19:34 and it's fair it's a fair deal it's not
19:36 a screwball deal signed an opium deal
19:39 but no the president's actually playing
19:42 it cool cuz he loves the art of a deal
19:43 he loves a deal so be thankful he's
19:47 president not me you wouldn't be getting
19:49 your iPhone's anytime soon and my
19:52 rationale is when a situation has been
19:55 abused as much as that situation it's
19:57 been abused there needs to be some shock
20:00 and awe at the financial level you think
20:02 you're this big super power financially
20:05 in the world you keep reading those
20:06 articles about yourself from APs and
20:09 Reuters well let me write a new blog for
20:12 you but how you're no longer contender
20:15 in this world and will shift all of our
20:17 manufacturing back to the United States
20:19 and maybe that slave labor ain't gonna
20:23 get you anywhere anymore
20:25 and when your people rise up and say
20:27 what the f
20:28 I bet you'll sign that sign that
20:32 negotiation and I bet it would last
20:34 maybe a week you'd be done with this
20:36 crap already instead of dragging it out
20:38 like Trump stone for what's it gonna be
20:40 a year two years I know it's worth
20:44 billions but you could create a fair
20:47 deal they're gonna make a ton of cash
20:48 they're gonna prosper they're gonna
20:51 maybe fill up those phantom cities they
20:53 have but what concerns me initially is
20:58 our health and this is where Trump's is
21:02 sort of losing traction with his
21:04 supporters I do not believe the United
21:08 States of America has a national
21:11 standard for drinking water in the
21:14 United States of America you can have
21:16 great water in New York and crappy water
21:18 in California and no one says this is
21:20 what the national standard of strategic
21:23 resource called water should contain and
21:27 have him immediately say fluoride is a
21:30 poison if you want Florida in your water
21:34 then fine we'll give you ten places you
21:36 can buy a fluoride and squirt it into
21:38 your water like a [ __ ] and at least we
21:40 just let those that need to seize
21:43 procreating to procreate you know they
21:45 just won't do it the teeth will fall out
21:47 the die of Osteopathic whatever their
21:51 brains will be really small because
21:54 their pineal gland will be dead but nope
21:58 we have crappy water all over the place
22:00 in the United States of America medicine
22:03 hmm we know that we're creating cancer
22:08 and we know they probably have probably
22:11 some synthetic methods of curing it but
22:13 we also know that we have natural means
22:15 of curing it natural vitamin ways of
22:20 curing it one the scientists of the
22:23 world know what you should eat every day
22:24 to avoid cancer they do and they know
22:27 what you should stop eating to not get
22:31 it they know that all the devices that
22:34 we carry around with us are completely
22:35 toxic they know that cell phones have
22:39 a manual that's supposedly in the phone
22:42 that says keep it three quarters of an
22:44 inch away from your face otherwise you
22:47 could run into health issues but they
22:48 never specify cancer go to McDonald's in
22:52 America at least and read the little
22:54 sticker on the to go window this is food
22:57 in this you know restaurant causes
22:58 cancer at least according to California
23:00 so I know that that's what you're doing
23:02 but you drive by it they put the sticker
23:04 far enough back that by the time you
23:06 drive up to open your window to pay for
23:07 it
23:08 the stickers out of your sight and out
23:09 of your mind mmm of course there's that
23:13 one guy that eats you know - there was -
23:16 - for Big Macs a day and he's just doin
23:19 just fine you know you've got some
23:22 rotgut I'm sure and he ain't dead yet
23:25 vaccinations preventive healthcare to
23:27 keep all these pharmaceutical companies
23:29 afloat a horrible regiment that blows up
23:36 the stomach blows up the brain gives you
23:40 a swelling due to the infection and some
23:44 of that swelling can cause brain damage
23:47 how many kids are autistic these days
23:49 was it one in four they're saying by
23:52 2050 it'll be every other kid okay when
23:57 do we care seriously spare me all of
24:00 your stories about how you'll save a
24:02 puppy at some you know veterinarian
24:04 place and you know don't get a new dog
24:07 get a beat-up dog what about human
24:10 beings first what about that thing you
24:13 go to go to your dog thing ii love dogs
24:15 but let's put some skin in the game of
24:19 stopping this ridiculous regiment stop
24:22 going in and telling people they need
24:24 vaccinations when you know nothing about
24:26 pharmaceuticals and if i said i got a
24:29 gun pointed right at your face and it's
24:32 loaded and it's cocked and if you can't
24:34 name everything in a vaccination that
24:36 you're recommending for your children or
24:38 mine i'm gonna blow your [ __ ] head
24:39 off well maybe you would recall your
24:44 expertise oh but I trust corporations to
24:47 care about my health oh really
24:49 do you trust McDonald's the curve about
24:51 your health
24:52 No well then why would you care why
24:54 would you think a pharmaceutical company
24:56 is built out of special human beings
24:57 that don't need money to keep going
25:00 we know that pharmaceutical companies
25:02 are running around killing people in the
25:04 United States they absolutely are
25:07 they're not only killing killing these
25:09 doctors who run around preaching anti
25:12 vaccination they are torturing these
25:15 people it's atrocious man and you know
25:20 never gets reported when it gets
25:21 reported passed around your conspiracy
25:23 theorists mm-hmm I mean apparently
25:26 skydiving is safer than becoming a sort
25:31 of pediatrician that's against
25:32 vaccinations being a Navy Seal in this
25:36 in the thick of the worst war we've ever
25:38 fought as a safer career to being a
25:40 pediatrician against vaccinations yeah
25:44 and these morons vote on these laws that
25:47 say oh yeah you know we're gonna pass
25:49 this law that says you got to take a
25:50 vaccination to go to school they're
25:53 trying to pass mandatory vaccinations
25:55 for adults good luck man good luck and
26:00 no one's sticking a needle in me man
26:01 unless I want it in me what else is
26:05 going on we have abortions down in the
26:08 United States of America at least in 13
26:10 states lucky 13 right where they can
26:14 kill a fully-formed child and they can
26:19 kill a fully healthy form child and they
26:21 can kill a child with Down's syndrome I
26:23 got this episode I recorded I'm not sure
26:25 I'm gonna release it it's all about the
26:27 demon Kratts there's gonna be a little
26:30 duplication if I do release it but
26:34 nothing about that the Democrats were
26:36 trying to give Trump crap because he
26:38 didn't type up you know the most fuzzy
26:41 warm essay when the Special Olympics
26:44 came around it's like this guy if he's
26:45 just handling business and he doesn't
26:47 pay attention to something that few
26:49 presidents have ever paid attention to
26:50 in any written form he's a jerk but
26:53 they're running around saying you can
26:54 kill a Down syndrome kid now at nine
26:56 months before it's born because the
26:59 parents don't want to deal with it we
27:02 know that they're planning an economic
27:04 collapse they're gonna try to do it but
27:05 it's actually
27:06 fairly difficult now some of the things
27:08 were waiting for let me actually go back
27:10 to health for one second here the other
27:13 thing that hasn't stopped especially as
27:18 a result of this 17:00 movement and this
27:20 fully lucid president is chemtrail
27:24 Spring as matter of fact articles are
27:27 coming out every single day about these
27:30 agencies including NASA and DARPA
27:34 talking about how they're gonna spray us
27:36 with chemtrails to block the Sun because
27:39 climate change is real well climate
27:41 change is [ __ ] fake for one thing
27:42 completely [ __ ] fake and spraying
27:45 trails in the sky is not going to ever
27:46 solve that problem the world's a
27:49 gigantic place if it's a disc or a ball
27:51 adèle matter you're going to need
27:52 millions of planes flying millions of
27:55 missions every single day to affect the
27:57 you know the reflection of the Sun off
27:59 the earth
28:00 it's about poisoning us on planet Earth
28:03 I got friends that hat can't stay
28:07 healthy for two weeks I look in the sky
28:10 and it's full of these ridiculous
28:12 chemical dust balls up there that people
28:15 call clouds they're not clouds go see my
28:20 episodes on chemtrails I have talked to
28:23 military pilots and commercial pilots
28:25 that both acknowledged it ain't them
28:28 like believe me it's not them and when
28:30 we try to talk about it it's like trying
28:32 to talk about a UFO if you talk about it
28:35 too much you'll get fired but luckily
28:38 the third person I talked to was a
28:39 private pilot who didn't really hadn't
28:42 put any thought into chemtrails but he's
28:43 like oh yeah yeah I've actually went
28:46 into these things I didn't know you guys
28:47 called him chemtrails but absolutely
28:48 they're real and they fly at night and
28:51 I've nearly you know had an encounter
28:54 with one of the planes that it's lights
28:56 off it was spraying this gigantic cloud
28:58 of crap coming out of the back and I was
29:00 worried it was gonna take me down it's
29:03 real it's super real the German
29:05 government because they have fairly
29:07 educated citizens and a friendly I guess
29:09 basic moral fiber and their bones told
29:11 their citizens it was a military secret
29:14 weapon all right so one country says
29:18 it's totally real and
29:19 a weapon and then everybody in America
29:21 can't handle it because or whatever the
29:24 two snowflake II obviously that
29:26 algorithm is changing but you can't have
29:29 one of the part of the world say it's
29:30 real on the other part of world say it's
29:31 fake I mean it's the same stuff it's
29:33 being sprayed globally then you get your
29:36 baby boomer like Jesse Ventura who says
29:38 oh oh but it can't be real because they
29:40 spray them on top of the politicians too
29:42 sure they can sure they can
29:46 these people are complete [ __ ]
29:49 sellouts why don't you think they just
29:52 continue look up and go oh there's my
29:54 I'm responsible for that program I'm
29:56 special I'm important and even though
29:58 it'll kill you it won't kill you right
29:59 away so you know it's just we're in the
30:02 Wild West and I'm a coward like there's
30:06 courageous people that sell out their
30:08 country according to Jesse Ventura it
30:12 just it took that guy from maybe being a
30:15 nine on my skill to being at to like a
30:18 big turd the seventy dude has a really
30:22 well it's probably not his phrase but he
30:24 got it into the vernacular of the Great
30:28 Awakening which is you don't get the
30:31 flack unless you're over the target
30:33 well one they've attacked the seventeen
30:35 movement on an unprecedented level whoo
30:39 that sounds like fear to me and so it
30:44 sounds like what he is distributing is
30:46 lucidity and again for anyone who wants
30:49 to believe he's a LARP because again you
30:50 can't stomach what's going on with cue
30:52 the problem with that is is he's
30:54 teaching us how to wake up he's teaching
30:56 us how to be you know critical thinkers
31:01 that is not the algorithm of the deep
31:04 state and it will never turn into
31:07 something that will be flipped besides
31:10 perhaps a global Cataclysm that they're
31:12 planning which would be some some poison
31:16 and everyone knows we're gonna get to
31:20 the 5g thing no I did an episode on the
31:22 5g phone network it stands for fifth
31:25 generation not five gigahertz with 4G
31:30 networks you have a wave of an
31:33 gee at a low amperage but it's about two
31:36 and a half feet before it repeats so
31:39 just imagine a sine cosine wave up down
31:41 up down okay
31:44 the one of five G is about a centimeter
31:49 really small and so they're gonna put
31:53 them everywhere now what did the 17
31:56 movement try to say well one of the
32:00 spin-off folks that are supposed to be
32:03 tight with him they essentially said
32:06 that President Trump took 5g to the
32:08 military and got it cleaned up I don't
32:11 know how you do this right gets it
32:13 cleaned up preventing it from causing
32:15 cancer preventing it from controlling
32:17 the minds of humans which is what 4G can
32:19 already do and without your permission
32:22 these things are being put in your
32:24 neighborhood and they're being beamed at
32:25 your bodies and I did see a special of a
32:29 kid who was trying to debunk 5g he made
32:34 some good points his point was that the
32:37 amperage the power that 5g networks are
32:41 going to be operating on is so low that
32:43 your average light bulb in your house
32:45 has more amperage and that radiation in
32:49 general is a light bulb it's everything
32:51 it's everything then emits that hits
32:52 your body it's that's radiation and so
32:55 his thing is to say he pointed up at his
32:58 workshop and he said you know see those
33:00 fluorescent lights up there those have
33:01 more emissions on my body than a four
33:04 then a three 5g Network routers hitting
33:07 me in my neighborhood so let's hope he's
33:10 correct it's easy to get afraid of
33:12 things that we don't completely
33:13 understand but again with with 3G and 4G
33:18 you had scientists all over the place
33:20 and Australia and I believe wherever
33:26 Nokia is so the Netherlands or whatever
33:29 that is Norway whatever whatever country
33:31 they're in they all came back and said
33:33 this is bad news man this stuff can be
33:36 configured to talk to the human brain
33:38 okay all I can say is the Internet of
33:44 Things is a lot different than just
33:45 saying one little signal
33:47 at a certain amperage is not going to
33:49 hurt me well if every object in my house
33:51 has a an internet Wi-Fi chip in it
33:55 that's a whole different game guys and
33:59 so there was this series of articles and
34:02 posts on the Facebook group for deep
34:04 thoughts the radio that said is this the
34:08 kill switch I mean is this it is this
34:11 the life-ending thing that will make the
34:13 Georgia Guidestones true which is to say
34:15 if you haven't seen the Georgia
34:16 Guidestones
34:17 it's a set of stones in the Ebert
34:20 engorge ax that say a lot of good things
34:24 from two to ten but number one is reduce
34:27 the role population to five hundred
34:29 million you know they're not going to
34:32 start at the highest number so if they
34:33 start around 120 million or at about 97
34:37 to 98 percent reduction of the world
34:38 population which is where we get into
34:41 agenda 21 which has been rebranded
34:43 agenda 2030 2030 is only ten years away
34:47 people here comes helicopter
34:51 I can hear it back there most of the
34:54 world just wants to be left alone but
34:56 most of the world is trying to leave
34:58 everyone else alone as well and that's
35:00 the problem
35:01 everyone's looking the other way all
35:03 around the world though the EU must be
35:07 good because everybody wants it's all
35:09 those group mentality this groupthink
35:11 unfortunately they're infected with
35:13 algorithms that aren't written by their
35:15 own minds so again they are they are
35:18 convinced to worship their demise it's
35:21 on one level at just sitting back and
35:23 going well I believe in God I believe in
35:26 a whole nother realm of existence so
35:29 this is sort of an experiment and sort
35:31 of interesting to watch it would be as
35:32 if you went back to any country that was
35:36 overrun by a dictator that took away the
35:38 guns promising they'll be safer and then
35:41 immediately [ __ ] all their citizens
35:42 right it's like going to whatever
35:47 country just watching it occur and going
35:49 well you know if I even get a caught up
35:51 in the collateral well I'm just going to
35:52 get reincarnated so whatever but I don't
35:56 think that's the test of mankind I think
35:58 the test of mankind is to build
36:00 world that can sustain itself without
36:02 war without these dictators without
36:05 these bankers without anyone doing any
36:08 harm to anyone I think that's the
36:09 ultimate test you want to wait for the
36:11 second coming like it what's so funny is
36:14 the Internet's starting to get full of
36:16 all these people that believe the second
36:18 coming is are like right around the
36:20 corner I hear it I hear just in public
36:24 it's weird man
36:26 everybody always thinks that the Second
36:28 Coming is coming when they can't deal
36:30 with reality they're just like well God
36:33 is coming back so I don't need to worry
36:34 about anything I'll just vote for
36:35 whoever they say I'll just do whatever
36:37 give me that VAX it give me double flu
36:39 shot tonight this blows me away the
36:46 Federal Reserve is a gigantic problem
36:48 the United States of America it's a
36:49 private for-profit bank as we always
36:51 talked about seventeen keeps saying that
36:53 the private the Federal Reserve is going
36:55 to be reorganized they can't just simply
36:58 I mean they could but it's easier to
37:00 infiltrate the deep state banking system
37:04 and reorganize it than it is to turn it
37:06 off and try to replace every single
37:08 element of its existence from scratch
37:12 the only thing we need to do is take a
37:14 mall fiat currency and bring them on to
37:16 either a fiat currency that we control
37:18 which has limited amount of quantity or
37:21 get us back on a gold standard and for
37:24 those people that think we don't have
37:25 enough gold
37:26 it's all relative people you could have
37:28 one bar gold and make it on the gold
37:30 system you just have to say that a I'd
37:34 have three hundred and fifty million
37:35 people you chop that bar gold and 350
37:39 million theoretical pieces and that's
37:41 how much gold backs our currency but
37:43 fortunately the United States has more
37:47 gold than any country in this world I
37:49 think once we do it and you know that
37:53 doesn't that's not any type of slam on a
37:57 different country most countries have a
37:59 lot less people the United States of
38:00 America in the first world index India
38:03 and China I haven't quite reached the
38:05 first world index yet I don't care what
38:07 anyone says
38:08 these people aren't free the living and
38:10 you know if there are free they're not
38:12 up to our levels of Sanitation
38:14 enough public restrooms in a city you
38:17 know for God's sakes or they're still in
38:19 a communist regime that's not first
38:22 world you don't get first world
38:25 classification in my mind unless you're
38:27 a freely elected system and I think that
38:33 we almost need another level over first
38:35 world which is once one of us goes first
38:38 and cleans out the deep state we get a
38:40 different categorization we're a zero
38:44 world country I mean we are the top of
38:46 the top because we got rid of these and
38:48 supposedly there's a few countries in
38:51 Europe that have done it I can't verify
38:53 it so I won't even mention it I wrote an
38:57 article and one page news com called the
38:59 big picture and it was I drew a diagram
39:03 as well which showed essentially the the
39:07 various arteries of how they control us
39:09 an education is in there and it's huge
39:13 what they're doing to the educational
39:15 system now is unbelievable and we need
39:19 to have honestly the Attorney General of
39:24 the administration that's exists to go
39:27 in and develop some some standards and
39:31 some laws that say this is the way you
39:32 can operate your school and this is what
39:35 you can you know detain a child for or
39:38 remove a child from school for and these
39:40 are the things you can't mentioning god
39:43 no sorry can't touch a child if he's
39:46 proud of his president and wears a mag
39:48 ahead you can't touch the kid you can't
39:53 if he wants to say the Pledge of
39:55 Allegiance and you just got to deal with
39:58 it but I think add more level of
40:00 granularity if a teacher is caught
40:02 pumping some political agenda especially
40:07 outside of a political class terms for
40:11 immediate removal from the school you
40:17 can be fired immediately in a public
40:20 school now if you want to send your kids
40:24 to some liberal snowflake college may be
40:27 my guess
40:28 be my guest don't be surprised if they
40:31 have gender identification problems
40:33 don't be surprised if they crawl under a
40:35 desk the moment that the world gets hard
40:38 they'll be surprised if they're pouring
40:40 coffee for the rest of their lives
40:42 trying to pay for that new Macintosh
40:45 laptop that just got no [ __ ]
40:47 processor power one port and no disk
40:50 space you know it's up to you men if you
40:53 want to destroy your kids the world is
40:56 getting soft and that's what they want
40:57 us to be soft you know they love
41:01 throwing all of the the soldiers these
41:03 amazing men and women who joined the
41:06 military in the United States of America
41:08 can't speak for any other country but
41:09 they love throwing them into Wars and
41:11 causing all kinds of physical and mental
41:13 ailments in their in their lives they
41:18 want them to be suicidal they want them
41:20 to disappear they want you to be
41:23 disabled and that's why you got a fight
41:25 if you survived you come back and you
41:28 repair yourself and you stick it to them
41:31 because they're the ones that put you
41:33 there the bankers put you there and we
41:37 don't even know what war agendas are
41:38 good and what war agendas are bad
41:40 America has got a big piggy bank which
41:43 is why we keep getting screwed
41:44 globally I've said it so many times I'm
41:48 sick of saying it but I'm gonna say it
41:50 again the European monarchy which still
41:53 runs Europe okay if you have any
41:56 delusions other than that time to wake
42:00 up time to wake up but they control us
42:02 too because they control and own all the
42:06 banks every single one and are their
42:09 families that ever became monarchs the
42:11 Hapsburgs and the Rothschilds sure
42:13 absolutely if the pace or rumor is true
42:17 and they're in the United States with
42:18 the French monarchy in the United States
42:20 richest family in the world could be a
42:24 PSYOP who knows it's on the CIA website
42:27 look it up pay Sewer against PS EU are
42:34 but they think the United States of
42:37 America is their property they financed
42:39 it in their mind way way back when
42:42 and even though they lost the
42:44 Revolutionary War they just considered
42:45 that a setback and they were right
42:48 because through enough paid shills they
42:51 got the Federal Reserve in the 16th
42:54 amendment and income tax which is a
42:56 voluntary system to be perceived as a
42:58 mandatory system of collecting money
43:01 from us to pay for their deeds the
43:04 Democratic Party right now in the United
43:05 States of America is the most it is the
43:09 biggest collection of mental patients
43:12 that has been that have been released
43:13 from a mental hospital or you know it's
43:16 a metaphorical they haven't been
43:18 released they never were admitted but I
43:19 should say that haven't been admitted to
43:21 a mental hospital they are incredibly
43:25 bad at all things government one plan
43:29 after another after another this Cortes
43:32 chick guarantee her degree was purchased
43:36 by somebody but Bernie Sanders can't
43:38 even get a budget right in any one of
43:40 his platform initiatives talking about
43:44 like you know trillion dollar
43:46 initiatives here and trillion to harsh
43:47 initiatives there okay tries to tell you
43:52 to tuck in your belt and you know spend
43:55 less money on utilities when the guy has
43:56 three houses just like Al Gore and his
44:00 $40,000 a month electric bill in summer
44:02 time mm-hmm Al Gore said the Montecito
44:07 would be under water in 2010 and he went
44:09 bought a house before 2010 banks around
44:12 the world financed beachfront property
44:15 all around the world constantly because
44:17 they know that Al Gore is lying about
44:19 the rising ocean levels but people
44:23 staying high still hang on to this crap
44:25 let's not forget the Hearst Corporation
44:27 that invented lying yellow journalism
44:30 they realize if they pumped a narrative
44:33 into the public mind that people just
44:34 simply believed it because why just like
44:37 I said the previous episode what are
44:41 facts people believe the newspaper was
44:43 real they didn't think the newspaper
44:45 could lie and then it just turned into
44:47 radio and then television and movies and
44:50 television shows they get you from all
44:52 angles lie lie lie
44:54 hmm that's why I like whiten period
44:57 pieces because there's no chance that
44:59 someone's gonna insert this crap in my
45:01 film unless they bring it back to modern
45:02 day which they might the reason why I
45:06 sleep better nowadays is that the
45:09 movement against these individuals is
45:12 gigantic YouTube is interestingly enough
45:18 paid for by them and it is the tool that
45:22 is destroying them people are talking
45:25 about things had never talked about
45:27 before I don't walk in a room and
45:29 mention something that no one's ever
45:30 heard of very often and that's good
45:34 that's real good technology is another
45:38 area where we are all failing miserably
45:41 we accept the ludicrous you know we are
45:45 allowed to you know there's all this put
45:48 solar panels on everything
45:49 solar panels are the shittiest way to
45:51 generate electricity in a natural means
45:53 but that's why we're allowed to have
45:55 them but now there's a bunch of
45:56 businesses lobbying all the state
45:58 legislation to put them on the roof of
46:00 every house windmills are the second
46:03 shittiest technology now in a particular
46:07 situation yeah sure you can put that on
46:09 your house well we fit what we
46:12 discovered in California is that they go
46:14 bad when they're obsolete and then
46:18 recycling recycling them is a huge pain
46:20 in the ass people put these gigantic
46:23 heavy things on their homes some homes
46:26 can't support them on the rooftops
46:29 mm-hmm where is the zero-point energy
46:32 systems you know why is it that we have
46:36 physical proof that these things exist
46:39 and no one goes and resurrects them and
46:42 builds a company out of it we got
46:45 billionaires chasing Bigfoot and UFOs
46:47 but no billionaires chasing zero-point
46:49 energy systems why because they know
46:52 they're gonna get killed doing it and
46:54 we'll just sit around going huh whatever
46:56 another billionaire did whatever it's
46:59 good man mm-hmm I think the biggest
47:03 thing about the big picture in 2019
47:05 especially in spring
47:07 is that we are far from winning this war
47:11 we have to assume that they are moving
47:13 around every way they possibly can to
47:16 counteract everything that's being done
47:17 in the United States and everywhere else
47:20 the problem was seventeen is that he is
47:24 trying to tell everyone don't worry
47:25 about anything enjoy the show
47:28 and then he posts fight fight fight
47:30 whatever the hell that is and he's
47:33 getting us to be complicit with no
47:35 progress that is really effective you
47:40 know we've been clearing the president
47:41 estates of this fake Russian collusion
47:43 of course it's fake it's a complete fake
47:45 bunch of [ __ ] it is completely I
47:48 mean the idea that a president about to
47:51 be on boarded or even running for
47:54 president and he is the president that
47:56 has been chosen by a particular party
47:58 that the Democrats the Republicans I
48:00 want that person to start having
48:01 dialogue with Russia he didn't do it but
48:05 I mean I watch come on you're gonna
48:07 you're gonna go into this position on
48:09 the very first day and say get me Putin
48:11 on the phone let's start talking well
48:13 you know it's okay to but why not
48:16 premeditate a little bit and just kind
48:17 of say well I'm going to be the
48:20 president I'm going to be a hundred
48:21 percent for my citizens not yours so
48:24 what do you think about that
48:26 they say all this stuff is going on I
48:28 haven't had an Intel briefing yet so you
48:32 know what am I gonna find out about you
48:34 when they tell me all this stuff
48:35 what are they gonna say what do you say
48:37 if they say they got proof what do you
48:39 got is their terms of counter proof
48:41 those kind of conversations are logical
48:44 things that are going to take place and
48:46 I'll give you an analogy that is
48:49 commonplace in this world okay let's say
48:52 that you run a business that sells air
48:55 conditioners and here's your an AC guy
48:58 your NAEYC salesman okay you are working
49:03 for one of the biggest AC production
49:06 companies they sell more AC units on
49:08 commercial properties residential
49:10 properties in Southern California you're
49:12 one of the top dogs as a matter of fact
49:14 and now a medium company is trying to
49:19 you know
49:21 to be competitive and they're gonna try
49:23 to hire and poach that guy out of
49:25 another company there's no law against
49:26 it of any kind and they're like looking
49:28 at their budget and they're like look
49:29 we're making pretty good money you know
49:31 that other company makes a half a
49:33 billion a year we only make 20 million a
49:35 year all right well we're gonna set
49:37 aside three hundred and fifty thousand
49:40 dollars to hire the best salesmen from
49:43 that other company and we know no matter
49:45 what they're given that guy he ain't
49:47 making three hundred fifty thousand
49:48 dollars a year it doesn't have stock
49:50 options that he doesn't have this and
49:51 that and this and that so they put
49:54 together a package and they contact the
49:56 guy and they say hey would you like to
49:57 work for us of course you're going to
50:01 hire someone who knows the competition
50:04 okay what's the difference between a
50:06 presidential candidate knowing about the
50:08 enemy supposedly someone you have to get
50:11 along with you cannot become the
50:12 president United States and not get
50:14 along with Europe get along with Russia
50:18 China South America you have to have you
50:22 know some sort of rapport and
50:24 relationship and if you have a
50:25 pre-existing expertise but you're the
50:28 number one candidate to take the
50:30 position as opposed to someone who's
50:31 never had those conversations who might
50:33 get on the phone with Putin and he just
50:35 rolls over the person because he's been
50:38 presidents in the 1999 he's at 19 years
50:41 to become an expert our president gets
50:44 eight years okay the Democrats are doing
50:48 anything in America they're trying to
50:50 block absolutely every piece of progress
50:52 because they don't want Trump to get any
50:55 credit for anything so it's a vendetta
50:58 based lack of participation in repairing
51:02 a very [ __ ] up country and how did it
51:06 get all [ __ ] up because Obama was
51:08 president for eight years and Bush was
51:09 president for eight years a bunch of
51:11 deep state guys or president until since
51:14 JFK was murdered in 1963 they all sold
51:19 out America every single one of them and
51:23 now we got a guy that doesn't want to
51:24 sell out America and he's the ultimate
51:26 bad guy how do you figure man how do you
51:30 figure well you don't like the way he
51:32 talks and brags about himself and also
51:34 there's
51:35 okay fine who cares you know how many
51:38 celebrities that you like to treat every
51:41 waitress like a piece of [ __ ] every maid
51:44 that ever cleans their house are doing
51:46 one of the ever mows their lawn they
51:47 treat him like a piece of [ __ ] but you
51:49 worship them on a daily basis some of
51:51 you are those people not my fans but you
51:55 know so I might slip up on the video and
51:57 somehow tab to this part of the video
52:00 there's an actress in Hollywood I won't
52:02 say your name but she I heard a bunch of
52:07 but hurtness when she was not in Blade
52:11 Runner 2049 they created a CG image of
52:16 her and they said well why didn't they
52:17 bring her back the original girl not
52:20 tell you why because she's a [ __ ]
52:22 that's why she was at a convention a
52:28 comic-con convention and she was with
52:32 two very good friends of mine
52:34 and she's walking down a hallway with
52:36 her two sons and there was a security
52:38 lady guiding them to where they needed
52:40 to be and this woman was a little bit
52:41 heavy and she said something to the
52:44 effect of well at least I'm not like
52:47 this fat [ __ ] in front of us oh the
52:52 lady could hear her okay I'm talking two
52:54 feet away why that lady didn't turn out
52:57 lean into her man I do not know okay
53:00 what about all these fans that love her
53:03 to death are they willing to admit
53:05 that's what kind of person she is
53:07 I mean you know aside aside from pulling
53:11 out a kitchen knife and stabbing her in
53:12 the back how do you get any lower than
53:14 that
53:15 as a human being unreal and in this
53:21 world what I've discovered is um it's
53:24 really strange you know I'm the kind of
53:30 guy that keeps it very very real in my
53:32 universe and I have the friends I have
53:35 because I keep it real but sometimes we
53:39 need to acknowledge people's strengths
53:42 and weaknesses in order to better know
53:43 them and better interact with them to
53:46 know that when we get propositioned by
53:48 them
53:49 that we need to be cautious and perhaps
53:51 just bow outs for whatever reason so I
53:55 don't makes friendship and business or
53:57 whatever the case might be but what I
53:59 find out is that there are people that
54:01 operate like that and when you sit down
54:03 and go oh you know so-and-so had a big
54:05 business venture well you know that that
54:07 guy's got that issue and yeah he does
54:09 okay so we're we're all on the same page
54:12 here yeah but you'll get someone in the
54:13 room that says oh man you guys are being
54:15 so critical about somebody else and he's
54:17 not here to defend himself and then it
54:18 on you look at this guy going dude
54:21 we love this person we're talking about
54:23 could be your parent could be some
54:25 relative but they could have issues and
54:29 sometimes they have issues and they're
54:30 really good people and sometimes they
54:32 have issues or they're just complete
54:34 [ __ ] that's their problem not my
54:37 problem over a particular age and you
54:41 own who you are and you have seen better
54:44 behavior maybe you're mentally ill maybe
54:47 a person's mentally I should say and you
54:50 they just can't stop being that way well
54:53 that's the case they're gonna be a
54:54 lonely person aren't they because you
54:56 can't have that type of negativity in
54:57 your life you just can't it's a
55:00 cognitive dissidence it's the emperor
55:02 that has no clothes on sort of mentality
55:05 people want to live in such a wonderful
55:07 world they're not willing to acknowledge
55:09 what's wrong with it how we gonna fix
55:12 anything if we can't do that call a
55:15 spade a spade is what they used to say
55:18 20:19 will be the make-or-break moment
55:20 for this 17 dude he's either gonna go
55:23 down in major flames or he is going to
55:27 be revered as one of the greatest heroes
55:31 of mankind or he and his clique he and
55:34 his people plus the administration and
55:36 the president 9 states if he's telling
55:38 the truth
55:39 but now there's been this little
55:40 archetype that's been going on and I
55:43 want to address it because some of our
55:45 listeners who are very smart and very
55:46 compassionate brilliant human beings I
55:49 brought up a point and that is that some
55:54 people that seem to have worked for some
55:56 pretty evil agencies are getting
55:57 appointed in various roles by the
56:00 President on States
56:01 the recent concern was that the recent
56:05 appointee to be the head of the fish
56:07 fishing Game Commission in the United
56:11 States of America is an ex Monsanto
56:12 executive okay so it looks like our
56:16 presidents bowing down to Monsanto has
56:19 been purchased by someone else I forgot
56:20 about him
56:21 but of course they create all the GMOs
56:23 in the world which are super bad for us
56:28 here's the way I view that because I
56:30 think Rudy Giuliani and my mind if you
56:35 ever caught any of the MKULTRA episodes
56:37 we raked that guy over the coals every
56:39 single time we had a chance because he
56:42 presided over 9/11 and he seemed to go
56:48 along with everything that was going on
56:49 and his biggest sort of faux pas in the
56:54 eyes of anyone who wishes man well is
56:57 that they were looking for the remains
56:58 of the survivors of that horrible day at
57:03 Ground Zero in Manhattan but as soon as
57:08 they found that missing gold he called
57:11 off the search and rescue for the human
57:14 beings and later because he called it
57:17 off way too soon we were finding remains
57:21 of people all over the place in New York
57:23 and someone actually proved that some of
57:27 the remains were being scooped up in
57:29 rubble not sorted not searched because
57:33 the search had been turned off that
57:35 stage had been turned off and it was
57:37 being reapplied towards potholes in New
57:41 York like they'd pour stuff into a
57:44 pothole to fill it up and they found
57:46 human remains in a pothole that was a
57:47 story that went around they fell in it
57:49 they found human remains on neighboring
57:51 buildings because of the explosions that
57:53 went off inside the buildings blasted
57:55 that stuff like a flower all over the
57:58 area but they didn't have the chance to
58:00 clean up the human bodies because he was
58:04 operating under banker orders to simply
58:08 get this thing reset the second they
58:09 found the gold now
58:13 that guy is a huge advocate for the
58:15 president senator Graham senator Graham
58:20 is besties with uma Abidine the absolute
58:24 female agent from the Arab Brotherhood
58:26 who was given clearance I believe in
58:29 1996 top clearance in the White House
58:31 without any background investigation as
58:33 to where she came from which is why you
58:36 know and she was also side by side with
58:38 Hillary forever we think that they were
58:40 lovers and that she was simply a
58:43 ceremonial wife to Anthony Weiner who
58:46 was off trying to have sex with
58:48 teenagers so Graham's been a huge asset
58:51 yes I was Rudy Guiliani for the
58:53 president United States so are these
58:55 guys all deep state or still hmm well I
58:59 think we have some pretty good visual
59:01 proof about Senator Graham when he went
59:04 to John McCain's funeral there was some
59:07 pretty heavy stares at him by those that
59:10 were leading a pretty deep investigation
59:13 into what John McCain was up to and the
59:19 very next day after that funeral he an
59:21 interviewed Cavanaugh and made sure the
59:23 Cavanaugh said on record that a normal
59:27 citizen of the United States of America
59:28 could be tried in a military tribunal as
59:30 long as they conducted acts of treason
59:33 or sedition against the United States of
59:35 America collaborating with the enemy you
59:37 lose your rights and you go into a
59:39 military tribunal that was spoken it was
59:41 recently spoken again for senator
59:43 Feinstein who then got really nervous
59:46 let me run this scenario you're working
59:51 for any government any agency any
59:56 corporation and you go in big-eyed
59:59 because you're very optimistic and
60:00 you're young and I've got plenty of
60:03 friends who have run into the States
60:05 this situation the nurse that told me
60:06 that autism was merely a legal loophole
60:09 to keep hospitals from being blamed for
60:12 the the damage that vaccinations are
60:14 doing to kids and she's sobbing her head
60:16 out she says she just finished a meeting
60:17 with a hospital administrator that was
60:19 telling her this with a bunch of other
60:21 people everyone in the room was guilty
60:23 after that point for administering
60:25 vaccinations to
60:27 kids without telling their parents about
60:29 what's what's at risk and she didn't
60:33 know what she was gonna do with her life
60:34 she was like I can't do this and she was
60:36 sobbing and I mean sobbing okay you look
60:40 up that word in the dictionary and her
60:42 face is there okay the day I have met
60:44 her so these people are in the inside
60:47 sometimes and they find themselves on
60:49 the wrong side of the law the wrong side
60:51 of humanity and so they jump at the
60:56 opportunity to switch sides to say
61:00 you're gonna protect me now I get
61:03 protection right I'm not gonna die I'll
61:05 go in and do all the things that I've
61:07 been dying to do which is to stick it to
61:09 these jerk-offs I'll do that you're
61:11 gonna prove promise me I'm not gonna die
61:13 and they tell them whatever they need to
61:16 tell them you're gonna get top security
61:18 you're gonna get Secret Service
61:19 protection like you never have them by
61:21 the way all these kids are brand-new
61:23 Secret Service people they don't report
61:25 to the old guard now the nice thing
61:27 about these guys being called out guys
61:30 and gals being called out as as previous
61:32 deep state operatives running for
61:35 corporations that have torn up our
61:37 health system our legal system etc etc
61:40 helping the bankers every step of the
61:43 way there's an hour watching them you
61:46 think that lady who's been put in charge
61:48 of the fishing game is not gonna be
61:49 watched like a hawk
61:51 watch her see if she does anything
61:54 that's absolutely crazy I don't know
61:55 what you can do a fishing game to really
61:57 screw up the entire universe I don't
61:59 know Rudy Guiliani jumped in and applied
62:02 his legal knowledge to the Trump
62:06 collusion investigation met with Mueller
62:08 and basically came back and said this is
62:10 gonna come back a huge nothing burger
62:12 you just wait and it did was it Lindsey
62:16 Graham that dude is up there defending
62:18 the president on a level that's never
62:22 been seen before he struts with the
62:24 press following him he's got this [ __ ]
62:26 eating grin on his face for the first
62:27 time in his life he gets to be on the
62:31 good side now now what if you were in
62:34 that situation would you want to be
62:35 absolved for those of you who are
62:37 Christians think about Paul Paul gets to
62:39 write 80% of the New Testament
62:41 he was a serial killer of Christians
62:43 until God [ __ ] put a beam of light on
62:45 him in the desert you never even met
62:47 Christ in his entire lifetime knows
62:49 everything about him wrote this whole
62:51 two-thirds section well if you think
62:55 he's cool well then that's exactly what
62:58 all these other people are they've
63:00 switched sides potentially you hear all
63:03 these reports that people don't like the
63:04 president from and within his
63:06 administration well there's probably a
63:08 few reasons for that one you don't think
63:12 Obama employed some of the biggest bunch
63:14 of [ __ ] snowflakes on planet Earth
63:16 they don't want people administration's
63:18 that are being controlled to have any
63:20 say in anything and so you'll never see
63:23 your boss you'll never be asked to do
63:24 anything besides go get a cup of coffee
63:27 and so when someone comes in who's a you
63:31 know rocks [ __ ] hard and he's like
63:33 this isn't gonna be a game anymore
63:35 people if you're in my administration
63:36 you work and this is what we're going to
63:39 do and they see all these liberal you
63:42 know wastes of money these these stupid
63:45 welfare programs and you know keep
63:48 everybody down thinking keep the blacks
63:50 thinking they're down Mexicans they're
63:51 down everyone is down but white people
63:53 and now white people have all this white
63:55 privilege and so we're going down to and
63:57 the president's like that has nothing to
64:00 do with me so if you're gonna toe those
64:02 agendas you're gonna be really unhappy
64:03 and of course they'll go out and squawk
64:05 and just publishing companies out there
64:09 leftist publishing companies that want
64:11 that juicy descending voice so think
64:16 about it you have some petty job in the
64:20 administration and some guys gonna give
64:22 you five hundred thousand dollar advance
64:23 on a book to squawk on the president
64:26 sure though we're gonna take it one
64:28 they're cowards one they're the
64:31 treasonous to begin with they've been
64:34 dealing with treasonous administration's
64:35 and helping them do their treasonous
64:37 stick things sure when the treason games
64:40 over their expertise are gone they're
64:43 complicit docile nature has no use but
64:48 I'm willing to bet there's a few they
64:50 did what I just talked about and they've
64:51 been looking at a bad administration for
64:53 eight years no
64:54 god this is a breath of fresh air let's
64:56 do this it's almost as if Americans
64:59 aren't content with the president unless
65:01 he lies about everything he promised to
65:03 do during his administration Obamacare
65:07 did not allow in everyone with
65:08 pre-existing conditions Obamacare didn't
65:10 let you keep your doctor - the biggest
65:13 lies about that whole health program in
65:15 premiums they said that would go down
65:18 have quadrupled like two or three times
65:20 now $100 a month fees for people that
65:25 had just basic coverage for emergencies
65:27 like someone young like me that's
65:29 healthy you know you know I don't buy
65:31 all that crap why should i buy that crap
65:33 I'm healthy my relatives didn't have any
65:35 of that stuff and they lived just fine
65:38 yeah I get super old I get Medicare good
65:41 but I'm gonna take care of myself so I
65:42 don't burden my fellow citizens with my
65:44 health if the political parties of this
65:49 world cared about us it would take maybe
65:53 six months to clean up all the laws
65:56 besides the tax code but you just throw
65:58 all that [ __ ] out the door and come up
66:00 with something very simple if they fully
66:04 tax corporations instead of giving away
66:06 all these prizes to corporations we
66:07 wouldn't have any income tax at all for
66:09 citizens right you have Apple
66:14 corporation makes a hundred billion a
66:16 quarter and we need to collect citizens
66:20 from Joe the Plumber or closer collect
66:23 taxes from Joe the Plumber do we really
66:25 have to do that no because if you tax
66:28 that 100 billion properly you just wiped
66:30 out the need for any citizens and
66:32 there's all kinds of major corporations
66:34 you want to do business inside the
66:36 United States of America where you're
66:37 gonna pay taxes on that business so if
66:39 you want to sell oil you gotta pay taxes
66:41 you can put your company and all kinds
66:44 of weird offshore agencies doesn't
66:46 matter you want to sell that product to
66:48 the United States of America it's gonna
66:49 get tariffed on the way in and sales tax
66:51 as soon as it sells enjoy life in
66:54 America controls the third-largest
66:56 reserve of oil in the world nets off the
66:59 coast
66:59 northern coast of Alaska plus we have
67:02 giant reserves plus our land all 50
67:05 states generate oil
67:07 we'd be just fine providing all of our
67:09 own strategic resources we've got enough
67:14 uranium and plutonium to blow up the
67:16 world a million times we don't need
67:17 those specialized things either I think
67:20 most of you that follow this thing
67:24 called NASA you understand that NASA
67:27 used to exist and not really get in the
67:29 press that much and now because of
67:32 social media they are pounding social
67:35 media with lies lies lies lies lies
67:39 animations tons of SpaceX animations no
67:42 one's allowed to see those boosters land
67:43 live especially the third one that lands
67:47 out in the middle of the ocean hunt some
67:49 barge hilarious man hilarious until one
67:55 of us is invited to see that stuff
67:56 happen live
67:57 I'll volunteer take me to where those
68:00 boosters are landing off the coast of
68:01 Florida just let me sit there in a
68:04 folding chair he'll even drink a beer
68:06 I'll just wash it and I'll film it with
68:09 my iPhone or my phone my Android boom
68:12 I'll film it I'll film it with this
68:13 camera right here and I'll stream it
68:15 live on the Internet so you guys can see
68:18 my footage of those things landing then
68:20 we can all go Wow Wow [ __ ] they really
68:21 do it but until then they're not doing
68:25 it I wouldn't trust the trip to the
68:27 space station but I'm sure someone's out
68:29 there that would maybe a mark sergeant
68:32 would send him up to the space station
68:34 let him take photos with his cameras and
68:37 all that good stuff or some other really
68:40 double-blinded conspiracy person let him
68:45 see it was that stick 666 Galliano on
68:49 YouTube I hate his handle but he's a
68:51 brilliant dude man so that guy up I
68:56 trust him
68:57 son David Icke I trust that guy don't
69:02 trust Alex Jones I'm in at episode 20
69:06 ago called keeping the pressure on
69:09 that's the name of the game right now
69:11 that's the big picture name of the game
69:13 that's the strategy now I mentioned this
69:15 other thing a long time ago and it needs
69:17 to be said again we do
69:19 when the Great Awakening is over we
69:24 decide when this revolution is over not
69:26 them we need a list of demands from the
69:29 citizens of the United States of America
69:31 because if we get it right Europe will
69:33 not sit and watch they won't they will
69:36 revolt you think this yellow vest thing
69:38 going on in Paris is bad it'll be a
69:40 million times more intense than that
69:42 until they get what we have over here
69:44 and if you're over there I know you
69:47 agree what would be my list of things
69:51 let's start shall we let's start with
69:55 health care there could be absolutely no
69:58 kickbacks allowed on any medicines being
70:00 prescribed by anyone you can't go and
70:03 abduct a child in the middle of the
70:05 night from their parents to force them
70:07 into either chemotherapy or vaccination
70:09 programs or any medical regiment
70:11 whatsoever if you don't agree with their
70:13 choice on how to raise their kids tough
70:16 [ __ ] it's their sovereign right to do
70:18 whatever they want if they're guardians
70:20 of these kids they're guardians of these
70:23 kids now doing harm in terms of actively
70:26 destroying the flesh of a human being
70:28 that's where laws are already on the
70:30 books to stop that from happening the
70:33 major corporations getting a profit off
70:34 this care without proving what's in
70:37 these vaccinations not allowed anymore
70:41 we need to have a due diligence on all
70:43 of the things that we know that cure
70:45 cancer and start creating hospitals that
70:48 do nothing but Gershom technique that do
70:51 the vitamin b17 see regiments that do
70:54 thermal therapy that do maybe what is it
71:00 the weed therapies they have out there
71:02 try them all see what happens
71:04 have people volunteer into the system I
71:06 guarantee there's a million people out
71:07 there who say yeah I'll die trying those
71:11 I won't die trying this radioactive
71:14 isotope crap or this radiation therapy
71:16 stuff education every single school has
71:21 to prove that the degree that they are
71:22 giving a child is linked to a trade
71:25 skill or an employable skill of some
71:27 kind and to the degree that those are
71:30 not trade skills they have to be
71:32 explicit
71:33 you want to learn chemistry and only go
71:35 one degree in your bachelor's degree
71:37 that's great you can teach it that's
71:40 what you're gonna do or you can work in
71:41 a lab at a low level but they tell you
71:44 that ahead of time these are the careers
71:46 you can get if you want to be the top
71:47 dog at a pharmaceutical company you're
71:49 not getting a PhD very simple you know
71:52 this going in and so your expectations
71:55 are cool that works loan programs for
72:00 education have to be demolished because
72:05 it's allowing schools to create jag Anik
72:07 tuition fees of which they can get all
72:10 this sucked out of the government loan
72:12 programs tuition would absolutely go
72:16 through the floor for at least most you
72:19 know state-level colleges because they
72:21 wouldn't have this opportunity to milk
72:23 the citizens for all these loans sure an
72:27 Ivy League school could do whatever they
72:28 want banks banks and all corporations
72:33 sort of go into one little camp these
72:36 fees that they charge us for all these
72:39 things you know these cellphone
72:40 companies that [ __ ] you over left and
72:42 right man I just had a big Rosen I
72:46 called them up and reduced my data plan
72:49 my bill came in perfectly at 119 bucks
72:52 very next month it was back up to 139
72:55 but I was busy and I didn't make the
72:57 phone call and then it came in at a
72:58 hundred and sixty nine and then I found
73:00 out the guy on the phone didn't remove
73:02 this stupid tablet they gave me with $10
73:05 a month charge which I finally got
73:07 reduced and they kept this 8-gigabyte
73:11 plan on my thing when I had reduced it
73:13 to four on the phone the guy on the
73:16 phone didn't change my plan but took the
73:19 entire phone calls claiming that he did
73:21 you get caught doing that hmm when you
73:27 got a refund all the money every single
73:29 penny you [ __ ] the customer over you
73:32 got to prove it you want to prove that
73:34 he didn't say it you got to prove that
73:36 too now how many little you know 911
73:39 charges are out there still little
73:43 charges that were invented during a
73:44 moment of
73:47 shock and awe and trauma for our systems
73:50 and these companies still carry these
73:51 weird little fees on all these bills
73:54 climate change
73:56 we gotta race this stuff out in the
73:59 United States of America we don't
74:00 acknowledge it anymore
74:01 you can talk about it all you want but
74:04 there's not gonna be any you know carbon
74:07 credits I get this [ __ ] emails from
74:10 my Power Company you get more carbon
74:11 credits than did for what look you know
74:16 global warming is fake it's completely
74:19 [ __ ] fake and I'm still getting
74:22 carbon tax things carbon tax credits or
74:25 whatever right where's the 17 movement
74:28 when it comes to that chemtrails I gotta
74:30 end hey if it's a natural thing that's
74:34 happening for some fuel additive reason
74:36 or something like that you can't have it
74:38 your plane's if they are caught leaving
74:40 [ __ ] in the sky that lasts more than 15
74:42 seconds especially something that
74:44 expands into a silvery cloud looking
74:46 thing
74:47 your entire airline is going to be
74:52 seized by the United States military
74:55 your planes everywhere they are will be
74:58 deke [ __ ] constructed until we find
75:00 where the [ __ ] you sprayed this stuff we
75:03 put our fighters in the sky anyone
75:05 caught spraying this stuff gets escorted
75:07 to the ground and if you don't adhere to
75:09 that we shoot you out of the [ __ ] sky
75:11 if you know any passengers on you
75:12 because it's trying to exterminate
75:15 people on the earth GMOs you can't do
75:18 them you can't do them they sell you
75:21 this GMO crap that we can't feed all the
75:24 people in our country of the America
75:25 without GMOs
75:26 well Europe seems to be doing just fine
75:29 a lot of third-world countries are doing
75:31 just fine and they you have a they have
75:33 a screwing problem right they're making
75:34 too many people they don't spray this
75:37 stuff all over themselves I mean all
75:39 they don't put in their food they've
75:40 outlawed it right so it's a big lie it's
75:44 a huge line because people have
75:47 kickbacks john kerry's talked about it
75:52 Mitt Romney's talked about it hmm
75:57 about the drug trade lots of money in
75:59 the drug trade isn't there eazy-e said
76:02 I've said it two or three times on the
76:04 show he made the greatest point on earth
76:05 this guy made a million dollars on drugs
76:08 in the eighties before NWA he said none
76:13 of us have passports but none of these
76:15 drugs come from us we don't fly south of
76:18 the border to get this stuff what do you
76:20 think it's coming from go steady Michel
76:23 Rupert's his whole history of
76:25 identifying where the drugs come from
76:28 they come from the five eyes because
76:31 they need liquid money it's untraceable
76:33 that's laundered to finance their deep
76:36 state op reduce operations we need clean
76:40 water and clean air absolutely and there
76:43 needs to be national standards and if we
76:46 have to spend a billion dollars to
76:48 replace every rusty pipe and this planet
76:50 let's do it
76:52 at least the United States could go
76:54 first this whole act and you know Trump
76:58 has said he's gonna he's gonna deal with
76:59 this whole thing but the whole act of
77:02 investigating to find a crime to
77:06 basically manufacturer crime against
77:08 someone has got to be written into the
77:10 Constitution as an amendment just like
77:13 we did for the the Double Jeopardy
77:16 Clause in the Constitution if you are
77:20 tried for a crime and you are acquitted
77:22 or found innocent they can't go back and
77:24 try you again that's what used to happen
77:26 and the monarchy of Britain and Europe
77:29 they just try and try you and try you
77:32 until you're guilty it doesn't work you
77:36 can't keep doing that over and over and
77:38 over again you tie up someone's life you
77:41 make them spend all their savings trying
77:43 to defend themselves and Christ in the
77:45 modern day you know you could be a multi
77:48 multi-millionaire and you'll be broke in
77:50 a year so the only thing worse than that
77:53 is going after someone where there's no
77:55 evidence that they've done anything
77:56 wrong and you just try to find some you
77:59 try to and then you this this fusion one
78:02 dossier thing where they manufactured a
78:06 fake dossier so they could get real
78:10 search warrants to the
78:11 FISA courts we were told by 17 and every
78:14 other attorney especially the lynelle
78:16 guy online who's amazing my vital nation
78:20 is a channel on YouTube which is
78:22 definitely worth watching extremely
78:23 lucid man former prosecutor of in New
78:26 York City he said look once you mess
78:29 with the FISA Court judges you're in
78:30 massive trouble well I'm waiting for
78:32 anyone to be in massive trouble and
78:35 being pardoned by a president should not
78:38 be able to admonish treason or sedition
78:42 if you're found committing treason in
78:44 addition any pardon that you've been
78:46 given by anyone is null and void you go
78:49 to jail
78:50 I think the I've said it before but I
78:53 think the Constitution needs a new 0
78:56 amendment which is that compound
78:58 interest is illegal you can loan for a
79:01 fee that's it
79:03 you don't get compound interest on
79:05 anything you pay a fee credit cards
79:08 could still exist but it's gonna be for
79:10 every $1,000 we're gonna charge you 50
79:14 bucks or whatever it is you agree to it
79:17 you sign the dotted line and then that's
79:20 what you have to pay if you don't pay it
79:22 back then we keep a record of you being
79:24 a welcher on your debt but if you do get
79:28 it paid back it comes off your record it
79:32 just took you a little while maybe you
79:33 had some financial hardships and you
79:35 couldn't pay off your card so we freeze
79:36 the card we freeze the debt there's no
79:38 compound interest happening on you
79:40 there's no additional fees going on you
79:42 that's your debt and you need to work it
79:44 off and once you work it off we patch on
79:45 the back and say good job man sorry you
79:48 had a little hiccup in your in your
79:50 finances that way parents and
79:53 grandparents could loan their kids a
79:54 little bit of money cards gonna get
79:56 cleared off maybe there's even some if
79:59 you're a minor you have to get
80:01 co-signers for those fee agreements just
80:03 like we do now it's a fixed fee you want
80:06 to buy your house cost half a million
80:08 dollars you're gonna pay another $50,000
80:11 in fees you agree well that's what your
80:14 debt is maybe it's a hundred grand
80:15 whatever it is maybe the penalty box
80:18 were you being able to reapply for that
80:21 type of credit is based on how much you
80:23 went into debt for
80:25 so you Welch on that $500,000 debt with
80:28 whatever fee and you can't do it for
80:30 five years you can't have any credit of
80:33 any kind maybe that's the way we work it
80:36 out I think that we need to bring back
80:39 the laws that say that news agencies
80:42 can't pump propaganda that used to be
80:47 the law and they got rid of it and
80:50 supposedly it was brought back under the
80:52 obama administrations but since then
80:54 we've seen more propaganda in the news
80:56 than we have ever seen in world history
80:58 in world history so any working if it
81:03 was brought back okay our country of the
81:06 United States of America needs to create
81:08 an initiative to find zero-point energy
81:11 with perhaps a massive reward you find
81:14 it you get a billion dollars ok Caltech
81:18 how long is it gonna take you they
81:20 probably just go well we've had it in a
81:22 file right here but we're told not to
81:23 read it you know not read to the public
81:25 please give us the billion dollars ok
81:28 boom there you go you win a billion
81:30 dollars have fun with that money build a
81:32 new wing on the side of your college but
81:35 this immediately goes into public domain
81:37 you know one can charge a royalty for it
81:40 everyone can build it and all of a
81:42 sudden we don't need anything Tesla cars
81:44 have an infinite number of miles they
81:46 can travel but guess what every other
81:48 car manufacturer can do the same thing
81:50 so now it's up to you to build a better
81:51 car that's the competition more luxury
81:54 bound safer u1 5g what you gotta prove
82:00 it's it's not gonna kill everybody
82:01 it's got to be vetted by every agency
82:04 that wants to be involved but right now
82:08 4G has given people diabetes cancer all
82:12 kinds of crazy stuff leukemia is the big
82:15 one radio transmissions in general do
82:17 that to the human body houses are still
82:20 being built as if the internet doesn't
82:22 exist it's it's revolting when you think
82:27 about technology I'm a technology guy
82:30 okay well electricity existed before
82:33 houses were wired with electrical
82:34 outlets but it didn't take us that damn
82:36 long to start putting electrical outlets
82:37 in the wall
82:39 so why isn't every house thrown with
82:41 like cat6 wire or cat seven or whatever
82:45 some fiber why isn't the whole house
82:48 wired with fiber how much would that
82:50 cost you an extra grand with fiber it's
82:54 not supposed to turn much but there's
82:55 junction boxes that are built to turn
82:57 right angles so you you right angle the
83:01 outlet in the wall goes straight up the
83:03 wall your right angle it on the roof the
83:05 Attic of your house and it distributes
83:07 all around your house here comes the
83:09 modem from outside it goes in a nice
83:12 safe place where there's no emissions
83:14 from it whatsoever it's in a freakin
83:16 lead box okay maybe it gets a little bit
83:19 of air-conditioning in it or whatever it
83:21 needs right and you plug it right into
83:22 the fiber and every home in your every
83:25 room in your house either has a teeny
83:27 tiny repeater which is just as enough to
83:31 broadcast in your room which means the
83:33 amperage is going to be nothing or every
83:36 device is wired that power cable that
83:39 goes in the bottom of your phone it's
83:41 got the Internet on it and when you pull
83:43 out you know you're going wireless but
83:46 that keeps a tremendous amount of
83:47 wireless technology out of all your
83:48 desktops your laptops it reduces all
83:51 that steam in your house all these smart
83:55 meters in your house well they're just
83:56 wired right into the fiber no need for
83:59 any wireless transmission you want the
84:01 Internet of Things okay so as soon as
84:03 you plug your your refrigerator into the
84:06 power outlet fibers and part of that
84:08 wire system so your whole your whole
84:13 appliance regiment is automatically in
84:16 the internet of things but it's not
84:17 doing it wirelessly it's not even an
84:21 option is it it's wireless wireless
84:23 wireless everywhere death by a thousand
84:26 needles we're waiting for this phase to
84:31 conclude its first chapter because
84:34 there's going to be many many chapters
84:35 after this but the number one phase that
84:38 we are all waiting for and the seventeen
84:40 guy is promising it is that there will
84:44 be arrests a whole slew of arrests that
84:47 you didn't think we're possible that a
84:50 bunch of people are jumping online right
84:51 now and saying since
84:52 muley reports out all these arrests are
84:54 you know right around the corner yeah I
84:56 wouldn't be convinced wouldn't be
84:59 convinced go talk to a Christian has
85:00 been waiting their whole life for the
85:02 second coming and it ain't happened yet
85:04 the whole they think it's right around
85:06 the corner but it's not so it's time for
85:12 us to get e up it's time for us to
85:15 spread this information I am not the
85:17 best source by any stretch of the
85:19 imagination I'm better for your brain to
85:21 to develop in a more enlightened way I
85:23 think I try to stay out of these
85:26 political things but sometimes it just
85:29 peeks out of me and I just got to say
85:32 something I won't know if I'm gonna
85:34 release the demon Kratz episode until I
85:37 hear it so we'll see how bad I got in
85:40 that video but I go after all the deep
85:42 deep dark stuff because I I think that
85:45 we need to stop worshipping people who
85:47 hang out with the spear cooking people
85:49 and these Saints I mean it is super bad
85:52 but luckily they stick out like a sore
85:54 thumb and luckily the hubris of their
85:56 need for fame keeps them right out there
85:59 in front everybody dressing in devil
86:01 costumes and doing half for Super Bowl
86:05 half times and all this Masonic
86:06 symbology I'd be interested in your
86:09 comments you know what would be your
86:10 list of things that would need to happen
86:13 before you would be okay with chapter
86:16 one being over in Chapter one when it's
86:19 over I think the definition of it is
86:20 that we see we see five bloody bleeding
86:25 eyes we see America reaching a level of
86:28 prosperity and freedom from the
86:32 government that we haven't seen in a
86:34 really really long time I don't even
86:36 know when being a [ __ ] is not
86:39 allowed anymore you know you don't get a
86:42 Church of Satan in my neighborhood you
86:45 don't you don't get off when you're
86:47 convicted of or sorry I should say
86:49 proven to be a part of human trafficking
86:52 and underage sex rings like this Epstein
86:57 dude that just keeps getting off and
86:58 getting off and getting off that doesn't
87:00 is that you're not allowed to get off
87:02 like that there's nothing you can throw
87:05 down for a
87:07 maybe to keep yourself alive in jail but
87:09 that's the most you can do those things
87:12 need to occur we all need to feel safer
87:15 so we can get back to normal humanity
87:19 we're not walking around a bunch of
87:20 gangbangers you know like I said you
87:24 know for those of you don't live in
87:25 America what's going on in America is
87:27 really interesting there for the big
87:30 metropolitan areas in the Midwest
87:32 they're totally not like any of the
87:35 farmer little tiny towns that hold up
87:38 the Constitution and the morality of
87:39 mankind they are trying to emulate the
87:42 mid-nineties of Los Angeles they're
87:45 trying to be the biggest gangbangers the
87:46 toughest kids and it's sad because it's
87:51 going nowhere I've seen this stuff in
87:53 San Jose San Francisco Austin Austin was
87:58 atrocious man it's supposed to be this
88:01 big leftist hippie movement I'm telling
88:02 you man my uber guys were trying to be
88:05 as gangster as possible now there's some
88:07 great Christian dudes that were driving
88:09 me around as well that you would fight
88:11 over to your house but the younger kids
88:13 the younger the drivers were was all
88:15 they play gangster music in the car
88:18 salade they couldn't hear what I was
88:19 saying some of them aren't even
88:21 full-blown citizens united states yet
88:24 they're from other countries so they
88:28 need to feel safe so they don't need to
88:31 exhibition this I'm so tough thing in my
88:35 opinion I think chapter 2 would be
88:38 locking the system down locking out all
88:42 of the corruption create checks and
88:43 balances such that that corruption can
88:45 exist that's what I think needs to
88:48 happen I think that's a tall order but
88:49 the banking systems have to be gutted
88:51 educational systems have to be gutted
88:54 Medical has to be gutted science in
88:57 general has to be gutted agencies that
89:01 are sucking you know billions of dollars
89:04 out of our country every year have to be
89:06 gutted and don't worry there's plenty of
89:09 jobs in fact I think there's maybe even
89:11 more jobs available once we come up with
89:13 these policies but someone needs to try
89:15 someone needs to get this going experts
89:17 in those industries know how to lock
89:19 that stuff down
89:20 anyway I hope you feel me if you have
89:24 minute deep thoughts radio.com please go
89:26 that's where you can switch from audio
89:27 to video meaning you can get on your
89:29 podcast if you don't have it or you can
89:31 watch it on video if you happen to want
89:33 to see the pixels move there's a lock
89:36 Facebook group a Twitter page there's
89:38 two donation artery arteries the patreon
89:42 page and the PayPal page so all the
89:45 links are up there just go up there I'll
89:48 probably be changing the theme over the
89:49 summer with a better template so you
89:51 guys can search better on the website I
89:54 apologize I thought I had a search
89:55 filled up there the theme doesn't even
89:57 support a search field so I'm gonna get
90:00 a blog a vlog base template on WordPress
90:03 and get that up there
90:05 but until then take care of yourself and
90:07 someone else and I will see in the next
90:09 deep thoughts over now
