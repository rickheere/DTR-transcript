00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen on this hot 2017 August
00:44 afternoon here smoking a Cuban that my
00:47 buddy JJ got me for my birthday
00:49 Ramone aloneness from the banda i
00:53 thought today we would finally conquer
00:57 the idea of people worshipping our
00:59 celebrity worshipping it's this really
01:02 really strange thing and your humble
01:07 narrator definitely understands it
01:11 because i was young once what this
01:14 episode is about is essentially the
01:18 thrusting force behind things like
01:20 tmz.com
01:22 you know there are just an online
01:24 tabloid agency you know they're the
01:27 probably one of the latest comers to the
01:29 game do you have and this just one
01:33 apparatus they're just an ends to a
01:36 means when i was a kid the two ways that
01:40 you worshipped people and worship is
01:43 obviously my choice of words was you
01:46 watch television or movies i always kind
01:50 of put that in the same theatrical way
01:52 or you bought albums and if the person
01:58 couldn't come at you through one of
01:59 those three sources you really never
02:04 knew they existed and you didn't have
02:06 the constant data flow to worship them
02:10 right you know if you don't know what
02:13 someone looks like
02:13 pretty hard to remember them if you
02:16 don't know what they do exactly yeah so
02:19 information has to travel at you in
02:22 order for you to build up any pretense
02:26 or any notion of who they are or what
02:28 they are right now I was trying to think
02:31 that just for an example of just kind of
02:33 retracing my own background with this
02:35 whole thing which is sort of weird you
02:37 know think about sitting down telling
02:39 people the first celebrity you could
02:42 recognize as a child you know perhaps it
02:47 might have been you know Captain
02:52 Kangaroo or mr. Rogers mr. Rogers gave
02:56 me the willies I have to say at first
02:59 his puppets just looked like little
03:01 satanic hand mittens to me Captain
03:06 Kangaroo was cool man he was just always
03:08 just really relaxed didn't ride over
03:12 chief was good but I can't remember
03:16 thinking about them beyond that morning
03:18 you know there wasn't any like
03:20 connection for me on television or in
03:23 movies I was too young at the time and
03:26 I'm gonna start I'm gonna say 7 years
03:30 old my father used to belong to Columbia
03:34 Records and for those of you who are too
03:38 young to remember you've got a kick out
03:41 of this and for those of you who do
03:42 remember here comes a big powder puff of
03:45 nostalgia my father would get this
03:48 catalog and the catalog was just packed
03:50 full album covers and it's the whole
03:53 music industry inside this thing
03:55 obviously Columbia Records predominantly
04:01 the main albums in there but you would
04:04 join up to this thing you get like
04:06 something like 12 albums for free or for
04:10 a buck when you first join of course
04:11 they're pressing these things for a few
04:12 you know dimes apiece but you had to buy
04:16 an album every single year I mean every
04:17 single month for a year and through that
04:20 attrition without a discount they made
04:23 up all their cash but
04:26 there was a certain cycle if you bought
04:28 so many in a short period of time you
04:31 got a free album and my father gave me
04:33 the catalog because he had picked out
04:35 all the ones that he wanted I said here
04:37 why don't you just pick out an album and
04:39 the funniest thing was is he knew I had
04:43 no knowledge of music beyond what they
04:45 played in the house right and what
04:48 they're playing in the house is like
04:49 Abba Pink Floyd deep purple Led Zeppelin
04:57 and so I look in this album and you know
05:00 of course I don't know anyone but I see
05:03 kiss and I thought whoa what is this
05:07 this looks badass this looks like it's
05:09 gonna be good music and for whatever
05:12 reason there weren't a bunch of makeup
05:14 so I put a little check in there my dad
05:16 sends off for it and this album drives
05:19 I think I'd switched over to my 8th
05:22 birthday but in between ordering it and
05:24 getting it and I had him I lived in the
05:28 country in this beautiful home and there
05:31 was a this kind of piece of furniture
05:34 that was the stereo you know like back
05:36 in the 50s my grandmother had given me
05:38 her old stereo it was beautiful I mean
05:41 today it would be worth bank okay
05:43 because it was beautiful gorgeous would
05:45 you open it up you have the pit where
05:47 you can stack a bunch of records on the
05:49 needle the little doodad on top and it
05:52 just keeps dropping records and playing
05:53 them right so I'm supposed to be going
05:56 somewhere as I remember it and it wasn't
05:59 like right now right now but it was like
06:00 within a few minutes I got a go with the
06:03 family but here comes the Columbia
06:06 Records package and for whatever reason
06:09 that image on that album I mean gene
06:10 Simmons and Paul Stanley are the big
06:13 brand you know geniuses behind this they
06:16 were utterly brilliant to put this in
06:20 there they use that sort of thing I am
06:24 pulling the plastic off I'm taking the
06:25 record I'm putting it down and I play it
06:30 and I remember from the very first
06:32 couple seconds of this thing I was blown
06:36 away I was like holy [ __ ] this is rock
06:38 and roll
06:39 for me kind of you know when you look at
06:41 it now some of the kiss music is it's
06:44 just just fun you know it doesn't take
06:46 itself too seriously it's not it's kind
06:49 of got some goofy lyrics to it but
06:52 there's still just shy of being too
06:53 goofy
06:54 you know she's radioactive gene Simmons
06:58 is so loved so I get hooked on kiss very
07:04 shortly after that kiss Meets The
07:05 Phantom movie came out which made it on
07:08 TV real quick I don't even know if it
07:10 was made for TV it seems like it was but
07:14 now they're like freaking superheroes in
07:16 my life my guy was ace frehley and
07:19 probably gene Simmons between the two of
07:21 them but honestly I liked all of them
07:25 then came the posters it was a big deal
07:28 in the 70s you got posters as things
07:31 just gotcha tape you just put it on the
07:33 wall maybe attack if you're lucky but
07:37 they did a beautiful job of you don't
07:39 know within a couple within one year
07:41 excuse me they had all release or solo
07:43 albums and so now we have these
07:44 beautiful kind of airbrush paintings of
07:47 them and so the reason why I'm
07:50 mentioning kiss is that they provided
07:51 all of the fodder all of the merchandise
07:56 for me to get totally head over heels
07:59 for this band at the same time I'm
08:02 discovering Led Zeppelin and Queen and
08:03 all this other stuff so I'm being pulled
08:05 in different directions but there wasn't
08:08 I'm sorry I didn't have access to stuff
08:11 about them as much as I did kiss like I
08:15 saw one you know van Halen poster when I
08:19 was a kid of course everyone had him in
08:22 their cars in the late 80s but I sort of
08:25 building up this you know I wanted magic
08:29 in my life and kiss was magic you know
08:33 gene Simmons even though he's wearing
08:35 sort of scary demon makeup he never made
08:39 me feel like he was against me or for
08:42 the devil he was just simply him and he
08:46 had his powers and his abilities and I'm
08:49 in his camp I guess you could say I got
08:52 a chain
08:53 to see the charisma tour in 1979 in
08:56 Wichita Kansas a believe cheap trick
08:58 opened I saw it you know gene blow the
09:01 fire gene bleed out you know the lifters
09:05 and risers go up Peter Chris's unit went
09:07 up I mean you know it was one of the
09:09 most amazing concerts right so that's my
09:13 first foray into worshipping humans
09:17 however as I just noted I was a child
09:21 the next big dude that I got into
09:24 because I was watching starting out live
09:26 really late one night
09:27 it's like February 18th or something
09:31 like that
09:31 Prince plays Prince played I think
09:36 uptown from the dirty mine album the
09:38 very next day releases two singles off
09:40 of controversy which my dad happened to
09:41 VHS record and so I had controversy and
09:47 sexuality on tape in video form mmm guy
09:51 just was [ __ ] weird and wild and his
09:54 music was just this crazy crossover
09:56 stuff but now the TMZ issue isn't the
10:01 problem the reason why I'm making this
10:03 episode isn't for this particular
10:06 Allegiance that I'm talking about here
10:09 but I wanted to give that example first
10:11 because there is a sort of fun take on
10:18 liking people and then there's this
10:22 crazy weird sort of gosh there's so many
10:27 weird things that people get out of
10:29 worshiping celebrities today that when I
10:31 was a kid you never you never thought
10:35 about I never saw the adults wondering
10:37 what Woody Allen thought about the
10:39 Democratic Party you know those
10:42 questions were never asked to
10:43 celebrities because we didn't think they
10:44 had any answer that was better than ours
10:46 so how does this go from a transition
10:50 from childish icon worshipping and
10:53 people worshipping to the dangerous
10:57 thing that we have today the perception
11:01 about and when I say people worship I'm
11:03 probably better off just saying
11:05 celebrity worshipping
11:07 the idea is that a celebrity makes so
11:09 much money that they have time off to be
11:13 educated about other things they have
11:17 circles that they travel in in which
11:20 they are given privileged information
11:21 and so when they open their mouth and
11:25 talk there's this notion that they have
11:29 gifted information for all of us now a
11:34 musician who was in the sort of
11:36 Illuminati controlled apparatus of
11:39 Hollywood the MKULTRA thing yes they
11:41 will have information about you know
11:44 what they've had to give up in their
11:47 soul to become popular same thing
11:52 probably for some actors that we know
11:54 but now we have academic celebrities
11:58 you're Stephen W Hawking you're Neil
12:03 deGrasse Tyson you're Bill Nye the
12:05 complete lying douchebag guy we have it
12:09 in business now we have famous CEOs an
12:13 Elon Musk who always says look over here
12:17 look over it no look over here look as
12:20 he creates a wake of failed corporations
12:23 with no with having never attempted to
12:26 really make the thing in the first place
12:27 right and again we all make mistakes but
12:30 you know when you're a media [ __ ]
12:33 you're you're pulling to yourself more
12:37 criticism than those of us who just live
12:39 our lives right the Grammys the Oscars
12:43 the Golden Globes every single award
12:46 show has now been it's been so
12:51 shamelessly hijacked by again it's the
12:57 MKULTRA sort of cloud over this industry
13:02 where what I mean by that is that once
13:05 you want to be a celebrity what what you
13:09 learn when you get into especially music
13:11 is that they've got a whole line out the
13:14 door of super qualified people to be
13:16 whatever musician you think your going
13:18 to be so if you say you're going to be a
13:19 country musician or rap
13:20 or they've got them lined out the door
13:23 there's no problem finding talent held
13:27 it that most the people that are famous
13:28 are talentless and music nowadays people
13:32 can't sing being auto-tuned right I mean
13:35 you could just be conscious and you can
13:38 have a top ten hit in this world it's
13:40 true there's no requirement for a melody
13:44 or something you can hum afterwards
13:46 there's no metaphor or depth required
13:50 just get up there and you know rebrand a
13:54 nursery rhyme so if you want to get to
13:57 the front of the line with a big line
13:59 you know behind you there you're gonna
14:03 have to give it up and if your boy they
14:06 got boy things for you to do and if
14:08 you're a girl they got girl things for
14:10 you to do the gravy right so one of the
14:17 interesting things about this sort of
14:19 sell your soul to become famous thing
14:22 which it's definitely in the acting
14:24 realm a lot and it just there's a
14:25 certain transition period in the 90s
14:27 where it became really bad and it sort
14:30 of stayed there
14:31 now the pedophilia thing that Corey
14:33 Feldman talks about that goes back a
14:34 long ways and nobody even knows where
14:36 that starts right
14:37 definitely by probably late 70s you
14:41 start having bizarre accounts coming up
14:44 right but because everyone's
14:46 tight-lipped
14:47 no one's been prosecuted wasn't
14:49 unbelievable so now I want you to think
14:53 about this formula here where when
14:56 Ronald Reagan got famous
14:57 he had integrity because the world had
15:01 integrity when Walt Disney became famous
15:04 the world had even more integrity and so
15:08 there was sort of this you're held up to
15:10 a standard in order to to be respected
15:14 in general now think about it for those
15:16 of you who huge Walt Disney buffs
15:18 whether you're fans or nods are relevant
15:21 but you can understand the man he rarely
15:25 came out and said anything political his
15:26 his main agenda was everyone get along
15:29 you know it's a small role kind of
15:32 formula and I'm gonna build a beautiful
15:34 place
15:34 we can sort of all come together
15:35 harmonize and realize that there's
15:37 nothing to fight over but now think of a
15:40 bunch of musicians and actors who will
15:42 sell their soul and you know we talk
15:46 about souls on this show and I believe
15:47 in Souls I do not believe there's
15:49 somehow you know devil off to the side
15:52 you can talk God out of you know
15:55 maintaining possession of you so I don't
15:57 really believe you can say you're so but
15:59 there is a way to surrender your being
16:05 in this planet to others and to serve an
16:10 agenda that hurts others and there's a
16:14 lot of that out there sometimes people
16:18 are you know you think about a brood of
16:20 ants and you've got your soldier ants
16:22 you've got your worker ants and you got
16:24 this queen well in the center of our
16:26 world in these sort of controlled world
16:28 you have the nefarious powers that want
16:31 to destroy the fabric of society they
16:33 are trying to bring you know a brave new
16:35 world all the way to the front forefront
16:38 it what 1984 to occur all these
16:40 different sort of repression istic
16:42 things then it depends on who is up
16:46 there you know you might have one
16:48 musician she gets up there during the
16:50 Grammys and twerks and teaches your
16:52 daughter how to twerk and if you have
16:54 ignorant parents they all get into it
16:56 and it's just slowly turning your
16:58 daughter into a [ __ ] [ __ ] you might
17:01 have an actor you know I mean it's
17:03 usually fairly fairly you know there's
17:07 some boundaries here I'm just gonna say
17:09 like but you know guys will have their
17:11 own thing about what is acceptable was
17:13 that what isn't acceptable
17:14 you know obsessing on money obsessing on
17:18 drinking obsessing on drugs because you
17:20 got to outdo the guy in the music video
17:22 who isn't really the guy in the music
17:24 video what I'm trying to get out here is
17:27 that the quality of the human beings
17:29 that have become celebrities today and
17:32 of course there's exceptions but the
17:34 more than 51% are of the lowest quality
17:41 a person
17:44 that we have ever allowed to claim some
17:48 sort of celebrity nasai overseen a show
17:53 on TV where you got some clicky thing
17:57 going on a bunch of popular kids are in
18:01 some group and you're not in that group
18:02 or some fictional thing you're watching
18:04 on TV and so sort of the Nerds go well
18:07 screw that we don't need to hang out
18:09 with the jocks we're gonna make our own
18:10 club we're gonna do some cool ass [ __ ]
18:12 so another good group of kids creates
18:15 their own little niche right there a
18:16 little clique but now imagine you've got
18:19 sort of these folks that are you know at
18:23 no fault of their own they're bred by
18:25 society today which is sort of aimless
18:28 right you know I think one of the peels
18:30 of this show is that for whatever reason
18:32 I had a privileged childhood right lived
18:35 in a wisdom bound world the Midwest and
18:38 everything was about those two hundred
18:40 years old statements that would make you
18:42 live a better life and to judge people
18:44 properly and not judge them at all or
18:46 whatever right this is what I want to
18:49 put down in legacy here such that it can
18:53 always be referenced right but now you
18:56 take it out and I don't know about Katy
18:58 Perry's parents but they [ __ ] up they
19:01 completely [ __ ] up that kid nice
19:04 people who raise bad children are
19:05 usually nice people that forgot to pay
19:07 attention to their children in a lot of
19:09 cases and it can happen life gets busy
19:11 and you think your kids figuring it out
19:13 but they're not figuring it out you see
19:16 that one thing wrong and it just creates
19:18 that little grudge and so they're off
19:20 tattoo on their face and joining a gang
19:22 or or making porn you know I mean it's
19:25 just like I'm trying to get back at you
19:26 right but the overall intelligence of
19:30 celebrities has dropped drastically and
19:32 I mean I'm not sure honestly how high
19:36 it's ever been but it seemed like you
19:38 know a lot of them became businessman
19:41 politicians and carried very intense
19:43 dossiers with them where they were
19:45 really addressing issues and I don't
19:49 know we have a couple of those today
19:51 that do well
19:53 but you've got you know you've got you
19:57 know you know I try not to mention names
19:59 but you've got celebrities that do
20:00 tremendous amounts of cocaine that have
20:04 you know venereal diseases that'll kill
20:06 them
20:08 they've been celebrities their whole
20:11 life by the way they've also been
20:12 accused of man-on-man pedophilia where
20:16 they're the adults and this other kid is
20:18 young and and they're caught you know
20:20 one's forcing himself on the other when
20:23 you look at how they've made their money
20:25 it's pretty much you got lucky to make
20:27 films when when things were easy when
20:30 our demands on acting or as low as
20:32 possible and when the overall masses can
20:36 watch a sitcom that is you know tend to
20:39 amount to the follow-up to Sesame Street
20:42 in terms of intellectual depth and
20:44 comedy and they will make their way out
20:48 to the public having literally destroyed
20:53 their life behind them in fact they're
20:55 in the tabloids for having destroyed
20:57 their life for months and years and
20:59 years and years and they'll come out and
21:02 say a political statement or some sort
21:04 of you know where you should put your
21:06 beliefs in this world who's a good guy
21:09 and who's a bad guy I think it's the fun
21:11 part and they like to pick on a recently
21:16 elected president of ours and it's funny
21:19 that that there would be any credibility
21:21 behind this the opinion of one who has
21:24 destroyed their life you know I'm always
21:26 saying on the show if you have a hero
21:28 you want to worship then the way it
21:30 works is you take from them what you
21:32 think would work best for you but you
21:35 leave everything else behind and so when
21:39 someone is completely screwed up their
21:41 life you wouldn't want to live a day in
21:43 their shoes
21:44 honestly why would you ever listen to a
21:48 single thing they have to say right now
21:51 if you think about it what's interesting
21:55 is you know and you're not famous you're
22:00 wondering well but this way if you're
22:04 not famous and you somehow had a little
22:07 an inkling to be famous it's a very
22:11 interesting process of will you ever get
22:12 famous and do you really know what you
22:15 need to know and dadada
22:16 of course you're watching people around
22:18 you do it too if you want to be famous
22:22 but you're not famous and there's this
22:24 there's this weird thing that goes on in
22:26 that individual
22:28 luckily my my own personal bout with
22:33 wanting to be famous
22:34 if it ever existed it was so quick I
22:37 can't remember what had happened I'm
22:39 sure that happened you know because they
22:40 used to used to you know roleplay kiss
22:42 concerts and stuff when I was a kid and
22:44 stuff but I'm not sure I ever really
22:45 understood being famous but when I
22:47 watched people get famous and lose their
22:50 lives to the press man I didn't I didn't
22:53 want any part of that real quick I
22:55 wanted to be behind the camera you know
22:57 almost entirely but when you want to be
23:00 famous there's this weird thing there's
23:02 this yearning to be famous and then you
23:04 start to add credibility to those are on
23:06 the other side of this Fame wall and
23:08 that they did something right and you
23:09 just need to figure it out and if you
23:11 can repeat it in your own style then you
23:12 could become famous and it's not that
23:14 that probably isn't technically true
23:17 it's just it might not be the best use
23:19 of your time like I always say in
23:21 episodes you know I have an episode on
23:24 Fame if you were going for Fame you will
23:27 almost assuredly never get it you need
23:31 to have a skill you need to do something
23:33 special and fame will just follow right
23:35 it's like asking the age-old question
23:38 what would you rather have all the money
23:40 in the world or all the intelligence in
23:42 the world and the idiot says money
23:45 because the intelligent man said well if
23:47 I have all the knowledge I could make
23:48 money yeah I can generate it in a
23:52 million different ways because I know
23:53 all but the guy with all the money you
23:55 might spend it but I know celebrities
23:58 friends of mine who they had a skill
24:02 they had a great skill they got on
24:06 television they are worthy of our praise
24:09 because they created you know fictitious
24:12 characters on TV that are to this day
24:15 just wonderful
24:16 hilarious great you know you can go back
24:19 and watch the reruns and it's great
24:20 right
24:21 however when this presidential election
24:23 came around and they started doing these
24:28 Facebook posts where the post is just
24:32 packed full of hate and tolerance racism
24:37 towards their own race
24:39 all the while claiming the inverse of
24:43 their quality and you look at it from a
24:46 peaceful standpoint of you know with the
24:48 way we usually approach life from this
24:50 show and you're thinking wow this person
24:54 is an utter contradiction and just like
24:57 all of the sort of Alex Jones interviews
24:59 for people who show up to Trump protests
25:01 when they take the microphone and go why
25:03 are you against Trump it's all sound
25:07 bites hearsay you know lies
25:11 you know just unbelievable how
25:14 uninformed and unintelligent these kids
25:16 are but they're trying to quaff in their
25:18 brain that they're intelligent they've
25:20 actually convinced themselves by getting
25:22 to dumb people in a room they have no
25:27 evidence but neither one of them do and
25:29 so they go right aren't we right yeah
25:31 we're totally right right and so what
25:35 has been fantastic about the Trump
25:38 election you don't like that guy at all
25:40 but the greatest thing is that we've
25:41 weeded out the cockroaches and we've
25:45 weeded it out in the celebrity side of
25:47 the world and we've weeded out in the
25:49 average citizen side of the world we
25:53 have been able to expose for the very
25:55 first time the human beings that worship
25:57 celebrities to a degree that they
25:59 actually make policy in their own life
26:01 based on what susan sarandon says you
26:03 know or or charlie sheen and because the
26:08 apparatus is trying to create civil war
26:11 in the United States of America and you
26:13 have to know that every tabloid magazine
26:15 is linked back to this this whole system
26:17 and we're gonna get back to celebrity
26:19 worshiping or people worship being a
26:20 second here when you when you take
26:23 something and you make it an extreme it
26:28 immediately becomes noticeable you ever
26:31 sat in a chair or sat somewhere and
26:33 you're bumping up against something
26:34 right
26:34 motorcycle is actually a pretty good
26:35 example and your your legs kind of
26:37 touching a component down there by the
26:39 engine that's hot it's warm let's just
26:41 say and you know you're like I'll maybe
26:44 it's a cold day and it's a little
26:45 furnace down there and it's great but
26:47 the second you start touching the pipe
26:49 where the pipe starts heating up because
26:51 you really start taking off to where
26:53 you're going you're now suffering
26:55 first-degree burns and you're headed to
26:57 the second degree burns and third degree
26:59 burns your body starts reporting in a
27:01 day hey hey that shit's really hot down
27:04 there you need to move your leg and that
27:07 analogy of opening your mind because of
27:10 extremism on a metric which in that
27:13 particular case is heat you know but I
27:16 was a kid I didn't see these [ __ ]
27:18 protests going on during people's
27:20 acceptance speeches like I do today I
27:23 mean it is it is again it's so much like
27:28 the Star Trek episode were way back in
27:30 the 60s where little kids we're running
27:32 a planet that's what these award shows
27:35 are they've lost all integrity right I
27:38 think most of us understand that every
27:40 awards given if you pump agendas
27:43 kiss-ass and stay in the industry for at
27:45 least twenty years right you know every
27:47 once in while they throw a Trotsky out
27:49 to a kid who's first time actor right
27:51 but it usually has an agenda it's
27:55 related in some metric to an agenda well
27:57 you know we're gonna you two between
27:58 these two but this these group of
28:01 filmmakers are more attached to a bunch
28:04 of other civil war agendas that are
28:05 going on in America so let's give it to
28:08 them let's just let's just take that
28:10 algorithm and push it into the forefront
28:11 if we give it an Oscar then more people
28:14 will see it they'll have this feeling
28:16 they'll either feel empathetic towards
28:18 something that we're trying to draw them
28:20 into oh they'll be outraged by something
28:22 we want them to be outraged when they're
28:23 in their backyard or at the convenience
28:25 store right it happens I go to TMZ
28:30 because every once why I've had either
28:34 former clients or current clients or
28:35 friends of mine in there and you know
28:39 one of my clients got really really
28:41 really attacked last year
28:45 and she was calling me frantically too
28:47 because she thought I could do something
28:49 to help her and so I ended up going to
28:52 teams every day just to figure out
28:54 what's going on you know because she was
28:57 out of touch
28:58 after she her and I did what we could do
29:00 to help her out right she was attacked
29:04 technically not physically but what
29:09 happens with celebrities is that
29:10 obviously they have lines written for
29:12 them so you never really unless they
29:15 show up on Jimmy Kimball or something
29:16 like that which again is a fully
29:18 scripted interview not every single word
29:20 but every single topic they're gonna go
29:22 into from first one a second one two
29:24 third one it's all orchestrated front to
29:26 back there's gonna know mysteries
29:28 usually in those interviews and so you
29:32 don't know who these people are at all
29:34 how many times have you heard of male
29:37 celebrities who you've always seen doing
29:40 amazing things like Bill Cosby for
29:42 instance who would have ever thought
29:44 that guy was drugged and women I'm he's
29:47 mitad to it now in court and so you
29:53 wouldn't have ever thought in a million
29:54 years that that's that's the what the
29:56 case was right was at Rock Hudson no one
29:58 thought he was gay because he was such a
30:00 debonair guy and so we don't know who
30:04 these people are and sometimes it's
30:06 something benign like someone's sexual
30:08 identity that we don't really have any
30:10 business being worried about like George
30:13 Michael's preferences when he went home
30:15 it's not our business right if your girl
30:18 has a crush on yeah I can see where you
30:20 might be upset but whatever you're never
30:23 gonna sleep with them anyway so just
30:25 chill out
30:26 but actors are probably the most
30:29 dangerous because they get extended
30:31 scripts and TV actors probably our most
30:33 dangerous because they get years and
30:36 years and years of a script they play a
30:38 fictional character more than they
30:40 probably play themselves and so even in
30:43 their own mind they're trying to sort
30:44 out well Who am I in this and you know
30:47 after they get more juice to get a
30:48 higher paycheck they're capable of
30:51 walking into the writers and saying well
30:53 I would never do that as a person so I
30:55 really wish
30:56 that you would stop writing that into my
30:58 character and sometimes they Bend and
30:59 they go and so there's this weird kind
31:02 of Xanadu thing where you've got a
31:06 little bit of country a little bit rock
31:08 and roll mixing together now sometimes
31:13 it's truly as clear as a bell
31:16 worshiping someone has got the posters
31:19 they've got the clothing they've got
31:21 t-shirts they go see them in concert or
31:23 whatever they've got every book signing
31:25 and they truly are just mini stalkers
31:27 and then you have a side that is unaware
31:32 that they are absolutely hooked on a
31:35 particular individual and the fictional
31:39 characters that they portray are the
31:41 lyrics that they sing or are influencing
31:44 the mind of the kid or the adult who
31:47 constantly ingest ingests it right now
31:52 something really happened strange for me
31:54 when gangster rap came out now my town
31:58 luckily had just a very light brush with
32:02 this but you would see videos online
32:04 that made complete sense to me and that
32:06 you had you know the CIA drug trade in
32:10 most major cities needed a distributor
32:13 and there was already two gangs in both
32:15 places the Crips and the Bloods although
32:17 they were fairly teeny compared to what
32:20 they are today and so they were
32:21 solicited to become the pushers I know
32:26 you know it was billions and billions of
32:28 dollars going into the ghetto and it
32:30 paid for a lot of things in the ghetto
32:33 right of course it was happening other
32:35 districts as well but when you go to the
32:37 Midwest during that whole gangster rap
32:38 thing and you start seeing kids that
32:41 have no understanding of what a ghetto
32:44 really is their parents make plenty of
32:46 money they've gotten decent cars maybe
32:48 not you know Mercedes but they got they
32:50 have the decent stuff fairly decent
32:52 education but now they're listening to
32:55 the album's and they're memorizing the
32:57 albums and they are trying to dumb
32:59 themselves down to a fake persona the
33:02 Snoop Dogg created on top of himself to
33:04 sell records
33:05 what Dre you know outwardly behave like
33:09 to sell records now
33:10 everyone's seen Dre now because he sold
33:12 beats and so now we have all these
33:15 really intense documentaries with him in
33:18 it and you get to hear he's extremely
33:20 intelligent he would being and he always
33:23 has been and so you know some folks
33:28 never did that like LL Cool J would
33:30 never play one of those characters
33:32 there's just no way in his moral base
33:34 would he do that when other people will
33:36 do it he'll do anything they that that
33:38 will get them on top and so when what
33:42 happened was is in the Midwest I started
33:44 seeing you know from Tennessee to
33:46 Oklahoma to Texas getting privileged
33:50 kids with everything trying to pretend
33:54 and emulate ghetto life when the ghetto
33:57 kids are trying to escape they want the
33:59 [ __ ] out of that situation right and
34:01 these kids can't get jobs because
34:03 they're starting to talk like morons and
34:07 honestly these these imitators these
34:09 posers talked worse than the kids that
34:12 actually lived in the ghetto then those
34:15 kids became parents and the game was on
34:20 baby now for the Hollywood and music
34:25 industry which you know music industry
34:27 is just a tiny skeleton or what it was
34:28 but for Hollywood they're television or
34:30 film now they could make scripts that
34:33 they've never been able to make because
34:34 the public has never been so goddamn
34:36 stupid before but now you can make
34:41 scripts with no [ __ ] endings
34:43 you can make scripts that did that have
34:45 the worst cliches and are just held up
34:48 by sort of shock and awe special effects
34:51 and they'll actually turn a profit
34:53 whereas forty years ago they you know
34:58 the only thing that the only notoriety
35:00 they would have ever had was how bad the
35:02 film was or the show was in the press
35:06 now I personally don't know how many
35:08 people in America because I'm only
35:11 talking about America you have no idea
35:12 how this works overseas there's a lot of
35:15 cultural differences overseas where
35:16 celebrities are not the big deal but I
35:20 guess the other one too is sports
35:23 the sports is just a tiny sliver or
35:26 anyone worries about the political
35:27 statements of a 22 year old kid who's 6
35:30 foot 8 you know most people understand
35:32 that kid hasn't lived enough life and I
35:34 will say on average for me personally
35:37 I'm a huge sports fan the kids it that
35:40 are privileged enough to get on these
35:42 teams they're usually pretty
35:43 tight-lipped about their political views
35:44 they usually maintain a really good
35:46 rapport with society and only a couple
35:48 times there's a scumbag quarterback sit
35:51 down during the national anthem you know
35:54 I don't give a [ __ ] what color you are
35:56 you stand up if you're in this country
35:58 because I would never sit on a bench in
36:00 your country when your national anthem
36:02 is playing let alone in my own goddamn
36:03 country so I'm just gonna leave sports
36:06 out of this because I don't know of any
36:07 you know catastrophic sports
36:11 contributions that were bad but the
36:14 reason why I'm making this episode is
36:15 that celebrities celebrities are being
36:17 used as a sort of distraction
36:24 misdirection mechanism almost like
36:27 they've got a paintbrush and they're
36:28 walking by all of their subjects eyes
36:30 and painting them shut you know painting
36:33 it with a glue to keep their eyelids
36:35 shut and you're only to listen to me I
36:38 am your eyes your ears
36:40 I am your brain I'm your intellect and I
36:45 don't think actually and when listening
36:46 to this show is suffering from this
36:48 problem but I want to increase the
36:50 dialogue between us such that we might
36:53 distill something that we can say that
36:57 it sort of makes people kind of take a
36:58 look at themselves right but it's so bad
37:02 right now that we've sort of filtered
37:06 out folks that are willing to do a
37:07 little bit of research versus a lot of
37:09 research we filtered out those the
37:12 cockroaches that research nothing know
37:14 everything we're still yet to identify
37:19 and arrest those chickenshits that were
37:22 masks and go to protests hopefully that
37:28 jig is up
37:29 and hopefully the investigation if I
37:32 know who they are is not up
37:34 made a whole separate prison for those
37:36 [ __ ] but we need to own our own mines
37:40 right it's like I always say in the show
37:43 little girls at some point around 13
37:46 years old at a maximum usually let
37:50 little boys who are completely immature
37:51 decide if they're pretty right they go
37:54 well am I pretty
37:55 you tell me and then an immature boy of
38:00 the same age or so who's starting to get
38:03 his hormones you know definitely D
38:06 prioritizing everything important in his
38:07 life gets to own your kids opinion of
38:12 themselves and if you don't care if you
38:13 have a boy the boys worry about the girl
38:15 thinks the girls worry with the boy
38:16 things and we surrender our own opinion
38:19 of ourselves
38:19 due to pop culture celebrity worshipping
38:23 also comes with a fair amount of
38:25 tribalism right are you on the winning
38:28 team because that's the only team we
38:29 want to be on and life gets busy right
38:31 so you can't you can't read anything
38:33 anymore you can't study anything anymore
38:35 you can't look at photographic evidence
38:37 of something you're just going to kind
38:40 of pop your up head up out of your life
38:41 sometimes ask everyone where we're going
38:44 what are we doing today
38:45 oh it's ham sandwiches in the backyard
38:48 okay I'll meet you there
38:51 Mayweather just fought Connor right
38:54 Mayweather can't read he can't read and
38:58 I've been asking a lot of people around
39:00 him who were in his circle because I was
39:02 trying to say well surely he reads a
39:04 little bit they said nope he could
39:07 understands his name on paper that's
39:09 about it
39:11 again I still find that hard to believe
39:13 but friends very close to him swear up
39:17 and down that he does not know how to
39:19 read but now imagine some kid
39:22 worshipping Mayweather what could may
39:26 weather possibly know without being able
39:28 to read anything he only knows what he's
39:30 told because he's always training and
39:31 working hard now hopefully now he's
39:33 retired he's a pure vessel of
39:37 indoctrination how could you possibly
39:40 worship that now just so you know I'm
39:43 not picking on me whether I think
39:46 there's a lot of people like that
39:47 who
39:48 can read but are even dumber than
39:50 Mayweather because they like me where
39:53 there's you know for whatever they I get
39:55 I mean I guess he's a wife-beater to or
39:56 something but maybe he's trying let's
39:58 just give him the credit he's trying to
40:00 get educated there's other folks that
40:03 have had the education they got the
40:04 degrees they've traveled in similar
40:06 privileged circles and they put their
40:11 fingers in the ears and say la la la
40:13 when the evidence comes in against you
40:15 know rushing stories and all kinds of
40:17 stupid [ __ ] that's wasting all of our
40:19 times climate change if you believe in
40:22 climate change you're failing the IQ
40:25 test of the century I've met celebrities
40:28 of various genres you know like there's
40:31 a lot of celebrities that don't get on
40:33 you know tabloids because they're not
40:35 famous in front of the camera they're
40:38 famous behind the camera they're famous
40:42 behind the stage of a you know of a band
40:45 they write all the music for the band
40:46 but the band gets all the fame but in
40:49 our circles they're famous they're like
40:52 oh yeah that guy has nine Oscars and I
40:57 will go to these parties with them and
40:59 they'll have political debates but at
41:02 least you've got some people who have
41:05 read and at least they're having a real
41:08 debate and it's all matter of priorities
41:10 in life as to which candidate is going
41:13 for their priorities right and it's a
41:16 fair debate you're like great great men
41:18 we're actually talking here we're
41:20 bringing up facts but the more
41:23 commercial someone is the less informed
41:26 they are when Dave Chappelle broke out
41:30 of his Comedy Central contract and fled
41:32 to Africa because he felt the crushing
41:36 and kilcher force on his career as soon
41:39 as he came back and started taking
41:40 interviews of which he didn't really
41:43 feel like he needed to is from what I
41:44 can gather it's like [ __ ] you it's my
41:46 life I don't need to talk to you I don't
41:48 have any obligation to explain my
41:49 decisions in life this is me but he
41:53 realized he needed to still pay some
41:54 bills even though he's got plenty of
41:55 money to to retire he's got a love for
41:57 getting on stage and making people laugh
41:59 I got to see him live down here a couple
42:01 years ago by the way Dave Chappelle is
42:04 very buff these days he's a big he's
42:07 much bigger than I thought
42:08 I think he's six foot at least and he
42:12 could knock a [ __ ] out with one punch
42:14 and we tell you but because he was
42:17 always so scrawny when he was young he
42:19 is no longer but you could tell in the
42:23 dialogue of what once you see him live
42:25 you'll understand but he's educated he's
42:31 educated well he's educated before he
42:33 ever became famous and he's really put a
42:37 lot of effort into staying educated and
42:39 he stays educated like we stay educated
42:41 talks about the things that very few
42:43 people talk about and so you will have
42:46 some in there that sort of you know you
42:48 if you just don't suck in the
42:51 information from celebrities because
42:52 they're famous and you listen to the
42:54 words out of their mouth you will find
42:55 some gems and the good ones will tell
42:59 you when they know something and when
43:00 they don't know something there's a
43:03 great interview with Orson Welles a man
43:05 who gave very few interviews in his
43:06 lifetime but he gave an interview to
43:09 Dick Cavett back in the day you could
43:10 look it up on YouTube and there are
43:13 several situations in the discussion
43:15 about making films where you have Orson
43:18 telling dick about the things that were
43:21 super important to him and revolutionary
43:23 that he pioneered and he very quickly
43:26 they're talking about some modern issues
43:28 and he said well you know I don't know
43:29 anything about that I didn't keep up on
43:31 that area so I wouldn't remotely attempt
43:35 to comment except to say that I don't
43:38 know anything about that and boy you
43:41 don't get that much humble pie these
43:43 days because again everything is
43:44 orchestrated if if there was a
43:46 background interview before the show
43:47 like a Jimmy Kimball show they would
43:49 simply run into that subject and say oh
43:51 he doesn't know anything about that well
43:52 don't ask that question oh okay and so
43:55 it turns in is like a Bill burr
43:56 interview where they just feed into his
43:59 comedy routine right now comedians
44:01 what's very interesting about comedians
44:03 is that in the 60s you had you know
44:06 Lenny Bruce and George Carlin or Richard
44:09 Pryor and just a ton of folks that
44:12 probably been Woody Allen but
44:15 you have comedians that were very very
44:18 intellectual they didn't know that they
44:21 were gonna become comedians necessarily
44:22 so they stayed educated for all reasons
44:25 to make money just feed their families
44:27 you know Lenny Bruce Bill Hicks
44:32 you know I think Bill Hicks might have
44:34 been whacked I don't know but these guys
44:37 were super duper political George Carlin
44:40 got massively political at the end and
44:42 so we can have individuals that are
44:44 absolute gifts to society but the the
44:47 genetic DNA for those type of comedians
44:50 today is pretty damn rare and like I've
44:54 said in previous shows comedians get
44:55 their specials on TV by bringing a bunch
44:59 of material to a producer who's
45:01 reporting to one of the eyeballs and a
45:03 triangle and they'll go oh that's pretty
45:05 good this is pretty good well could you
45:06 say something about climate change and
45:09 sort of lean towards it being real and
45:12 hey Jim Jefferies could you take a big
45:14 [ __ ] on America's Constitution when you
45:17 come over here and tell everyone how
45:18 stupid they are for having the Second
45:20 Amendment sure what else am I gonna do I
45:26 don't give a [ __ ] about life I'll [ __ ]
45:28 society right Amy Schumer could you make
45:31 sure every little girl in America and
45:33 around the world I can understand your
45:34 routine turns into a big fat [ __ ]
45:36 can you do that oh yeah sure it's not a
45:40 stretch trust me it's funny for a little
45:44 while especially if you're an adult and
45:46 you're educated and you you can see the
45:47 the satire and the irony and a lot of
45:51 things that they're saying because
45:51 perhaps you made the same mistakes in
45:53 your lifetime but when you think about
45:55 the fact that this is broadcasting in
45:57 every single living room around the
45:59 world you have little girls and little
46:02 boys watching these people how many
46:05 people know that our Kelly is
46:07 technically a pedophile I don't think he
46:09 does it to babies but he definitely goes
46:11 to underage girls he's been caught
46:13 several times doing several things and
46:15 people still buy tickets to him but when
46:17 they come home and they hear about a
46:19 pedophile on TV or someone that raped a
46:21 fourteen-year-old
46:22 they say oh my god I would just you know
46:25 I would kill somebody I would probably
46:26 become a murderer I'm gonna go that RKO
46:29 certain Saturday once you consume their
46:32 product do you support them you know
46:36 it's it's hard to imagine that when you
46:37 put money down or when you turn your
46:39 television to a program on television
46:41 and you're watching a sitcom with an
46:44 actor that is one of these people that
46:47 are very uninformed but they're taking
46:50 money on the side to pump an agenda on
46:51 some tabloid you're giving them money
46:54 the second you turn your television to
46:56 their channel when you buy a ticket to
46:58 their concert when you buy a ticket to
46:59 their movie they get part of the money
47:02 you're putting into that how many of you
47:06 are shocked that honey booboo child is
47:08 an obese child right now as soon as she
47:12 got the show she had a little uh I think
47:14 it was like a little YouTube segment or
47:16 someone did some little off spin shoot
47:18 on her and then they she got her show
47:21 and the mom is like got through what up
47:25 god 15 surgeries on she's looking
47:27 actually pretty interesting very proud
47:30 of her but the kid is really big well of
47:35 course a little juice that she was
47:38 drinking to go onstage was probably
47:40 about 3,000 calories worth of liquid for
47:43 a tiny child of course she's bouncing
47:45 off the wall on crazy she's headed
47:48 straight to type 2 diabetes and no one
47:52 around her understood enough about the
47:53 science to keep the kid out so now she
47:55 has this you know gorgeous sister and
47:58 she is now gonna be fighting obesity for
48:01 her entire life because the the
48:04 television producers that were
48:06 exploiting that to make a buck on TV
48:08 we're like drink drink drink go go go
48:11 yeah get fat and cute oh it's just that
48:13 people love you like that and of course
48:16 as society gets obese because of
48:18 horrible fast food they like to have an
48:20 image of themselves on TV succeeding
48:23 when you're really not watching success
48:28 on TV you're just watching people in a
48:31 train wreck on TV they're not really
48:33 going anywhere that you would ever want
48:35 to go and sometimes people like to watch
48:37 the world burn right you know I've met
48:41 dozens and dozens of the eighties
48:42 rockers who were all the bands that we
48:45 worshipped back in the day right and
48:48 nearly all of them are clean now they
48:52 barely drink no drugs whatsoever no
48:55 drugs but they have snorted 50 gallon
48:59 barrels of cocaine in their lifetime
49:01 probably without exaggeration there's a
49:03 few guys that have done it you know if
49:05 you took all the heroin that Nikki
49:06 Sixx's shot up in his veins I don't know
49:09 how many milk cartons that would fill up
49:10 but quite a quite a few right and again
49:14 some of them rehabilitate and become
49:15 really great people they're not perfect
49:17 but there are people we can listen to
49:19 and we can sort of side with their
49:21 struggles so there's a lot of good DNA
49:23 in some of these folks right but a lot
49:26 of them just keep their mouths shut
49:27 thank you their life to themselves not
49:30 that it's a sin to express yourself and
49:32 public but in the end we all need to own
49:36 our own brains right we have to own our
49:39 own decision-making process because any
49:43 paradigm of thought that we adopt that
49:46 we didn't create we have to be careful
49:50 now if it's your grandfather your
49:52 grandmother and they are passing that
49:54 [ __ ] and shinola piece of wisdom to you
49:57 so I keep mentioning in recent episodes
49:59 here then you can just take it at face
50:01 value and go wow this is someone who
50:03 loves me to death who's trying to keep
50:05 me out of trouble I don't need to I need
50:08 to understand it so if I don't
50:09 understand what they're telling me I
50:10 should clarify but once I understand it
50:12 I can just take it and run with it I'd
50:14 help myself out right I've said on the
50:18 show you know my admiration for LL Cool
50:23 J when I was a kid well all of his
50:25 lyrics were either funny or he had some
50:29 sexual ones too but I also knew it was
50:31 married so I realized that there was a
50:33 bit of a tongue-in-cheek thing with that
50:35 he's got to do what he has to do to get
50:37 the young girls all excited but he made
50:41 the song breakthrough had a lot of good
50:42 advice in it and that became an anthem
50:44 for me as I took what was I understood
50:47 and when I'm about my business Prince
50:51 you know I did learn a lot about that
50:53 guy in his life times
50:55 his lyrics inside and out he didn't try
50:59 to give a hell of a lot of life advice
51:01 he just basically said you know he
51:04 repeated this statement on one of his
51:05 posters I said you know your success is
51:09 proportional to your risks and there was
51:12 an interview I just watched recently
51:13 with LL Cool J and Eddie Van Halen on an
51:16 interview together when they
51:17 collaborated on a song and both of them
51:19 are repeating this you know they were
51:21 saying look you got to have the guts to
51:23 take risks in life if you're not
51:26 satisfied with what you have or you just
51:28 want a sharper more amazing experience
51:32 with this world right what I feel like
51:35 personally with my personal position is
51:39 that I was the kid who you know was just
51:42 like anyone else now again it was a
51:44 little bit less by the 80s in the
51:47 sixties you had Beatle mania which was
51:49 you know a buddy of mine I just tell me
51:51 he went and saw the Beatles live and he
51:55 said he actually started you said he saw
51:58 them live that was one thing but he said
51:59 he saw hard day's night in the movie
52:01 theater back in the 60s and he said you
52:03 couldn't hear a word on the screen
52:06 because the girls were screaming from
52:08 the moment the credits rolled to the
52:09 moment it in he goes a dozen girls
52:12 passed out because they literally ran
52:13 out of energy to scream girls being
52:16 carried on the stretchers he's here in
52:18 Los Angeles so that kind of calmed down
52:21 by the 80s where I grew up and so we
52:23 definitely had folks that we liked most
52:25 of them rockers or you know it could be
52:27 Clint Eastwood Bruce Willis Stallone
52:31 Schwarzenegger grinning those guys right
52:33 but today I see it being more
52:36 proliferated because of the internet and
52:39 I'm not even sure that many people watch
52:41 TV I think TV today for most people's
52:43 Netflix HBO GO you know at least in
52:48 Southern California
52:50 I talked to students I talked to my
52:52 comrades of all ages from you know 35
52:56 and up and they just don't watch that
52:59 much TV a couple series they might
53:01 ingest so it's coming off the internet
53:05 and having just
53:08 you know been lucky to me a lot of the
53:10 folks that I admired as as a kid and
53:12 finding out that you know I'm very
53:14 fortunate I picked a really good group
53:16 of people to admire and they are very
53:18 steadfast and very educated and they
53:22 don't get into debates you know very
53:26 often not even in the public eye and
53:27 then you have a couple folks that I know
53:32 that are they basically speak in sound
53:36 bites that come out of their favorite
53:37 news organization when they talk they
53:40 actually think they're speaking out of
53:41 some constructive sentence and mechanism
53:44 in their brain of their own free will
53:45 but they when they talk for an hour or
53:48 something and they haven't said anything
53:49 new that literally has it been broadcast
53:52 over and over and over in the mainstream
53:54 mass media right you realize that
53:57 perhaps it's been decades since they
53:59 ever thought for themselves you know
54:03 when you're given as a page of text to
54:05 read as a script it's not your words
54:09 it's not your world the world is
54:11 actually fake and so what happens when
54:13 you're very famous in that realm and you
54:14 spent 30 40 years speaking other
54:16 people's lines and a lot of times the
54:20 lines are very intelligent
54:21 you may even take a an actor might take
54:23 a role that is way beyond their
54:24 intellectual capacity and for whatever
54:25 reason they're so damn good at acting
54:28 they put off if they've got this 180 IQ
54:30 when it's more like 85 you know mainly
54:34 with this episode I won't expose the
54:36 fraud of celebrity worship I would love
54:42 the population to frown on usurping
54:45 awards as places where people put out
54:48 their own personal agendas because no
54:51 one agrees on everything bare minimum
54:56 like my analogy for church people
55:00 there's no one Church on planet earth
55:02 that has two members that believe the
55:04 Bible from start to finish in the same
55:07 way but they're still able to go to
55:09 these churches and worship and believe
55:12 through an intent through a hope through
55:15 a wish that they actually do have this
55:18 similarity and the thing is is do you
55:21 want to live your life
55:22 with integrity or do you want to live it
55:25 as sort of a caricature of being alive
55:29 if what you say and what you think and
55:33 what you admire is fake you better be
55:37 careful now it could be that you're in a
55:40 repressed situation and you need to be
55:42 you need to fight through it right there
55:44 was a great interview with Morgan
55:48 Freeman on CNN talking to this douchebag
55:53 kind of guys obviously on CNN he's
55:55 trying to race bait Morgan into the the
55:59 black lives matter thing just trying to
56:01 incite civil war which is all [ __ ]
56:03 seen and does right and Morgan wasn't
56:06 gonna buy it because on average Morgan
56:10 does his homework and Morgan's old
56:14 enough to remember what America was like
56:16 back in the day he knows where kids are
56:19 full of [ __ ] and the guy on CNN was
56:23 telling him well he basically said
56:28 something to the effect of how could you
56:31 give hope to kids that have no hope how
56:35 could you tell a ghetto kid that he has
56:37 any chance of escaping the ghetto this
56:38 is the CNN reporter Morgan looked I'm
56:41 like that's [ __ ] you have no right
56:45 to tell another human being that they
56:47 can't get out of a ghetto that they
56:48 can't eclipse the challenges of their
56:51 life because the majority of people that
56:55 have succeeded in life have come out of
56:57 these horrible situations whether it be
56:59 a coal mine coal miners daughter or kid
57:02 out of the ghetto go tell everybody from
57:04 NWA how you can't escape the ghetto and
57:07 so Morgan was just like look we have
57:10 more examples of people that have that
57:12 have refused to believe that than people
57:14 who do the ark in 2017 is exactly what
57:18 the CNN reporter has been doing they go
57:20 around to the disenfranchised and they
57:22 tell them that you are disenfranchised
57:25 and let me tell you how much you're
57:27 disenfranchised let me drum up some
57:30 reasons why you're so repressed and why
57:32 all the things you want in life are
57:35 because of outside force
57:36 is pushing you down when if you got a
57:40 computer do you even have just a laptop
57:42 and you can access YouTube there's not a
57:46 profession on planet earth that you
57:48 couldn't become PhD level certified
57:52 Mensa student 180 IQ brilliant if you
57:56 just watched what you liked and and
57:58 you're obviously a trade skill and
58:00 learned it and learn history and learn
58:03 watch all the conspiracy videos here all
58:05 the dissenting voices about how things
58:07 have been changed and you'll be smarter
58:10 and smarter and smarter the Bill Cosby
58:14 really did what he did he's admitted it
58:17 now we think he did a lot more than he's
58:19 admitted but surely there are some
58:21 people that are accusing him of things
58:22 that he didn't do just to get a little
58:23 bit of money out of the situation right
58:25 but there's some pretty compelling
58:27 evidence that the reason why Bill's
58:30 history came out so heavily after statue
58:34 limitations are over for a lot of his
58:36 people that are complaining now Bellino
58:39 I'm not trying to write the guy a blank
58:40 check for for that behavior but he had
58:44 the audacity to tell the ghetto kids and
58:46 I was in the Bay Area at the time when
58:47 they were trying to formalize Ebonics in
58:49 Oakland California in schools trying to
58:54 say speaking bad English is just your
58:57 tribal instincts right when what tribe
59:00 are you talking about right people in
59:02 Africa don't sit around speaking bad
59:03 English in fact they speak the Queen's
59:04 English if they do because they were
59:06 taught by British teachers right never
59:09 hear the the Indian operators that call
59:11 you up and they have a British accent
59:12 well that's where they get their English
59:14 from why not get it from the people who
59:16 really have refined it more than anyone
59:19 else in the world right but Bill Cosby
59:22 came out and he said you know pull up
59:24 your [ __ ] pants stop talking like an
59:26 idiot get educated figure out what you
59:28 want to do in life figure out how many
59:29 steps is going to take you to get there
59:31 and start taking the steps well the
59:34 problem is is there's a narrative to
59:36 keep these kids down and that no one's
59:40 allowed to break that narrative you're
59:43 not allowed to give kittens kids
59:45 inspiration who were on that list
59:49 that racial list anything that's funny
59:54 is the irony of the whole situation we
59:55 have in America today and I think people
59:57 are finally waking up to the formula and
59:59 I think that most of America like you
60:01 know I can't speak for any other country
60:02 there a week but the people that think
60:05 that they are helping the
60:08 disenfranchised are actually doing
60:10 nothing but assuring that they remain
60:12 the disenfranchised and they're using
60:15 star power to do it a lot of times they
60:19 are manipulated because they are good
60:20 people too but they are just not that
60:22 smart they're brilliant at what they do
60:25 but they don't read they don't study
60:30 they don't have the the mental capacity
60:34 to hear things that they don't agree
60:35 with they don't have the mental capacity
60:37 to read frustrating information that
60:39 contradicts their indoctrination and get
60:41 unand doctrine in so they can join the
60:43 right side of this game nobody knows the
60:46 coup de Gras single thing that will fix
60:49 the society like I always say if that
60:51 was a case we'd do it and we be in
60:52 Utopia we're not there yet so we
60:56 struggle but if you're not trying to
60:59 figure that out by yourself with your
61:02 own brain then chances are you've been
61:05 lured into helping the other side I've
61:09 got good friends of mine that are an
61:11 acquaintance's I should say that are
61:15 revered you know we walk into a
61:17 restaurant and half the time we get to
61:19 sit down for free and or sit down in a
61:21 nice place eat [ __ ] for free and it's
61:24 cool but and as much as I love my
61:27 buddies and what have you
61:29 there are things with them that they'll
61:30 even tell you to your face that are
61:32 screwed up about them and they'll even
61:34 tell you don't copy this about me or
61:37 it's and some lesser cases there's
61:40 they've got issues they're embarrassed
61:42 they know everyone at the table
61:43 understands that they've got these
61:44 issues and they're you know that they're
61:48 working on it personally and they just
61:51 need space and they need love in between
61:52 the moments that they're struggling
61:54 against their addictions or whatever it
61:56 might be the celebrities that I think
61:58 are really educated and super happy are
62:01 the ones that keep their
62:02 life focused and simple that's probably
62:08 the the two things that they have but
62:10 they also have very controlled groups of
62:13 friends around them the smartest
62:15 celebrities don't allow the industry
62:17 itself to participate in their life that
62:19 much because they understand they get
62:20 manipulated they have all their money
62:23 swindled away they have to take roles
62:26 where men wear dresses and you know what
62:29 have you Dave Chappelle said Dave
62:32 Chappelle defended himself he had gained
62:36 this huge crowd to watch his show on
62:39 Comedy Central and then when he hit this
62:40 third season as I understand it they
62:43 started writing the scripts for him and
62:44 changing the agenda of what he was
62:46 saying and he could see it he could say
62:48 I would never say this why am i saying
62:50 this I'm not gonna say this see you
62:52 later I'm gonna go away and be quiet so
62:55 don't run around chasing me and trying
62:57 to accident' me into a palm tree but
63:00 they do make their way back out they do
63:02 you answer some questions they do write
63:04 some routines and they get the
63:06 information out a lot slower Guns and
63:09 Roses wrote a song called welcome to the
63:11 jungle and I think it is unbelievably
63:13 brilliant of them on their Appetite for
63:15 Destruction album that I believe it's
63:17 the first side first song of the album
63:21 and I can't think of a better precursor
63:23 to what they were about to experience
63:25 than to write that song because that
63:27 song pretty much talks about the entire
63:32 paradigm of Fame the lyrics in that song
63:36 are a thousand percent correct you know
63:40 the Big West bombshell girl who comes to
63:43 Hollywood to become famous her family
63:47 didn't understand Hollywood because they
63:49 lived a normal Midwestern life the kids
63:52 come out with no knowledge but a lot of
63:54 energy and dedication and as soon as
63:57 they go to that one Hollywood party up
63:59 in the hills meet a few executives that
64:01 will not sleep with her it's on baby oh
64:04 you want this well then I get that here
64:08 you go
64:08 it's this thing the gravy train right
64:11 what's also fascinating is you'll read
64:13 plenty of stories especially if you
64:15 listen to and get
64:16 find the the folks from Hollywood that
64:17 got in and left now some of them were
64:20 never meant for Hollywood they didn't
64:22 have what it takes to make it happen but
64:24 a lot of them had everything it took to
64:26 make a great album to make a great movie
64:28 television show would have you they
64:30 participated they created some gems and
64:32 then they just walked away and you're
64:35 kind of like how the hell did that
64:36 happen how did you how were you on top
64:38 and then you left trust me they've got
64:41 some really good reasons why they did it
64:44 in most cases they were protecting
64:47 themselves Charles Dickens story about
64:51 Scrooged as a very interesting has a
64:54 very interesting twist at the end when
64:56 he sees Christmas past Christmas present
65:00 and Christmas future right and it
65:04 changes him he utterly transforms when
65:07 he sees from a higher elevation looking
65:10 down on himself who he has been who he
65:12 is today and if he continues who he will
65:15 be and I will tell you that anyone who
65:18 is sucking the tit of Fame whether you
65:21 be famous already or you're aspiring to
65:24 be famous the more that you are
65:26 centralized on that one attribute that
65:29 one classification that one trophy of
65:32 public description your most the time
65:37 bullshitting yourself right Sally Fields
65:41 you know I don't mean to pick on her
65:42 because she was awesome and smoking the
65:44 Bandit she got an Oscar once and she
65:47 stood up there and said you know what's
65:50 great about this is that I now know that
65:52 you like me and the people like me and
65:54 it was the first time that she had
65:57 gotten the alkylating gold that
65:59 confirmed her lifelong agenda to be
66:04 accepted in society when way before she
66:08 was in the movie they got her the Oscar
66:09 which I can't run what the hell that was
66:11 she was already loved there was there
66:16 shouldn't have been any shortage in her
66:17 own personal opinion that she was
66:20 completely accepted by society but she
66:23 needed this arbitrary award to finally
66:27 let it click in her brain
66:29 because she had externalized the opinion
66:31 of herself to a Awards Committee now if
66:36 you're in Hollywood I would say there's
66:38 one other thing you understand about
66:40 this whole conversation which is if
66:42 we're ever to make Hollywood great again
66:45 because TV is pretty damn awesome right
66:46 now no shortage of writers and actors
66:49 and special effects houses I mean their
66:51 shows that are just must cease all over
66:54 HBO and Netflix and what have you but if
66:58 ever to make music good again
66:59 Hollywood good again we're gonna build
67:03 it out of people that don't give a [ __ ]
67:04 about Fame they don't give a [ __ ] about
67:08 other celebrities they don't yeah there
67:11 might be some inspirational people in
67:13 their life but I bet it's one or two a
67:16 guitar player that has a couple guitar
67:18 players that they admire singer that has
67:21 a couple singers that they SuperDuper
67:23 admire but does anyone waiting around
67:25 for Jimi Hendrix 2.0 to show up mm maybe
67:29 a few but it would get old really fast
67:32 and so we want to see Lenny Kravitz come
67:35 around right Lenny Kravitz paid homage
67:38 to the 70s a little bit even the 60s the
67:41 Vinny start creating his own sound start
67:43 using Sentell even Rob Zombie's done
67:45 that right came in with some crazy heavy
67:48 metal band called white zombie we broke
67:50 out on his own he's doing you know
67:52 keyboard songs and techno stuff there's
67:55 he's got his name on all kinds of stuff
67:57 kylie prince did back in the day created
67:59 music you never knew because they don't
68:02 give a [ __ ] about the fame the only
68:05 thing they milk fame for is money but
68:07 it's a game it's a business and when
68:08 they go home put their head on their
68:10 pillow they could give a [ __ ] I think
68:13 you feel me you know we got a we got to
68:18 turn off some of the things that have
68:20 been turned on in society I think that's
68:22 what it really comes down to and the way
68:24 it turned it off is to not really pursue
68:27 it don't go to their sites don't go to
68:29 their channels don't turn on their shows
68:31 don't attend their movies when an actor
68:34 removes all doubt that they have no
68:37 brain maybe you don't go to their movies
68:40 and in the box office goes you don't
68:41 have any more drum
68:42 draw dude lady I'm not gonna cast you
68:46 anymore no matter what capacity you put
68:49 yourself in right deep thoughts radio
68:52 calm for all the feeds there's video if
68:54 you're on audio audio if you're on video
68:56 your video options are YouTube and Vimeo
69:00 your audio options are iTunes Google
69:02 Play or simply go to deep thoughts radio
69:04 comm and click on the RSS feed from your
69:07 mobile phone it'll load it up as well we
69:11 have a locked Facebook group real small
69:14 group of folks but we are having really
69:16 good conversations I want to put a
69:18 little bumper on the end about the
69:19 Facebook group we had some so we have
69:24 folks that believe different things and
69:26 you know there's been this huge debate
69:29 online about flat earth vs. globe earth
69:32 and for those of you new to this show
69:33 yeah I actually just said that and so
69:36 there'll be folks that are part of the
69:39 group and they put together these they
69:40 find really good references to support
69:42 their particular opinion about such a
69:44 thing and sometimes you know the Flat
69:47 Earth group bombs the page with a bunch
69:50 of cool links and I look at them making
69:51 sure they're not real angry links or
69:53 anything like that I try to keep the
69:55 political crap out of out of deep
69:57 thoughts but if you guys are posting of
69:59 something that's politically
70:00 complimenting an existing episode then
70:03 I'll let it go through but a gentleman
70:06 came up to the channel and here the page
70:08 and he's like it's a group actually
70:10 Facebook group just searched on deep
70:13 thoughts radio and look for the group
70:16 it's a link on the deep thoughts radio
70:19 calm page but he said you know it looks
70:20 like you're really biased to this Flat
70:23 Earth thing when I guess the gentleman
70:26 had not watched enough of my videos to
70:27 realize that my position is round globe
70:31 like because of expanding Earth theory
70:33 and so just know that it's gonna surge
70:37 in one way but it's due to the organic
70:39 nature of you guys contributing stuff
70:41 and you know I can't I can't sit around
70:43 with my personal time and say oh I got a
70:45 bunch of Flat Earth articles let me go
70:47 find a bunch of rounders articles too so
70:49 I'm fair and balanced or some [ __ ]
70:50 like that right hey it's a discussion
70:53 it's as if we're all in this patio
70:55 having a discussion
70:56 if the flattered people talk more than
70:58 for this particular session when you
71:00 total up the minutes they got more time
71:03 what I don't want to have is sort of
71:07 abusive disagreements because there's no
71:09 need for that in our world right so
71:12 that's that anyway take care of yourself
71:14 and someone else and I'll see you in the
71:15 next deep thoughts
