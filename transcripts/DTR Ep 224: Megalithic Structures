00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:35 deep thoughts so let's see here it's
00:40 been a couple of weeks since I made an
00:41 episode and I've just been sort of you
00:46 know pushing out all the old episodes
00:47 and looking at new stuff and trying to
00:51 find out what would be interesting to
00:52 cover because you know it's got to
00:54 interested me too and then I stumbled
01:00 onto something that has been sort of an
01:03 annoying reality to me my entire life
01:07 and finally had it explained a couple
01:12 times in videos and I've been watching
01:15 good half dozen really long three-hour
01:18 videos that have archaeologists and
01:21 geologists and historians
01:24 anthropologists physicists all looking
01:28 into the megalithic structures that man
01:34 has created in the past and perhaps
01:37 somewhat different than man has created
01:41 and if you're like me you in life
01:46 they'll be when you see a mystery for
01:49 instance you will feel the mystery you
01:51 will feel the frustration of its
01:52 existence but you obviously are being
01:55 shocked by its debut in your mind and
01:58 debut in life as you've experienced it
02:00 and you get frustrated that you feel it
02:03 you can't quite put the mystery into
02:06 words you can't define it but
02:08 immediately your soul rushes in to try
02:10 and solve the mystery
02:12 and of course being brand-new to the
02:14 mystery you don't have any data you have
02:16 any logic you don't know you know where
02:19 to look so let me give you some examples
02:22 for for the sake of argument about what
02:26 I'm talking about and these are the ones
02:29 that I deal with personally right I look
02:32 at the Pyramids of Giza massive
02:36 structures one of them is built very
02:39 special the Great Pyramid is built
02:42 completely different than the other two
02:43 sort of bad copies but then when you
02:47 start studying Egyptology you look at
02:50 the dozens of bent pyramids step
02:52 pyramids hybrids between the two and it
02:58 starts to blow your mind as to who built
03:02 these things and why when you go into
03:06 South America you have this Inca group
03:10 of folks that built a bunch of amazing
03:11 things but there's this even more
03:13 amazing group of people before them that
03:17 built the absolute totally precise and
03:20 gigantic monolithic stuff there are
03:26 totems in all in the Americas south and
03:29 north totems of men with beards who are
03:34 the wise men with parables attached to
03:36 them about how they came out of the sky
03:39 or what have you and the indigenous
03:43 life-form in South and North America
03:46 neither of which had the ability to grow
03:48 facial hair somehow carved a person with
03:52 the beard and they've carved big marble
03:56 statues of what they would call the gods
03:59 with curly beards so a civilization that
04:04 couldn't grow hair on their face somehow
04:09 worshipped to the point and to the
04:12 extent of creating sculptures of them
04:14 and attaching to them the lore of
04:17 helping to sort of set up the continent
04:19 and set of society this group of bearded
04:21 people and so you hear these things you
04:25 see these things
04:26 and it took the internet God 20 years to
04:29 really start correlating and
04:30 cross-referencing data you know the
04:33 internet really you know from my
04:36 experience took off in 1996 in terms of
04:39 HTTP protocol really blowing up and
04:42 becoming more organic and you didn't
04:44 need you know yellow book directories to
04:46 find URLs online Alta Vista was out
04:49 there yahoo debuts you know for search
04:51 engines to find things and at that point
04:55 you have this this incredible move to
04:59 get the historical data online
05:01 photographs movies but then the devices
05:03 we took the photographs with suck you
05:05 know 35 millimeter cameras and the bad
05:08 super you know 1 megapixel digital
05:10 cameras then there's no real way to
05:13 capture movies you know without a three
05:15 thousand dollar video card and so it's
05:19 taken us 20 years to get to the point
05:21 where we can now just flip on the you
05:23 know YouTube our go take a deep dive
05:27 through a bunch of article chains and
05:29 threads online before you're going to
05:30 actually get you know a great
05:34 three-dimensional view of something
05:36 right but now let's go back to our sort
05:41 of structures we have these
05:46 commonalities between continents
05:50 everyone's familiar with Stonehenge
05:52 right you have the series of the same
05:56 structure and if you're from Ireland
05:57 you'll know you have these altars all
05:59 over the country where you have two
06:02 vertical rocks with a one Rock across
06:05 the top and sometimes they're just
06:07 beautifully honed where the the two
06:09 vertical rocks are very flat on top and
06:11 then the top one just fits on there
06:14 willy-nilly however you want it and then
06:16 you have you know where there's a lot
06:18 more work to it things have been notched
06:20 right and it fits very precisely and so
06:24 it just keeps evolving and evolving
06:25 right well we have that technique all
06:30 over the world and we have it excavated
06:34 out of you know sand dunes in all of
06:38 Africa
06:38 South
06:39 North Africa Egyptian Africa and these
06:43 rocks are perfectly mitered 90-degree
06:47 angles
06:48 seemingly utterly without man-made tools
06:54 aside from perhaps some sort of circular
06:56 saw some sort of ability to just cut it
07:02 with a device you know and you know
07:06 there's you know there's very few
07:09 naysayers about this but in case you're
07:11 trying to suggest the traditional
07:16 mechanisms of you know taking a rock to
07:18 hit a rock and then honing it out smooth
07:21 and making these perfect 90-degree
07:22 angles I would say you are a coward of
07:28 science you know when you see a 90
07:31 degree turn in granite right surface top
07:36 surface of the rock and then 90-degree
07:38 turn straight down the right or left
07:40 side or front and back however you want
07:42 to look at it and then that rock goes
07:44 for 50 feet and there's less than one
07:46 five hundredth of an inch of deviation
07:50 in this rock which is several of the
07:53 stones in Egypt in the great pyramids
07:55 and so forth that level of precision is
07:59 is really beyond the capability of
08:01 mankind to conceive one five hundredth
08:04 of an inch you can't conceive of that
08:07 except to say wow I bet that's really
08:10 accurate but you can't see it with your
08:13 eyes and yet we have perfectly mitered
08:17 rocks right and let's let's take it one
08:20 step further for the brain so you got
08:25 top edge to side edge 90-degree angle
08:27 perfect okay now bring that back to a
08:31 corner so now you have three sides three
08:34 completely adjacent sides the front the
08:38 side and the top and there's a corner
08:40 there and the corner is perfect perfect
08:45 now let me remind you here as much as
08:49 granite is very very strong
08:52 if you go and dig a rock up in one
08:55 location and quarry it and make it
08:57 perfect and then you carry it all the
09:00 way to its destination right and you
09:04 bump it you bump it once those corners
09:08 are gone forever those edges are gone
09:10 forever right
09:14 so these rocks are everywhere and
09:16 they're all over history and they're all
09:18 when I say they're all over history you
09:21 know that sounds like a very typical
09:22 statement you've heard your entire life
09:24 and but the way I want you to think
09:26 about it is almost like a time travel
09:28 movie they are in time all around the
09:33 surface of the planet Earth different
09:36 cultures right now before we get into
09:41 some of the assertions I need to free up
09:43 your mind a little bit if you have been
09:45 following official history now I've said
09:50 that several times on the show but I've
09:51 never said it so on point so let's get
09:54 this straight the white males of Europe
09:58 are a very insecure group of individuals
10:01 and they are very greedy with all things
10:04 and we don't have any problem with them
10:08 understanding their greed for money and
10:10 we don't have usually an understanding
10:14 their grief or control over mankind
10:16 that's what their whole lot is about
10:18 right they're all about war keeping us
10:20 fighting each other so they can do
10:22 whatever they want okay they are also
10:24 greedy when it comes to history
10:28 they fear history probably more than
10:32 anything else one we can see their deeds
10:34 repeated over time and so that we can
10:36 make we could escape their Ponzi schemes
10:40 if we could ever [ __ ] remember
10:41 anything for any length of time right
10:45 but when it comes to history and you can
10:48 see this blatantly in history okay and
10:51 hopefully this will free your mind up
10:53 because we need to really loosen up our
10:55 grip on what we think is true and false
10:58 because I can see a bunch of people from
11:00 you know official universities coming in
11:02 and going oh no I learned this and I
11:04 memorized and repeated this never
11:06 [ __ ] thought once and I got a degree
11:07 that says hey you're good memorizing
11:09 repeater in your you're such a good and
11:12 dr. need a little dogma boy that you'll
11:15 never be able to see the truth if you
11:16 don't for yourself now here's the way
11:20 history goes when it comes to this
11:23 ancient architecture and ancient
11:24 civilizations one year to think that we
11:27 didn't have any ancient civilizations
11:29 beyond perhaps the Sumerians right as
11:33 soon as you get past maybe 5000 BC
11:36 everyone turned into idiots nobody knew
11:38 anything there were no accomplishments
11:40 everybody was stupid yeah the only thing
11:43 you're allowed to look at our cave
11:44 paintings and pottery here and there
11:46 you're to think that you owe them the
11:50 Masons
11:51 what have you everything they saved you
11:57 alright and there's ice ages we could
12:00 throw in here as well but here's the
12:01 thing the reason why the Sumerians and
12:05 the Egyptians get to remain the history
12:08 books is pre white civilize history's
12:12 because they were written into the Bible
12:13 they're written into documents people
12:16 remember what it was like and they have
12:18 passages and songs and books that
12:21 they've written to talk about the old
12:23 times and so the the white bankers of
12:25 Europe were unable you're descended from
12:27 Rome or unable to erase those two
12:30 previous civilizations now consequently
12:34 what did they do to usurp the
12:37 intelligence of Egypt okay Greece's you
12:40 know several thousand years later you
12:44 have Stonehenge which is reconstructed
12:47 in 1954 from some ruins that were down
12:50 the road and they literally wouldn't
12:52 took the rocks and repaired them with
12:54 cement bottoms and reinforced them and
12:56 then built this [ __ ] place in 1954
12:59 and they didn't necessarily lie that
13:02 they built it 1954 they just never
13:04 mentioned it when the Americans came
13:06 over and got all googly-eyed over it
13:08 right but what do they do they date
13:10 Stonehenge prior to the Egyptian
13:14 pyramids to make sure that whitey got
13:18 there before Blackie
13:20 it's that sick okay now what's
13:25 interesting news is you have Asia
13:29 remaining quite a bit of a mystery
13:31 it wasn't until probably the 80s or 90s
13:34 that Americans were allowed to think
13:37 through teaching that China has been
13:40 civilized for 3,000 years you know that
13:43 was an epiphany in the south late 70s
13:45 early 80s wow these people been around
13:48 for a long time not meanwhile you've got
13:51 pyramids in China you have unbelievable
13:56 structures in Cambodia it's all over the
14:01 world quite frankly fi if I forget to
14:04 mention a country it will have to be a
14:06 pretty rural country not to have some
14:08 sort of monolithic structures as a part
14:11 of its indigenous species following
14:15 their their beliefs and their structural
14:19 capabilities right but now come over to
14:23 the Americas you have you know
14:28 Christopher Columbus supposedly coming
14:30 over here to discover gold for the queen
14:33 of Spain right his name wasn't
14:36 Christopher Columbus but whatever
14:40 the guy was a complete creep but we'll
14:43 make an episode on him a different day
14:46 but what happened is is Europe didn't
14:48 know anything about the Americas at
14:51 least officially speaking right the
14:53 Vikings
14:53 obviously come over Asia I think was
14:57 actually a descendant from the Americas
14:59 not the other way around
15:02 but you have a culture that you know
15:06 supposedly looks really primitive to the
15:08 people coming over from Europe and
15:10 undoubtedly there was some truth to that
15:14 but South America tells a completely
15:16 different tale of how long these folks
15:19 had been around and how sophisticated
15:20 they had been but in history what
15:24 happens is this they'll say oh you know
15:26 if you were part of the bank heat
15:29 banking oligarchy who's trying to
15:31 control reality in history here
15:33 is the kind of conversation that they
15:34 have researcher comes back from the
15:38 Americas it's hidden counsel and they
15:41 say okay tell me what you found
15:43 well we found an incredibly advanced
15:45 civilization that seems to have been
15:47 seems to have gone but they have the
15:51 same type of architecture we found in
15:53 Egypt in Sumerian times and some of
15:58 these crazy amazing monolithic
16:00 structures we see rocks that are 200 now
16:02 1200 tons huge rocks precision-cut and
16:08 then on top of that is this current
16:10 culture called the Incas who have
16:12 definitely figured out some of the old
16:14 techniques but they don't have any
16:15 ability to refine rocks so they're
16:17 really just sort of stacking rocks right
16:21 and so then the bankers go well
16:26 has this been reported has anyone
16:28 reported this before no okay
16:31 well we can't allow them to establish
16:35 that they have been here first because
16:37 we might lose some of our indigenous
16:39 European community people to potentially
16:44 take pilgrimage over to South America
16:47 and try to find their roots so in the
16:51 room will be some guy who's part of the
16:52 Historical Society and they'll say okay
16:54 you you are in charge of creating a
16:59 believable fake history for these people
17:01 but you know go with the standard themes
17:04 that they're savages that they're
17:05 barbarians and try to work that into
17:07 anything that you find yes sir some time
17:12 passes the historian group gathers they
17:15 get a bunch of folks together Royal
17:17 Society Academy whatever history and
17:20 they go across the pond they find
17:24 gorgeous pyramids step pyramids ornate
17:29 beautiful they establish very quickly
17:33 that the rock that these pyramids are
17:34 built out of doesn't exist natively at
17:36 the location so now they have to
17:38 contemplate holy [ __ ] how did they move
17:40 all this stuff here they look at it even
17:43 further and realize there's a foundation
17:44 that's been laid to make
17:46 the pyramid doesn't slide around and
17:47 move around they realized that bricks
17:50 have no motor they're just interlocked
17:52 you know maybe with a like a tea joint
17:57 the Keystone locks right and for those
18:01 of you don't know what those are show
18:02 picture of it but it's essentially an H
18:05 with it's like two T's that are
18:07 connecting at the bottom and they knock
18:10 them out of the top of rocks on the
18:11 explosively pour precious metals in
18:13 there to kind of keep them locked
18:14 together now the funny thing about
18:17 keystoning is if you don't Keystone with
18:19 another piece of stone there ain't
18:22 nothing that that crappy metal is going
18:25 to do to hold to 1,000 ton rocks
18:27 together if they want to move your
18:29 little your little Keystone you know
18:32 lock is going to break it just will but
18:36 so they come over to South America they
18:38 look at these amazing you know Mayan
18:42 pyramids and they say or Inka and you
18:45 know the Aztecs which came about later
18:47 on they look at these creations and they
18:49 start these rumors that these people
18:52 were barbaric that they sacrifice babies
18:56 right because there's nothing more
18:58 amazingly horrible than sacrificing a
19:01 child right and so the way that they
19:05 create evidence for this is even more
19:09 sick they the lesser of the two is that
19:13 they actually take you know grease
19:15 pencil and coal and they draw pictures
19:18 kind of arbitrary kind of gross pictures
19:21 which doesn't match in any way shape or
19:23 form the amazing capabilities of these
19:26 people right the the Mayans the Incas
19:30 the prehistoric you know monolithic
19:33 culture that put this thing together
19:34 they have shown aptitude on levels that
19:36 if they saw a human being and wanted to
19:38 render a likeness it would look exactly
19:40 like that human being if they wanted to
19:42 but these little grease pencil drawings
19:45 of you know some sort of priest holding
19:49 up a child with blood hanging out you
19:50 know popping out of the little drops
19:52 little cartoony drawings are all drawn
19:54 by Europeans and then blamed on the
19:56 local culture to create the thing you
19:58 saw an avatar
20:00 right which is to call them savages
20:02 which is the Doctor Who episode Kenda
20:06 that's where avatar was ripped off fYI
20:10 the project name was Kenda as I
20:12 understand it in Manhattan Beach and
20:15 they will not let the dates go back
20:17 further than say you know I think that
20:20 the most credit I've ever heard
20:22 attributed to South American
20:24 capabilities was about 750 ad right now
20:32 what's that do to the mind of man well
20:34 imagine your South American and you
20:36 believe this white man interpretation of
20:39 your history I'm hoping that this isn't
20:42 the case I'm hoping that they're they're
20:43 more intelligent than this but what's
20:46 interesting is is you get these sort of
20:48 pre sensor shift you know
20:50 mouth-breathing architects or arkad say
20:53 architect sorry i should say i'm
20:55 anthropological wannabes these
21:01 archaeology wannabes and they just
21:04 they'll do anything to get employed
21:06 because they know they have an esoteric
21:08 career that few people haven't let me
21:11 think about it how many times you go to
21:12 a bar and you ask somebody what they do
21:14 and they say they're an archaeologist it
21:16 doesn't happen very often so these
21:18 people have to kiss-ass to remain
21:20 employed and what if they ascend through
21:23 the system and they keep getting these
21:24 you know $10,000 a year raises are you
21:27 going to rock the boat and then someone
21:30 whispers in your ear hey our culture
21:33 didn't make these things but you know
21:35 when they believe that we did it they
21:37 tend to achieve more in school because
21:39 they feel like they have the heritage of
21:41 those that did make this I mean what
21:45 blows me away is you know it one level
21:48 is that if you were an Egyptian child
21:51 and you believe that your ancestors made
21:54 the pyramids which they didn't but you
21:57 did believe that as a child you should
22:00 be able to you know look at your school
22:02 window at the three pyramids of giza and
22:05 go I am going to be the best you know
22:08 mathematician because those things are
22:10 based on PI I'm going to be the best you
22:13 know struck
22:13 engineer because those things are one of
22:15 the most ingenious things that's ever
22:17 been built in the world if not the top
22:18 thing ever built in the world you know
22:22 given the time period that they say they
22:23 were built which is a lie so Egypt is
22:29 got a special situation with its history
22:31 it has been utterly gagged by the
22:35 shortest possible date that they
22:38 contribute to it so they lie to you and
22:39 tell you that the pyramids are you know
22:41 about 3200 BC with master buzzers that
22:45 go back maybe another four or five
22:47 hundred years you know we went to turn
22:49 these master buss which if you haven't
22:51 seen what that is they essentially built
22:53 sort of these shoe boxes in the sand
22:56 they had no doors it was kind of like a
22:59 building without doors but they had no
23:01 roof on it and you had chambers kind of
23:05 like you ladies who have the boxes that
23:06 sort your jewelry right so imagine
23:08 taking that and building it up to the
23:10 size of a building putting it into the
23:12 ground and when the Pharaoh dies or some
23:14 dignitary dies you get you know your
23:17 bodies get put in different compartments
23:18 so you and your wife might get put in
23:20 one compartment your maids and
23:22 assistants go in different compartments
23:24 because they're murdered the day the
23:25 truth that you die and animals and
23:27 things favorite pets and stuff and stuff
23:29 that you need going in and they seal it
23:32 off at least that's what they told you
23:36 what those are it's it's plausible but
23:43 now since everyone's awaken in that
23:46 community or a lot of people have and
23:48 people who aren't invited to wake up
23:50 mind you they've gone over and re
23:53 researched everything they've looked at
23:58 the rocks and they've looked at the
24:00 structures they've looked at what
24:01 temples look like versus tombs versus
24:04 these random things called pyramids
24:06 which lack any any remote architectural
24:11 or I would say artistic or ceremonial
24:15 likeness to what they're claimed to be
24:19 you know they bring in these physicists
24:21 they bring in these electrical engineers
24:23 and they take a look at things and
24:24 they're like man this thing is not what
24:26 you think it is
24:27 you know it looks more indicative of
24:29 some source of power generation and then
24:33 you have your more existential people
24:34 that study it over time and they realize
24:36 that this device shaped like a pyramid
24:40 would create sort of a double helix
24:42 emission of of power coming off the
24:46 surface of the world or receiving
24:49 something from the world so the first
24:52 thing I want to do in the first 30
24:54 minutes is sort of illustrate some of
24:56 the frustration that you might share
24:58 with me and that these things are right
25:00 in front of your face and what's
25:02 interesting is when you see something
25:04 the more gnostic lee programs you are to
25:07 communicate with the universe you are
25:11 feeling the universe trying to solve
25:13 this problem right in front of your very
25:14 face and you're frustrated you're
25:19 frustrated that you can't just get it
25:22 you can feel it on you but you can't
25:25 quite put it into words yet the little
25:28 Lego pieces aren't connecting the puzzle
25:30 pieces aren't connecting right so
25:33 there's two halves to the equation there
25:36 is how did they put these things
25:39 together right but the more intriguing
25:42 question is why did they put these
25:44 things together and then there's the
25:48 really mysterious side effects of you
25:52 know why do you I did South American
25:56 people pay homage to folks with beards
26:00 when they didn't have any until the
26:02 Europeans came over and crossbred with
26:04 him it would seem that we have physical
26:07 proof that that someone traveled over
26:10 there and did something now for those of
26:12 you who are lanterns or loom Aryan folks
26:15 or Anunnaki folks or the archons or what
26:19 have you that's a very deep rabbit hole
26:22 to attach to this I'm going to let you
26:24 guys take it deeper until I do my own
26:26 episodes about these individuals and
26:29 these potentials because if I go down
26:31 those paths there's no evidence that
26:33 those folks existed besides the legend
26:35 and maybe you could point out these
26:37 characters that have been carved but I
26:40 would rather
26:41 deal with what we can see with their own
26:42 eyes what you could buy a plane ticket
26:45 tomorrow and go visit that's where I
26:48 want to keep this conversation because
26:51 if I start going too mystical you know I
26:52 channeled you know knowledge from Planet
26:55 X then this episode is over for a lot of
26:58 you in it and I'm not going down that
27:00 path we're going to stay onboard here
27:01 right so what kind of structures do we
27:05 have built over and over and over again
27:07 let's take a look at that real quick
27:09 well the two that I see the most okay
27:14 are your structures at which it looks
27:19 like man is supposed to be inside of how
27:22 do we define that well I would say the
27:27 temples of Egypt you know your
27:30 parthenons and your your structures in
27:34 in Greece now your Stonehenge is
27:37 different your Stonehenge doesn't look
27:38 like it was ever anything to be inside
27:40 of it looks like it borrows from the
27:42 technology that is used to build things
27:44 you're supposed to be inside of but it's
27:45 creating some sort of druid moon
27:48 calendar but again who knows when you
27:50 rebuild it from 1954 from scratch you
27:52 can infer all kinds of things into it
27:55 but there's pretty good evidence of the
27:56 pile that got these rocks from that it
27:58 was pretty much in that circular
28:01 formation and they did have the
28:03 wherewithal to at least build the 1954
28:05 copy using traditional rocks from that
28:08 era in and on a predestined circle right
28:13 so there was a circle on the ground that
28:15 looked like it may have hosted something
28:16 like this and so they weren't trying to
28:18 be totally disingenuous right I think
28:21 it's interesting that the Druids of
28:23 Europe have you know ceremoniously taken
28:27 over and try to usurp Stonehenge for
28:31 themselves the fact that the government
28:33 allowed this usurp ssin would really it
28:37 really calls out to the fact that
28:38 whoever actually you know put this thing
28:40 together in 54 did believe that the
28:43 Druids were the ones they held rituals
28:45 as soon as they finished it and again
28:47 the whole country of England were
28:51 invited to see this thing even though it
28:53 was on a military base being built
28:55 you know they didn't shut you off or
28:57 anything right but the two main
29:00 structures are you have again these
29:02 these rocks that are stacked up in
29:05 columns with cross beam rocks and then
29:09 from there you can build all you know
29:11 other cross Bream's and you can get
29:12 yourself a rooftop and you could line up
29:15 with vegetation if you want to try and
29:16 try and waterproof it but the other big
29:20 structure are pyramids and you know so
29:25 you look at pyramids and it's sort of
29:28 frustrating and it's sort of beautiful
29:30 all at the same time right where do we
29:33 have pyramids well we have them
29:34 everywhere depending on what you're
29:36 willing to acknowledge as a pyramid
29:38 now the more primitive stack rocked
29:40 pyramids obviously exist in in the pre
29:44 inca era they exist in obviously Egypt
29:50 they exist in China they exist all
29:55 throughout Africa so someone was
29:58 building these big monolithic structures
30:03 out of monolithic stones or megalithic
30:05 stones I should say and just using them
30:10 for different things right now what's
30:13 odd is if you look at the architectural
30:15 interior of say the Aztecs Mayans /
30:19 pre-inca or pre inca pyramids you have a
30:23 much different apparent use for the
30:27 pyramid with steps where human beings
30:29 were actually invited to proceed up the
30:31 face of this thing and have rituals at
30:33 the top burn fire at the top in Egypt
30:37 you have it capped off with a pear
30:39 Meridian stone of probably gold and you
30:43 have the varying levels of conductivity
30:44 in the materials so the outer tower
30:47 limestone was non-conductive the
30:48 interior limestone which is 96% of the
30:52 entire structure is very conductive and
30:55 then you have red granite which is
30:57 considered a liquid rock to electricians
30:59 forming the internal corridors of the
31:03 place right and it's all built to
31:04 express amazing phonics when you sing
31:07 inside the caverns of the grey
31:08 pyramid it harmonizes with you it's
31:11 amazing why are there pyramids all over
31:14 the world with seemingly different
31:16 functionality attached to them
31:19 and what could they have been are they
31:22 individual structures that are just
31:24 created per society for whatever kind of
31:27 spiritualistic ritual that is currently
31:31 in vogue in that particular part of
31:32 region of the world at that particular
31:34 level of evolution in mankind and then
31:38 how is this knowledge of how to build a
31:40 pyramid kind of spread all over the
31:42 world well I will tell you I will remind
31:46 you that most of you have played in the
31:48 sand in your lifetime or if nothing else
31:50 you've played in the dirt and it doesn't
31:53 take more than a child to realize that
31:56 when you dig up a bunch of dirt and you
31:58 move it to another location and you pick
32:00 it up with your hands and you drop it
32:01 down a pyramid creates itself and you
32:05 pat it down with your hands especially
32:06 when you hit the beach for the very
32:07 first time as a child you realize you
32:09 know moist sand you can turn into sand
32:11 castles but before you start creating
32:13 these amazing sculptures in the sand as
32:16 a teenager or someone in their 20s and
32:18 above you start creating pyramids
32:22 so the hint or the clue to build a
32:26 pyramid I think is in a fundamental
32:27 understanding of man now having said
32:32 that you know there are natural angles
32:35 of pyramids when you drop when you drop
32:38 dirt and you drop sand it's bizarre how
32:42 the angles of ascent and lean and slope
32:46 on the edge of these structures are very
32:48 similar whether or not you're doing it
32:49 in sand or dirt so it seems as if man
32:51 could have learned sort of a beautiful
32:54 natural curve to this process just from
32:57 playing around but again the pyramids
33:01 are really different aren't they I mean
33:04 one in China I don't know anything about
33:05 the one in China that is supposedly dug
33:08 underneath it and found the the soldiers
33:12 for the particular regime that was going
33:15 in those times and again you look at
33:18 those Chinese soldiers and you look at
33:20 their faces and you look at the geometry
33:22 and you look at how many they are there
33:23 are and the fact that they're all
33:25 different and you know the legend is is
33:27 that they are actually mocking real
33:29 soldiers that when you passed away
33:32 inside I don't know if it's the Ming
33:34 Dynasty or whatever but in one of the
33:35 dynasties when you passed away they made
33:37 a soldier in your likeness phenomenal
33:41 right now they've been a mummy movies
33:45 right
33:46 animated that's bad guys of course but
33:52 don't let me draw some theory on you and
33:56 this is not completely new I think maybe
33:59 the association's I'll make might be a
34:01 little new I saw recently a picture that
34:05 so someone supposedly had taken of a
34:08 young i believe it was a mock pyramid of
34:12 the Great Pyramid inside some laboratory
34:14 and they were running sound frequencies
34:17 through it and took a picture of it
34:19 again there's only in my knowledge to my
34:22 knowledge is only one photograph taken
34:23 by one guy so you know whatever but
34:27 exuding from the pyramid was a double
34:29 helix shape of energy / sound and they
34:33 taken this photograph of it now again
34:38 regardless of your belief of where we
34:39 are in the universe one thing is for
34:42 certain mass and energy spins right as
34:46 dictated by the spinning of the ether a
34:48 particle go see my episode on gravity to
34:50 fully understand what gravity is and
34:51 what we are so it seems to be a
34:56 commonality you know in order to make
34:58 life occur you have to move energy you
35:02 do regardless of what that is you have
35:04 to move it from point A to point B
35:06 otherwise you don't have life you have a
35:07 static world and so we know there's this
35:10 ecosystem of movement this current of
35:13 movement some infinite mobius strip of
35:16 of a path of all energy whether it be an
35:19 infinite loop some sphere turned inside
35:21 out or some infinite plane doesn't
35:23 really matter we can accept today that
35:25 things spin our own you know double
35:29 helix is a spinning
35:32 sort of vortex of energy and you know
35:37 the nucleic acids are invited into that
35:40 realm and when they all kind of coalesce
35:42 and bang into each other we get our
35:44 alpha code that is our DNA right but
35:50 there was a movie written by a NASA
35:52 scientist slash sci-fi writer arthur c
35:55 clarke you hear me reference it all the
35:56 time a 2001 a space odyssey our 2001 a
36:00 space odyssey and if you read his 2010
36:05 and 3001 books he reveals what the
36:09 monolith is over time it's a mystery for
36:12 the first two films and then if you read
36:13 the book it's sort of kind of a warrant
36:15 law ending to this thing and it seems
36:17 like an old guy trying to be technically
36:19 hip which is interesting but if we take
36:23 away our movie review of him what's
36:26 interesting about it is there is logic
36:29 and in his story flow which is the
36:33 following in 2001 a Space Odyssey you
36:36 how this black monolith shows up it's
36:39 transparent in the book but it shows up
36:41 the prehistoric apeman and of course
36:45 that's a big evolutionary quarter sort
36:47 of homage but hey evolution was so hit
36:51 back in those days right and this
36:54 monolith talks to the monkeys and I just
36:58 gave an example this in one of my last
36:59 episodes I will not go into this in
37:01 detail but the monolith teaches man
37:04 things and man starts to progress up and
37:08 then it disappears and it hides itself
37:11 on the moon and then it's discovered on
37:12 the moon and then it teleports itself
37:14 out to the you know the orbit of Jupiter
37:17 and it takes several years to get to it
37:20 which is what 2010 is all about right
37:24 going and visiting it but by 3001 the
37:30 monolith is redefined or further defined
37:33 as a computer that is there to transfer
37:37 messages to mankind until mankind what
37:41 to do and in a true Independence Day
37:44 slash average
37:46 computer hacking movie mankind sends a
37:49 virus up into the monolith and shuts it
37:51 off potentially crashing the operating
37:54 system of our controllers some alien
37:56 race someplace else in the universe
37:58 right now for those of you who are
38:02 heliocentric globe earth people that
38:05 believe in the aliens coming from
38:08 another world you're going to have a
38:10 connection to this for your reasons and
38:12 for those of you who believe in a flat
38:14 disc you will have an equal amount of
38:17 significance from where you're coming
38:20 from and that either the dome owners or
38:22 God Himself is potentially working to
38:25 this theory I'm going to throw at you
38:26 and I'm not trying to be you know
38:29 incredibly serious about this assertion
38:32 but it's just something that Gnostic lis
38:34 is kind of coming to me and I want to
38:36 share it it feels like a thread in the
38:38 sweater you know sometimes threads
38:40 aren't exactly the information you're
38:42 looking for they are merely the clue to
38:45 what you're looking for right but isn't
38:49 it interesting that everywhere that
38:52 pyramids exist there seems to be a
38:55 fairly advanced version of society who
38:58 also live there now the obvious thing
39:01 that you might think about as an
39:03 archaeologist anthropologist and
39:04 historian is that of course this is the
39:07 byproduct of eventually achieving
39:09 intelligence you have to have
39:11 intelligence before you build a pyramid
39:13 right but let's look at it from a common
39:17 denominator standpoint why do you know
39:21 incredibly intelligent civilized
39:24 sections of world history seem to get to
39:28 the pyramid stage you know if you look
39:31 in Cambodia it looks as if they went way
39:33 beyond the pyramid stage within seconds
39:36 they built temples that that accentuate
39:39 the solstices right they've got a temple
39:43 where they've got three temples one of
39:45 the centers slightly higher to smaller
39:46 ones and winter solstice the Sun comes
39:48 up over the the dome of one of the
39:51 buildings and
39:52 and uh in the other solstice comes on
39:57 the other building on the right amazing
39:59 now I think there's a bit of a novelty
40:01 and you know you have to build the place
40:05 where the person has to stand this is
40:07 where the Cambodians did it
40:08 they built you stand on this particular
40:10 stone and but you know this Solstice
40:13 thing winter and summer and the show up
40:14 in these particular spots we figured it
40:16 out now technically speaking you got
40:20 enough old guys standing around
40:23 potentially living a lot longer than we
40:25 live today and they just kind of say
40:27 well this rock was always here so it's
40:29 sort of like the rock where everyone
40:30 hangs out and so they track you know
40:33 where the Sun comes up because whatever
40:34 what else are they going to do right
40:35 they don't have to do a day job like we
40:37 do today so they're there looking and
40:40 looking and recording and recording and
40:42 then they finally figure out the
40:43 geometry of building something on the
40:45 ground almost a two two dimensional
40:47 plane projection on top of the surface
40:49 of the earth so I said if you build two
40:51 towers here boom boom you've got the
40:53 solstices locked in why not make one in
40:55 the center that we can save the
40:58 unification of the two right it must
41:01 have been interesting to build these
41:02 buildings and get all that accuracy down
41:04 but really have no communion with the
41:06 Sun in the end you're just sort of
41:08 paying homage to the Sun just in case it
41:11 is a living being that is paying
41:12 attention or perhaps you have a higher
41:14 being that watches over you right but
41:21 for those of you who have dabbled in the
41:22 notion that our DNA and a lot of our
41:26 hair follicles and that sort of thing
41:28 act as antenna and 10i to the universe
41:33 perhaps we're receiving messages perhaps
41:37 we're receiving programming from a
41:39 particular part of the universe whether
41:41 it be our Creator as in some omnipotent
41:45 omnipresent God or the next step down
41:48 which would be one of his creations that
41:50 would be an alien race with the
41:53 vocational ability to create us whether
41:56 be through gene splicing with hominids
41:58 which bones seemed suggest a DNA seems
42:01 to suggest
42:03 or just working with us while we're here
42:05 right
42:07 but what if pyramids first built small
42:11 then built bigger provide a sort of
42:16 wireless you know almost cell phone
42:20 tower experience for mankind when you
42:24 build them small you start getting more
42:26 epiphanies because that shape catches
42:29 information from the universe and
42:31 broadcasts it out because of its shape I
42:34 mean if you think about it if you take a
42:36 pyramid and you draw a perpendicular
42:37 line on every of all four sides of this
42:41 day and then you make a cone around that
42:46 perpendicular line it's a pretty good
42:49 little distribution hub of information
42:51 and perhaps like the monolith in arthur
42:55 c clarke story
42:56 it simply rebroadcasts perhaps perhaps
43:01 that nothing else just the thoughts of
43:03 man but perhaps it is taking information
43:07 from the universe and broadcasting it to
43:10 men there is a series of hieroglyphs of
43:13 Egypt which show a pyramid receiving a
43:18 sort of broadcast from space right to
43:20 the para meridian tip stone and then
43:23 there's a ricochet off of that into the
43:26 third eye of the Pharaohs and remember
43:31 you know I think that the Egyptians
43:32 really utterly and completely nailed
43:37 whatever is going on
43:39 they not only nailed it but they built
43:42 they tried to build it in stone in such
43:45 a way that we could benefit from it I
43:48 would say all save them writing passages
43:53 about it in hieroglyphs but we know that
43:55 the Christians went down there and the
43:58 Romans went down there and especially
43:59 the Christians though and they destroyed
44:03 a tremendous amount of Egypt especially
44:06 the release of you know the if you
44:10 listen to historians they'll tell you
44:12 was only only where leaders
44:15 were you know put an effigy in a rock so
44:20 they would get rid of say King Tut or
44:22 something off of a stone I'm sure that
44:24 occurred too but that doesn't really
44:27 threaten the Christian Church does it to
44:29 say that Caesar existed doesn't really
44:32 modify anyone's belief and say Jesus
44:34 Christ it doesn't do anything for you so
44:36 someone said oh you know they went down
44:38 there and knocked out a bunch of rocks
44:40 that said the leaders who existed back
44:42 in those days it doesn't make any sense
44:45 there's no motivation there but if it
44:48 does one of two things there's a reason
44:51 to destroy the information in Egypt one
44:56 they predate Christianity and the Old
44:59 Testament by tens of thousands of years
45:03 you know Graham Hancock came back with
45:05 photographs where we believe on a wall
45:09 we've got thirty five thousand years of
45:12 Pharaohs with symbols for year and month
45:15 and consequently for your flat earthers
45:20 it's a circle around a solid disc as a
45:23 year and a circle around an empty disk
45:25 is a month all right
45:28 suggesting the orbit of Earth around the
45:30 Sun is a year and the orbit of the moon
45:32 around the earth being darker is a month
45:37 sure feels like somebody is pretty
45:40 heliocentric in that model and they've
45:42 been out there and they've seen it or
45:44 whoever taught them what they did had
45:47 seen it but the second thing besides
45:50 just literal history going back further
45:53 than their fake story okay it is a
45:57 completely fake story okay is to get rid
46:01 of any methodology to find the truth
46:04 truth that had already been found and
46:07 the mechanism to harvest truth of the
46:09 universe say like a Gnostic like a like
46:13 a Nostradamus or someone right or a
46:18 philip k dick
46:21 for the Americas we have the Europeans
46:24 coming over and talking to again the
46:26 Incas talking to the Native Americans
46:29 and they all say that there were races
46:33 before them that built the things that
46:34 we see so South America is again packed
46:36 with this pre incan architecture made of
46:41 megalithic stones right and some are
46:45 smooth and sort of roundish where they
46:48 put these rocks together very precisely
46:51 had no motor maybe some again some
46:55 Keystone T joints in there supposedly
46:58 poured with metal which seems to boggle
47:01 the mind a little bit and then you have
47:05 that super precise Egyptian sort of cut
47:09 again Turkey has theirs I mean it's I'm
47:13 neglecting a lot of countries to have
47:15 these things in them I'll try to show
47:18 them in the photographs but the Native
47:21 Americans were the ones that said look
47:23 there were giant humans here before us
47:26 and they've only recently become extinct
47:29 and we'll show you where they're buried
47:32 now I'm gonna do a whole episode on
47:33 giant humans and we get all my research
47:36 together but supposedly you know written
47:39 in books that are published all right by
47:42 these official agencies not by
47:44 conspiracy theorists the Smithsonian
47:46 scientists or scientists associated with
47:49 the Smithsonian have validated and
47:51 verified that they found human beings
47:53 from you know skeletal remains of human
47:56 beings from seven feet to supposedly
47:58 over 20 feet there are documentaries on
48:04 YouTube where anthropologists go through
48:06 the old books and prove to you and hand
48:09 them out to the audience to say look
48:10 does this look real I didn't go and have
48:12 this published somewhere these pages
48:13 have gone through various acidic wear
48:17 and tear although they're not prepared
48:18 on the city city paper thank God but you
48:21 know people's hands and stuff great
48:23 patina on the pages take centuries to do
48:25 that and they prove it these skeletal
48:30 remains were picked up and removed to
48:32 erase his
48:34 three to secure history in the eyes of
48:38 the European banking / oligarchy rich
48:41 kids who want to say they invent
48:43 everything I mean just think about it
48:45 you take a whole world and you convince
48:49 them that you created everything that
48:50 the blue blooded white people created
48:53 everything that's amazing I mean you go
48:57 to Egypt today and you look around it's
48:58 a pretty primitive place I'm not saying
49:02 it's not fun to be there and fun to be
49:03 Egyptian but you think about it you have
49:07 all of the busts of Egypt extremely
49:11 African like black males black females
49:15 they rendered themselves again the
49:17 further back you go in the dynasty
49:19 obviously you're getting the more and
49:22 it's probably the very first time I'm
49:25 super duper happy that we're very
49:27 different
49:28 biologically on the outside because it
49:29 allows us to look at King Tut's bust and
49:31 say that is not an Arab okay that's a
49:35 black guy and they rendered themselves
49:38 really dark-skinned in the hybrid glyphs
49:41 when they had a chance to paint them and
49:42 we're talking about they have a hundred
49:45 thousand percent capability of rendering
49:47 exactly what they see some of the you
49:50 know the amazing facial structures of
49:54 old Pharaohs they are utterly perfect
49:57 you can cut the left side of the face
49:59 out Photoshop it over to match the right
50:02 side of the face and the geometry is
50:04 exactly the same and it's all based on
50:05 pie unbelievable mis machine precision
50:11 stuff and we don't really know how we
50:13 would make them today we got laser
50:16 printers but cutting cutting granite
50:19 with a computerized arm is something we
50:21 haven't built a device to do but they
50:23 did it back in those days and it's not
50:26 some guy looking at the left look at the
50:27 right take a little bit off there look
50:29 at their eye
50:29 no way unbelievably advanced stuff right
50:35 consequently the the more that the
50:37 hieroglyphs become closer and closer to
50:40 the ptolemy stage when Rome took over
50:42 Egypt the skin color gets a bit lighter
50:44 because they kept getting invaded and
50:46 kept getting crossbred and
50:48 leadership changed and the race
50:50 literally changed now someone asked me
50:54 the other day because I make this
50:55 assertion that the Egyptians were black
50:57 and what's really crazy as I could show
50:59 them the busts of you know as many
51:02 Pharaoh toons as they want and they're
51:05 all African black people and they look
51:09 straight at it and I know that they know
51:11 I'm not lying that I didn't make the
51:13 King Tut you know tune masks right of
51:17 gold and and ebony and all these other
51:19 beautiful quartz rocks and stuff but
51:23 they go okay I have a hard time
51:25 believing this because when I look at
51:27 Africa today and we look at all the
51:29 tribes and stuff and you know there's
51:30 definitely cities and things they seem
51:32 to be so primitive how could they
51:35 possibly have built the pyramids and I
51:38 said well that doesn't one doesn't
51:40 negate the other one is proof and one is
51:42 something you just need to figure out
51:44 but now think about it if you were in a
51:48 utopia if we were able to make any city
51:51 in the world a utopian city la New York
51:55 and you're able to exist like that for
51:58 say a hundred years let's say a thousand
52:01 years where would your military go would
52:04 you really create a military all right
52:07 that's why all this socialistic you know
52:09 UN [ __ ] and EU [ __ ] about you
52:12 know they really are luring us to or
52:15 trying to lure us to a sort of utopian
52:19 future but they want to create a world
52:22 army I think that armies disappear once
52:26 you reach these beautiful realms where
52:29 generation after generation are born and
52:31 no one perceives war because you're
52:35 intelligent and you understand the
52:39 ramifications of war the lack of benefit
52:42 of war the sad nature of war and so you
52:49 stop and so we have these cultures that
52:53 could be wiped out in a day as long as
52:55 there's a barbaric culture somewhere
52:57 that is still living off the old the old
53:00 DNA
53:01 so it may be that these cultures have a
53:04 couple different storylines the Egyptian
53:08 pharaohs that set up Egypt again
53:10 probably as far back as say 40,000 BC we
53:15 need to touch on Ice Age theory for one
53:16 second too but they either did one of
53:19 two things
53:21 they were either genetically wiped out
53:24 even though we have Africans the still
53:26 exists in Africa that seem to be very
53:28 similar in design and you know for those
53:32 of you who you know look at folks from
53:35 Africa and you can immediately tell the
53:37 different types of genetic tribes and
53:38 you can see the shape of their skull and
53:40 what-have-you
53:40 that does seem to be this similarity
53:44 among the pharaohs of course they're
53:46 very inbred very ancestral people argue
53:49 with me about this and and you know I
53:52 studied this intensely for six years
53:54 I mean od'd on this all year around for
53:58 six years straight and it could be it
54:02 could be ancestral claims might be
54:04 something the white man did to the
54:06 history of the Pharaohs but we believe
54:09 that the hieroglyphs of the Pharaohs
54:11 names and car to she's absolutely
54:14 conclude that that an offspring of one
54:18 you know Pharaoh marry the off same
54:20 offspring of the same Pharaoh and they
54:22 became the new dynasty they're supposed
54:24 to hand it down you weren't supposed to
54:26 crossbreed with anyone because you want
54:28 to lose the genetic intelligence that
54:29 you managed to manifest by not being
54:32 oppressed right you know it was the
54:35 kings and queens of Europe that were
54:38 really big into crossing over kingdoms
54:41 right so you know if one person had land
54:45 and one person had food they'd be great
54:49 if they got together especially at their
54:50 border border communities and then the
54:53 country got bigger and bigger and bigger
54:54 and they just started going underneath
54:56 family names but Egypt was Egypt north
55:00 and south united supposedly by their
55:04 fictitious characters menís gave me nes
55:06 I mean maybe that farrell existed and
55:09 you know he was the one that got
55:11 everyone to behave
55:13 but maybe they just did the unthinkable
55:17 maybe they left
55:20 maybe that particular tribe simply said
55:23 we have done what we need to do man is
55:25 well on their way we have given them the
55:29 mathematical knowledge that they need
55:30 and here it goes
55:32 boom straight into Greece the Greeks did
55:36 a beautiful job taking the Egyptian
55:39 architecture moving it to the next level
55:41 now of course that latter suggestion
55:44 would suggest that they were way beyond
55:46 the intelligence that we think we see in
55:48 many of the structures right again I've
55:51 said it before one of the things I
55:53 learned about Egyptian architecture and
55:54 architecture in general throughout
55:56 history of mankind is when you build a
55:58 temple any type of structure that man is
56:00 supposed to be inside of the the
56:04 distance between the columns suggests
56:06 and pretty much records in history the
56:10 level of advancement of that particular
56:12 culture okay so you have pretty close
56:17 columns I mean again they're really far
56:19 our Parkers are really massive in Egypt
56:21 once you get to the Parthenon a lot of
56:23 Greek architecture the columns moved
56:24 apart quite a bit and the architectural
56:27 techniques were very similar
56:29 all right you stack a bunch of rocks up
56:31 and keep cutting them into these
56:32 cylindrical shapes and so it's a bunch
56:34 of sort of doughnuts on top of each
56:36 other to create these columns it's not
56:37 like they cut them out of the ground
56:38 like obelisks all right but there's two
56:42 ways to leave earth right there is of
56:44 your own mechanical ability where you
56:47 actually develop science that can get
56:49 you off the planet which is probably not
56:51 likely with what we saw left behind and
56:54 then there's someone coming to get you
56:56 and pulling you out of the mix for those
56:59 of you who believe in a flat disk it
57:01 could be the dome owners for those of
57:03 you believe in aliens it could just be
57:04 the aliens or no one left
57:07 they simply bestowed on two men through
57:10 pyramid structures of transmitting data
57:13 very much like a monolith to men what
57:16 they needed to know and then it just
57:18 once they got us all kind of programmed
57:19 up they said okay now it's time just to
57:23 watch the experiment go we've juiced it
57:25 up
57:26 but let's look at Ice Age theory the
57:30 scientific evidence for Ice Ages has to
57:34 do with what we believe to be glacier
57:36 movements on earth right or as the
57:39 Britons call it glassy as they believe
57:44 that they have been able to photograph
57:45 you know the growth and shrinking of
57:48 glaciers
57:48 don't ask Al Gore about this and they
57:52 believe that a lot of the corrosive
57:54 nature of the surface of the earth is
57:56 made by glaciers for instance they try
57:59 to tell you that a glacier dug out the
58:01 Grand Canyon all right well I'm going to
58:04 tell you right now unequivocally no
58:06 glacier created the Grand Canyon what
58:09 created the Grand Canyon is what we call
58:11 expanding earth when the crust expands
58:15 which it does currently about 19
58:16 centimeters a year it rips apart the
58:19 surface of the earth what's fascinating
58:22 about geology okay is that to become a
58:27 geologist and I do apologize to those of
58:30 you who are geologists you know you may
58:33 be one of the more creative ones if
58:34 you're listening to the show like this
58:36 but it's a pretty dry science you know
58:39 you
58:41 it's so exciting when you go down to
58:43 Grand Canyon you're looking for various
58:44 looking at the various sedimentary
58:46 layers and you're pulling out rocks that
58:48 have been stuck in there for you know
58:49 billions of years it can be it can be
58:52 very exciting to be one of those folks
58:57 but you are typically kind of a very
59:00 academic person and you're really likely
59:02 to be a person not to thank very much
59:04 for yourself and fossil fuel designation
59:08 of crude oil is one of the key points of
59:10 evidence that geologists don't think
59:12 that much because again we find oil 8
59:15 miles down on the ground when all life
59:18 and fossil history stops at 16,000 feet
59:21 which is just three miles down roughly
59:24 right I had someone tell me the other
59:28 day that they believe that the reason
59:30 why you can find oil really deep is that
59:32 the you know the surface of the earth
59:35 everyone's wall goes underneath another
59:36 sliding plate which again is Pangaea
59:39 drift which is complete
59:40 [ __ ] and that's why all those down
59:42 there really deep and I said well then
59:44 you would carry the fossil record also
59:46 very deep which has never been
59:47 discovered beyond 16,000 feet roughly so
59:51 their theory just completely blows up in
59:52 their face but let me ask you this
59:56 question
59:56 I can almost make an episode about this
59:58 but I can't lament that far why do you
60:01 think mountains exist right why do you
60:05 think that they exist if you listen to
60:08 Pangaea drift horseshit it'll they'll
60:10 tell you oh well it's you know these
60:12 plates slamming against each other and
60:13 then they I kind of do this big you know
60:15 collision and they make a mount to mount
60:18 Mount Everest is nothing more than a
60:20 giant plate collision I'm going to
60:23 suggest it's not OK I'm going to suggest
60:27 you're expanding earth that all you're
60:29 seeing are the remnants of the old
60:31 surface I've said this in previous
60:33 episodes if you look at south west
60:37 Arizona along the 10 highway 10 you see
60:41 these plateaus you see these rocks that
60:42 goes straight up you always see them in
60:44 old westerns it's in West world it's in
60:46 the Lone Ranger remake they go way up
60:48 and they make a plateau what you're
60:51 looking at is the old surface of the
60:52 earth and as it expanded it created
60:55 these huge gaps for the soils you know
60:58 went down with a new larger
61:00 circumference of the earth in some cases
61:04 you have the Black Sea rips apart what
61:07 if the Black Sea was empty what would
61:08 you call it you would call it the Grand
61:10 Canyon all the bumps on the other side
61:13 matched bumps on this side it was ripped
61:15 apart by expanding earth right I
61:18 mentioned this digression for one reason
61:20 to go back to something I have threaded
61:23 through a lot of episodes and went into
61:25 great detail in the gravity episode but
61:28 when we study some of the sort of oral
61:31 history especially of South America they
61:34 talk about the magic earth they talk
61:36 about how these stones are moved into
61:38 place these giant megalithic stones and
61:41 they talk about methodology of human
61:44 labor and the magic force of earth the
61:48 magic earth is how it's referenced in
61:50 several the translations I'm sure it's a
61:52 different word
61:53 technically speaking but it seems to
61:56 correlate with the stages of the Earth's
61:59 bowels to assist in the creation of
62:02 these big structures now imagine again
62:08 the Tesla the man that actually invented
62:10 something other than the [ __ ] hack
62:12 I'm Stein who invented nothing besides
62:15 [ __ ] mathematical theories which you
62:17 have to jump into the mathematical
62:19 paradigm to gain any insight into what
62:22 he was saying it's an interesting
62:23 exercise of mental thinking but very
62:27 useless for us today but if the world
62:32 had an electric core and if the supply
62:37 of dielectric waves gives something
62:40 either it's gravity or not gravity works
62:45 on a flag disk works on a round globe
62:46 don't worry about it but the surface of
62:50 the earth would exude this electricity
62:52 or partial electricity right you have
62:56 magnetism and dielectric power come
62:57 together to create electromagnetism we
63:00 dig electromagnetism and experiments
63:02 because that allows us to move ether
63:04 allows us to move things in gravity
63:05 right the Hutchison effect right it's
63:10 all the same [ __ ] people people like oh
63:11 my god have you seen the Hutchins
63:12 anything like yeah there's pure proof of
63:15 how ether winds work when you see this
63:19 they do this little experiment where
63:21 they have a fairly large lead column
63:24 that under certain electromagnetic
63:26 stimulation twirls itself and just
63:29 basically turns itself in a twisty bread
63:32 because that's the wave of ether varying
63:36 its dielectric supply which creates
63:38 either an implosion or an explosion of
63:40 gravity right video it's imploding in
63:44 the vector of ether albeit a very macro
63:49 form of it right what if the world is
63:52 exuding this energy on a massive level
63:55 and every rock if pushed on a particular
63:58 Meridian right and you can just test it
64:01 by taking a smaller rock let's say you
64:02 take a 10-pound rock and you just walk
64:05 around with it
64:07 and these builders from the past hold in
64:10 a particular area in Obon else and it
64:12 weighs an ounce okay put a little marker
64:15 in the ground they say this is where the
64:17 brainian is coming out today could be
64:19 moved tomorrow maybe they even knew that
64:21 the currents of it moved
64:22 maybe they chase the currents of the
64:24 meridian lines all around the world
64:27 because again if man has been around for
64:30 intelligently I would say for 100 mm -
64:33 to hunt 200 thousand years bc but erased
64:38 by modern bankers and you know [ __ ]
64:41 artists we would not believe that that
64:44 would be possible but if we were to
64:46 exist let's just say let's just do it as
64:48 an example a hundred thousand BC we were
64:51 really intelligent mechanically
64:54 intelligent then the reason why bearded
64:57 men showed up in the Americas was
64:59 perhaps they were chasing it from the
65:01 European communities maybe chasing it
65:03 from some of these islands that tend to
65:04 disappear you know when the earth
65:07 expands the ocean can start taking over
65:10 more land masses and so you don't
65:13 necessarily have to have a cataclysmic
65:15 thing to get rid of Atlantia lumeria you
65:18 just have the water level goes up off
65:20 the coast of Japan all these places in
65:23 the world you have these hidden cities
65:25 underwater and sometimes only 50 feet
65:28 down sometimes they're 100 feet down
65:31 well they were on the surface at one
65:33 point obviously right no one's willing
65:37 to explain that Pangea drift does
65:40 nothing to explain that okay expanding
65:42 earth completely explains that but isn't
65:47 it interesting every time you study
65:48 these megalithic structures they
65:52 typically have abandoned building
65:54 practices one of the biggest megalithic
65:58 stones in the world was just abandoned
66:00 in the digging quarry
66:02 they had shaped it they had moved it out
66:04 of the quarry a little bit and it's on a
66:07 slant and it just sat there Egyptians
66:10 have ma obelisks everywhere that are
66:12 still in transients still in the
66:15 quarries
66:15 it's as if someone just picked up and
66:17 took off
66:20 well that's how the historians love to
66:23 tell the story
66:23 well the Incas didn't build this stuff
66:26 otherwise they would have continued the
66:27 process so previous civilizations of the
66:30 Incas put together a lot of those those
66:33 digs down there in South America right
66:35 and they like to say that people just
66:37 picked up and left a lot of the
66:40 assertions are they would run out of
66:41 food they would over harvest their food
66:44 and that seems pretty pretty ridiculous
66:47 for cultures that were smart enough to
66:49 build greeneries and all kinds of other
66:51 stuff it doesn't make any sense with
66:53 their discovered artifacts they're not
66:56 that stupid maybe they were trying to
67:00 chase the meridian and they ended up in
67:02 a different area of the world but if the
67:06 world keeps going to these metabolic all
67:08 sort of electrical cycles and perhaps
67:12 it's dictated by the Sun you know if we
67:16 have an electrical core as Tesla proved
67:18 in Colorado if the Sun goes through some
67:21 sort of burping phase and really ejects
67:23 a lot of the prime components either
67:27 dielectric waves or magnetism waves or
67:29 fully metabolized electromagnetic waves
67:32 and they get to earth and they pass
67:34 through the crust because they can and
67:37 then earth has an abundance of this
67:38 energy and starts to exude it out of its
67:40 crust and when that occurs stones
67:43 specifically porous stone and its
67:47 geological makeup hangs on to the
67:49 electromagnetic waves coming out of
67:52 Earth or dielectric waves and things
67:56 become weightless or they simply don't
68:00 weigh as much and so all this stuff can
68:02 be created by little men walking around
68:04 right now it doesn't what it's left out
68:08 there to be explained is again all the
68:09 craftsmanship of these rocks and again
68:11 if you buy a book just look up a book
68:14 thirty-nine thousand BC it does a inside
68:19 the book is pretty much your
68:20 photographic proof that the Egyptians
68:22 has circular saws they had all kinds of
68:24 modern equipment and it's not found in
68:27 necessarily all of the structures it is
68:30 there but it's a little harder to find
68:31 because everything's refined in the end
68:33 but you have all these little stones
68:35 hanging around the temples hanging
68:37 around the pyramids that are just kind
68:39 of fodder sort of the excess rock that
68:42 was cut off and they've magnified
68:45 photographs and they've proven that
68:47 there were circular saws because the
68:50 path of the cut is circular but
68:52 consistent they have board holes that
68:54 are perfectly round cut out a rock it's
68:59 beautiful it's proof something was
69:02 different than what your pasty-white
69:04 historians would tell you but let's
69:08 let's hone back on perhaps alien
69:13 participation because there's a lot of I
69:15 think fairly nonsensical conclusions
69:18 that are very popular in sort of your
69:21 more frenzied archeologists
69:25 anthropologists and ain't no I I salute
69:28 them a hundred percent and postulating
69:30 this because without postulation we
69:33 don't have any we don't often consider
69:36 something to be true or false without
69:38 someone asserting that it might be true
69:39 or false right but any time they see a
69:43 giant field they'll call it a potential
69:47 runway okay when I was a kid the Giza
69:50 Plateau which is a massive massive
69:52 structure that the pyramids are built on
69:53 top of which again in my research they
69:56 said it's taller than the Great Pyramid
69:58 the great pyramids 455 feet tall so the
70:01 Giza Plateau is you know 460 to 500 feet
70:04 tall down inside the earth right
70:06 structurally it makes complete sense
70:07 because when we piledrive for buildings
70:10 here in california sort of the wetlands
70:13 area they pile drive it exactly the
70:16 height of the building into the ground
70:18 to make sure it doesn't fall over during
70:20 an earthquake right but the funny thing
70:23 is is that these assertions were
70:25 developed in back in a time when man had
70:28 to land airplanes with wheels on it
70:31 you had a forward velocity that then
70:33 loses altitude the tires touch and we go
70:36 for a little ways until we can bring the
70:38 vehicle to a stop and then we stop it
70:39 and so everything became runways right
70:43 now with
70:45 you know decent science-fiction for the
70:46 last 40 years we now portray these
70:49 spaceships any type of UFO as being
70:52 completely capable of landing you know I
70:54 miss quoted the same movie twice and a
70:58 couple episodes back nineteen fifty one
71:00 was The Day the Earth Stood Still not
71:02 Forbidden Planet I said Forbidden Planet
71:04 twice unfortunately so The Day the Earth
71:06 Stood Still which is a byproduct of
71:09 probably gosh 50 years before that with
71:12 HG Wells you know flying saucer lands in
71:16 the middle of a baseball field rushing
71:17 to DC just land straight down there's no
71:20 runway so our thinking as human beings
71:23 advance to a point where we no longer
71:24 think of everything being runways okay
71:26 for those of you about aircraft carriers
71:28 you could say well it's not really a
71:30 one-way it's an area where a bunch of
71:32 ships would land and get out and do
71:33 their thing the big the big no-go path
71:39 for my brain meaning the big sort of
71:42 contradictory path of aliens
71:44 participating directly in the
71:46 construction of these locations is that
71:49 I would think that if we as mankind were
71:52 to travel to another planet I'm not sure
71:56 we would you know grab indigenous stones
71:58 and move them all over their planet's
71:59 surface to create sort of structures we
72:01 can get inside of I don't know that we
72:03 wouldn't bring our own structures with
72:06 us you know there's been all these
72:07 fabled trips to the moon that they're
72:09 going to plan and you know the Japanese
72:11 been doing planning for 40 years at
72:13 least you know building structures out
72:15 of the dust but building very
72:17 intelligent you know man-made hexagons
72:19 that can be used to you know combine to
72:22 make structures right many of you've
72:25 seen an episode of Star Trek when they
72:27 any one of the series when they land on
72:29 a planet they usually at least Voyager
72:32 and beyond they brought their own
72:34 equipment they brought their own little
72:36 campers and and you know double-wide
72:39 mobile homes and stuff and they were
72:40 able to stay down there's one Berta Cote
72:42 and Captain Janeway are stuck together
72:45 due to some virus that they have and you
72:49 know they brought their own stuff so you
72:52 know the idea that every every alien
72:55 installation would have been discovered
72:57 and
72:58 and captured by man I guess it's
73:00 technically possible but there's no
73:04 fable of such a thing right they kept
73:06 everyone's mouth shut forever seems
73:08 pretty hard to believe that means
73:11 impossible but it's just you know we
73:13 have to think it further if we're going
73:14 to postulate that aliens landed here
73:18 right
73:18 was the movie Stargate that a pretty
73:21 pretty funny twist that the pyramids
73:23 were merely sort of landing pads for
73:26 gigantic spaceships right it's very
73:30 beautiful assertion but the idea that
73:33 that you would build a craft that could
73:35 only land on a pyramid it seems pretty
73:37 ridiculous right we kind of build a
73:39 pyramid why well we got to land oh yeah
73:41 that's right we can't land just by
73:42 ourselves
73:44 right still it was a fun story but what
73:49 do we have to gain by figuring out all
73:51 this stuff I think one for those of us
73:56 who understand that history is being
73:57 revised on a unbelievable level by those
74:01 who we wouldn't want to be ruled by
74:05 there's a defense mechanism that kicks
74:07 into place to say no no no you guys
74:09 don't get to tell history anymore you've
74:11 had your your network television for the
74:13 last 80 years and we are we're bringing
74:16 this to a close normal human beings with
74:20 minds that are open that can think with
74:23 the skillsets to make connections they
74:25 have multiple disciplines not just one
74:26 discipline or if they have only one
74:29 discipline they're smart enough to bring
74:30 the other people with them that might
74:32 have correlating pieces of science with
74:34 them we're going back out there
74:37 researching everything now when that
74:40 occurs I'll just throw this out there
74:42 and make sure we all understand we don't
74:44 need to jump up their butts if we think
74:45 that they're wrong let's give them some
74:47 credit for finding the money to get
74:49 funded to go out and do this research at
74:51 all it's very important research because
74:55 they're sort of doing a two-fold
74:57 contribution to mankind in our
74:59 prehistoric history one their undoing
75:02 the shitty history that we've been told
75:04 so that's the very first thing that they
75:06 can do the next thing they're trying to
75:08 do is they're trying to try to assert
75:10 what might have occurred
75:12 by using logic and science right more
75:15 like Tesla science and not like Einstein
75:17 science right so really tangible
75:19 sciences that the yield invention and
75:22 proof I will do an episode on Einstein
75:26 where we utterly shred this guy I'm
75:29 still just collecting there's so much
75:31 evidence against Einstein being who he
75:33 was that it's going to take me probably
75:36 a week just to make my notes and figure
75:40 out how to approach this the guy's a
75:42 complete [ __ ] fraud
75:44 unbelievable plagiarist wife-beater etc
75:48 etc he is Peter Sellers and being there
75:52 but we want to know who we are right and
75:56 we believe I think quite accurately the
75:59 further back we can go and find out what
76:01 we what we accomplished where we came
76:03 from whether it be evolution or creation
76:05 or intelligent design or all the above
76:08 it will bring solace to some of us to
76:13 know who we are is that all saying you
76:17 don't know where you're going if you
76:18 don't know where you've been huge amount
76:21 of truth to that which is why I do
76:24 believe that the folks there's several
76:26 folks at NASA that have been you know
76:28 briefed on the fact that we haven't gone
76:29 to Mars we haven't gone to the moon we
76:32 barely can you know get space travel
76:35 worked out and low orbit but someone
76:38 tells them that story hey look if these
76:40 kids believe that that's what we're
76:41 doing our culture / America being the
76:45 the head of the snake for NASA more kids
76:50 jumping to science and eventually we
76:52 will get there eventually we'll find out
76:53 but if we don't energize through fiction
76:57 it won't happen now I don't personally
76:58 subscribe to that at all I think that
77:01 the 10x version of that formula is to
77:04 tell kids that we didn't go to the moon
77:05 and say wouldn't you like to go why
77:08 don't you be the first to go why don't
77:09 you figure out the science to get there
77:12 and everything that you create has to be
77:15 published you don't have hidden f1
77:18 booster rockets that couldn't possibly
77:19 have gotten us to the moon you don't
77:21 have a bunch of [ __ ] you know a
77:25 ignoring of science that might prevent
77:28 us from traveling space due to just
77:30 electromagnetic radiation and on that
77:34 note if you think about it you do have
77:38 Africans that if they are related to the
77:40 furrows they don't believe so an African
77:46 kid waking up in some tribe if you were
77:47 to take them on a little field trip and
77:50 shown the pyramids and say you know what
77:51 your DNA your people made that and all
77:55 that knowledge has been lost out of your
77:57 people so why don't you get some books
78:00 opened up some nice mathematical books
78:02 that teach you about PI and structural
78:04 sciences and why don't you see if you've
78:06 got that recessive gene tuck way back
78:08 inside your DNA that can activate why
78:11 don't you see if you can't figure this
78:13 all out again and will organically look
78:17 at how you did it if you're able to do
78:19 in the next five hundred years and/or
78:22 maybe 50 years because we have so much
78:25 you know science now and computers to an
78:28 engineering software to speed up the
78:30 process maybe we'll find out more about
78:33 ourselves simply by trying to create
78:34 this stuff from scratch same goes for
78:37 South America right go up to an Inca
78:40 they don't really none of this is really
78:43 lost on them but to say look perhaps
78:46 your DNA is the group of people that
78:50 built this for perhaps not but you have
78:54 daily access to all the stuff that they
78:56 did do get into it and stop letting
79:00 people tell you what is true before you
79:02 start luckily they're brilliant people
79:05 out there trying to figure this stuff
79:06 out I think we need to help them by
79:10 opening our own minds and taking another
79:13 look most people are interested in this
79:16 kind of stuff but it's sort of this it's
79:19 a difficult thing to study let's put
79:20 that way because you'll go into the
79:22 sciences of it all and you will be
79:24 bombarded by official science quote
79:26 unquote that really is built to close
79:28 your mind and it's built to close your
79:31 mind in a very simple way just like the
79:32 moon missions and all this other stuff
79:33 if they say they figured it out you
79:36 don't have any curiosity
79:38 curiosity is by far the most
79:40 inexhaustible force and human
79:41 consciousness when you think you can't
79:46 solve something my god man just
79:48 continues going and going and going
79:50 right it's an old 1991 episode of Star
79:53 Trek generations where they bump into
79:56 what they think is a black hole they all
79:58 pass out for what they believe is 30
80:00 seconds and later you find out that they
80:02 had actually discovered a planet that
80:04 didn't want to be discovered and so they
80:06 faked a black hole and they do this
80:08 little memory wipe on the the crew but
80:13 they unfortunately didn't cover all the
80:14 bases in the first attempt and so
80:16 everyone started looking around going
80:18 well this couldn't happen his hands been
80:20 broken mended and these plants grew a
80:23 whole day when they were always supposed
80:24 to be out thirty seconds and so they
80:25 kept digging and digging until they went
80:27 back to the location and found the class
80:29 one hour class and planet it was trying
80:32 to be hidden and they nearly got killed
80:35 because they made a mistake they left
80:39 curiosity behind and Picard has a great
80:42 monologue about the power of curiosity
80:45 for man something we need to remember so
80:49 for any of you who are digging this
80:51 episode and you know like yeah you know
80:55 I am interested in that but I haven't
80:56 gone back and taking a look I will tell
80:58 you that the amount of videos coming out
81:00 today on YouTube which are presentations
81:03 by scientists who have an open mind and
81:06 have rejected all of the official
81:08 history of the world they're really on a
81:11 roll right now it's it's an exploding
81:13 trend on YouTube for those of you who
81:15 are into that sort of thing and of
81:16 course if you view YouTube the last
81:19 thing you ever want to do is look at
81:20 trending videos and what's popular
81:22 because it's all mega and doctrine ation
81:26 mega indoctrination I think you feel me
81:31 deep thoughts radio calm for all the
81:33 fees there's video if you're an audio
81:35 audio if you're on video for videos your
81:36 choices are YouTube calm and vid dot me
81:40 as I always say vid that me has the most
81:42 pristine version of season 1 because I
81:45 was using rock and roll songs my whole
81:48 music library someone asked me what
81:49 music I like and the answer is go watch
81:51 fit me season 1 and all that intro music
81:55 is the kind of stuff is sitting on my
81:56 computer very diverse for audio you've
82:00 got iTunes Google Play or you just take
82:02 your mobile phone and go to deep
82:03 thoughts radio com click on the lower
82:05 right icon which is the RSS feed and it
82:08 will find whatever podcast reader you
82:10 have on your phone if you visit on your
82:12 home computer it will barf out a really
82:14 ugly page so don't worry about that
82:15 don't do that let's get out there and
82:18 rediscover who the hell we are
82:19 right doesn't it sound fun you can do it
82:23 at your own leisure anyway take care of
82:26 yourself on someone else and I will see
82:27 you in the next deep thoughts Oh
82:30 [Music]
