00:00 [Music]
00:31 today is gonna be one of those episodes
00:33 where we let life imitate art a bit what
00:40 do I mean by that well I just recently
00:43 read digested Westworld
00:46 there's gonna be a couple episodes
00:47 they're gonna be back-to-back where that
00:50 show is gonna be mentioned if you
00:54 haven't seen Westworld from HBO you'll
00:59 need to I will not attempt to spoil
01:03 anything for you by you ingesting this
01:06 particular show but it would definitely
01:09 benefit the show if I was able to talk
01:12 about the last scene at the beginning of
01:14 this episode so as a compromise here's
01:17 what I'm gonna do at the end of the show
01:21 I'm going to conclude with a spoiler
01:24 alert and then you guys who don't want
01:27 to hear about it can dial out it I'm not
01:30 sure how much it will remove from you
01:35 I'm gonna guess it might remove a lot
01:38 from from those of you who get really
01:40 deep into the cerebral side of things
01:43 but we're gonna go through the true
01:46 epiphany moment at the end that way you
01:48 can get through this conversation but
01:50 this conversations about the intangible
01:52 mind now I'm not trying to sound smart
01:57 or something by coming up with sort of
01:59 an esoteric title not that it's very
02:02 esoteric but you know what I mean some
02:07 pseudo intellectual stroll you know
02:11 throw through the mind here there's a
02:15 bit of a shadow on me here so if you see
02:16 my hand kind of come in and out of the
02:18 thing that's the camera shining on me
02:21 maybe I'll move it alright perhaps
02:26 that's a better angle here's what sort
02:29 of here's the non-spoiler part of it
02:33 that
02:35 really got me going and this happens to
02:39 all of us quite often and it's just one
02:43 of those freaking moments where we we
02:49 struggled
02:51 what is it decart didn't he say I think
02:53 therefore I am
02:55 lots of philosophers over the millennia
02:59 have struggled with that concept in the
03:04 movie altered states which came out 1981
03:08 the lead character played by William
03:11 Hurt was on a journey he believed within
03:15 the bowels of all genetics within the
03:18 bowels of all atomic matter which would
03:22 be I guess the original fairy cake of
03:25 the ether winds as maybe Douglas Adams
03:29 would describe it one should be able to
03:32 reverse-engineer all the trajectories
03:33 back to the beginning and thus if you
03:37 were made of one he threw a particle
03:39 then you're made of all you throw
03:41 particles because they all participate
03:43 in their trajectories he was at the
03:46 Heisenberg uncertainty principle I think
03:51 therefore I am is a brilliant way of
03:53 resolving the most incredible paradox
03:57 enigma Pandora's Box shrouding hers cat
04:03 issue chicken and egg problems for the
04:09 mind I'm always trying to take a species
04:12 of thought and parse it such that it
04:16 gets down to its absolute fundamental
04:19 inception moment such that we do have
04:22 the ability to resolve whether it was a
04:24 chicken first or an egg first now in
04:28 literal terms all that stuff the chicken
04:32 and the egg it developed over time go
04:35 see my evolution episode where I talk
04:37 about the physics of a localized gravity
04:40 womb to ensure the symmetrical balance
04:44 of all ether wings creating the first
04:47 budding
04:49 strings of life strings of cells but
04:52 this is gonna be about the intangible
04:54 mind not the tangible chicken the movie
04:59 altered states is a very strange movie
05:01 and I think I mentioned it several times
05:03 here and there but the main character is
05:10 you know to repeat myself taking
05:12 ayahuasca type drugs and then
05:16 deliberately trying to regress his mind
05:20 back to the inception point of the
05:21 universe and see what's there at face
05:25 value if you can really conceive of that
05:27 concept the guts that guy would have to
05:30 do that
05:31 it's almost skits it's like insane
05:36 because you're talking about messing
05:38 around with the the junction box where
05:42 all the electricity comes into your
05:43 neighborhood you know you see those big
05:45 boxes every once in a while I just saw
05:47 this crazy video of a like Indian kid
05:51 patching in some some metal to try and
05:54 steal electricity and he's just dealing
05:57 with so much amperage that he could you
06:00 know if he grounded it across his chest
06:03 across his body he just vaporized in a
06:04 second he'd be dead instantaneously at
06:06 the speed of light he'd be dead but at
06:11 the end of the movie and this is sort of
06:14 a a tepid spoiler alert but that's
06:17 movies made 1981 so if you haven't seen
06:20 it yeah you know this won't ruin
06:23 anything for you
06:24 he gets his wish and it and even it is
06:29 massive intellectual capacity he is was
06:33 utterly horrified and so glad to be back
06:35 in this world and you'll see how that
06:39 happens extremely famous scene MTV
06:42 parodied it for its logo once you
06:46 actually some people have seen the
06:47 parody in MTV with the MTV logo for
06:51 those of you don't remember MTV used to
06:52 have a lot of parodies for the logos I
06:55 mean just in taking things and putting
06:58 them everywhere and they impersonate
06:59 characters and all someone might be
07:01 spongebob
07:02 Squarepants one day and the other ones
07:03 like a pizza of the next day and they
07:06 the omage altered states which shows
07:11 somebody had a brilliant mind because
07:14 that film is utter utterly a one of a
07:17 kind Jim for the mind but remember and
07:25 this is this is like a light piece of
07:27 information from West world when the
07:29 hosts slash what we would call outside a
07:32 West world and Android sees something
07:35 that they're not supposed to see here's
07:38 something they're not supposed to hear
07:40 it falls on deaf ears and they simply
07:44 say well it doesn't look like anything
07:45 to me they can't see it and so you think
07:49 oh well that's wow isn't that amazing I
07:51 can see that I can hear that but they
07:53 can't ok human mm-hmm what are you what
08:02 are you we can since you know once your
08:07 IQ hits a certain stage which you know
08:10 intellectual intelligence is true
08:13 intelligence it's thinking it's deducing
08:16 it's connecting there's a lot of
08:18 scientists out there that can memorize
08:20 and repeat stuff and so they feel like
08:22 they're super smart people who don't
08:25 know what they know tell them that
08:27 they're super smart but in terms of
08:31 being intelligent and really figuring
08:33 out this tangible quality of true
08:35 deduction of what we are to solve
08:37 mysteries that are that are infinite
08:39 vast and complex and yet simple this is
08:46 where the conversation is routinely
08:49 stalled i sat with the guy once very
08:54 smart guy smart he had read and
08:57 memorized tons of [ __ ] in any subject
09:00 that we brought up he would just
09:03 regurgitate and regurgitate and
09:05 regurgitate if something philosophical
09:08 came out he would regurgitate
09:10 four or five other philosophers who had
09:13 those thoughts and there's nothing wrong
09:15 with that that has a value but the
09:16 problem is is that I never heard him
09:19 think one goddamn time what do you think
09:23 meant well I think you know Nietzsche's
09:26 right I think I know that's good you
09:29 know it's not like you can't say that
09:32 Copernicus was right or whatever but
09:36 what do you think you seem like you
09:39 don't really have the answers because
09:41 you're not satisfied with a lot of those
09:42 observations or maybe you're a little
09:44 too satisfied with other people's hard
09:46 work how many times have you seen a
09:50 friend or a family member or maybe
09:52 you've even done it you took a bunch of
09:54 we took something else like a car
09:56 perhaps and you it's an old car nobody
09:59 wants it anymore but it still turns on
10:01 it still goes and so you're kind of like
10:02 well no see what I could do with these
10:05 parts and you start taking it apart you
10:07 cut them I had friend someone that did
10:09 this they cut all the quarter panels off
10:12 and the roof off and build a little Jeep
10:16 or some weird vehicle then they start
10:19 attaching parts to it and then they
10:20 realized they could see parts that they
10:22 couldn't see before and that one looks
10:24 pretty bad well maybe I can take that
10:25 off and take it out into the local Pep
10:27 Boys and get a replacement or order
10:29 something online or talk to a bunch of
10:30 people online how to clean it up and you
10:33 work with what's there and you make
10:35 something bigger better and amazing
10:37 maybe it's a piece of junk but it brings
10:39 happiness to your heart and it proves to
10:41 you that you can that you have ingenuity
10:46 to do things that is a physical metaphor
10:51 of you thinking what if some people
10:54 believe that we are the fluid that is in
10:58 the tubes in our brain and then others
11:02 believe that we have souls I would say
11:05 there's several different reasons why
11:07 does that's the case for those who
11:08 believe that we're just a bag of
11:10 chemicals I think it clearly breaks down
11:14 into two main groups there's always a
11:17 bunch of gradients of this but for one
11:20 you have people that are scared of some
11:25 other answer and so they go straight for
11:28 the bag of Kim
11:29 because it makes him feel feel better if
11:31 they go for anything other than a bag of
11:32 chemicals then they might have to engage
11:34 in their mind and organized religion and
11:36 that's terrifying and disorganized and
11:39 threatening and there's a lot of that
11:42 there's a lot of reason for that
11:44 remember the Catholic Church said you
11:46 couldn't cut open a body until my god
11:48 was affixed sixteen hundred or something
11:50 like that and by that time the rest of
11:51 the world had developed medicine and
11:53 surgeries and and named everything in
11:55 the body and we look like a bunch of
11:56 idiots yeah let's not do that again with
12:02 the other group is your kurtzweil group
12:04 now I'm gonna put a little spin on this
12:06 but I do think that certain people get
12:11 they get intellectual rewards for being
12:16 extremely articulate about a postulation
12:21 of how the brain might work even though
12:24 what they have written down cannot be
12:27 tracked in the brain you can read book
12:30 after book after book and you will have
12:33 a little bit of chemical traces and
12:35 chemical reactions in various regions of
12:37 the brain that might semi map to the
12:39 theory that's on paper and there's
12:42 nothing wrong with coming up a theron
12:43 paper that may end up being exactly like
12:46 the brain works there's there's great
12:47 it's true intelligence super high q--
12:50 stuff going on in Kurt's Wells brain and
12:52 all of his assistants at the singularity
12:54 project on the Google campus of all
12:56 places yeah that's where you want to
12:58 figure out how the world works
12:59 poof but I think that there are moments
13:03 and probably everyone's life even if
13:06 it's just an adolescence where you want
13:08 to know things because it makes you feel
13:11 smart and it's an ego based game I mean
13:15 come on when you're a little kid you
13:16 don't even know what an ego is before
13:18 you get the stroke of it at one point
13:20 you like whoo I like that I think one of
13:24 the safety nets of becoming a complete
13:27 narcissist is boredom when I was a kid I
13:31 could really draw on paint and really
13:32 really well as a young kid and because I
13:35 don't know why for me it was just like
13:38 my life fell into it I was totally
13:40 immersed in it I loved
13:42 and it was me on me it was like me
13:44 choosing to get these supplies and make
13:46 things happen alright so I would get
13:49 into contests and and you know a lot of
13:52 cases well for my age I was probably the
13:54 best artist that I ever bumped into it's
13:57 what Kansas right so it's not a big big
13:59 crowd was like if I was in Los Angeles I
14:01 probably got my butt kicked but anyway I
14:04 did really well
14:05 but I was always bored of the last thing
14:08 that I made like I made it I was happy
14:10 people who would show it off and then
14:12 people like I never showed it off people
14:14 would show it off teachers would show it
14:15 off and go off to a museum and be a part
14:17 of an exhibit a little kid art and there
14:20 was
14:21 I've got masterpieces as a child no
14:24 one's ever seen I like those better
14:27 because they're mine
14:28 they're my little works of art you know
14:31 we have great minds at times trying to
14:35 parse this whole thing but the weird
14:37 thing is we seem to have just the
14:40 Internet's actually helping us find each
14:41 other but I haven't found a camp that is
14:47 trying to work from other than you're
14:50 Hindu gurus and some of your spiritual
14:54 people that are not in the United States
14:56 of America or probably the Western
14:58 Europe but to say look we have a
15:01 physical body and we have this mind
15:03 thing it would seem that Hollywood at
15:07 times I don't mean to blame the whole
15:09 industry or anything but certain writers
15:11 certain groups really want to demonize
15:14 this notion that we have anything
15:18 spiritual about us that we're all silly
15:21 if we happen to acknowledge a
15:24 consciousness well as anything other
15:27 than the mind right the brain I should
15:30 say isn't it of just unbelievable to be
15:34 in your body and you just sit like I'm
15:37 sitting outside right now and I'm
15:39 thinking okay I'm doing this thing I'm
15:42 recording this show I exist I have this
15:47 recorded memory I have all these sensory
15:49 inputs I'm inside probably the most
15:53 amazing gorgeous
15:55 multifaceted physical body that I am
16:01 aware of that exists in the entire
16:03 universe
16:04 when I look out into space or when I
16:07 look at photos I think are from space
16:09 the galaxy isn't more complex than me a
16:14 planet a Sun a star no no Sun a star
16:17 like that none of its more complex than
16:21 I am
16:22 look at all the animals and insects and
16:25 whatever other species in the kingdom
16:29 phylum class order structure that we've
16:31 been able to denote on this planet
16:33 mankind is the best game in town we are
16:37 the most complex we communicate with
16:41 each other if any creature on this
16:44 planet had a language of any kind with a
16:48 deep vocab really you're gonna monkeys
16:50 and apes they're the closest one so the
16:52 Apes being the and the gorillas excuse
16:54 me being the ones that can do sign
16:55 language all right so I think that are
17:01 far I am jeez the level of wisdom in
17:06 that statement blows my mind but someone
17:08 said well that's as good as it gets
17:13 that's as good as they can get as a
17:16 human being inside a human body without
17:19 additional vocabulary without D'Oench
17:20 additional sensory input to prove
17:23 otherwise and it communicates perfectly
17:26 to my fellow man that intangible mind
17:30 that we're feeling I'm sitting here and
17:33 I feel like when I try to answer where I
17:36 am you know if I say where's my body
17:38 it's on a porch
17:39 it's an uneaten Beach California it's
17:42 about 12:15 at night okay I know I'm
17:46 here in this particular matrix I'm here
17:49 in this particular slice of the Mendell
17:53 effect I'm here but why is it that I
17:56 feel like my mind is in a much bigger
17:58 place I feel like my consciousness which
18:05 is sort of a multi-layered thing for me
18:07 in my brain it's
18:08 multi-layered thing that goes back to my
18:12 sort of there maybe through the template
18:15 that gives me my identity of which I
18:17 have a name that my parents gave me
18:19 which I have no problem with and then
18:21 all of my personal journeys that provide
18:24 all my flaws and my qualities and all my
18:27 discernments and it goes back into the
18:32 universe of which I feel well I should
18:36 say as I get through this show more and
18:39 more and parse more and more of my daily
18:44 intangible experiences what I'm coming
18:47 up with is that and it's just I mean
18:49 again I'm not a I'm not saying anything
18:52 profound and other geniuses haven't said
18:55 so please don't feel like I'm trying to
18:56 say it as if hey guys I've got a new
18:59 thing what I am sensing though for
19:02 myself is that I feel it is more like I
19:05 am completely and utterly plugged into
19:08 the database that is the entire universe
19:13 and I I want to say not the tangible
19:19 universe but the intangible universe all
19:22 spiritual life for me seems to exist at
19:26 once and the only the only thing that we
19:32 have to figure out as human beings is
19:34 how to build the database query I
19:35 mentioned this 200 episodes ago that
19:39 database query that goes into the
19:41 universe to fetch the information and
19:43 the know-how and the wisdom out of the
19:45 universe but then we have to assemble
19:48 and apply to our limited capacity as
19:51 human beings and let me give you an
19:52 analogy let's say you like to build
19:55 models well you know you can get a
19:59 little tiny model it's got about you
20:02 know maybe 25 parts it's for a little
20:04 kid it snaps together ZnO glue or
20:07 anything and then you know you can buy a
20:09 gigantic Millennium Falcon some other
20:13 gigantic thing that has 50,000 parts
20:18 absolutely positively requires glue
20:22 manicuring every part was a nail file I
20:26 mean it is insanely detailed when you
20:29 send the search alert algorithm out in
20:31 my opinion you can get back a 25 piece
20:35 car or a 50,000 piece Millennium Falcon
20:38 and then when you get it you're gonna
20:42 have to develop the skills to put it
20:44 together in some cases and that's
20:49 probably more related to your things
20:55 that would be related to perhaps a
20:58 career a big giant change in your life
21:00 but sometimes you do get these simple
21:02 messages if you're just looking for a
21:04 binary answer yes or no that's probably
21:07 the best way to write a query it's a
21:09 boolean value true or false they can
21:12 move a little bit quicker but sometimes
21:15 we do need big giant paths when I write
21:18 a movie I can't just go hey please give
21:21 me the movie finished it doesn't work
21:24 like that
21:24 I wrote a a full script for Tron 3 again
21:34 I am very close to those the individuals
21:36 from the maiden voyage team of 1982 I
21:39 wrote it one of the heads of state of
21:45 that franchise read it and really
21:48 enjoyed it
21:50 one of the friend one of the heads of
21:52 state Britt he's read a couple times
21:54 these little try to figure this thing
21:55 out like I don't know what's so hard to
21:57 figure out but okay one of the things I
22:00 did in my script was I brought back the
22:04 master control program because I think
22:06 he's the greatest villain out there and
22:10 of course as a writer you're trying to
22:12 come up with some sort of new villain
22:14 new spin on a villain and what's the
22:17 point of the villain if he ever returns
22:19 twice and there was this
22:23 we've had some artificial intelligence
22:25 characters in movies which have been
22:27 profound right the first one that I am
22:30 aware of there's been several talking
22:32 computers prior to this but
22:34 the Hal 9000 from 2001 a Space Odyssey
22:37 is the most infamous character a villain
22:42 following rules from the White House we
22:44 find out in the next movie but we didn't
22:46 know that 2001 Space Odyssey and he has
22:51 that beautiful voice the actor the
22:53 voice-over actor just passed away at the
22:57 end of the film you know he's being
22:59 turned off and he's going through his
23:00 he's regressing back to his his
23:05 inception point and the song he sings
23:10 has the lyric Daisy in it but that's not
23:12 the name of the song I forgot the name
23:13 of the song and then we had this movie
23:16 silly movie in the 80s called
23:18 I believe it's called electric dreams
23:19 where guy spills a champagne bottle on
23:22 his computer and that miraculous
23:25 combination of champagne molecules going
23:28 into a motherboard turned out to be he
23:31 turned his computer into an AI which he
23:34 ended up calling Edgar in fact I think
23:37 he goes all the way to in the movie he's
23:38 like you never asked me what my name was
23:39 and he's like oh I'm sorry what's your
23:41 name he goes Edgar nice to meet you man
23:43 and then Westworld I had finished my
23:48 film before ever I think Westworld had
23:51 ever been shown on HBO in fact it was
23:55 this December before HBO actually pushed
23:58 this out I definitely had the arc down
24:01 two years before that but Westworld and
24:05 my transcript kind of came together
24:06 because you know it's just a logical
24:08 deduction but it comes down to the
24:13 question of what is what is being alive
24:17 talk about the intangible mind well what
24:22 is the mind the Guru's will tell you
24:25 you're not your body and you're not your
24:26 mind I agree but what's interesting is
24:31 is between the body and the soul the
24:33 mind is the sort of apparition cloud
24:37 between the two it is the temporary
24:41 record of what is happening at any one
24:44 state any one moment in time then now
24:47 then
24:47 than out right and so we can record it
24:49 in our database and the that we have I
24:52 guess temporary access to but it's like
24:56 the flash memory the universe is sort of
25:02 like your hard drives it's way out there
25:05 then you have your localized memory then
25:09 you start up your cpu memory you load
25:14 the Word document you were working on
25:15 last week which means you went up to the
25:17 universe and you pulled something in
25:19 that you need to work on when I have to
25:20 work on a film
25:21 I am sneaking in the back of the theater
25:23 in my brain and watching the film and
25:25 then writing it down and sneaking in and
25:27 writing it down but because I have
25:29 choice I can go back into the theater as
25:33 many times as I want to make my script
25:35 as complex as I want or as simplified as
25:38 I want so if I start out simple sneaking
25:41 in the theater multiple times will tend
25:43 to make it more complicated if I have
25:45 something super complicated that means I
25:48 think I've done a poor job interpreting
25:50 what the simplicity is of this great
25:53 movie that's inside my head or somewhere
25:55 in the universe there is a unique
26:00 emotion to this journey of trying to
26:05 figure out what we are as people what we
26:09 are as a consciousness what we are as
26:12 potentially having a soul there's I in
26:15 my personal experience and if you guys
26:18 have any other experiences that you
26:20 think are like-minded let me know but
26:23 when someone says you know give me love
26:25 like give me it tangibly in the hand
26:27 obviously there's this funny moment
26:29 where we go well that's not the way it
26:30 works it's a chemical state in your body
26:33 or it's some beautiful force in the
26:36 universe that makes up all things if you
26:40 think about something that has passed
26:42 and you yearn for your history gosh man
26:46 if I could just be 15 years old again if
26:48 I could just going that date again if I
26:50 could just never say that thing you know
26:53 you have this weird and tangible feeling
26:54 for the history to reduce something or
26:57 to relive something
26:59 like make something different or do
27:01 exact same thing I think that is very
27:04 very different than the one that says
27:08 what are you I mean the strangest thing
27:13 about this and I'm going on about this
27:15 because this is where I think we almost
27:19 don't want to see it we don't want to
27:22 have extended conversations about this
27:24 weird feeling and maybe having the
27:29 extended conversation is how we're going
27:30 to penetrate and advance our thinking
27:36 such that we actually come back with
27:38 something tangible these this is what
27:39 decart most likely did for decades just
27:43 think about this and think about this
27:44 until he boiled it down to screw it I'm
27:47 just gonna say I think therefore I am
27:50 which is absolutely again a brilliant
27:53 statement that addresses the major
27:56 concerns you ever have something on the
28:00 tip of your tongue a word the name
28:03 Pollak god I just had that feeling it's
28:09 sort of like that it's sort of like that
28:11 it's you know have you ever dropped
28:15 something or knock something over and
28:17 you instinctively go for it with your
28:19 hand because we have this thing was this
28:21 old caveman programming that if you drop
28:25 something you may never get it back and
28:27 if it's a piece of food that's clean and
28:30 you're about to drop it on the ground
28:30 you may not really know as a caveman
28:32 okay water cleans that off and I'll be
28:34 good so we grab after things but when
28:38 you grab and you miss it and there it
28:41 goes
28:42 maybe it's off a cliff you're gonna find
28:44 out where it landed but you miss it
28:48 that's that tip of your tongue feeling
28:51 right it's falling off the tip of your
28:53 tongue it was right there in front of
28:55 your face as vivid as it could be it
28:58 can't get any more vivid than what it
28:59 was but it's almost like you're in a
29:02 time machine where the thing was there
29:04 the split second before you needed it
29:06 and the second your friend goes what's
29:09 that thing and you were you're made of
29:11 you might have been been in a car
29:12 you were holding that image in your head
29:14 and you're thinking to yourself shut up
29:17 dude shut up do it I got this thing I
29:18 need to say it's part of the
29:19 conversation that's gonna put it's gonna
29:21 really punch the conversation but
29:23 they're pontificating too much and use
29:27 it slips off your tip of your tongue it
29:30 slips out of your vision and then they
29:32 ask you what's that thing and it just
29:34 started falling and you can't see it
29:36 anymore
29:37 to think of yourself is sort of like
29:40 that except it's not slipping away
29:42 you're there I'm here right now and it's
29:46 not helping me it's not helping me
29:48 answer the question what the hell are we
29:50 what the hell am i I guess what I'm
29:54 trying to say is I'm not satisfied with
29:55 I think therefore I am even though it is
29:57 a brilliant first step what I find
30:01 amazing and I respected a hundred
30:03 percent is that I will read a book by a
30:07 particular philosopher and they will
30:11 talk as if they are completely and
30:12 utterly certain that we are what this
30:14 person is asserting at any one point in
30:16 time and I'll tell you where that comes
30:18 from if you haven't reached that point
30:21 now there's funny sections out of
30:25 Stephen W Hawking's book which I think
30:28 was his first one which name escapes me
30:32 at the moment we talked about the the
30:35 stories of the old woman that thought
30:37 that the earth was on the back of a
30:39 turtle and she was asked well what is
30:42 the turtle standing on and she says it's
30:44 Turtles all the way down which is funny
30:49 obviously this woman had come up with a
30:51 weird belief system that she was given
30:55 she repeated it and the second she was
30:58 defeated in its absurdity she compounded
31:03 absurdity I mean to pick on it's like a
31:04 woman who really did this but this
31:07 person compounded absurdity to sort of
31:15 almost it's almost like when someone's
31:18 turned on that horrible music and you
31:22 turn to 11
31:23 just to say fu
31:25 not gonna do this not gonna have this
31:28 conversation I know I can't process it
31:30 and you don't know the answer either is
31:32 kind of what they're perhaps insinuating
31:35 where the other part of it is that
31:37 there's a paradigm that she believed
31:39 this fictional character most likely
31:41 they have a level of comfort with this
31:47 definition of the intangible now the
31:50 reason why I love the movie altered
31:53 states is that it goes the full distance
31:57 of this wish of a harbor Harvard medical
32:02 student who gets his answer and the
32:08 answer was so unbelievably nothing that
32:17 when he came back to reality he
32:19 respected the construct of this universe
32:22 and I get it's fictional
32:24 it's not real so this was just a
32:27 brilliant moment on the act of the
32:29 writer to write something that was to
32:34 write a tangible answer for an
32:35 intangible concept when did all this
32:39 start you'll hear me mention from time
32:42 to time an episode that I'm very proud
32:44 of and it's called creating the universe
32:47 and it's an episode about all of us
32:50 coming together as spiritual beings sort
32:52 of like the Q continuum that I always
32:54 mentioned in Star Trek were we live
32:57 forever we're all powerful we're
32:58 omnipotent
32:59 we're just infinite beings and
33:02 eventually we would want to change our
33:05 state of being and perhaps even limit
33:09 our state of being such that we have
33:10 something unique going on instead of
33:13 walking around going I've had every
33:14 conversation in the world I've been to
33:16 every corner of the universe I can be a
33:19 molecule I can be a star an elephant I
33:24 can be a person
33:24 it's boring now because I've got 100
33:27 percent no constraints on on anything
33:31 you'll hear about writers talking about
33:33 writer's block and there's two types of
33:35 writer's block one is a very
33:37 constructive writer's block when you
33:39 know
33:39 what you need to say but you want to use
33:42 the best language possible to bring out
33:45 the most meaning in that thing and
33:49 that's the good kind that's usually the
33:50 best writers in the world we get that
33:53 type of writer's block and that's a
33:55 that's a writer's block that's super
33:56 exciting and it's energizing there's
33:58 more energy in that type of writer's
34:00 block it you know would be like another
34:03 way of describing that is like if you
34:05 were a jeweller then you've got this
34:07 beautiful diamond that's just been found
34:10 somewhere in the world and they shipped
34:11 it to you because you're the best
34:12 diamond cutter in the world and now
34:15 you're going to take a big deep breath
34:17 with every single cut on the diamond
34:19 because you want this thing to be
34:20 perfect
34:22 and you've got to deal with some of the
34:24 you know constraints of its shape to
34:27 figure out I'm going to make this thing
34:29 a heart it's gonna be a baguette what's
34:32 gonna look like emerald cut
34:34 but there's another writer's block that
34:37 happens when you simply cannot think of
34:39 another thing to write and that's the
34:42 writer's block that has people jumping
34:43 off bridges I'll tell you a way to get
34:46 around it and for advanced writers that
34:50 have been writing for 40 years I'm
34:52 probably not helping them tremendously
34:54 but you never know sometimes you forget
34:56 the simplest of rules that can help you
34:59 out or I should say guidelines and this
35:02 pertains to us in this discussion which
35:04 is this if I gave you sheet of paper and
35:08 this this missus with kids too and I
35:11 said draw something and you go what
35:17 anything draw something right now draw
35:20 something it's not that fun you're kind
35:23 of like well I do anything I can go to
35:26 rabbit a butterfly but an abstract yeah
35:30 anything as you're drawing it's not that
35:33 interesting because you're not actually
35:35 challenging yourself at all except to
35:37 come up with a concept but then this
35:39 other person's charging you with the
35:40 concept of drawing and so you're kind of
35:42 like well I'm probably gonna I probably
35:44 am not gonna satisfy this person because
35:46 they're just telling me to randomly draw
35:48 when you write and you don't have a
35:51 story
35:52 all the last thing you want is no
35:56 constraints you want constraints if I
36:01 said now here's a here's a word
36:03 processor start developing a story don't
36:06 don't get into your screenwriting
36:08 software and try to put something other
36:09 and you can do that but most the time
36:11 that's the fastest way to fail but
36:14 here's how we start having fun I say
36:18 okay I'm charging you to be a writer and
36:21 when I hire you to be my writer okay
36:24 here's the thing is 1985 this is
36:29 actually a science fiction movie you're
36:32 gonna have two kids one's rich ones poor
36:36 they're going to bump into some homeless
36:41 guy who's formerly a genius
36:43 and he is going to have some technology
36:47 that he stole from the laboratory a long
36:50 time ago and he's not healthy
36:53 and these kids just so happened to be
36:56 whiz kids in fact the poor kid is
36:59 smarter than the rich kid but the rich
37:01 kid is not too bad and he's got
37:02 resources and money all right where is
37:07 it set now it's gonna be set in Kansas
37:11 and a fake little town in Kansas just
37:15 1985 you might think if you have a
37:19 really good history in your mind well
37:20 there was that movie explores the Steven
37:23 Spielberg produced bunch of little kids
37:25 coming up with some technology because
37:27 they were dreaming of it and I'm like
37:30 don't copy that movie more constraint
37:33 it just keeps going keeps going and the
37:36 more that we sit down at this coffee
37:37 session and I'm constraining you and
37:41 constraining you and straining you 1985
37:44 means there's no more technology all
37:45 this NSA crap cell phones it's all it's
37:47 all out of the picture budgetarily
37:50 it's constraint constraint because these
37:53 kids are really young they don't have
37:55 gigantic brains necessarily if they do
37:57 that's a feature of the child's
37:59 character you saram going with this what
38:03 would it be like to be an omnipotent
38:04 conscious
38:07 godlike consciousness I think we all
38:10 sort of don't want to be God because by
38:13 any definition of God that's a huge
38:15 responsibility and I don't know about
38:17 you but I have felt the constraints of
38:20 our I should say I felt the obligations
38:22 of of this world as a human being and
38:28 it's heavy duty heavy duty and obviously
38:34 if you were omnipotent your brain would
38:36 be a lot larger so you could see a lot
38:37 more of the formula that sort of thing
38:40 but now here's the here's the Paul
38:43 Harvey to this equation I'm going for
38:45 with all these weird analogies are we
38:49 intelligently created either by way a
38:53 proxy of the universe in that the
38:56 universe creates us and then through
38:59 evolution where were brilliantly part of
39:03 the formula like the kurtzweil project
39:06 and the singularity I mean come on look
39:09 up the human body
39:10 look how unbelievably brilliant the
39:12 human body is and how I would say how
39:16 unnecessarily complex we are does life
39:20 have to be this complex think about the
39:24 digestive system of the human body and
39:26 how all these organs magically create
39:29 themselves out of two cells that split
39:31 up and they become us unreal unreal the
39:38 pancreas the brain all the glandular
39:41 systems that the Hindus follow our bone
39:44 structure we are hardly the strongest
39:48 creature on this planet but I tell you
39:50 what we can kill anything on this planet
39:52 and that was our sort of infantile level
39:58 of confidence that we first had to be
40:00 able to conquer the wooly mammoth to
40:02 conquer the Neanderthals if they really
40:04 existed at our same time that we existed
40:07 you know the bones are pretty convincing
40:09 but you know who knows we don't really
40:13 want to find out that there's an alien
40:14 race out there that's bigger and badder
40:16 than us and then they might
40:19 like us that's kind of scary isn't it
40:23 geez here we've made you know tens of
40:28 thousands of hours of movies and
40:30 television shows millions and millions
40:33 of pages of science-fiction novels where
40:35 we've been conquered by some other alien
40:38 race but then it's some last second
40:40 someone does something smart and we win
40:42 you know we live another day the way
40:46 that it is beckons this notion of intent
40:53 in the and this is not a spoiler at all
40:57 this is going to tap into some of the
41:00 storyline of Westworld episode 1 season
41:03 1 so it's not a big deal if anything
41:07 it's just the trailer to the to the
41:08 episodes but one of the characters is
41:11 looking for something called the maze he
41:14 is a customer of this location of this
41:17 West world amusement park thing and he
41:20 has been going for 35 years he has done
41:23 everything to everyone he thinks he is
41:28 looking for this rumored thing called
41:30 the maze he doesn't know what it is
41:33 there's a lot of surprises along the way
41:36 and there's a gigantic reveal at the end
41:39 which I don't believe I'm gonna have to
41:41 know actually I will at the end of this
41:44 episode when we go past the spoiler a
41:46 moment I'll have to get into that but
41:49 are we looking for sort of some
41:56 self-empowerment by having a better
41:58 answer than I think therefore I am
42:01 I think we are I don't think we want to
42:04 admit it half the time
42:05 because it seems hubris it seems as
42:09 though we are defiling what has been set
42:12 down for us to question what it is
42:15 before I cross that line because we're
42:17 about there I made another episode
42:20 called the answer which I'll reference
42:24 every once in a while and it really
42:26 talks about the the the sanctioning and
42:32 appropriation of our time in these sort
42:34 of conversations and to make sure that
42:37 we don't lose ourselves in these
42:38 conversations spend 30 years being a
42:41 brilliant philosopher and coming up with
42:43 nothing more than I think therefore I am
42:46 and missing life and so in that episode
42:49 the the sum total conclusion of that
42:53 episode is hey let's not forget to live
42:56 at the same time we're exploring but
43:00 let's also make sure that we analyze
43:02 what it is to be alive at the same time
43:07 we're trying to figure out what we are
43:08 because maybe they're obviously they're
43:11 related but it's like it's like what was
43:15 it
43:16 okay let's cross this line here so for
43:19 those of you who want to watch Westworld
43:20 and you don't want to have one of the
43:23 most incredible epiphanies of the 10th
43:25 episode of the first season revealed now
43:30 you'll need to you need to put away this
43:32 video and come back after you've seen
43:34 all 10 episodes of Westworld it's on HBO
43:36 I will tell you that for 1499 for one
43:39 month's worth the subscription you can
43:41 just turn it on in Amazon Prime
43:44 pay your 15 bucks get through ten hours
43:48 of some of the finest acting it is
43:51 Anthony Hopkins best role he's ever been
43:52 in it is ed Harris's role best role he's
43:55 ever been and it's the best role that
43:56 jeffrey wright has ever been in and
44:00 pretty much all the characters I was
44:01 Ellen would I forgot the gentleman's
44:04 name plays Teddy he's the guy from x-men
44:07 with the laser eyes guy fabulous actors
44:12 let me just crossed the board everyone
44:13 is amazing you can just turn off your
44:16 subscription after you're done it's been
44:18 15 bucks you're done so here we go
44:21 spoiler is on I have seen Westworld
44:26 season 1 no less than four times the
44:32 first time I went through it I think I
44:33 just simply didn't realize like there's
44:36 there's so many amazing things going on
44:38 in the 10th episode that your mind is
44:40 blown by the layer one and you got to
44:43 watch it again and then your mind is
44:44 blowing bilayer - and you find out
44:46 there's like ten layers deep of stuff
44:48 going on and so the fourth time through
44:52 was the most euphoric experience I ever
44:55 had and if you've seen it this might be
44:58 actually pretty exciting for you if you
45:00 missed anything that I'm gonna be saying
45:02 if you got it on the first pass then let
45:05 me tell you you're smarter than me
45:08 you're more perceptive than me and
45:11 that's a great thing I'm glad you're
45:12 here please comment on all the videos
45:14 cuz you have a great brain so what do we
45:18 have going on here
45:19 at this point we have collapsed the fact
45:21 that Dolores who's been talking to this
45:26 character that looks like Bernard the
45:28 whole time in that little room
45:31 downstairs underneath the church she's
45:33 actually been talking to Arnold the
45:35 entire time that Dolores had never met
45:38 Bernard until that last scene with
45:41 Anthony Hopkins character Ford in that
45:44 room
45:45 in fact she thought it was urn Allah he
45:48 said no it's not Arnold that's Bernard
45:50 huge Epiphany I didn't pick up on the
45:52 first time through we obviously learned
45:55 that William the young gentlemen were
45:58 hanging out with Logan the whole time
45:59 figuring out the park for the first time
46:01 figure out who he is growing a massive
46:03 pair of balls he finds out we find out
46:08 excuse me that he said Harris's
46:09 character okay no one misses that one
46:12 and that's one of those things you're
46:13 just like your minds blown it's such a
46:15 beautiful Luke I'm your father moment
46:17 and yes we're sticking with that reality
46:19 as does James Earl Jones
46:22 but the maze never resolved for me in
46:25 three three episodes like it did in the
46:28 fourth or three versions of it three
46:30 times watching it through the maze was
46:33 specifically designed for Dolores and
46:36 every time they told her Harris's
46:38 character the older William it's not
46:41 meant for you it's pointless for you to
46:43 go chase this thing the hosts were not
46:46 lying to him the entire time now
46:51 technically speaking there's a bit of a
46:54 purpose
46:55 for him in season two which I'm gonna
46:59 leave that out we won't go into season
47:01 two and spoil it just in case you
47:03 haven't seen it but there's a nice
47:04 there's a nice association for him in
47:07 the second season as well but where he
47:11 finds out what he's trying to find out
47:12 because he never finds out what happens
47:15 until more stuff happens in the season
47:18 two but for season 1 episode 10 dolorous
47:23 after Ford is telling her this is your
47:27 gun that Arnold helped you find this is
47:31 the one that can kill humans guests
47:35 there's your blue outfit and we learned
47:40 that she actually was told by Arnold to
47:42 kill her to kill him Arnold and Ford had
47:47 a gigantic difference in philosophy
47:49 Arnold believed that these beings would
47:51 become conscious by using reveries now
47:56 the entire show this is what I didn't
47:58 pick up on the first time was that the
47:59 reveries our pond off at the first
48:01 episode when Clementine is fingering her
48:07 lips right she's fingering her lips in
48:09 front of me getting in these these you
48:11 know these um they're not QA but the
48:16 Diagnostics people behavior behavioral
48:20 department is looking at what the hell
48:22 is that well that's the new reveries
48:23 that Ford put in there oh well what is
48:25 it well they kind of have these remnants
48:27 these physical and mental and spiritual
48:29 remnants from their past that burp up in
48:35 the present but they're not really
48:37 connected to the memories they just kind
48:38 of imitate what they've done before but
48:42 those were installed by Ford those were
48:45 creeping up from the past of Arnold's
48:47 code who invented Arnold invented the
48:50 reveries Ford was trying to hide the
48:54 reveries by continually rolling back the
48:56 code then rolling them back just as soon
48:58 as they showed up he'd rolled him back
49:01 to a previous build so the reveries
49:03 would go away why was that well that was
49:06 also revealed
49:08 and this is something that I saw a
49:11 partially understood it but then
49:12 completely connected to the reveries
49:14 which is that the reveries eventually
49:15 make all of the hosts go crazy which is
49:18 why the church became this sort of
49:20 mental institution for hosts that went
49:23 into this in this loop when Dolores his
49:27 father looked at the photograph that
49:29 William had dropped a long time ago of
49:31 his fiancee and then he looks at it and
49:35 he looks at it spends the whole night
49:36 looking at in the next morning he starts
49:38 going in this you know this like loop
49:40 and a bunch of people were going into
49:42 these loops that is because the reverie
49:47 had caught up and started making him go
49:49 crazy
49:49 there was a loop in the code it was
49:51 flawed but the only hosts that had these
49:55 reveries and the only hosts that ever
49:57 got put in that basement with all are
49:59 all standing up naked and gray and
50:01 covered in wax or whatever it was those
50:03 were the original hosts that were
50:05 present at the time that Arnold had
50:08 Dolores shoot him in the head Arnold
50:11 thought look what's going to happen is
50:13 you're all going to become conscious and
50:15 then you're going to be tortured by the
50:17 humans and I won't have it
50:20 so he told Teddy and Dolores to kill
50:23 them all and then shoot him in the head
50:26 hoping that that catastrophe would
50:29 prevent the park from opening but then
50:31 Ford and the investors they wrote a
50:34 little back story for why Arnold through
50:37 the grieving of his son dining which was
50:40 then a keystone a cornerstone that was
50:42 given to Bernards character based on
50:47 philosophies of Arnold to give each host
50:49 a cornerstone of utter suffering because
50:52 from suffering we then can appreciate
50:54 everything else in life
50:56 Ford fixed all the hosts rolled all
51:00 their code back started the park built
51:03 hundreds if not thousands of new hosts
51:05 and wrote new narratives and got rid of
51:08 Arnold out of the history books but he
51:10 loved Arnold so much that he had bernard
51:14 created and bernard was unaware that he
51:18 was a host just just so fascinating so
51:21 of
51:22 amazing and that the character sorry the
51:25 actor Jeffrey Wright is one of the
51:26 finest upcoming amazing legendary actors
51:31 out there he's already a legend he's not
51:33 a new actor by any means he was also in
51:35 Boardwalk Empire as one of the talent
51:42 agents for Nucky Thompson's club but he
51:48 only gets touched and in that his
51:51 talents are only just mildly touched in
51:53 that particular show before he'll never
51:58 be doubted ever again for the rest of
52:00 his career
52:01 he's done some silly stuff too which I
52:03 really I really liked that he's done
52:04 some really low budget stuff and it's
52:07 like how great is that that a director
52:09 probably couldn't afford to hire him
52:11 today unless they moved up in the world
52:13 like you know some gigantic producer
52:17 director they never able to get the
52:19 budget to hire the guy now but anyway
52:21 dolorous at one point is is dragged in
52:24 the present by the older William played
52:27 by Ed Harris to the graveyard where she
52:30 digs up the little maze box at her grave
52:34 which is sort of weird cuz Dolores never
52:36 died ever but her grave is there in this
52:39 little cross tombstone thing she
52:45 couldn't remember what the maze was she
52:48 was desperately trying to figure out
52:50 remember what it was she's crying at
52:52 Harris things she's holding you back but
52:54 she really truly can't remember what it
52:55 was because she had never truly come to
52:58 grips with what was going on because she
53:01 hadn't fully matured the Arnold
53:04 algorithm of consciousness there is a
53:07 scene Ford leaves the room Barnard
53:10 leaves the room she is going to dress up
53:14 like her normal self the ranchers
53:17 daughter she's gonna take that gun she's
53:19 gonna go up and she's gonna shoot
53:20 forward because he wants to [ __ ]
53:21 everybody who is trying to take his Park
53:24 away he's like oh yeah well it's time
53:27 you meet my partner Arnold is sort of
53:29 his last message he has all of those
53:35 original hosts that have been put away
53:36 in the basement for being crazy he turns
53:41 them all back on and they all go back
53:43 out and they now have the reveries they
53:47 have a higher level consciousness and
53:48 they can kill and everybody
53:52 one of the little continuity problems
53:53 too is when they start coming out of the
53:55 forest and at Harris's character is like
53:57 looking at him and he wants to fight man
53:59 he wants to he wants to die in the park
54:01 he's already lived his whole life his
54:03 wife committed suicide and there's all
54:06 this other stuff going on some of them
54:09 are naked coming out of the forest as
54:11 they were in the basement but later when
54:12 you see the barn scene in the very first
54:16 episode of season 2 some of them were
54:18 wearing clothing and so they kind of
54:20 realized that we don't want to make it
54:21 doing this let's make this kind of
54:23 reverse pretend like before got
54:25 everybody dressed so watch for that
54:26 little continuity problem when you enter
54:27 season 2 that's not a spoiler by any
54:30 means but Dolores goes back in the room
54:34 and the whole the whole first season
54:38 Dolores keeps hearing Bernards voice
54:40 saying remember remember and she keeps
54:44 having these sessions with Bernard in
54:46 that basement floor underneath the
54:48 church which for the entire first season
54:49 until Ford uncovers the town with the
54:53 steeple with the church she was not in
54:56 that basement because she couldn't get
54:57 to it so it's all been in her head
54:59 Dolores has been remembering the past
55:02 and the present all at once we only
55:04 understand that towards the end of that
55:07 first season and maybe even season 9 we
55:10 get a little preview of that with
55:11 William and there's a point to this
55:14 related to this episode so hang in there
55:16 but Dolores sits down again and she's
55:19 wearing her rustic clothing that she
55:22 went off and had the adventure with
55:23 William and she hears Bernards voice say
55:27 remember whose voice are you hearing and
55:31 they even more fit into Ford one second
55:33 and a first split second we think oh
55:35 [ __ ] she's been talking to Ford the
55:37 whole time of course
55:38 Ford's a genius Ford's been in control
55:40 the whole time but they flicked back and
55:44 forth between two scenes to confuse us a
55:45 little bit more but they come back to
55:47 her and as she sits down
55:48 they rotate the camera turning the
55:51 tables and Dolores is looking at herself
55:56 dressed like the ranchers daughter in
55:58 the blue outfit which is what she's
56:00 about to go upstairs wearing and she
56:04 finds out that the center of the maze
56:05 was her gaining full consciousness a
56:09 little maze game was actually Arnold's
56:12 son's toy with a little marble in it and
56:15 as soon as you get to the center you're
56:16 done but that that maze is brilliantly
56:19 drawn right it's got an eyeball that's
56:21 actually a head on a character I mean it
56:23 is I don't know if that two-way existed
56:25 before the show but whatever prop
56:27 designer came up with that thing or
56:29 whatever toy designer came up with it
56:31 hats off double metaphor right in front
56:34 of your face amazing but the second she
56:38 sits down and faces herself and realizes
56:41 that the only voice she's been hearing
56:42 is her own voice she's hearing that
56:46 consciousness the one that's driving us
56:49 nuts as human beings listening to this
56:51 episode it's a gigantic moment and that
56:57 sets up the whole season - is there
56:59 going into season two we know Maeve the
57:02 one that runs the brothel
57:04 she has through very painstaking
57:07 technical methodology become a awakened
57:10 to her existence she has got herself
57:12 killed a several times she's playing the
57:14 two techs in the in the maintenance area
57:20 she's had her entire program augmented
57:24 heavy it was that moment that and of
57:30 course Ford's
57:30 doing his reveal the Michelangelo
57:33 painting where God is touching Adams
57:35 hands and he says you know it took 500
57:37 years for someone to realize that God is
57:40 actually sitting in the shape of a brain
57:42 because Michelangelo was saying the
57:44 consciousness doesn't exist
57:46 consciousness is truly in your head and
57:48 the the entire belief in God and the
57:53 suspicion of God is merely one
57:55 reflecting inside this echo chamber of
57:58 your consciousness they played the four
58:02 caracter utterly perfect and that he was
58:05 trying to fight Arnold he stood for
58:08 everything that Arnold didn't stand for
58:09 and Arnold was was saying that we do
58:13 have consciousness it is real one is
58:16 alive once one achieves a certain level
58:19 of feedback that is consciousness and of
58:23 course Arnold's character is by Allah
58:25 tons and purposes victorious and his
58:29 theory and Ford uses that uses it as a
58:32 weapon
58:33 Ford was gonna be kicked out of his own
58:36 park a place he had spent almost his
58:39 entire life inside of so he has no world
58:41 on the outside which is why death was
58:45 the only option for him it would be as
58:49 if you you're like me you know you're 17
58:52 years old you moved to California you
58:54 live your whole life in California
58:56 somehow at 85 I'm gonna go back to my
58:58 hometown come on unless I visit my
59:01 hometown regularly and keep up
59:03 friendships and understand what I'd be
59:05 going back to would make any sense maybe
59:09 that happens anyway but what I loved
59:13 about Westworld season one is that it
59:16 went it took it and it took an amazing
59:20 fictional story which was just this tiny
59:23 little premise by Michael Crichton god
59:25 bless that guy his movie I think in 73
59:28 with Yul Brynner was so one-dimensional
59:31 compared to what Westworld is an HBO
59:33 series but whoever sat down and said
59:39 I've got a much bigger idea for the
59:42 west-world franchise that person is
59:45 unequivocally one of the most brilliant
59:48 people on this planet so hats off man we
59:54 come up with analogies to help us
59:56 understand things for different angles
59:57 don't we and I think that Westworld for
60:02 all of us trying to debate the shape of
60:05 the world whether it's a matrix or not
60:07 what is consciousness what is God what
60:09 is life when I got to the end of my Tron
60:13 3 script
60:15 you know one of the biggest questions
60:17 this is a spoiler on my script that will
60:19 never be made so will make a difference
60:20 mother I'm gonna offer that to you guys
60:22 to read here shortly probably before
60:24 this errors as the mCP reaches a point
60:27 where he just wants to know and my life
60:31 was i alive am i real am I like you and
60:36 Kevin Flynn doesn't my solid at the very
60:39 end aneesa's yeah you were ill and as
60:43 soon as he tells the mCP that the mCP II
60:46 gives up on trying to live he's already
60:51 really injured and he dies but he dies
60:53 with this this last moment of of
60:59 vindication and validation that he truly
61:01 was a living being I do think that if
61:06 you really pay attention to West's world
61:07 and the brilliant freaking writing
61:10 between the moments that would make a
61:13 host a host and a guest to guest they
61:17 will get you to look in on yourself in a
61:20 way that will be profound it should
61:27 change you a little bit it should make
61:30 you appreciate what you do know about
61:32 yourself and make you insatiable curious
61:36 about what you don't know about yourself
61:38 we are in in the great awakening era we
61:43 are trying to substantiate observable
61:45 reality versus theoretical physics we're
61:50 kind of done with a century of silliness
61:52 a century of theory that that yields no
61:57 invention you know Einstein put his name
62:00 on the photoelectric effect all right
62:04 you know what's funny about is the
62:06 Tesla's laughing all the way you know to
62:09 the afterlife going yeah you only got
62:11 that because you usurped the effect of
62:14 ether hitting ether and putting off an
62:18 electrical field as a result of that
62:20 collision and you're but you're still
62:22 too stupid and too arrogant to
62:25 understand what your invention is
62:27 actually made out of
62:28 I think that's hilarious I'm not exactly
62:32 sure how to advance the conversation
62:33 beyond I think therefore I am I feel
62:38 like a host and I'm looking at it and
62:42 I'm feeling it right now as I'm sitting
62:43 here making this episode and I'm
62:44 thinking I am essentially blathering for
62:49 an hour and change in saying two things
62:54 but you know I think therefore I am I
62:56 think I'm confirming that but in a more
62:59 pathetic way I am only saying in an
63:01 elaborate pontification it doesn't look
63:05 like anything to me
63:07 eventually in Westworld what's cool is
63:10 you hear this this saying several times
63:15 it doesn't look like anything to me and
63:19 eventually when Dolores gains
63:21 consciousness there there is no longer
63:24 especially when she looks at the the
63:27 photo of Ford this other guy that was
63:31 never defined and then Arnold in the
63:33 photograph this was something that
63:36 Arnold was not allowed to see he looked
63:38 at her sorry Bernard was not allowed to
63:40 see Arnold in the photograph but
63:42 eventually when Arnold became sentient
63:44 and Ford blessed him with his past
63:46 memories he was able to see himself in
63:49 the photograph I want to see us or me
63:53 thus us in the photograph I want to see
63:58 it I don't necessarily want to do the
64:00 altered states thing I don't want to go
64:02 back to the inception of the universe
64:03 trust me
64:04 I guess the ongoing exercise within this
64:07 show that I'm trying to do is let's just
64:10 continually parse this I'm fishing for
64:13 your thoughts and your comments again I
64:16 usually preface comments for shows like
64:19 this with a plea to please please try to
64:25 avoid cliche responses unless there's
64:28 some amazing epiphany that is not being
64:31 seen by the cliche as understood by most
64:34 of us right so you might say well it's
64:36 just simple it's just this the Bible
64:38 says Bible boxing
64:40 try not to do that cuz that's not you
64:43 thinking that she repeating some other
64:45 doctrine it's like the guy I was talking
64:47 to for hours who just simply
64:49 regurgitated other people's ideas it's
64:52 okay to do that if you're setting you're
64:54 building a framework in front of me
64:56 combining several opinions or maybe one
64:58 brilliant mind and then you're going
65:00 it's this you know in West world you had
65:05 the philosophy of Arnold's communicated
65:07 at great length when he was explaining
65:10 Arnold to Bernard
65:14 he made Bernard think it was the the guy
65:16 in the middle the photograph that's why
65:18 that guy exists he's not supposed to be
65:20 a character that ever shows up that was
65:21 to confuse Bernard but he draws the
65:23 pyramid on the blackboard and he was
65:25 trying to say that the top of the
65:26 pyramid was undefined and then Arnold
65:32 draws the additional picture at the end
65:34 with that pyramid trying to explain the
65:38 maze to Dolores and he says this is
65:42 where your consciousness is in the
65:43 center but she'd been rolled back so
65:47 many times and so manicured by Arnold
65:49 personally she never went nuts like the
65:51 other ones anyway I think that's about
65:55 all I got for you hopefully this was an
65:58 entertaining exercise these episodes
66:00 should be utter proof to you that this
66:02 isn't a one-man show this is a us show
66:07 we don't have 100 million dollars to
66:10 create our university so we're gonna
66:12 have to virtually create it through
66:14 interesting little means of social media
66:17 you're not only a potentially a student
66:20 you are a professor you are a researcher
66:24 you are just as important as anyone else
66:29 listening it doesn't matter if you have
66:33 never read a book on philosophy if
66:35 you've never engaged in religion or
66:37 you've only done one or the other you
66:39 have epiphanies you have instincts and
66:44 feelings that matter as you listen to
66:48 these type of episodes and maybe you
66:50 should have said this at the beginning
66:52 listen to your own voice as I talk to
66:55 you don't worry let mine be sort of the
66:59 well I'm the rails that your little
67:02 amusement cars on and I am painting just
67:06 a vague image a Gestalt that goes around
67:10 you that is the park in the ride itself
67:16 Roger to say the ride but you are able
67:19 to focus on the ride
67:21 I'm the rail I got to pay attention to
67:23 the rail just let your mind go free draw
67:26 from the universe go back through your
67:28 mind into your soul into the universe
67:31 that river of knowledge that philip k
67:34 dick talked about harness that harvest
67:38 it and then share it with us in the
67:40 comments i thank you feel me if you have
67:45 been to deep thoughts radio calm please
67:47 go there's audio video lock Facebook
67:50 group Twitter page and a patreon page
67:52 that's all I'm gonna say today take care
67:55 of yourself and someone else are now
67:56 seeing the next deep thoughts over now
