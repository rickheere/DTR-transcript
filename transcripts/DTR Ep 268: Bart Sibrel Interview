00:32 all right ladies and gentlemen you are
00:35 in for a huge treat because this is one
00:37 of my own personal conspiracy heroes
00:39 probably one of the very first human
00:41 beings that actually woke me up to
00:45 conspiracy thinking in the first place
00:47 but took on one of the things that 1991
00:50 ten years before he released his film
00:52 two friends of mine from NASA told me we
00:54 didn't go to the moon I couldn't process
00:57 the the words coming out of their mouths
01:00 ten years later in fact probably even 15
01:02 years later when I first saw one of the
01:05 most amazing movies called a funny thing
01:07 happened on the way to the moon by bart
01:08 sibrel my mind opened and that opened me
01:11 to everything else and I want to welcome
01:14 onto the show mr. bart sibrel when you
01:18 when I I had a show before this one
01:20 where I had a my partner was about seven
01:21 years older than me and he said that
01:23 when the moon mission happened he saw it
01:25 live and I don't know if anyone's asked
01:28 you if you were old enough to see it
01:30 live and remember on TV well I was old
01:34 enough in a way I was four and a half
01:37 but I think it was Central Time around
01:40 9:30 10:30 something like that and that
01:43 was past my bedtime I couldn't stay up
01:45 that late you know I was asleep in bed
01:47 however my father was in the Air Force
01:49 as an officer and he got a VIP package
01:51 of nine by twelve color prints of the
01:55 first mission to the moon and I they
01:57 were cherished present I had him up on
02:00 my bedroom wall for 10 years so from the
02:03 age of 4 to 14 I saw them over 3600 in
02:08 65 times right so that's a lot of
02:12 imprinting I thought it was the most
02:13 marvelous thing and then when I was 14
02:15 after seeing them for 10 years every day
02:17 I saw bill casing on Oprah or no it's
02:21 actually a magazine program although he
02:24 did Oprah before them and he said you
02:27 know they didn't go to the moon and that
02:29 kind of planted a seed in my brain and I
02:31 went to my bedroom wall and sure enough
02:33 it was like my eyes were a white shot or
02:35 something and I saw them with new
02:37 perspective things that were right there
02:39 in front of you I mean the most famous
02:41 shot the guy's arm is bent like this in
02:43 the picture right yeah I mean it's
02:46 supposed to have pressure in it why are
02:47 there wrinkles have you ever seen any
02:49 wrinkles in a balloon right right and so
02:52 there's so much information just there's
02:54 like seven or eight clues his antennas
02:56 cut off
02:57 where's his antenna because the
02:59 background they he was up on cables or
03:03 something the cables even though they
03:04 were black showed up so they very
03:06 quickly pasted a black tape on top and
03:10 you'll see in certain prints the
03:12 background below the the backpack is one
03:16 black and above the black backpack it's
03:19 a different shade of black now they
03:21 corrected that later but in early prints
03:23 it's it's a straight line across of a
03:25 differentiated black and there's no
03:26 antenna they cut off the antenna because
03:28 they were covering something up probably
03:30 cables or something
03:31 then the background wall and the soil in
03:35 earlier pictures not in later pictures
03:38 you have to find books from like 1975
03:40 something like that and the soil is
03:44 brown and the soil behind him is blue I
03:47 mean they're two different colors and so
03:51 then they color corrected it now it's
03:52 all blue I mean there's so many clues
03:55 right in that one picture so then
03:57 another 10 years go by mark and I'm 24
04:00 now I'm a filmmaker and guess I'm
04:02 editing one day a film for the guy made
04:05 the TV show with the guy saying we
04:07 didn't go to the moon I'm like who was
04:08 that guy in your shown he's like oh I
04:10 don't remember call the San Francisco
04:12 office I did they said mr. Hsu Braille
04:15 we were two days away from deleting all
04:17 ten-year-old files to make room in our
04:19 archives I'm gonna throw everything away
04:21 I had you called two days later we would
04:24 have never been able to tell you who the
04:25 guy was so I got
04:27 name and contacted him from a payphone
04:30 just the case this whole thing that
04:33 being true the same site and within a
04:37 couple of minutes he could tell he was
04:38 the real person very grandfatherly or
04:42 whatever and he said hey you should make
04:43 a film about it and I thought about I
04:46 basically took off six months I paid
04:48 myself a salary whatever is making back
04:49 then pretty decent to live and for six
04:53 months I just did research how the
04:54 shadows that should be parallel from
04:56 sunlight they intersect three of the or
05:00 two of the three astronauts and never
05:01 give interviews the administrator of
05:04 NASA resigned the Soviets did everything
05:06 first the first man the first woman that
05:08 worked and of all everything and the
05:12 expressions on their faces like they're
05:14 in a funeral instead of winning the
05:16 Super Bowl I said you know there's at
05:19 least a one out of four chance they
05:22 faked it and considering if they were
05:25 real you know that's what four chance I
05:28 could be risking my life looking into it
05:30 so I said I want to have a wife and
05:33 family someday I've decided they want to
05:35 do I'd turn down the project and then
05:37 five years ago by another client said
05:40 hey Bart read the Bible and we'll give
05:41 you a open door to get your script to
05:45 this famous producer so I bought it one
05:48 year Bible I read it I think five times
05:51 from cover to cover five years by I've
05:54 read the Bible now five times still
05:56 didn't understand it it's like read book
05:58 how to play the piano by Beethoven but
06:00 have a no teacher and you're playing
06:02 with two fingers five years later but
06:04 anyway I did have the understanding that
06:06 there is right and wrong there is a
06:07 distinction obviously rape is wrong and
06:10 murder is wrong stealing drawing I mean
06:12 there's certain things that are obvious
06:13 and if that's the case then there are
06:16 forces that work seen and unseen go in
06:19 one direction and go in the other
06:20 direction so you have to make a decision
06:22 what is morally right if they did not go
06:26 to the man you see mark that's more
06:28 profound than if they'd actually gone
06:30 imagine they could go to the moon they
06:32 could put something up there or they
06:36 couldn't do it they embezzled billions
06:38 of dollars and they murdered people to
06:41 keep it
06:41 secret that's more profound than if they
06:44 had actually gone that's more profound
06:46 of an event historically and it ends up
06:48 being true so I changed you in mind we
06:51 raised half a million dollars from
06:53 aerospace board member at NASA building
06:57 rockets for NASA is the guy who fighting
06:58 up star film and he wishes to remain
07:01 anonymous and I don't wanna ruin his
07:04 career or make a stock go down do you
07:07 say thank you next time you talk to him
07:11 but in any case and then I you know
07:14 three and a half years into a five-year
07:16 film I thought just like some Americans
07:19 thought will never see a black president
07:22 in my lifetime especially
07:22 african-americans they said that they
07:25 were wrong thank goodness we proved at
07:27 least were not racist that happened
07:30 historically it was a great moment for
07:32 the America african-american people and
07:35 but I said kind of the same thing we'll
07:37 never know in my lifetime whether they
07:40 went wrong I was just like they were I
07:43 put in a tape one day it said do not
07:46 show to the public on the screen and I'm
07:48 like what what what what's on the label
07:51 and on the tape or to Dover thinks they
07:53 put it the wrong label on it and it got
07:55 put in the public pile but way down at
07:57 the bottom second from the end and most
07:59 reporters asked for the first few tapes
08:01 I said send me everything every picture
08:04 every video every film from just the
08:07 first mission because I figured if they
08:09 faked it they're more likely to have
08:11 made a mistake the first time they faked
08:14 it so let's focus on that mission if
08:16 that's faked and they're all fake
08:17 because if one Volkswagen can't go a
08:19 thousand miles an hour none of them can
08:21 so they couldn't go to the moon that
08:23 means none of them did and then we
08:26 analyze this tape and it's them
08:28 faking the shot of the photography with
08:31 a model making a one-foot model of the
08:34 earth pretending they're halfway to the
08:35 moon and you hear the CIA and a private
08:38 channel telling them to only talk after
08:41 four seconds go by to give this
08:43 impression that they're further away
08:45 from the earth and they really were and
08:46 the shot is beautiful they used a
08:49 circular window and the earth fills a
08:51 portion of it and they put the camera
08:53 back and they turn off the lights and it
08:54 looks like
08:55 you're floating in space and they say
08:56 we're far away from the earth but it's
08:58 really the window and we ask you when I
09:02 watch that in your movie
09:03 I heard the words coming through
09:06 beautifully and I took me like four or
09:08 five watches to know what the heck I'm
09:09 looking at so how long did it take you
09:11 to figure out what you're looking at
09:13 I've watched us about four or five
09:15 watches and then okay so you're the
09:16 first person in the world to see this
09:18 really and exactly what happened okay
09:21 tell me what happened okay so I'm trying
09:24 to finish up the film it's nonlinear
09:26 editing we had non linear editing back
09:28 then and which is part of how they faked
09:31 the moon landing but another story and
09:32 so I'm trying to finish up the film and
09:35 I'm looking for the launch in real time
09:36 one minute to zero without edits this is
09:39 kind of dramatic whether they went to
09:40 the murder or not they did go into Earth
09:42 orbit and there was no small feat even
09:43 today so they did it in 1969 it's a
09:46 brilliant feat to get into Earth orbit
09:48 back then but that's all they did and so
09:51 we have them faking being halfway to the
09:53 moon which means they couldn't go half
09:55 way they cannot leave Earth orbit and
09:57 what a surprise
09:58 fifty years later the farthest we can go
10:01 is Earth orbit so to say they went a
10:04 thousand times farther with 50 year old
10:08 technology on the first attempt and it
10:12 can't be repeated by any nation on earth
10:14 fifty years later that's a pretty
10:16 unusual claim in fact it's the only time
10:19 in world history a milestone was made
10:20 like crossing the Atlantic in an
10:22 airplane or Columbus or the Wright
10:25 brothers or breaking the sound barrier
10:27 it's the only time in the entire history
10:29 of technology that once a Moscow has
10:32 made nobody including the people who
10:34 claim they did it could not repeat it
10:36 for more than 50 years it's the only
10:37 time that's happened and I'll tell you
10:39 the analogy I do is that if you take two
10:41 hundred thirty six thousand miles as the
10:43 average or 37 or whatever and you divide
10:45 a wall from the floor to the ceiling you
10:48 get about a centimeter for every
10:49 thousand miles and if you think about
10:51 the fact that Apollo nine we only got to
10:53 about 200 miles up we're talking about
10:56 we only got to two millimeters off the
10:58 ground on all the missions before and
11:01 then the very next thing with Apollo 10
11:03 we go all the way to the ceiling circle
11:05 around and come all the way back
11:07 that's just the magnitude of yeah and
11:09 the great thing is on this tape they say
11:12 as they're faking the shot this is the
11:15 way ten did it well what are they
11:17 talking about Apollo 10 anytime a
11:21 mission claim to orbit the earth with
11:23 people it never happened
11:24 which means Apollo 10 didn't happen I
11:26 think they did it on Apollo 8 I have to
11:28 double-check my memory but I think they
11:30 did it on 8 and 10 and then of course
11:32 they did it on the six missions and the
11:34 alleged seventh that allegedly orbited
11:36 the moon Apollo 13 and on April 13th at
11:40 13-13 military time I didn't I mean come
11:45 on have fun with sonic much you know oh
11:48 you know people were complaining after
11:51 they I'm in imagine right now imagine
11:53 mark right now we'd say we've got to
11:54 take a break they're planning a flag for
11:57 the very first time at the South Pole
11:58 right now right no mistake we watch it
12:01 of course we watch it but let's say a
12:02 year from now we're having another
12:04 interview and they're doing it a second
12:05 time are we watching it the second time
12:07 of course we're not we're continuing the
12:09 interview and that's what happened when
12:11 they went to the moon the second time
12:12 people were like great analogy we have a
12:14 lot of more missions coming here we need
12:17 some moola off of this thing I mean a
12:18 moon rover 60 million dollars I mean
12:20 that's we were parts that Jeep and out
12:24 do you have probably one of the most in
12:28 in making this documentary you have one
12:30 of the most unique positions who have
12:31 had the conversation with people coming
12:34 from a level of authority do you find
12:38 that people that actually saw it on TV
12:40 have an extra level of just impossible
12:43 resistance to get over that hump
12:45 yeah what it is mark it's kind of the
12:48 opposite of the following let's say
12:50 you're here in Chicago and I say I want
12:52 to take you to this great restaurant and
12:55 it's got the best steak and everything
12:58 so we get there and the service is great
13:00 and you're about to get the steak looks
13:03 fabulous smells good right before you
13:05 cut in it cockroach crawls across the
13:07 place wears out table I've had a choice
13:11 and I say you know this is my favorite
13:13 I've seen him before and I've seen mice
13:15 run across where it still look great
13:17 so 50 years from now what do you
13:20 remember
13:21 that wrestling you remember the great
13:22 service aren't you know you remember how
13:24 great the steak smells no you remember
13:26 the cute waitress no you remember the
13:28 cockroach and once that is burned in you
13:31 cannot unburn it and once people cried
13:34 oh my god they said remember out of the
13:37 overflowing the heart the mouth speaks
13:39 when the rocket launched my god it has
13:43 become their God because I talked to a
13:44 professor at a major university a
13:47 professor at one of the top universities
13:49 in the country and I asked him it was an
13:52 adamant we went to the moon out there
13:54 you say otherwise
13:54 people are not that wicked to fake it
13:56 hello children are being molested
13:58 genocide for your religion in the tens
14:01 of millions and someone wouldn't lie on
14:03 a test I mean come on and so he said or
14:08 I asked him if you saw one of the Apollo
14:11 astronauts tearfully confess on national
14:14 TV
14:14 he lied he's sorry what would you think
14:18 that he said I'd still think they went
14:20 oh my gosh I think he I think he went
14:22 crazy
14:23 mmm so he says he knows better than the
14:26 man who was there because he saw it on
14:28 television yeah that's pretty remarkable
14:31 isn't it
14:32 yeah and Congress passed a law after the
14:36 quiz show scandal right Time magazine
14:39 had on the cover the smartest man in
14:41 America in the late 1950s it's a major
14:43 they made a film about it
14:44 Alisha's I've seen it again so he was
14:48 the smartest man in America as long as
14:50 he got the answers in grants which is
14:52 the key to his success and when that
14:55 came out there were congressional
14:56 hearings congressional hearings Time
14:58 magazine was wrong Time magazine was
15:01 deceived
15:02 just like they put a man on the moon
15:04 they were deceived and so Congress wrote
15:07 a law television cannot be an instrument
15:10 through which to lie oh my gosh
15:13 and what did they do with Apollo 11 and
15:16 then after World War two ended to say
15:18 we're not going to be continued spying
15:19 on everybody they said propaganda is
15:22 illegal now I know they recently
15:23 reversed that like six months ago
15:26 but that wasn't reversed in 1969 was it
15:29 so not only that they use television to
15:31 lie they also were using it as
15:33 propaganda both of which are fell
15:35 so the government committed two felonies
15:38 interesting government is a felon yeah
15:41 the government isn't uncaptured at-large
15:45 felon interesting okay so that's
15:48 somebody I'm so sorry
15:50 well I'm gonna follow up with you but
15:52 I'm hearing there people at the door now
15:54 I've got to go yeah so okay mark have a
15:58 question for you real quick yeah
15:59 how many CIA agents does it take to
16:01 screw in a light bulb no idea well I
16:04 could tell you so just before your film
16:08 is company came out and I wasn't I
16:10 wasn't aware of your film coming out but
16:12 you know I think I saw it about 2006 or
16:15 7 because you were gracious enough to
16:16 share it online there was this weird
16:18 video that I saw at when I was working
16:21 Electronic Arts where an astronauts
16:23 coming down the stairs and a big light
16:25 goes slamming in front of the screen
16:28 have you ever seen this film oh yeah
16:31 that's very funny
16:32 some filmmaker made it in his garage is
16:34 that it of course
16:36 okay so think it's a fake film that some
16:38 filmmaker making his garage okay it's
16:40 like a guy at my level filmmaker and
16:44 financially up one step and it's
16:46 principal like that they have plenty of
16:48 money and they have Studios and they
16:50 would do that for fun as a joke whether
16:51 we went to the man or not it's not they
16:54 don't care then have anything to do with
16:55 about it's a joke to them it's and it's
16:58 very funny I thought it was look
16:59 beautiful but you know and but people
17:01 take it as the real thing whatever they
17:04 still didn't go to the moon I mean
17:06 that's why there's the whole flatter
17:07 thing when bill casing was on Oprah as
17:10 soon as bill casing was up he worked at
17:12 NASA for six years building the Apollo
17:14 rocket he edited memo so he saw the
17:17 whole thing that they tried to
17:18 departmentalized to keep it a secret
17:20 he saw everything he had top-secret
17:22 clearance he saw memos that said the
17:24 odds of them going and coming back alive
17:26 or one in 10,000 I mean the 747 was
17:29 built ten years after going to a moon
17:32 and millions of aircraft had already
17:33 been built and it took three years
17:36 longer to develop than the moon rocket
17:38 with ten years older I mean 10 years
17:40 newer technology and it took a hundred
17:43 and sixty attempts to get the fuselage
17:45 off the ground before the engines work
17:48 and
17:48 and and the Wright brothers 20 attempts
17:51 for the Gotham round and get the most
17:52 complicated one done with one millionth
17:54 of the computing power as a cellphone
17:56 they did it on the first occasion that's
17:58 never been done in the entire history of
18:00 aviation except the most difficult thing
18:02 ever done yeah
18:05 well the weird thing about that footage
18:07 where that light came down mmm that you
18:09 go and look it up I remember doing this
18:11 in like 2000 and they said that the
18:13 director had already died well the whole
18:17 thing the whole thing about this is if
18:19 they come up with evidence and the
18:21 evidence proves to be false and that
18:23 must mean we went to the moon that's the
18:26 whole point about this this information
18:27 the the shoes on the boot don't match
18:30 they do match they had plastic you know
18:34 coveralls been went over the flat thing
18:36 the point is that's rubber now if I take
18:40 a piece of rubber just like it I have a
18:42 pair of shoes just like that that have
18:44 spikes in them for some snow and they're
18:46 made out of that exact same type of
18:47 rubber if I put it in the oven at 250
18:49 degrees I don't think it would be
18:51 covered by the warranty I think yeah I
18:55 think I would have a pile of silly putty
18:57 with a bunch of spikes coming out of it
19:00 all in one spot you know I mean so how
19:03 could the rubber I mean why don't you
19:05 look into that how could the rubber not
19:07 melt at 250 degrees it's just silicone
19:09 rubber something yeah I know I know well
19:11 the whole thing about the SpaceX car in
19:14 space and the claims of how hot it is in
19:16 the Sun and how hot it is and the
19:17 shadows on the moon being about a 500
19:20 degree swing that car would have just
19:22 exploded in space you know because you
19:24 have the dashboard that's in the light
19:25 and the dashboard turns and it's in the
19:27 shadow and it's one big piece of plastic
19:29 that is basically back in the comb you
19:32 know according to their ridiculous
19:34 assumptions about the moon being so hot
19:37 and cold all the time but let me ask you
19:39 so you talked about being freaked out
19:41 the first time you contemplated making a
19:43 moon mission I didn't actually yeah then
19:48 there's like you actually did it and
19:49 then after you did it how is your fear
19:52 levels going up and down as well yeah
19:54 I'll tell you though sorry went off on
19:56 another tangent but basically so I pop
19:58 in the tape I'm looking for the the moon
20:00 shot all the way through you know
20:03 but they're not sending it to me they
20:05 know I need it to finish the film and
20:07 then they like send me the wrong footage
20:10 and I'm like okay I need you know the
20:12 countdown on it and they send me the
20:14 wrong footage again
20:15 yeah I said you understand Apollo 11
20:17 countdown not edited film or video they
20:20 sent me the wrong footage the third time
20:22 knowing I needed to finish the film and
20:24 then when I asked for it the fourth time
20:25 they say well you know we have a new
20:28 policy we're gonna pay for your postage
20:30 they never paid for anything you always
20:31 pay for the postage so now they're gonna
20:33 pay for my posters but it take a little
20:35 bit longer because of the red tape so I
20:39 know I know something's up I call a bill
20:41 and I'm like I think they're under us
20:42 thing know what we're doing and then
20:43 when the phone call is interrupted by
20:45 the screen
20:46 so the right before that I pop in the
20:49 tape that says do not show to the public
20:50 as a normal and hit fast forward which
20:52 is 30 times speed and I can kind of tell
20:55 when you're an editor you can learn it's
20:57 the same shot we go in around we're
20:59 going around but it's the same shot for
21:01 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes an hour
21:03 like oh this is under footage I asked
21:05 for it never got any rewind it from the
21:08 top
21:08 you hear NASA say the TV picture looks
21:12 good and then four seconds go by exactly
21:14 and then you hear on a third channel
21:16 completely different EQ crystal-clear
21:26 [Applause]
21:34 top other Neil Armstrong answers the
21:37 question if he had answered the question
21:39 right away it would mean he's really
21:41 close to the earth which is what he was
21:42 about 200 miles in orbit so they had to
21:44 count off four seconds two seconds radio
21:46 signal they're two seconds back actually
21:49 would have been much much longer
21:50 right now there's a four second delay
21:52 between Iraq and America with festival
21:55 equipment so with all that analog
21:57 equipment we're talking like 8 to 12
21:59 seconds 8 to 12 seconds delay you know
22:03 what I mean manage the amount of delay
22:05 in reality if they were really that far
22:07 and so I hear that and I'm looking at it
22:12 and I'm like what is this now what gave
22:14 it away is you don't have a ship window
22:17 and a ship like it and it's kind of
22:19 thick they're kind of like you know
22:20 waterproof or something and of course
22:22 the the windows in a spacecraft are like
22:24 that you know they're sealed and it
22:27 looked exactly the same like one of
22:28 these thick you know on a ship you know
22:31 and I'm like that's not a window no
22:33 that's not the window no and then they
22:36 turn up the lights and the cameras back
22:37 here you know they said for television
22:40 hey we have one window and the lens is
22:42 out the glasses it have to be to shoot
22:43 the timing earth far away but they're
22:46 faking it and they talk about how
22:47 they're faking it and we see that we
22:49 hear the CIA and I'm like wait a minute
22:52 let me get this straight wait a minute
22:54 I don't think of us in here they're
22:55 pretending to be halfway to the moon
22:58 that's clear it's not really halfway to
23:00 the moon
23:01 so if they're pretending to be halfway
23:03 to the moon that means they couldn't go
23:06 halfway to the moon and if they can't go
23:09 halfway to the moon it means they didn't
23:11 go to the moon they didn't go to the
23:14 moon then it's really really really
23:17 faked film and I started saying oh my
23:19 god about a hundred times in two minutes
23:21 I had a blind roommate and a toddler son
23:25 as a single parent and I'm what have I
23:28 gotten myself into I'm in deep trouble
23:29 that's what I call the bill I said don't
23:32 sleep where you slept last night they're
23:34 on to us and we hear the street it's
23:38 what I did I thought I could out with
23:40 the sea is so naive we'll get everybody
23:43 on scrambled phones that's what we need
23:45 to do okay that's the big mistake that's
23:48 that's a big flag anything on their
23:50 internet that's scramble they focus yeah
23:53 right you're totally decrypted don't pay
23:55 any attention we gotta get our phone
23:59 scrambled it's like 800 dollars a month
24:01 per flowers I'm ridiculous and that was
24:07 what got us to do Tribble now what
24:09 trouble saw you release this film and
24:12 obviously someone's paying attention
24:15 it's a beautiful film it's really
24:17 accessible to everyone so it's more of a
24:19 threat because grandma could watch it
24:20 and understand it and which is great
24:23 filmmaking at its best so what happens
24:27 afterwards does anyone say anything to
24:29 you any weird phone calls well no all
24:33 that stuff happened after we found the
24:35 footage and after the screech and the
24:36 phone okay so before you even damage
24:39 that happened before you were even done
24:41 with the film that started oh yeah long
24:43 before
24:44 okay when we it was it was a year and a
24:46 half before we finished the film that's
24:47 when we found the secret footage that's
24:49 when it's like I was wrong we do have
24:51 proof you know they'll never be a black
24:53 the president of my lifetime wrong
24:55 they'll never be proof that we didn't go
24:57 to the moon in my lifetime wrong it's in
24:59 my house I panicked oh my gosh I have
25:01 proof the moon landings are fake in my
25:03 house
25:04 what have I done whatever I got myself
25:06 into and then getting everyone on
25:09 scramble phone big mistake and then
25:11 followed and just it goes I can't even
25:14 go into detail it'll be in my book oh
25:16 come on a June of 2019 a funny thing
25:19 happened on the way you hear the back
25:20 story the CIA chases and etc etc etc
25:26 x-files beyond belief
25:29 real stuff that happened unbelievable I
25:32 mean if I told you it's just some bully
25:34 it's just he wouldn't even believe it
25:35 but I'm gonna put it in the book anyway
25:39 people can judge for themselves
25:41 okay so then I'll pull that question and
25:44 I'll say that okay so you go into this
25:46 next film so you release your first film
25:49 how many months years did it take you to
25:52 come up with the astronauts gone wild
25:54 because it is yeah an amazing
25:56 later well like a year later or
25:59 something I guess from watching TV
26:02 dramas as a kid you know will you swear
26:04 you're telling the truth so I said hey
26:07 why don't why don't we just track down
26:08 these guys at public events or set up an
26:11 interview with them
26:12 half of them we all I said was is I'm
26:15 you know a filmmaker and doing a
26:18 documentary about the moon landings it's
26:21 it's true right it's through that I was
26:24 a sucker and believe they're real but
26:26 and I used to be a sucker I was part of
26:29 suckers an optimist for many years but I
26:31 was converted and I graduated I got my
26:33 coin yeah I've been in truth now for a
26:38 few years and so it's just an incredible
26:43 experience and so I had this you know a
26:46 year goes by the films been out people
26:47 still say the window shot is not what
26:50 there's what they said is yes they're
26:52 faking the they're pretending to be
26:54 halfway to them because they're
26:55 rehearsing you see for television
26:58 transmission I said but wait a minute
27:00 you wouldn't bring all this extra
27:02 equipment at a million dollars or seven
27:05 or but in today's dollars it's 12
27:07 million dollars a minute and today's
27:09 dollars so why not just use the real
27:13 earth out the window if you're really
27:15 halfway to the moon why not rehearse
27:16 with the real earth not the window why
27:19 would you have to make a fake earth if
27:20 you really want them so they're
27:21 basically saying the footage is false
27:23 which means they didn't go to the moon
27:25 so even the detractors are admitting
27:27 really that it's fake nASA has admitted
27:30 indirectly to make a couple of times
27:31 well we'll talk about project Orion at a
27:33 second yeah that's it exactly
27:36 yeah yeah so so how because you know I
27:41 feel like we make your first film and
27:43 especially if you just said that you
27:44 were you were encountering some
27:46 surveillance and all kinds of crazy
27:47 stuff during the making of your first
27:49 film it blows my mind to this day that
27:52 you were actually able to get in and
27:54 talk to everyone and that they did that
27:56 they didn't coordinate their stories
27:58 like it was worse and totally thing I
28:00 thought about that to mark and I'm
28:02 thinking the only reason why they didn't
28:06 warn these guys it's because they don't
28:09 like them
28:11 I mean what yes of course there are
28:15 nationwide I believe if I'm correct
28:18 about 20 million government employees
28:21 and that includes federal state and
28:24 local 20 million now if 10 percent are
28:29 those are corrupt that's an army of 2
28:34 million people
28:36 if 1 percent of them are corrupt that's
28:41 an army of 200,000 individuals and the
28:48 government at federal state and local
28:49 levels who are sincerely faking the moon
28:52 landing with intention murdering people
28:55 I mean I think the Declaration of
28:56 Independence said we have the right to
28:58 life and when they murder their own
29:01 astronauts who will not comply you know
29:04 they've already broken the two felonies
29:06 right about propaganda and lying through
29:09 television now they're guilty of
29:11 homicide
29:12 you see I've spoken with the widow and
29:15 the son who's a 747 pilot of Gus Grissom
29:19 talked to them for hours together at
29:21 least eight hours all together and they
29:24 know for a fact that palawan fire was
29:26 set deliberately they know that for a
29:27 fact
29:28 and was there the end is it the switch
29:30 that was replaced that they think well I
29:33 don't want to go into it because I
29:35 thought the son had recently come out
29:36 and said that he had tracked down a
29:38 switch that replaced the day before and
29:40 it might have in the spark or whatever
29:41 but anyway doesn't really matter well
29:42 yeah they did have there's all sorts of
29:44 I got the Apollo one accident reports
29:46 like this thick red there's there was a
29:50 dip in electrical power right before the
29:52 fire which means something was clamped
29:54 into it that wasn't supposed to be
29:55 sucking power off of it then they were
29:58 buckled in when they removed the corpses
30:01 so if you saw a fire you went unbuckle
30:04 yourself so they say we're dead before
30:07 the fire they were cyanide gas found
30:10 they had cyanide capsules that would
30:12 drop in or something like that like a
30:14 gas cheaper they gassed them then there
30:16 was the fire to destroy the forensic
30:19 evidence of the cyanide because maybe
30:21 they could get out of time maybe who
30:23 knows whether they would or they
30:24 get out and they wanted to he wouldn't
30:27 cooperate he said the thing was a lemon
30:29 on national I know I know and they said
30:31 that he had shown I always see this
30:34 hangar with the lemon through it like he
30:36 someone had hung that up and I there's a
30:38 CG one out there someone I should meet
30:39 in a computer but I was trying to find a
30:42 real photograph of that and I couldn't
30:43 find it but well that's based on the
30:47 account of people who were there at this
30:48 son told me that I mean their son told
30:51 me the story he won there but he heard
30:52 two other ask not you know or his
30:55 friends so okay so you've done this
30:59 these two incredible films there's and
31:02 then you wake us all up so this whole
31:04 other generation literally what you
31:06 tried to do you accomplished it tenfold
31:08 in my opinion now there's a there's
31:10 obviously some distant feel videos but
31:12 there's some great videos out there
31:13 where people are looking at different
31:15 things it also grabs the footage that
31:18 has been out there before you made your
31:20 films and gives it a platform to be seen
31:22 and the one thing I was going to ask you
31:24 about is the I think it's an astronaut's
31:26 nephew went into a museum and got
31:29 preferential treatment and he brought a
31:31 measuring tape with him and he started
31:33 to measure the holes of the Apollo
31:35 capsule and finding out that you know
31:37 inflated they couldn't get in and out of
31:38 the doors because they're bigger than
31:40 the doors I started doing a analysis on
31:44 boosters and the the lunar module and
31:48 the boosters you know mechanics would be
31:50 way up inside the actual living
31:53 compartment that kind of stuff is there
31:54 anything you've seen since you've made
31:56 your films that you went wow that's
31:58 amazing and you hadn't thought of it
32:00 before or seen it before well I mean
32:03 there's really more proof they did not
32:05 go and prove that they did first they're
32:07 simply the logic that if they could go
32:10 to the moon on the first attempt of
32:11 1960s equipment people would have been
32:13 on March 25 years ago we'd be driving
32:16 there for lunch well probably be Church
32:20 travel to the moon at least if it were
32:23 that easy back then and but you know
32:26 obviously they did and they can't do
32:28 today they launched a riot project it
32:30 goes up into the radiation belts which
32:33 is why they couldn't leave Earth orbit
32:34 plus it didn't have enough fuel in any
32:36 case they say the
32:38 is lethal they say the technology to
32:41 protect astronauts going through it has
32:43 yet to be infinite so then what then how
32:47 did they go through it to the moon you
32:48 know it's unbelievable they're just
32:51 admitted they didn't go to the moon and
32:53 then when I asked to talk to the guy
32:54 they forbid it and then when I asked for
32:56 the Geiger counter readings they had two
32:58 geiger counters I'm Sol pointed the
33:00 mission is to measure the radiation I
33:02 said hey you know how much taxpayer this
33:04 is a taxpayer-funded project I have a
33:06 right to that information
33:08 give me the Geiger counter rings I said
33:09 I'm sorry mr. Sabri that informations
33:11 classified and I said wait a minute
33:13 when you send probes to the Sun it's the
33:16 temperature of the Sun classified when
33:18 you send probes to Jupiter is the amount
33:20 of helium and Jupiter's atmosphere is
33:22 that classified No then why would the
33:25 amount of radiation a part of nature be
33:27 classified the only reason is if they
33:29 showed that it was lethal it would prove
33:31 they never went to the moon therefore
33:33 they can't release that information I
33:34 mean it's unbelievable do you ever look
33:37 at the the whole ISS conspiracy that
33:41 it's not really there I mean if you and
33:44 I both believe they can get to low orbit
33:45 you know this thing doesn't have any
33:47 construction video they always seem to
33:49 film it from mysterious cameras outside
33:51 of it there does you know this this idea
33:53 of it's underwater and the particles
33:55 going in front it looks like China tried
33:58 to do some weird stuff where like
33:59 particles are going against the mask and
34:01 do you do you spend any time looking at
34:05 that sort of thing the Mars rovers or do
34:08 you just like hey I'm good I'm good you
34:13 know the can orbit the Earth they prove
34:14 that in the Apollo missions merocrine
34:16 Gemini missions they did orbit is
34:18 extremely difficult to fake zero gravity
34:20 especially in 1969 so the the tunas can
34:24 spinning around and the toothbrush going
34:27 by that is definitely zero gravity no
34:29 question about it which means they were
34:31 in Earth orbit and that way they could
34:33 launch in front of people
34:34 right they could come down in front of
34:36 people you would do as much of it real
34:38 as you could maybe you could land that
34:40 you couldn't get out and walk then you
34:42 would land if you could orbit the moon
34:44 but not land you know orbit the moon to
34:46 get that but they cannot leave Earth
34:48 orbit which means that's it
34:50 that's all we can do there's not
34:52 the fuel for one von braun's had yet to
34:53 ferry it up to a space station first
34:56 space station wasn't finished until a
34:59 couple of years ago now whether they're
35:00 thinking part of the Mars mission or
35:02 part of Earth orbit that could be they
35:05 they I would say there's probably at
35:07 least three space stations up there and
35:08 why does it take two days or four days
35:10 to go 200 miles up I just don't
35:13 understand this and then the Soviets
35:15 somehow do it in one quarter of the time
35:17 and they said oh yeah they got a better
35:19 math formula than we do so there is like
35:23 in you know I mean I'm very into visual
35:28 effects here in Hollywood and there are
35:30 definitely shots where they're using
35:32 harnesses and someone grabs the guy's
35:34 harness next to him to stop him from
35:36 flopping around and you can see pulls on
35:39 wire that's not on film maybe the space
35:41 station maybe it left Earth orbit maybe
35:44 they did ferry enough fuel maybe they
35:47 maybe they do have the capability of
35:50 gradually pushing through the poles or
35:52 somewhere where there's no radiation
35:54 maybe they're on a mission to save the
35:56 Earth from a comet or asteroid therefore
35:59 if they told us what they were really
36:01 doing with that space station
36:03 everyone would panic and stocks are drop
36:05 and grocery stores would be empty so
36:07 what they've done is is they have a mock
36:09 one for the one that's off on some
36:11 secret mission that Armageddon yeah yeah
36:14 well all that stuff is a lot of truth
36:17 than that you know meteors have happened
36:20 it's only a matter of time or solar
36:22 flare I mean we missed the lethal solar
36:24 flare a few years ago by just like being
36:26 behind where it appeared in Earth orbit
36:28 by six weeks or something and we would
36:31 be talking now we both probably be dead
36:32 but yeah from lack of water you know it
36:36 almost happened and it could happen
36:38 again and well my thing with that is
36:41 that I I did a show on NASA selling doom
36:43 which is sort of how they keep
36:45 themselves important you know like you
36:46 need us to get rid of meteorites and
36:48 also their stuff I did this episode
36:50 called do craters exist and I've been to
36:53 the Arizona crater six times in my
36:55 lifetime but then I went to Diamond Head
36:56 and Hawaii and I was like wait a minute
36:59 these things look exactly the same and
37:01 then it started dawning on me that every
37:04 single crater everywhere
37:05 pretty much perfectly circular which if
37:08 you've seen us you know anyone throw a
37:10 rock into a beach or whatever on the
37:12 sand it never happens like that you know
37:14 it comes in at a slightly different
37:16 trajectory than exactly straight down to
37:18 create this perfect round circle but if
37:20 you look at the moon every single crater
37:22 is perfectly round if you take Diamond
37:24 Head and the crater in Arizona put them
37:27 close to each other they're identical in
37:29 composition and so it seems to me like
37:32 maybe this moon was boiling at some
37:35 point and just that's what all that
37:37 stuff is we see the craters that glow in
37:39 the center which could be the it's old
37:41 connection to it's volcanic roots but I
37:44 didn't know if you'd ever contemplated
37:47 that because there's some things we're
37:48 looking at we're told that's what they
37:50 are and we don't think twice so we just
37:53 go oh yeah sure every single crater
37:55 everywhere is perfectly round there's
37:56 never that Superman
37:58 you know ship coming in from was it
38:01 Krypton hitting and creating a nice
38:04 slide that's like there's none of those
38:05 craters anywhere on the moon you think
38:07 after a hundred thousand to a million
38:09 craters b-12 came in at a weird
38:11 trajectory and so I don't know if you
38:15 never heard that theory before no
38:19 there's only so many hours in the day
38:21 yeah and if this if these criminals who
38:25 faked the moon landing but saved it JFK
38:28 9/11 gulf of tonkin let's say they're
38:31 all the same group of people they are at
38:34 large so if we want to survive and
38:37 morally and politically I mean kind of
38:40 constitutionally moreover then that
38:44 needs to be addressed and it's a little
38:45 more important than weather craters are
38:47 offense triangular or whatever you know
38:51 what I mean this whole thing you know
38:53 build casings on Oprah and so they
38:55 immediately say oh and you think the
38:56 earth is flat and then we've got 30
38:58 years go by my film comes out and you
39:00 also think the earth is flat
39:01 obviously the earth is round things form
39:03 bubbles underwater
39:05 gravity's the same way it's like water
39:08 around a bubble it puts everything into
39:10 a sphere
39:11 same thing with bubbles from scuba diver
39:14 bubbles in the air gravity Dark Matter
39:16 presses against objects that forms them
39:19 into a sphere that's just what happens I
39:21 don't know I think it's some big joke
39:23 that Jesuit priest or something or
39:25 laughing he used to be killed for saying
39:28 it was around so why would they now
39:30 reverse their thing and kill you for
39:33 some you know so they wanted you to
39:36 believe it was flat which was a lie so
39:39 now they're just trying to distract
39:41 people they're saying you must be that
39:42 crazy and what they're really saying is
39:44 you're crazy if you believe the truth
39:46 because they did fake them in Atlanta
39:48 it's a hundred percent fact we have
39:50 proof of them faking a shot on camera
39:52 and the CIA telling them how to do it if
39:54 that doesn't convince you and the
39:55 shadows intersecting and the floating
39:57 around be in slow motion that we can
39:59 prove right for any I mean I don't know
40:00 what to say of them von Braun saying you
40:03 needed to ferry fuel to Space Station
40:05 first and the radiation hit the Van Alen
40:08 same from the 50s it's 10 to 100 times
40:11 the lethal dose he put it in writing
40:13 1957 in Scientific American magazine
40:15 that's included just link this article
40:17 mark at the end of the video to the
40:20 salute Journal article that has the
40:21 film's in it all the information there's
40:24 so much more evidence that they didn't
40:25 go I mean again if they could go on the
40:28 first attempt with 1969 equipment then
40:31 there would be bases there by now people
40:34 are going on marks 25 years ago it's
40:36 illogical
40:37 that's like saying they broke the sound
40:38 barrier in 1947 but 50 years later no
40:41 one can do it give me a break yeah well
40:44 the project Orion I think is one of the
40:46 linchpins for me is the ridicule the
40:48 ridicule that we're all crazy that this
40:50 you know this Van Allen belt barrier
40:52 among other technical difficulties it
40:55 doesn't exist
40:56 astronauts going well it must not have
40:58 been a little we flew right through it
40:59 and then I'll send you green light a
41:01 project then you cancel it the second
41:03 thing all of us on the internet went hey
41:06 there it is right there
41:07 we didn't go Project Orion and someone
41:09 else is going who the hell told someone
41:11 that we got this project you're right
41:12 you know and so that for me is a huge
41:15 validation of the whole thing so just to
41:18 recap your offerings because I want I
41:20 want to put all the links in this video
41:22 you have two primary films right is
41:25 there a third film I've missed well no
41:27 not really I mean you can just link this
41:29 article or just links a brow my last
41:31 name si B
41:32 Arielle calm that has all the links in
41:35 there and you can see for yourself I
41:38 mean the fact is they did fake the moon
41:39 landing
41:40 the fact is Oswald did not kill Kennedy
41:42 and the fact is you know the buildings
41:45 at least building 7 was collapsed by
41:47 explosives and that takes like two days
41:49 the wire I mean I mean imagine there
41:53 were 2,000 aerospace people who said we
41:54 didn't care to the moon that'd be
41:56 incredible evidence we don't even have
41:57 that and we still didn't go to the moon
41:59 so they have that it's like you no one
42:02 does anything about it I just don't
42:03 understand this they say you know they
42:06 lost 4 billion dollars in cash like 15
42:09 years ago
42:10 remember that and it never makes the
42:11 news except on Comedy Central Comedy
42:14 Central
42:14 what about day 444 of the missing for
42:17 Nia's describe the said she and it's a
42:24 side note so you're working on a book do
42:27 you uh yeah I know how books work you
42:30 can't really you shouldn't really tell
42:31 us your name yet but you think in
42:33 mid-summer no it's called the funny
42:35 thing happened on the way to the moon
42:36 it's just that it's just the back story
42:38 of making of the film my adventures and
42:41 trials and tribulations making it and
42:43 why they didn't go and links to the
42:45 films and leaks to the evidence and why
42:47 if you're really a true patriot you need
42:49 to the government needs to tell the
42:51 truth about it otherwise the corruptions
42:53 just going to mold the rest of the
42:55 infrastructure morally and ethically and
42:57 ethically and everything I mean we
42:59 they're given Congressional Medal of
43:01 Honor the people who lied for lying what
43:05 did they do go to the moon what did they
43:07 not do go to the moon so they lied
43:09 they're giving their Congressional Medal
43:11 of Honor for a lying that is our country
43:15 these are the heroes and I get punched
43:18 in the face for telling the truth other
43:21 man looked like does anyone care this is
43:24 the state of things and so do something
43:26 about it I swear to God you ever met it
43:28 looked like you almost had buzz
43:30 confessing in that room like he was just
43:33 a hair he didn't fess you did confess he
43:36 said we're just passengers we were only
43:38 passengers and he was allegedly the
43:40 pilot he said and you're doing this to
43:42 become famous well how could it become
43:44 famous if I'm wrong he said oh and this
43:46 makes you
43:47 misperceived forever he thought at the
43:49 news at Brook we had to professional
43:50 cameras there right he thought that
43:53 story had broken worldwide for about
43:54 three minutes during this is the
43:57 separate interview of the punch was
43:58 later and he said oh and this makes you
44:01 famous for is that saying I'm right yeah
44:03 and he said I was only a passenger
44:05 that's saying I'm right and then when he
44:07 figured that out
44:07 he said if you show this to anybody of
44:09 me confessing directly I'll see you Oh
44:12 Mike come on sue please the court have
44:15 you swear under oath and show the window
44:17 shot and see what people think you know
44:19 have film a panel of filmmakers
44:20 testifying it's fake how Kelly Smith
44:24 come forward up to subpoena him right
44:26 and let's see what happens
44:29 I assume the answer the question is no
44:30 but did you cut anything from when you
44:32 either one of your films that later on
44:33 you were like you know that was actually
44:36 really other than other than there's a
44:39 at the very end of astronauts gone wild
44:41 we have a shortened version of me being
44:44 chased by the CIA account of mock comedy
44:46 film and there's a great there's a
44:48 Director's Cut version on my website
44:50 under sir brows moon landing films about
44:52 six or seven down called the kitchen
44:55 facts so you know directors cuts like a
44:57 six minute version that was the only
44:59 dispute with the exact he liked and it
45:01 was a good jump to the punchline at it
45:04 it's a pretty good editor he's got a
45:05 good eye but I kinda like the dialogue
45:07 and everything so you should go and
45:10 watch the full version of getting waxed
45:14 by the CIA on that note I'm gonna say
45:17 we're gonna put all the links down below
45:18 that way that nothing dates on-screen
45:21 you know I would recommend everyone to
45:23 get a copy of everything that that Bart
