00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen today we're gonna take a stab
00:41 at SpaceX you know me I usually stay
00:46 back from like super current affairs
00:48 because then you know the episodes
00:50 expire and their usefulness then what
00:52 you do it I probably have at least five
00:54 episodes that are retired due to that
00:58 sort of nature that I was smart enough
01:01 to make special reports this one's gonna
01:05 be sort of centered around the recent
01:07 news that SpaceX put a old roadster in
01:10 space headed towards Mars that are
01:12 supposed to be you know orbiting for
01:14 billions of years there's so much
01:18 [ __ ] around this particular event
01:22 it's it's hard to really shovel it
01:25 through your brain but let's start at
01:28 the beginning shall we so Elon Musk is
01:31 this sort of you know supposed
01:34 intellectual muscle man who he ended up
01:39 creating some company called zip2 then
01:42 he created this other e-commerce company
01:45 that was acquired by another company for
01:48 350 million dollars and of course you
01:50 don't get all the money that's the silly
01:52 part your partners get the money your
01:55 employees get some of it and then that
01:58 was sold off as PayPal at a later date
02:03 for 1.5 billion and so I'm sure he
02:07 rolled up some of his money into stock
02:09 options and sure he made a bunch of
02:10 money but I would be
02:13 I would love to see the paper trail
02:16 where all these other companies that
02:17 participated in and the other companies
02:20 that were doing the acquisitions right
02:21 when you would get acquired you lose you
02:24 really do that means you were unable to
02:26 keep the company going unable to keep it
02:29 growing so when you're getting acquired
02:31 that means you have reached the apex of
02:33 what you can do with the company because
02:34 otherwise you would stick with it and
02:37 sail past your competition it's not a
02:40 bad thing it's just a reality right
02:42 someone beats got bought by Apple beats
02:44 was at the end of their game and so this
02:46 is why I don't understand at least a
02:50 face value why companies get purchased
02:52 for these gigantic sums of money because
02:54 they would take a hell of a lot less and
02:57 this was a bit of a bidding war but even
02:59 bidding wars should be sort of kept
03:03 under control because it sets a
03:05 precedence right when oculus gets
03:07 purchased for what two and a half
03:08 billion dollars use a teeny tiny company
03:11 they would have taken half a billion
03:13 right
03:14 but when idiots do that you know it
03:16 happens and just so you guys know when
03:18 companies get acquired a lot of times
03:20 there's a wink-wink nudge-nudge thing
03:21 going on the background where they're
03:22 trying to launder a bunch of money so
03:24 trying to shove money into people's
03:25 pockets for payoffs and stuff so not
03:28 every acquisition is legitimate some
03:30 acquisitions are just simply like when
03:32 we need to get you a billion dollars for
03:34 this black-op okay well what we're gonna
03:36 do is you're gonna buy a bunch of shares
03:37 here we're gonna move this around there
03:39 would be this little fake acquisition
03:40 and you'll get your money okay that
03:44 happens too but somehow after this I
03:47 think it was a 1999 acquisition of
03:50 PayPal for the 1.5 billion which in 1999
03:54 was horrendously large and you know that
03:58 actually makes sense to me PayPal is a
03:59 wonderful service was one of the first
04:01 secure online payment services they're
04:04 very innovative in their designs but
04:06 that's not Ellen MUSC story behind him
04:10 is that he taught himself how to code at
04:12 12
04:12 whoopty-doo same here and he eventually
04:16 studied physics for a little while
04:18 studied computer programming he got his
04:21 master's in something goes to Stanford
04:24 to get his ph.d and quits within a month
04:26 and all of a sudden he pops out with
04:29 this um tremendous amount of money and
04:33 he founds SpaceX in 2002 with this goal
04:38 of you know reducing the cost of
04:41 supplying you know Space Research or
04:45 something like that you know the space
04:46 station resupply and going to other
04:48 planets and all this other stuff now I
04:52 have complete faith that people can
04:54 teach themselves things that they want
04:57 to know without getting degrees I'm one
05:01 of those people what's interesting about
05:05 him is that you know I've never seen him
05:07 do a lecture on technology now I know
05:11 some of you think you have but sitting
05:13 around going oh my god beneficent
05:16 intelligence is gonna be like so
05:17 terrifying the things I've seen that's
05:19 not a lecture on technology that's just
05:21 pontificating about the blatantly
05:24 obvious a lecture on technology is to
05:27 say well when I was doing this research
05:29 and I attempted to make a booster come
05:32 back down and land on the ground these
05:34 were the elements and the conditions and
05:37 the obstacles that we had to get over
05:39 and this is how I did it this is how I
05:42 patented it I've never heard him discuss
05:46 things but supposedly he is the founder
05:48 and who does he he's labeled as the
05:52 chief designer okay I would love to see
05:57 his aerospace research personally is
06:01 literally as astrophysics background you
06:04 know I don't give a crap about a degree
06:05 just just show me show me your
06:07 brilliance in fact if you don't have a
06:08 degree and you taught it to yourself
06:09 then that's even more impressive you
06:12 know I have no problem never slight the
06:14 guy for anything so he'd be an
06:15 interesting guy to meet I like to sit
06:17 down with Zuckerberg and talk about
06:19 programming oh you gotta be real
06:20 interesting but what have we seen three
06:23 SpaceX specs X has had these amazing
06:28 successes where NASA was unable to
06:32 succeed for 40 to 50 years of just in
06:36 fact NASA has never succeeded were
06:38 SpaceX has
06:40 which is to to send up a booster rocket
06:43 with enough ancillary fuel to fall back
06:46 down fire a retro rocket it's not really
06:50 a retro rocker but a rocket engine to
06:52 land it back down on the ground to be
06:55 reused which for me is just it's just
07:00 such a parlor game of ridiculous
07:03 mathematics and financial nonsense
07:06 these tubes aren't expensive to build
07:10 once you run an engine like that the
07:13 stresses of the launch the stresses of
07:15 the land completely tear them apart so
07:18 the idea that you can just wash it off
07:20 at a car wash and put new fuel in it and
07:23 use it over and over again that doesn't
07:26 work like that
07:27 so it's it's it's an interesting first
07:31 attempt if they're actually truly
07:33 getting it done but just to give you an
07:35 example go talk to anyone who's been in
07:38 racing when I used to work for Jim Hall
07:39 junior racing the smallest engine needs
07:45 to be rebuilt after it is used in a race
07:48 because when you have Pistons going up
07:51 and down in a normal combustion engine
07:53 of any kind a lot things are hybrid now
07:57 so it's a little bit easier but any
07:58 moving equipment that you move at those
08:01 unbelievable rates it tears apart the
08:05 steel we used to have to bore an Dario
08:09 ring and upgrade the piston size on
08:12 engines after every single race because
08:16 we ripped the crap out of them and
08:17 weren't doing much right so think about
08:23 a booster
08:25 that has the unbelievable stress of not
08:29 only just sitting there holding up the
08:31 cargo because you realize these tubes
08:33 are the devices that hold up the cargo
08:36 there is no other building that's in
08:38 there that it's attached to you have you
08:41 know a central booster and two side
08:42 boosters and especially on the heavy
08:45 Falcon and it does its thing so think
08:48 about the telescoping and wrinkling of
08:50 the metal as it is pushing up an object
08:53 at over 11 miles per second do you mean
08:57 to tell me you you can keep reusing that
08:59 how many times could you reuse it twice
09:02 how much money you saving just build
09:06 another one okay if anything go out and
09:08 get him out of the ocean and recycle
09:10 them melt them back down and build the
09:12 new tube with as much mechanical devices
09:16 and robot arms that we have we could we
09:21 can really automate a tremendous amount
09:23 of the construction focus on that so
09:27 here's the thing when I first got into
09:30 this this recent launch of the Roadster
09:34 the footage the quote-unquote candid
09:37 footage of these boosters landing was
09:40 not released yet we sat on YouTube for a
09:42 day and just looked and looked and
09:44 looked and everything we were seeing
09:45 look like the staged footage that looks
09:49 like the crane dropping down the booster
09:52 which I think they have used that
09:53 technique then they have probably at
09:57 least three separate angles now of a
09:59 candid footage of this thing these two
10:02 little dots falling out sky there oddly
10:06 mismatched in terms of their audio
10:09 tracks and one of the shots the the
10:12 particle cloud that comes up from the
10:14 landing appears to be much higher in one
10:16 of the shots and much these other two
10:19 shots seem to be congruent with each
10:20 other very strange and I'm just you know
10:24 riffing on what I saw one of the best
10:28 shots you hear this boom boom which the
10:31 guy filming so that was a sonic boom I
10:33 don't think it's a sonic boom I think
10:35 you're hearing the engines simply turn
10:37 on if they are truly doing what they're
10:38 doing
10:39 but the weird thing is is there's a
10:42 separate shot of this whole thing where
10:44 these two retrorockets are coming down
10:46 and you don't hear the boom boom and
10:49 he's filming it the same same length
10:52 right so I don't know how that's
10:55 possible
10:55 I'm pretty sure if you all went to see
10:58 the old space shuttle takeoff whatever
11:00 is happening on an audio level you'd all
11:02 here especially when it comes in for
11:03 landing and it truly does pop the sound
11:07 barrier which is a double boom I'm not
11:12 quite sure why there's two booms but
11:13 whatever so here in Los Angeles is very
11:16 interesting because we have a lot of
11:18 people that are in special effects I've
11:20 got a lot of contacts in that I got a
11:22 best friend in it with Emmys and I've
11:25 dabbled in it enough that I'm pretty
11:26 dangerous in it and just so that you
11:31 know the history of my own awakening
11:33 with this I really didn't know that
11:35 SpaceX was created until 2009 right I
11:40 had him as a customer of a product I was
11:44 developing for a buddy of mine very
11:46 funny so it was my friends from the
11:52 special effects industry that brought it
11:54 to my attention that they thought that a
11:55 lot of the footage of the original test
11:57 flights were fake so I didn't come in
12:02 you know oh my god this is fake and I
12:03 gotta be a martyr and throw myself on
12:07 the and the sphere of truth to get this
12:11 information out not at all but the first
12:14 launches actually ended up looking
12:16 pretty faked on some levels especially
12:19 with the particle systems that that
12:23 seemed to have generated the fire clouds
12:25 underneath the Rockets and there's just
12:29 something about reality that I want to
12:31 remind you of which is you may not be a
12:34 computer-generated expert mean you know
12:36 modeling this stuff in a computer but
12:38 you know what reality looks like and
12:41 your subconscious will be looking at
12:43 something and it won't be right and you
12:46 won't know exactly why it's not right
12:47 but you know and this is what happens
12:51 when
12:52 you just have the most basic knowledge
12:54 now when you have more advanced
12:55 knowledge these guys will say that's
12:58 this plugin
12:59 in Maya doing this thing you know when
13:03 people see that Mars footage that NASA
13:05 is supposedly turning in they're just
13:07 look at me and go that's Terrigen men
13:10 that's exactly it urgent and they'll
13:12 point out flaws and the Terrigen
13:13 generation you know you know if I find
13:17 hard to believe that they're using
13:18 Terrigen but whatever now for those of
13:21 you who monitored the very first fake
13:23 footage of Kim Jong Un's rocket program
13:27 it's extremely silly and ridiculous
13:30 looking but no one in North Korea has
13:32 ever double clicked Maya
13:34 Lightwave blender 3d cinema 4d they just
13:39 have it probably not no one but almost
13:41 no one there's actually a fairly high
13:44 chance that no one ever has except those
13:47 working for the organization and so when
13:51 you would see these goofy cartoon models
13:53 take off with these perfect circular
13:55 clouds of you know thrust and stuff it
13:58 was a joke and you just know right off
14:00 the bat you don't know how it's done
14:01 what product they use but you can tell
14:03 right then they started to get clever in
14:06 their second round where they had
14:08 actually taken out a camera and they
14:10 shoot what we call the plate so say you
14:12 want to put a fake space station or a
14:16 launch pad in a particular desert you
14:18 have the desert but you don't have the
14:19 launch pad because it's gonna take a lot
14:20 of time and money to build these things
14:22 you go take a camera you put it on
14:24 tripod and you shoot the desert that's
14:26 your plate that's your background then
14:29 you bring that into the 3d software and
14:31 it's just a movie playing in the
14:32 background then you start modeling your
14:35 launch pad you can look out in the
14:37 internet and buy one you could copy one
14:39 that's on a blueprint just make it look
14:41 convincing and then you light it inside
14:44 the 3d product to match the lighting of
14:46 the plate shot and this is where we do
14:48 what we call composite work you're
14:51 compositing these two layers together
14:54 what happened with the second round from
14:56 kim jeong-hoon was that the the tripod
15:01 that was filming the plate was moving
15:04 just a little bit and it looks like they
15:07 were silly enough to zoom up on a
15:10 particular location which is how you
15:11 would probably shoot a rocket right so
15:14 they zoomed up and once you zoom up the
15:16 slightest tremble of a footstep of a
15:19 piece of a little gust of wind let's
15:21 just put that way we'll shake the camera
15:23 and you would have to then do what's
15:26 called tracking during your composite
15:27 and say look this little pixel right
15:30 here this tip of the mountain is what
15:34 you need to track to any time this leaps
15:37 left-right up-down you need to take the
15:40 all the other layers and shake them as
15:43 well according to the movement of these
15:46 pixels up here and that's what we call
15:49 tracking so that wasn't done well in Kim
15:52 jong-un's second tier now they've
15:54 actually purchased some old farty
15:56 rockets and you see them really launch
15:58 rockets okay but you can just look at
16:00 him and tell you know it was probably
16:05 built about the time the 57 Chevy Chevy
16:07 was rolling off the assembly floor right
16:10 so fast forward or rewind to the SpaceX
16:15 launches now it's safe to say that they
16:18 have found some some very tried-and-true
16:22 blueprints of rocket systems of engines
16:25 what have you and they merely reverse
16:29 engineered or upgraded the designs of
16:32 their stuff to just simply create a
16:33 rocket that launches right and they've
16:35 had plenty of mishaps as well right
16:37 extremely expensive stuff people one of
16:39 these things falls over let's just say
16:41 that you know I must got a billion
16:42 dollars in the bank let's say really
16:44 walked away with that kind of money
16:45 okay what you didn't guarantee you you
16:50 got a I don't know 300 million to 750
16:55 million dollar rocket just fallen over
16:56 and exploding you're gonna go through
16:59 daddy's money really really fast so the
17:01 idea that this guy has always had
17:02 investors and subsidies to create this
17:04 thing is what would have to be the case
17:09 to do this right
17:11 when you think about technology like
17:13 Rockets I want you to think about the
17:15 black box and it's something that we use
17:18 as a term that we use in all technology
17:20 which is a black box is that you put
17:23 things in and stuff comes out and you
17:26 don't have to know exactly how what's
17:29 going on inside the box actually happens
17:31 it's just if it's a certified black box
17:34 that means it always works it's been
17:36 tested and stressed and all this kind of
17:38 stuff so if you had a taffy machine in a
17:42 black box you just simply put your sugar
17:44 in there your flour or whatever you got
17:46 to do your coloring and boom taffy comes
17:48 out the bottom you don't need to know so
17:51 rocket systems robotic systems computer
17:55 systems they are all black box systems
17:57 when you look at a chip on a motherboard
17:59 that is a little black box you have some
18:02 data feeds in and some data feeds out
18:04 and you have manuals to tell you what
18:07 you can do to maybe change it from
18:10 purple to red you know so in my opinion
18:14 I think I'm seeing some pretty
18:16 tried-and-true rocket systems developed
18:19 I think by the French the first time I
18:22 saw a SpaceX launch I thought I was
18:24 looking at a French rocket as one of our
18:27 listeners Paulie pointed out they have
18:29 reengineered a bunch of how they do what
18:32 they do so it is not the same technology
18:34 but there is a sense of the aerodynamics
18:37 like the hardest thing that NASA had to
18:39 figure out in the 60s was just getting
18:41 the thing to go up and not explode to
18:44 not flip out of control
18:45 to go into orbit a bunch of that just
18:48 simply has to do with the cylindrical
18:50 design the placement of the engines the
18:52 methodology that the engines most user
18:54 can use in order to create stability at
18:58 the bottom how to hang on to the rocket
19:00 with big clamps until it reaches a
19:02 certain level of you know hundreds of
19:05 thousands of pounds per square inch and
19:07 then you release the clamps and boom it
19:08 takes off right so all that was
19:11 pioneered a long time ago and we see you
19:14 come in you get to stand on the
19:15 shoulders of giants which is great
19:16 nothing wrong with that at all right I
19:19 saw the videos of the Falcon Heavy
19:22 taking off
19:23 if it is CG it is brilliantly done I
19:26 think it really exists I think it really
19:28 takes off and I think it's just
19:29 tried-and-true old technology that's
19:31 been heavily upgraded right I shouldn't
19:34 really say old but sort of some reliable
19:38 ideas being upgraded so good for them
19:41 right it being in the private sector is
19:44 great because the more that that goes
19:47 into the private sector and there could
19:48 be a bidding war we would get the 60
19:50 million dollars a day monkey off our
19:53 back called NASA as you said several
19:56 times in this show NASA's liability for
19:58 lies is so unbelievably steep and the
20:01 Internet has absolutely destroyed them
20:05 that there come a day when people are
20:09 indicted they go to jail and the only
20:12 way that these folks at the top that are
20:15 lying to their employees now below will
20:16 stay out of jail be one of two things to
20:20 die or to turn everybody in it's a bunch
20:25 of national pride isn't it right anybody
20:28 who defends the moon mission like I say
20:30 you're defending your patriotic pride
20:31 and that we accomplished it if you're
20:34 not an American and you still believe in
20:35 it's because you simply have told
20:38 yourself that either your country
20:39 contributed to the saturn v system the
20:41 apollo missions or you just simply
20:43 recognize the fact that this is mankind
20:45 mankind created this thing and i'm a man
20:48 and a tad edit i don't get all pissed at
20:51 me feminists because that's you to
20:54 justin trudeau can go suck a person so
20:58 for those of you who follow nasa very
21:00 closely and some of their ancillary
21:01 programs you'll know one thing about
21:03 nasa that is that they have had not a
21:06 tremendous amount of money but more than
21:09 SpaceX has ever spent dedicated to a
21:14 mechanism to take off straight up in the
21:17 air and land back down on the ground and
21:19 they've created this really there's a
21:21 little several versions of this sort of
21:22 cone based sort of you know nice round
21:26 tipped
21:27 little rocket ship that didn't have
21:30 anything underneath it that just simply
21:31 went in the air and landed back down and
21:33 I think even in this century they
21:36 utterly and completely failed to do this
21:38 it still landed and tipped over I mean
21:41 it is it has been the bane of their
21:43 existence to create this technology that
21:45 seemingly SpaceX nails on the first try
21:47 and anytime you have that kind of it
21:50 seems too good to be true
21:51 ask your elders it usually is right and
21:57 it's not that Eli Moss didn't have our
21:59 sorry should say SpaceX didn't have
22:00 their flubs but suddenly they were
22:03 making it work
22:04 what should maybe they did but let's
22:07 take the first you know like half a
22:10 dozen launches and re landing you know
22:14 of this booster rocket thing that ever
22:16 was aired on the Internet via the
22:19 YouTube channels right there was this
22:21 massive anomaly that kept plaguing
22:25 SpaceX right where as soon as this
22:28 booster is about to touch on the ground
22:30 they lose the camera feed and then all
22:34 the sudden boom it's on the ground it's
22:35 all good and the smokes coming out of
22:36 the bottom and in this absolutely
22:40 nauseating nauseating fake audience of
22:44 people yelling and screaming like though
22:47 this launch recently was just you just
22:50 want to throw up in your mouth how bad
22:52 it was right I think our listener Joe
22:55 said that that's what happened to him
22:56 yeah it was horrible you're just sitting
22:59 there going this is fake you know you're
23:01 all the all of the goosebumps on your
23:04 body and the hairs on the back your neck
23:05 that they lived for truth just just blew
23:09 just exude this sort of feral nature to
23:13 rip these [ __ ] apart because they're
23:15 lying to our face and 2018 so let's
23:19 rewind that kind of situation here you
23:22 have NASA for 50 years trying to land a
23:25 thing backwards
23:26 boom up down up down fail fail fail fail
23:28 fail the failure rate was so bad that
23:31 the majority of the attempts were never
23:34 aired to the public because it's where
23:37 the public can point and go what am i
23:39 spending my money for why the hell are
23:41 we doing this why do we even care if the
23:43 damn thing comes down and lands built
23:45 another one who cares right so in one
23:48 sense of it
23:49 they're able to just just unbelievably
23:52 succeed where NASA wasn't able to
23:55 succeed but they couldn't get a camera
23:58 to stay on no matter where this thing
24:01 land landed right where they landed it
24:03 on land whether they landed in the sea
24:05 which is a big joke camera never stayed
24:07 on okay all right so why would they need
24:13 to cut the camera right before it lands
24:16 because they ain't fly and that's why
24:18 because this tube was on a crane and the
24:22 crane is laying it down in front of the
24:24 camera and because that's gonna look
24:26 wonky and weird and you don't really
24:28 have all of the fuels spilling out of
24:30 this thing like you need to because if
24:32 you really had a rocket engine and the
24:34 thing is hanging by a crane it's gonna
24:35 be all over the place right so you
24:37 really just have a cosmetic burst of
24:39 fire out the bottom for those of you
24:42 think that that's impossible let me take
24:45 you back to my childhood and if you've
24:48 ever held a firecracker in your hand and
24:50 ruptured your skin from a little tiny
24:53 black cap with a little tiny bit of
24:54 black powder crushed inside some paper
24:57 you'll realize real quick what happens
25:00 when you compress explosives but for any
25:03 of you've experimented with black powder
25:05 cans there's these guns that are like
25:08 the the old Civil War guns and with the
25:11 ball and you have to push it in there
25:14 and you know Civil War also had
25:17 Winchester rifles but in Frye boots yeah
25:21 but you you could buy these cans a black
25:25 powder and it's very flammable but you
25:28 need to pack it in there you need to put
25:29 your your wad on top of it and then you
25:31 put your ball on top of that and then
25:33 you Flint boom pow and it makes the most
25:36 amazing boom sound you've ever heard in
25:38 your life right Bruce Campbell would be
25:40 very proud but you can take a whole jar
25:44 this stuff right and just dump it out on
25:47 a sidewalk I'm telling you something we
25:50 did once and then you light it and you
25:52 will get the biggest mushroom cloud
25:54 you've ever seen and it's pure white
25:55 it's just poof and it's just it looks
25:58 like a mini nuke it has the fire inside
26:01 the ball and it goes up
26:03 and it doesn't blow up it doesn't blow
26:06 up in a way that's like the neighborhood
26:07 just disappeared but if you take that
26:10 black powder and you can press it into
26:11 pipes and then light it as long as it
26:16 gonna get some level of oxygenation it
26:18 will blow up a whole first floor of a
26:21 house I mean you know it's it can be
26:23 huge so compression is everything so if
26:25 you need a cosmetic fire to come out of
26:28 something with no thrust that would mess
26:31 with a cream you can do it
26:33 pyro people do it all the time in Los
26:35 Angeles all the time just don't get near
26:39 it and you won't get Burton right so
26:41 that little facade went on and on and on
26:43 and on it got you know nauseatingly bad
26:46 this was always there was like up yeah
26:48 there it is there's the fake and then
26:50 they did this really ballsy thing oh I
26:53 should say before I go into that you
26:54 never had any candid footage of anyone
26:57 filming these landings okay
27:00 so you know out of sight out of mind you
27:04 can do whatever you want you can fake
27:06 anything you want because there was no
27:07 pedestrians standing there watching it
27:09 land this is what's different with this
27:10 car thing at least from what we've seen
27:14 everything can be faked I'm gonna try
27:17 not to be cynical to the nines here
27:19 right but then they do this thing where
27:21 they supposedly land a rocket on a barge
27:25 in the ocean and I mean this is not a
27:28 big barge this thing is just barely big
27:30 enough to hold this rocket if it were
27:34 truly to land so what they do is they
27:36 they launch this thing and then they
27:38 they track it with the camera filming
27:41 down and I have to commend them if the
27:44 stuff is real and they're filming down
27:45 the barrel of the of the tube it's
27:48 really cool now the roadster thing is
27:52 gonna shatter up most of your dreams
27:54 here if you believe SpaceX is real but
27:59 for those of you who ever played a
28:01 flight simulator where you had a naval
28:05 aircraft carry that you could land on if
28:08 any of you've had relatives who are top
28:09 guns and you had a chance to talk to
28:11 them about landing on aircraft carriers
28:13 you will know that
28:15 one of the most deadly training exercise
28:21 sort of non-combat related
28:24 maneuvers that kills pilots and gets top
28:27 gun people to quit the business is
28:29 landing on aircraft carriers because you
28:32 have a target that is moving on the sea
28:35 which is a Cartesian coordinate XY then
28:38 you have a Z where it's bouncing up and
28:40 down depending on the severity of the
28:43 weather and how the sea is behaving you
28:47 have a big you know raster hook that's
28:48 grabbing this wire that you have to hit
28:50 that target so you have to not only hit
28:52 the hit the tarmac and it's as large as
28:55 a football field if not bigger and it's
28:58 super difficult for human being with all
29:01 kinds of fuzzy logic in our brains to
29:02 compensate for crazy stuff that we're
29:04 seeing right and computers are very good
29:06 at this too but this is hard the only
29:10 thing worse than that is doing that at
29:12 night right so you have visibly this
29:17 rocket takes off and this is really
29:19 where my friends came to me and said
29:20 this looks fake these are people who are
29:24 space junkies they make space shows on
29:26 TV name-brand stuff okay they make
29:30 movies name-brand stuff and they said we
29:35 think we recognize the software that's
29:37 making this take place then another
29:39 scientist kid came in and said we're
29:42 missing a lot of frames this would have
29:44 a lot more frames and take a lot longer
29:45 to actually transpire but they know that
29:48 the public doesn't have the stomach to
29:50 sit and watch the true real time you
29:53 know penetration of the clouds and
29:54 getting down to this pad and you know
29:56 getting down to this barge and landing
29:57 so they'd be abbreviated the footage
30:01 what I understand is why they didn't
30:03 just do that why did why they didn't
30:05 just tell the public hey we chopped out
30:06 a bunch of frames because you know this
30:09 might be a real boring for the average
30:11 public so we truncated it just do a
30:13 crossfade just watch the clock keep
30:14 going and for the super nerds you let us
30:16 see the whole whatever o'clock shots
30:18 that are happening when it comes to the
30:21 missing frames I have no opinion at all
30:25 but I will say that this is one of those
30:28 landings that had the
30:29 the feed go out a little bit more
30:31 believable on a barge but come on it's
30:34 2018 right we can have fluent cell phone
30:37 calls with anyone in the world as long
30:40 as they you know don't go into tunnels
30:41 and move around a lot this barge is
30:44 moving better you're moving that much
30:45 right so look to me like you have a
30:50 crane behind the camera here comes this
30:53 thing and all you see is sort of there's
30:55 just some farty smoke and then the
30:57 camera fee goes out it lands and it then
31:02 the camera comes back on and boom and so
31:04 you have this crane that just drops it
31:05 into view
31:06 yeppity-do da-da-da know billion dollars
31:09 from their government tax subsidies and
31:12 I want to bring to your attention to for
31:14 those of you haven't explored the
31:16 business sense of Elon Musk just before
31:19 we get into this Roadster thing Elon
31:21 Musk has lost money on all these
31:24 companies infinitely so Tesla's never
31:28 made a diamond profit that might come as
31:31 a shock to some of you and you some of
31:33 you have already researched this but
31:34 every time the someone buys a Tesla tax
31:37 dollars are being spent on that person
31:39 it's part of this you know green
31:41 movement to get us off of fossil fuels
31:43 and not fossil fuels but you know they
31:46 get to fill up I believe with free
31:48 electricity everywhere they go I mean
31:49 who's paying for that us right he's
31:53 created a solar panel company that I
31:56 guess is gonna be the Solar City I don't
32:01 know there's no profit model attached to
32:02 that he's got a battery company that's
32:04 about to come online and they're already
32:06 saying that the technology that the
32:08 batteries are based on is extremely
32:10 obsolete not just regular obsolete I
32:13 don't have an opinion about it because I
32:15 don't know I haven't researched what's
32:17 replacing it or whatever but they're
32:19 saying that he's gonna be creating a
32:20 bunch of batteries that are going to be
32:21 filling up landfills that don't need to
32:24 exist at this point
32:26 SpaceX obviously hasn't created a profit
32:29 yet they may eclipse that here in the
32:32 next few years depending on the grants
32:34 from NASA who knows right so just keep
32:37 that in the back of your mind
32:39 the space program for the Apollo mission
32:42 although largely a government based
32:45 management center farmed out virtually
32:49 all the components to our number one
32:51 Aeronautics agencies and I believe the
32:55 bart sibrel balance sheet on this was
32:57 nine point five billion dollars in 1960
32:59 by 1972 it was nine point five billion
33:02 dollars that have been completely spent
33:04 into this program and then just go use
33:07 an inflation calculator online look up
33:08 nine point five billion and you'd
33:12 basically select the source year but
33:14 nine point five billion in and then
33:15 select I believe it only goes as high as
33:18 2017 because it's only up to the last
33:20 closing month I recently looked at fifty
33:23 dollars from 1950 to 2017 and it was
33:26 five hundred and about five hundred
33:30 forty dollars so over 10x so there's a
33:34 lot of money to be made anywhere you
33:36 know where you're around government
33:37 contracts and you know in some cases it
33:39 creates a bunch of jobs and does
33:41 innovate a bunch of Technology so in the
33:43 end it's not the most horrible thing
33:45 let's go to the Roadster there's three
33:49 parts to the equation there's the launch
33:51 the deployment and the boosters that
33:54 came down you saw it in launch boosters
33:57 come down and then the orbit of the car
33:59 that's that's the chronological order
34:00 that I saw it in the launch looks real
34:04 and again launching a rocket into space
34:07 is not the most insurmountable thing we
34:10 do it all the time and a lot of you
34:12 think that they're hanging on balloons
34:13 and all this other stuff again I'm going
34:16 to tell you I think that regardless of
34:20 what you believe the universe to be I
34:22 think these things exist in some
34:25 capacity because you know for instance
34:28 when the bin Laden family was kicked out
34:31 of the Carlyle Group just before their
34:33 son was going to be used as a patsy for
34:35 9/11 the compensation that they got
34:39 financially was to be sold all the
34:41 communication satellites for cell phones
34:44 from Texas to Florida
34:49 so what do you set what are you really
34:51 selling them right but whatever I think
34:57 the launch was real the boosters coming
35:00 down at first I thought was another one
35:02 of these wire removal crane drop things
35:06 and it still could be but then we have
35:07 to accuse the third-party footage of the
35:10 landings is also being falsified which
35:14 it looks very convincing
35:16 if either they have hired a team of
35:18 folks that are finally getting a down
35:19 pat or these things really did come down
35:21 and there were huge parties outside
35:24 watching the boosters land what I didn't
35:27 see though in the footage was someone
35:30 painting the crowd and then seeing the
35:33 boosters come down and painting back to
35:35 the crowd not that we don't have plenty
35:36 sellout crisis actors that would do this
35:38 but there's little kids and all kinds of
35:39 stuff right so I did not see any shots
35:42 of crowd landing crowd perhaps you can
35:46 point me in the right direction in the
35:48 comments section if you have on the post
35:50 the first footage I saw lacked the
35:53 actual landing out of the sky thing and
35:55 so it looked again like two Rockets
35:58 really close to each other which I don't
35:59 know why they would risk such a thing
36:01 but I guess they've got it down that
36:03 good the backdrop is blue sky so in
36:06 terms of wire removal technology very
36:09 simple all this would have been created
36:11 weeks in advance months in advance
36:14 the Roadster footage was definitely
36:15 created a long time ago wasn't created
36:17 just the day of right so it's not like
36:19 911 we're trying to fake stuff right I
36:21 should clarify faking on the day out
36:24 that's why the nose cone came out of the
36:25 second tower that was hit and went back
36:28 inside the tower yeah that was a flub
36:30 they did with her they're masking but a
36:33 day later all this other footage came
36:34 out so again I'm gonna lean off of the
36:39 crane technique of making these things
36:40 look like they landed one of the other
36:43 things I swore I solved my buddy and we
36:45 slowed it down and replayed it and slow
36:46 down replayed is when these boosters
36:48 finally landed and that crystal-clear 4k
36:51 footage it landed and then it popped up
36:54 it kind of bounced a little bit and and
36:57 then weary watched it a day later and it
36:59 was it wasn't bouncing its hurt we're
37:02 like
37:03 we're not crazy right we replayed that
37:05 like five times and talked about it and
37:08 slowed every frame down and it's like
37:10 really odd so I don't know how I
37:14 explained that but it looked like to me
37:17 the bounce up idea was either the the
37:20 landing gear has you know some some
37:23 extra you know units of energy a force
37:26 that would kick it up and it kind of
37:27 settles itself which would make sense on
37:30 one level or it and the crane technique
37:33 you would have a wire that's that's
37:34 hanging from and as soon as it actually
37:36 does its landing the wire has a wave of
37:41 energy that goes up snaps and comes back
37:42 down and so you have this kind of pop
37:44 that's what we were thinking of but
37:46 again you couldn't find it in the next
37:48 day worth of footage really strange but
37:53 then we have the Roadster and the
37:56 Roadster is a dead giveaway that this
38:00 crescendo has been completely and
38:02 utterly faked and why they do this I
38:05 don't know you know
38:08 before I forget you know I was gonna
38:11 close on this point and we'll loop back
38:13 around but what is occurring is that
38:16 people are being inspired people who
38:19 don't know what they want to do with
38:20 their life are being inspired to find a
38:23 passion in space in the space program
38:25 and so there is just like back in the
38:29 Apollo missions and the moon missions
38:30 there are people there are people who
38:33 watch 2001 a Space Odyssey who got into
38:35 artificial intelligence because they saw
38:36 the fictional character the Hal 9000
38:39 I've got a book in my house it's all
38:40 about this this inspirational curve that
38:45 AI exploded when life imitated art and
38:49 so even if this roadster is completely
38:52 fake and I believe it is it is inspiring
38:54 little kids to get into this program so
38:56 hey you know your kid was gonna be some
38:57 loser someplace else and now they're
39:00 gonna be this absolute genius boy or
39:02 girl they're into it so there is sort of
39:05 a silver lining to this weird cloud of
39:07 BS which on one level you know kind of
39:12 support it it's kind of weird right
39:15 if we had to wait another hundred years
39:17 to actually do this kind of stuff then
39:20 we have a hundred years of sort of lost
39:23 children you know what what's funny is
39:27 that a lot of folks well when I was a
39:30 kid in the 70s used to watch rockers
39:33 right and you would you would want to be
39:37 one you know I didn't as much as my hair
39:40 as long I didn't really have a super
39:42 desire to be a performer like that at
39:46 all but I definitely saw it around me we
39:48 all picked up guitars and we all played
39:50 and had fun with it so anyway you get my
39:53 point
39:54 but the Roadster so you have this
39:57 roadster that's inside this this final
39:59 capsule the heavy Falcon capsule at the
40:02 top and there's so much wrong with this
40:06 footage that it's it's hard to sort it
40:08 out the car has three cameras on it a
40:11 driver side camera on a crane which
40:15 could literally be the apparatus that's
40:16 holding this thing up although it
40:17 doesn't have to be because you could
40:19 hold it from the bottom because there's
40:20 never any shots at the bottom of thing
40:22 nor should there really be one would you
40:25 have a camera shooting over the hood at
40:26 the driver and one from the trunk
40:29 towards the driver to have the don't
40:30 panic you know Hitchhiker's Guide to the
40:32 galaxy logo on the front plus of course
40:37 everyone's everyone's blown away by this
40:39 Hot Wheel if it's on the front dashboard
40:42 wow that's just so irrelevant in the big
40:46 picture of things right but if you were
40:49 on YouTube
40:51 beautifully pointed out that if this
40:54 thing was real when the doors opened the
40:58 doors open in this insane speed they are
41:04 there and they're gone
41:05 just boom now these are big giant doors
41:08 people I mean these doors must be 20
41:11 feet in sort of circumference of the
41:14 Halfmoon shape or the whatever you want
41:16 to call that shape that is the capsule
41:17 the idea that these things can open up
41:20 and disappear in literally one frame of
41:23 a camera such that there's not a single
41:25 frame of animation of them kind of
41:27 coming out like an eggshell is really
41:30 impossible for me to believe there's
41:32 also no frames of the debris of opening
41:35 doors that quickly when you open doors
41:37 that quickly it's usually through an
41:40 explosive bolt system meaning you have
41:42 some sort of charge some explosive
41:45 charge bolts that blow up and it blows
41:47 the thing apart like an air bag right
41:49 nothing
41:50 just they're there and they're gone now
41:54 for some folks they actually tracked it
41:56 and said that the live feed which is
42:00 supposed to coming in from from SpaceX
42:03 they had opened the doors they're gone
42:05 the car is floating around and all the
42:07 sudden the doors were back and all the
42:09 sudden the doors are gone so you know it
42:13 could be someone recapping a different
42:14 angle or they made a big mistake in
42:18 their little green-screen thing but
42:20 again none of this would have been shot
42:22 live there would be no reason to shoot
42:24 this life okay but the first dude
42:26 pointed out that if they had revealed
42:30 the exposure of the car to space from
42:33 the front hood camera back towards the
42:36 driver back towards the trunk you would
42:39 have seen the Falcon fall back behind
42:42 the car now for any of you who are space
42:46 buffs okay and this is really gonna hurt
42:48 most of you who believe that the moon
42:50 missions were real okay
42:51 because I'm gonna shove some science up
42:54 your nose hardcore the Saturn 5 system
42:58 the whole Apollo missions they all
43:01 showed the Rings coming off of the
43:04 multistage rockets it's a big deal you
43:06 know they're always filming that that
43:08 that rocket engine in SpaceX you always
43:12 see that thing it's phosphorous ly hot
43:15 and then all the sudden it cools down
43:16 but they just happen to miss one of the
43:18 most glorious shots and all their
43:21 Hollywood production why because this
43:25 would be very tough to fake is why they
43:28 simply didn't try it okay and of course
43:30 everyone bought it now right away the
43:36 footage of the car that was initially
43:38 broadcast to us
43:40 was the car up at a hundred and
43:42 seventy-seven kilometers okay that's not
43:45 200 miles Apollo 9 in its first in its
43:52 orbit reads 200 miles the earth is
43:55 almost completely in view at a hundred
43:57 and seventy-seven kilometers that is
44:01 [ __ ] that is fake and that is a lie
44:05 if you want to know what percent you are
44:08 off the surface of the earth I don't
44:10 know what it is in kilometers okay it's
44:12 a hell lot more than it is in miles
44:14 right let's just say that you know 177
44:18 kilometers is roughly about a hundred
44:20 and thirty hundred forty miles up you
44:24 would there are to be very very close
44:26 you take seventy nine hundred miles it's
44:28 almost eight thousand miles and divide
44:31 that into let's say 140 miles so eight
44:35 thousand divided into 140 move the
44:39 decimal place two to the right and
44:40 that's the percentage you are off the
44:43 surface of the earth it's a teeny tiny
44:47 single digit people and they are in this
44:51 shot so far away from Earth they're at
44:55 least half the diameter of Earth they're
44:58 at least four thousand miles in the sky
45:00 with this totally round shot and there's
45:02 no there's no fisheye lens they can make
45:06 the earth okay fully round and the car
45:10 not be bending in the shot right now
45:14 let's before we get into how the car
45:16 would have a tremendous amount of
45:17 problems in space let's get into how the
45:19 set works this is most likely most
45:23 likely a similar if not the exact same
45:25 set as the ISS uses which is a big giant
45:30 screen and a big tank of water it most
45:35 likely has extremely clean water they
45:37 can make water so purified it is like
45:41 air okay and they can stabilize the
45:44 water's movement in the tank such that
45:46 there's no there's no ventilation
45:48 systems that are moving water there's
45:50 not there's no swimmers in there moving
45:52 around they get everyone out of
45:54 they let us stabilize and they could
45:55 start creating these shots and how
45:57 astronauts move around this I wouldn't
45:59 know but you know you're always told
46:01 that there's spaces of vacuum spaces of
46:03 vacuum but in all the shots that we see
46:06 there's a couple things besides there is
46:08 being way too round use your dead
46:10 giveaway it's fake there's never any
46:11 stars and they always tell you it's the
46:14 exposure problem okay you can go to
46:17 Target and buy a camera for those of you
46:19 in the UK it's like your consumer store
46:21 with all the products in it you can take
46:24 a shot of the sky and show stars if
46:26 you're especially in not near a city and
46:27 you're in like the country and then you
46:29 can take a picture of the Sun the next
46:30 day and then take a picture of the stars
46:32 the next day and it won't hurt the
46:34 camera whatsoever it still can do
46:35 everything it's not burning anything out
46:37 like the first digital cameras right so
46:40 the idea that no one ever adjusts the
46:41 aperture for the most amazing shot of a
46:43 roadster with the Milky Way behind it is
46:45 again utterly and completely laughable
46:48 right there are these particles that
46:51 keep going straight up straight up in a
46:53 perfect vector towards the back you have
46:57 when it comes off a little bit diagonal
46:59 but then it corrects and goes straight
47:00 up that's our air bubbles travel if this
47:03 is just little space debris then you
47:04 should have them going left and right
47:05 and up and down because they should be
47:07 coming off the car just going whatever
47:09 vector they were going when they came
47:12 off of wherever source they came from
47:14 you don't see that bubbles go up the
47:18 Chinese tried this technique and boy did
47:20 we see some great bubbles you know
47:21 bubbles that went up to the mask of the
47:23 astronaut took total contour the mask
47:25 and then went up right there's a ton of
47:29 this stuff if you go look for it so
47:32 that's most likely how this set worked
47:34 the other thing that you need to
47:35 understand is that people keep saying oh
47:37 it's CGI it's all CGI the car is not
47:41 computer-generated the car is a real
47:43 live prop it is an old roadster there is
47:47 a mannequin inside that car and they are
47:50 simply filming it and they're filming it
47:53 in a controlled environment probably in
47:55 water they have this rear projection
47:58 screen of the composite shot of Earth
48:01 which is like it's always the best day
48:03 on earth right it's always complete lit
48:06 sky
48:07 you know and we are launching this thing
48:09 during the day so there would be Sun on
48:10 that side of the earth but I mean it is
48:11 always the most gorgeous you know a blue
48:14 marble shot you've ever seen in your
48:15 life always now this particular shot
48:19 they simulated the Sun you saw the Sun
48:21 doing this 360 thing the funny thing is
48:24 is that this car is doing a 360 it's
48:30 spinning a 360 how do you know that
48:31 because the earth keeps going around
48:33 this car one of the reasons why you know
48:35 the car is a live action car is that you
48:38 could see Jesus but why there'd be no
48:40 reason to right they don't see G the ISS
48:43 when the astronauts are out there it's a
48:44 big problem is that the the Sun is
48:48 reflecting off of the front mask of this
48:51 of this fake astronaut you notice this
48:55 mannequin and it's not moving much but
48:58 the Sun is like going all around in the
48:59 shot right it's coming in it's it's
49:01 sparking the camera and what's really
49:04 funny is if you look at the solar flare
49:06 prism that's showing inside the camera
49:09 you can start deducing the the light
49:11 sources and the various RGB values that
49:13 are coming out of the actual original
49:15 light source that's pretending to be the
49:16 Sun the Sun Also comes off as a hexagon
49:19 several times in the shot when it
49:21 finally stabilizes its overexposure you
49:24 start seeing the hexagon you know Elon
49:27 Musk was talking about something about
49:28 you know the was he singing occlusion
49:33 occlusion lighting you know because this
49:36 car starts looking really weird at one
49:37 point you know it could be part of it's
49:39 just the problem of the water distorting
49:43 the light not getting in the camera
49:45 properly at first I didn't think that
49:48 was there was water at all I wouldn't
49:50 have used water at all because I don't
49:51 think you need to but if this is just
49:54 simply the way that the unit that the
49:56 set is built it has to have water
49:58 because we're using astronauts at times
50:00 and you know different different
50:01 projections it may just be like look guy
50:05 we're not going to drain the tank for
50:07 your little Roadster tricks you're going
50:09 to have to do the Roadster thing and I'm
50:12 assuming that if you put a prop like
50:13 that in water you're gonna have to spend
50:15 about a week hitting it with hoses to
50:19 make sure every nook and cranny
50:21 the air that could be stuck in something
50:22 would come out so that wouldn't be
50:24 embarrassing and then again you shoot it
50:25 over and over and over until you have
50:27 the right shot and if a big giant bubble
50:30 comes up well you just throw that piece
50:32 of footage away again you're gonna be
50:33 airing this at the same time as falsely
50:36 portrayed as live footage but you know
50:39 no skin off your back when you're lying
50:41 your teeth out right and I want admit I
50:44 know someone who works at SpaceX he's an
50:47 acquaintance and he was in the room when
50:52 this footage was playing and we said you
50:55 know look this can't be real the launch
50:56 can be real perhaps the landing of the
50:58 Boosters could be real but the this
51:00 roadster is [ __ ] and his only words
51:03 were well so be it pretty funny right
51:10 and he's a good kid he believes it's all
51:12 real I think so but you know when
51:15 confronted with some of the things I'm
51:16 going to finish on here he was hard
51:20 pressed to to rebut them okay so for
51:25 those of you who believe when it's the
51:27 moon I want you to scoot up closer to
51:28 the monitor or get the volume just right
51:31 on your iPod or your sorry podcast
51:35 device if you're a big expert on the
51:39 moon missions and you've been running
51:41 around writing comments in protest about
51:43 how we went to the moon then we're going
51:46 to use your knowledge of an atmospheric
51:49 lists environment and the Sun to
51:53 absolutely crush the notion that this
51:56 roadsters in space are you ready one of
51:59 the big contingencies with the moon
52:01 landing was that NASA told us that when
52:05 an astronaut was in the Sun on the moon
52:08 that they were about 240 to 280 degrees
52:10 Fahrenheit and when they went into the
52:13 shadow it was that in the inverse so
52:17 negative 240 to negative 280 Fahrenheit
52:21 one of the greatest smoking gun videos I
52:24 have ever seen is a video interview with
52:27 the gentleman who built the hostile
52:28 blogs that went on the Apollo mission
52:30 the Hasselblad is a little square
52:32 cameras
52:33 that we're getting mounted to the chest
52:35 of these astronauts to the point where
52:36 they create nothing but time Life
52:38 magazine shots but they ask the guy both
52:42 the camera he said what would happen if
52:43 we took your camera and put it in 280
52:46 degrees Fahrenheit then immediately into
52:48 negative 240 280 degree for a night even
52:52 240 and the guy said well it would
52:54 explode in so many words I'm
52:56 paraphrasing but he and they said well
52:58 what do you mean he goes well the the
52:59 medal would warp he would turn in took a
53:02 ball apply a ball of metal because it's
53:04 going to be expanding and contracting
53:05 and it's definitely not gonna function
53:07 if you do that one time so that was you
53:11 know one of these things of okay so
53:12 those cameras could not have taken any
53:13 of those shots and this is from the guy
53:15 that built the camera if you don't think
53:18 this guy has expertise to make that
53:20 comment need to understand the
53:22 Hasselblad have been taken into deserts
53:23 had major problems due to heat exposure
53:25 they've been taken into arctic
53:27 temperatures and had mating major
53:29 heating issues and the one guy that is
53:31 going to get that data to correct the
53:33 problem is the lead one of the lead
53:36 assembly dudes and Hasselblad is life I
53:38 grew up with Hasselblad for my father we
53:40 had tons of them they take about a year
53:43 to make it's like a Swiss watch it is
53:45 one of the most beautiful things that we
53:49 create there's Faberge eggs Swiss
53:51 watches and Hasselblad 's okay so here
53:56 you have this car that is just a regular
53:59 old roadster it's got some carbon fiber
54:01 in it lots of plastic lots of metal
54:04 tires and a mannequin built out of what
54:08 looks like you know regular motorcycle
54:11 helmet gear right not again SpaceX has
54:14 never put anyone in space like a human
54:16 being and they've never been responsible
54:17 for creating a space suit so that space
54:19 suit around the guy was just a nice
54:21 little cute problem right built out of
54:23 like hodgepodge crap so now imagine for
54:27 those of you who have an old car you are
54:30 over 35 over 40 and you've had an old
54:34 car you have seen a couple things happen
54:37 when temperature fluctuates on your car
54:40 now when I was a kid one of the things
54:42 my father did to make money on the side
54:43 because the apps I loved doing it of
54:44 course then I did about six so the work
54:46 was to detail
54:48 he loved cars it still does I have
54:53 washed a windshield in Kansas at
54:55 approximately 95 to 100 degrees and when
54:58 I took the mitt with the water on it and
55:01 wiped it over the windshield it cracked
55:06 it was a big event in my life
55:08 because you're like oh [ __ ] I broke a
55:09 windshield right you got a windshield
55:13 going in and out of the light from 240
55:16 plus to negative 240 and this thing
55:21 ain't breaking mm-hmm okay
55:24 space-age glass right but a lot of you
55:27 might say well you know glass is forged
55:28 and a really hot kiln and so yeah maybe
55:32 it did survive it wouldn't but let's
55:34 just say you want to go with that kind
55:36 of flimsy excuse I've got a 93 minutes
55:40 of busy out in front of my house
55:41 a second car purchased it has a crack
55:44 right down the dashboard it's very
55:46 subtle and you can't really see it so if
55:47 you want to buy it it's okay the idea is
55:50 just in California temperatures this car
55:55 has never seen super hot temperatures I
55:57 think I took it to the Grand Canyon one
55:59 time but it was only 75 degrees at the
56:01 top about a hundred down below it
56:05 cracked simply through the attrition of
56:07 the light winters that we have here in
56:10 the light summers that we have here all
56:13 right when you look at the roadster I
56:16 want you to you could take a shot of the
56:19 one from the trunk lid where it's got
56:20 the don't panic the astronaut mannequin
56:23 to the left and of course a little hot
56:25 wheel there and everywhere it's black
56:28 draw in a red outline okay and say
56:33 negative 240 plus and everywhere it's
56:37 got light on it right positive 240 plus
56:40 Fahrenheit right for those of you're in
56:41 Celsius it's really hot right a match in
56:44 Fahrenheit burns at about 320 degrees
56:47 Fahrenheit as I understand it not quite
56:50 flammable but damn hot definitely melty
56:53 hot right I have friends that have
56:56 looked at it who are carbon fiber
56:58 experts and
57:00 or you know they've paid for it they've
57:02 applied it and according to them they
57:05 say the resin potentially would start
57:07 cracking on this but I don't know about
57:08 that because it's used in and around
57:11 exhaust systems I've never seen an
57:13 exhaust system made out of it but
57:14 imagine exhaust is not going to be 240
57:17 degrees right but the dashboard would
57:20 utterly rip apart I have a relative
57:24 who's a specialist in plastics and he
57:28 gets paid a tremendous amount of money
57:29 to be in plastics and I once asked him I
57:32 said well what drives up this salary so
57:34 much I mean you know I understand it's
57:36 engineering and all this other kind of
57:37 stuff but isn't it you know CAD and then
57:39 you just put it into a mold bubble I
57:41 said no he said the real thing that we
57:43 get paid for is to calculate accurately
57:45 the distortion of plastic okay so what
57:48 are you talking about dude he says well
57:50 when we Forge something in plastic again
57:53 I have no expertise in this he says we
57:55 Forge it a little funky it's a little
57:58 bit wart and depending on how the
58:00 plastic is coming together to create the
58:01 contour the object it's more warped and
58:04 so that when it dries it dries in
58:07 torques into its perfect position so I
58:11 thought that was pretty phenomenal eyes
58:13 and maybe principles of plastic I don't
58:15 understand but as this thing is doing a
58:17 360 rotation you're talking about
58:21 cooking this thing in two 40 plus and
58:24 negative 240 that dashboard is going to
58:27 melt it's going to rip apart it's going
58:29 to have issues okay
58:32 nothing I think the windshield it's
58:34 pretty safe it's going to shatter just a
58:37 concussion okay of the bolts that were
58:40 able to blow away these gigantic doors
58:42 the shockwave of that and the vacuum of
58:46 space hitting this car it's probably
58:49 going to just it would have been it
58:52 would have been glorious how they just
58:53 blown the car up you know they just it
58:56 opens up in the car just go screw Shand
58:58 it turns into this crazy thing that
58:59 would have been awesome we all would
59:01 have yelled and screamed just as much
59:02 but they were looking to replicate the
59:05 opening scene of the 1981 animated movie
59:08 by Mobius heavy metal where this like a
59:11 58
59:13 corvette comes out i probably you're
59:15 wrong but it comes out of the the space
59:17 shuttle and then goes down and lands on
59:19 on earth right with ryder raider plan
59:24 then we have the tires and here is Elon
59:27 Musk going off about this Hot Wheel and
59:30 the little dude and he didn't mention
59:32 some very basic things that would
59:34 probably be best communicated like well
59:37 we deflated the tires because if we had
59:40 air in them and they were exposed to the
59:42 vacuum of space they would immediately
59:44 explode like a bomb for any of you've
59:48 seen a car burned to the ground on the
59:49 side of the highway one of the things
59:52 that the heavy rescue teams have to
59:55 watch out for is exploding tires they
59:56 have to wait for the fire to get away
59:59 from the tires before they move in to do
60:00 any hookups or any type of extinguishing
60:02 because if you're standing next to a
60:03 tire when it explodes it'll kill you
60:06 it's like a bomb right so what should it
60:10 happen how these tires had air in them
60:11 and again there's been no claim that
60:12 they didn't have air in them again these
60:15 are these are interesting anomalies that
60:17 would show the brilliance of SpaceX to
60:18 have someone come out and say well these
60:20 are the things we had to do we we
60:22 couldn't actually put a real roadster in
60:23 space because it would have exploded due
60:25 to the temperature changes so we modeled
60:27 a roadster in metal then we painted it
60:30 in really heavy paint that can handle
60:33 temperature changes and it's just a
60:35 simulation of the roadster how cool
60:37 would that have been right but no you
60:39 look at this roadster and the rubber
60:42 trim across the windshield was on the
60:43 top was all corroded because it's been
60:46 hanging around for a little while right
60:47 it's one of the originals the tires
60:50 would have erupted like four gigantic
60:53 bombs and those quarter panels would
60:55 have been just utterly shattered I think
60:59 it would have been cool I think they
61:00 should have done it you should have
61:01 really put the car up there and let it
61:03 blow up
61:03 and again they missed the shot of the
61:05 Falcon pulling away from the car and
61:09 here's the thing the cameras were on all
61:13 three cameras were on and I haven't seen
61:16 the footage they may try to create it
61:18 after the fact because they realized
61:19 they screwed up but it's going to be a
61:20 hefty little thing to do in a quick in a
61:23 quick manner now today
61:26 it's honestly it would be great school
61:28 CG for any studio in Hollywood let's
61:32 talk about that for one second
61:34 one of the things I like to do and I'd
61:37 like to challenge you guys to do it for
61:38 the rest of your life is if you see a
61:40 hoax but there be something very real
61:43 like two giant buildings in New York
61:46 fall into the ground or three I should
61:47 say is if you were assigned to do this
61:49 and you had some experts at your
61:51 disposal how would you do it with the
61:54 Roadster footage there are so many
61:56 options it's pretty well if you wanted a
62:00 green screen or blue screen the Roadster
62:02 then you have an immediate problem that
62:05 sort of negates doing that which is you
62:08 need the picture of Earth to reflect on
62:12 the paint job of the car and you could
62:14 go to the effort of creating a model of
62:17 the roadster and doing a composite
62:19 reflection on top of the car yeah if
62:22 you're gonna model the car go ahead and
62:24 model the whole thing but you do run
62:25 into the problem of realism so a real
62:27 car looks real because it's real and so
62:30 compositing might actually be a fairly
62:31 decent technique because this whole
62:34 thing is on an arm in terms of its
62:36 orientation matching the CG background
62:40 with the car would be pretty decent but
62:42 you've got to remove the blue and the
62:44 green that's reflecting on the paint as
62:45 well they have the technology to do that
62:47 but you might at some points almost lose
62:49 the complete geometry of the car because
62:51 it is reflecting so purely the blue
62:55 screen of the green screen that you're
62:56 gonna have to recreate the fender that's
62:57 missing so if you're gonna go to that
62:58 extent just model the car right but when
63:02 you look at the the dummy the dummy is
63:04 the real part that really reveals this
63:06 is a real car
63:08 this is a real dummy this is a real
63:10 object and if if the guys at SpaceX did
63:13 model this whole thing and they're
63:14 laughing at me
63:14 hats off to you guys man you made a
63:16 really good CG looking car let me tell
63:18 you the lighting wouldn't have been
63:21 messed up right Elon would not have been
63:24 apologizing for the word lighting on the
63:26 car had they CG at my opinion they could
63:28 have Siege eat some of it there's that
63:30 hood shot where the car really looks
63:31 strange and then they have all the
63:34 interior shots that look real so I don't
63:36 know maybe they CG part of it and let go
63:38 of the rest
63:41 you know silhouetting is the first area
63:45 of cg where we were able to create photo
63:47 realism without the burden of accuracy
63:50 and what's to the wedding I was in a VR
63:53 cave in 1992 at Sun Microsystems I
63:57 mentioned this before and I walked into
64:01 a room I wear active 3d glasses and I
64:04 was in a cave so they're projecting on
64:05 all the walls from behind
64:07 rear-projection
64:08 and it was mega real and when one of the
64:11 sequences they did was me on one of
64:13 those sort of swamps skippers you know
64:15 where you have the big fan behind you
64:17 and you're sitting all those little
64:18 doodads little boats don't even know
64:21 what the hell you call those things but
64:23 they did a daytime shot and you could
64:26 see that the blades of grass had low
64:28 poly sand you know pretty much solid
64:30 green color and they had kind of a
64:32 landscape in the distance and the Sun
64:35 was setting in front of me and all
64:36 sudden they flipped it and they made a
64:38 lightning storm happen also I was in the
64:40 dark and now I've got black blades of
64:41 grass coming at me everything is lit in
64:43 moonlight so there's no true photo real
64:46 you know blue light shining on things so
64:48 everything was black and the only thing
64:51 I could really see it was the the
64:53 moonlight in the in the atmosphere and
64:57 it was coming through all these black
64:59 objects and all of a sudden I felt like
65:00 in 1992 I felt like I was in pure photo
65:03 real virtual reality so doesn't when the
65:06 techniques you can use so the darker
65:08 shot of the hood with the really weird
65:10 coloring but I'd be the only one I could
65:12 imagine they could CG and pawn off as
65:14 real anyway and then we have this claim
65:18 that's going to Mars and it's gonna
65:20 float around for a billion years okay
65:23 well out of sight out of mind right and
65:27 then they told us well you've just seen
65:29 the last footage we're ever gonna see of
65:31 the Roadster no they could be wrong
65:35 whoever said that could be wrong but if
65:37 that's SpaceX's position then that's
65:40 absurd absolutely utterly absurd we're
65:44 getting shots from Rovers that were put
65:46 on Mars in 2003
65:49 right or somewhere in there 2003-2005
65:54 somewhere in there I just moved to this
65:55 house in there there was a landing we're
65:59 getting photo real shots for March right
66:01 again
66:03 probably some Terrigen spin-off right so
66:06 no reason why we wouldn't be able to get
66:08 shots from this car forever I mean for
66:12 our lifetime we should have no problem
66:16 you could say it's a battery issue well
66:18 they could have put some solar panels on
66:20 the on the other areas where you can't
66:25 see it what from the cameras you know
66:26 you get the whole hood trunk lid excuse
66:29 me could be all solar panels these
66:31 cameras are big you know $30,000 cameras
66:33 what I understand but you can still put
66:36 one was a little NASA cameras on there
66:38 you could put a radioactive bar slash
66:42 isotope in the backseat in the trunk and
66:45 create a infinite power system like we
66:46 have on all of the satellites out there
66:48 to create enough power over time to wake
66:50 up the cameras send some footage go back
66:53 to sleep you know charge back up wake up
66:55 and do it the irony is that the tesla
67:00 batteries which are getting better can't
67:03 last that long so that's why you lost
67:04 your footage
67:05 imagine that you charge it up for a 300
67:09 mile journey and you only turn them on
67:11 for the footage and you put them back to
67:13 sleep you turn them on you put it back
67:15 to sleep and zero Kelvin of space where
67:18 these batteries would be they you would
67:19 think they would operate beautifully the
67:24 reason why things this little footnote
67:26 here and then I'll close out and one of
67:28 the reasons why computers perform really
67:29 badly when they get really hot is that
67:33 you know when something moves very fast
67:35 like I said in a previous episode you
67:37 have a bunch of agitated atoms that's
67:40 why things are getting hot they're
67:42 getting wiggled by passing electrons and
67:46 the wiggle doesn't stop and you know it
67:48 keeps going going and going and going
67:49 and going and start creating this crazy
67:50 harmonic well then the CPU starts to
67:53 have a higher failure rate because the
67:56 wiggle gets so intense the electron
67:57 doesn't make it to its destination
67:58 properly and so they have to write a lot
68:01 of software at the
68:02 or a-level to say okay didn't mean to be
68:04 that this seems to be bad data so they
68:07 do error correction memory and a bunch
68:09 of other stuff right second one hotter
68:11 so same thing happens in space when it's
68:14 really really cold
68:15 you have a super stabilized circuitry
68:18 and every time electron goes by the
68:21 wiggle gets calmed down by the
68:22 environment it's cool so that's it
68:27 that's my SpaceX take on things you know
68:30 we'll make this a special report I'll
68:31 try to get this out tonight but for all
68:33 those with opinions please put them in
68:36 the comment section down below please
68:38 like the video because that makes the
68:40 the organic fine go up even if we're
68:44 being shadowed shadow censored or
68:46 whatever it is if you haven't subscribed
68:48 subscribe him into deep thoughts radio
68:51 calm please go the audio and video links
68:53 are there the locked Facebook group is
68:54 there on the patreon account is there if
68:57 you do grace me with your donations
69:00 every month one thank you very very much
69:02 and make sure you click the notification
69:04 bell because I've been posting some
69:06 exclusive content on there and I get the
69:09 notice back that no one's being notified
69:10 which means no one's clicked it now I'm
69:13 a subscriber of my own channel I get the
69:15 notification but that's probably because
69:16 I'm the administrator but I think I have
69:18 a phantom account out there why don't I
69:21 guess I can't
69:23 but anyway make sure getting notified of
69:26 the stuff if it's interesting to you bit
69:28 anyway take care of yourself in someone
69:30 else and I'll see in the next deep dots
69:31 over now
