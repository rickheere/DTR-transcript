00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to detail settlement today
00:39 I think I'm going to take another stab
00:40 at this latter thing I'm not even sure
00:43 where this whole thing happened for me
00:46 personally like I feel like it was in
00:49 December of 2015 when I first saw it and
00:54 then by I would say end of winter 2016
01:01 headed into spring I met a few people
01:04 who were dealing with it as well and now
01:08 we keep looking at the new videos that
01:10 come out and you know you have sort of a
01:14 dividing into a couple different groups
01:20 all very interesting all extremely
01:23 interesting as to how many people have
01:26 probably converted for the rest of their
01:28 lives - any conclusive proof that you
01:33 know to the contrary but you have
01:36 scientific people really getting at a
01:38 lot of the geometry and a lot of the
01:40 well how do the stars do this how they
01:42 do that and then you have individuals
01:45 conducting physical experiments as best
01:47 they can and you know trying to prove it
01:51 that way I'm going to drop a couple
01:55 notions on you guys during this episode
01:57 that I don't see people really talking
01:59 about and then we're just going to try
02:02 to go through a lot of what I've seen
02:05 since my last episode on it oddly enough
02:09 there really isn't a tremendous amount
02:12 of new evidence
02:13 that's let's come around I mean there's
02:17 new ideas on how to check things out a
02:20 lot of the evidence a lot of the
02:24 evidence that was submitted in the last
02:26 couple years has pretty much held up but
02:32 what's fascinating about it as we always
02:34 see on this show is that you have people
02:36 who didn't have any scientific knowledge
02:39 in these areas and now they do because
02:41 of the Flat Earth theory and I think
02:43 that that in itself is very valuable as
02:48 Jed said you know you can ask a person
02:52 why it's round and they've got maybe one
02:53 answer because everyone believes it is
02:56 and you ask a person why it's flat and
02:58 they will talk for hours and hours and
03:02 hours about why they think is flat and I
03:04 think it's interesting that the
03:06 knee-jerk reaction is to say truth is
03:10 really defined in pop culture as who
03:14 believes a particular thing the most
03:16 well then that must be true you and I
03:21 was a kid they were just transforming
03:24 the whole Charlotte is your B thing I
03:26 was in Massachusetts and the
03:30 mispronunciation of words started to
03:32 become this prevalent formula for how we
03:34 speak words and pronounce words in
03:37 English but if you just study how vowels
03:42 and consonants work together and follow
03:44 the rules I mean I'm not trying to be a
03:46 rule monger but there are very specific
03:49 ways to speak and it was just this thing
03:53 where my father was taught well when he
03:56 was young how to speak and so he knew my
03:58 words are supposed to be spoken and when
04:00 I would come home and say them wrong
04:01 he'd say why are you saying it that way
04:02 it's really this way look at the way
04:04 it's spelled and he showed me other
04:07 words that made the words I was saying
04:10 wrong so he correct me and I go back and
04:14 I tell you know the English teacher I
04:16 said I think I'm saying this word wrong
04:18 oh no you're not saying it wrong because
04:19 I say it the same way and then they got
04:21 out all these dictionaries I mean
04:23 literally one day and in sixth grade my
04:25 guess was seventh grade
04:27 got out all these dictionaries six of
04:30 them laid them down and the word dissect
04:34 was actually in there as detective
04:37 everyone says dissect today they are
04:39 utterly and completely wrong
04:41 it's weird words like data are really
04:46 data the a makes two a long second it
04:50 makes the first day long cause it's only
04:51 separated by a single consonant the
04:54 reason why I go through that is because
04:56 we are allowing mass ignorant to
05:01 potentially influence our complete take
05:04 on life well we all believe it's round
05:09 hmm none of us were there when we
05:12 determined it was around and so I guess
05:15 it is and as long as the space agency
05:19 who is now utterly notorious for
05:23 stealing money and faking missions and
05:26 faking science can say oh we're going to
05:30 cooperate mass opinion because all we
05:33 care about is our paycheck we do not
05:36 care about integrity NASA is not an
05:38 organization built out of individuals
05:40 that care about the integral proof of
05:44 what they've done you have as far as I
05:47 can tell at least 51% of the company is
05:51 made out of those nerds that are the
05:54 Nerds that don't care whether or not
05:56 they really have the ability to do it
05:59 they say they can do or the knowledge
06:00 that they say they have they just want
06:03 to control and be famous for whatever
06:06 little nerdy thing that they do they do
06:08 not care and my 20s I used to get a
06:12 strip joint I've only been in one of my
06:15 entire life and I went to it for several
06:17 months because a bunch of us guys from
06:19 the game industry were going there and
06:22 NASA was very close up in the Bay Area
06:25 and we get these NASA scientists coming
06:29 into this place it's very very famous
06:32 place I don't even know if it still
06:33 exists called The Brass Rail and there
06:37 was a guy that would come in with the
06:40 most massive comb-over
06:41 you've ever seen in your life he was
06:45 absolutely bald on top that he had
06:48 rocker hair twice as long as mine but I
06:52 only had it growing on one half of his
06:54 head and he would swoop that stuff over
06:57 well all the way down and almost his
06:59 waist on the other side of his body and
07:02 when you looked at him you know you were
07:05 thinking wow he actually is there doing
07:08 this as if no one can tell I always had
07:13 lots of money because he was a scientist
07:16 at NASA but I want you to think about
07:18 the guy with the four-foot come over
07:20 when you think about NASA employees it
07:25 doesn't [ __ ] matter to these people
07:29 they live in a bubble of absolute
07:32 [ __ ] crazy and self-denial and this
07:36 is where we get our authority for how
07:38 the world and the universe works yeah
07:42 hey place could be round place could be
07:45 flat the point is we have to figure out
07:48 how we get information who we get it
07:50 from and you know you get these groups
07:54 of society that you help you most of you
07:57 have a friend that is very against any
08:00 criticism / reality of people you can
08:06 find a person doing something very
08:08 ridiculous and reprehensible and they
08:13 don't care they'll tell you you
08:16 shouldn't say anything bad about another
08:17 human being and it's not that you're
08:20 trying to say something bad about them
08:21 this is you're trying to acknowledge
08:22 what they're doing Wow look at that and
08:26 that weird should we shouldn't be doing
08:28 that they shouldn't be doing that oh
08:29 well don't you dare criticize the
08:31 pedophile touching the child you don't
08:34 know what he's thinking you don't know
08:36 right I have a friend of mine that won't
08:42 let me use hypotheticals and I keep
08:47 trying to tell her I said yeah this is
08:49 the way the whole world has discovered
08:50 and pioneered reality this is the
08:52 absolute basis of all scientific method
08:55 and philosophical advancement is to
08:57 create hypotheticals and analyze them
09:00 until they can become realities until
09:03 maybe perhaps through a hypothetical we
09:05 can create an experiment by which we can
09:06 prove what we're thinking but if it were
09:09 up to her the whole place would be just
09:12 as matter-of-fact and now as as man used
09:15 to be before man got conquered by those
09:18 who could think better so Flat Earth the
09:23 fighter community is very interesting
09:25 because I think that we have a lot of
09:29 dedicated souls trying to prove it one
09:31 way or the other and it is just
09:36 fascinating how utterly different the
09:38 people are who are heavily involved with
09:40 this you know the most I think a typical
09:47 group of people that you would assume
09:48 define are the super evangelical
09:51 Christians where they just at will parse
09:57 words out of the Bible to serve the Flat
09:59 Earth movement I mean they will take a
10:02 single word that's been translated five
10:04 or six times and then almost use it in a
10:07 conversation to prove flood earth as if
10:10 that's what God or Christ or whoever
10:12 wrote the Bible meant you know and hey I
10:17 guess there's a potential that they're
10:19 right you have groups conducting these
10:23 experiments that are actually physical
10:26 experiments and the most popular ones of
10:28 course are putting cameras on weather
10:31 balloons and then sending them way up in
10:33 the air trying to prove that the world
10:35 is flat now I went through a laborious
10:41 process of trying to figure out how far
10:43 up you'd have to be before any sort of
10:46 resolution I whether it be your human
10:49 being or some sort of digital camera
10:53 could see the curvature of the earth and
10:56 what I came up with is 80 miles up it's
11:01 sort of the base of elevation the one
11:06 would have to achieve to start seeing
11:08 prone
11:08 Al's curves in the surface of the earth
11:12 with these hot-air balloons they can
11:14 only go up you know maybe a hundred
11:16 thousand and some change feet which is
11:21 very impressive but when you take the
11:23 overall diameter of the earth and divide
11:28 that into the height that these weather
11:32 balloons achieve then you're not going
11:36 to see curvature it's there if it's
11:40 there but you won't be able to really
11:43 see it with your eyeballs because the
11:46 rods and the cones and your eye do not
11:47 have enough resolution to register the
11:51 bend at the edge of the horizon now like
11:55 I said before this is really tough to to
12:00 do unless you do a lot of pre
12:02 calculations ahead of time but the most
12:05 telling curvature is the curvature in
12:08 front of your face how far should you be
12:11 able to see straight ahead when elevated
12:14 before the curvature should take away
12:16 landmass and you know what you would
12:20 have to do in that particular case is to
12:22 do your weather balloon experiment which
12:25 the problem is is that it keeps spinning
12:27 you know usually these things spin
12:28 people are getting pretty good at
12:29 building these things such that the the
12:31 apparatus can spin but the camera stays
12:33 pretty stationary so I've been really
12:35 impressed by a lot of the hard work
12:37 that's gone into these things and I
12:39 think eventually they're going to get it
12:41 they're going to prove it one way or the
12:42 other but I grew up in a little home
12:45 town that was a hundred miles from every
12:49 major city and so obviously standing on
12:52 a big Ridge I should not be able to see
12:53 100 miles away curvature of the earth
12:56 would prevent that from occurring now
13:00 there's obviously a differential
13:03 calculation for how high you are looking
13:05 down on something versus being flat and
13:06 level western Kansas is probably one of
13:13 the most amazing places in the world to
13:15 be if you're going to test Flat Earth
13:18 theory because it is so flat
13:22 in western Kansas that on average day
13:24 you do not feel like you're in reality I
13:26 mean it what's really well as you pull
13:28 the car over and you just start looking
13:29 looking around and he'll get up on your
13:34 car look around and it looks cartoonish
13:38 it looks completely like a firmament
13:41 dome how these people didn't you know
13:44 have some weird Amish sect that believed
13:47 that we were in affirm of a dome I don't
13:50 know I mean you would wake up every
13:51 single day almost completely disoriented
13:53 with no mountains in the distance no
13:56 Hills
13:56 no valleys just whatever crop you're
13:59 growing and they're so efficient at
14:01 growing wheat it makes it even more
14:03 bizarre and more amazing that you see
14:05 just these flat plains of wheat and you
14:08 see a blue sky with just you know
14:12 animated clouds up there it's crazy but
14:16 these elevation experiments don't go
14:18 high up enough and they won't and I'm
14:20 not sure why anyone would invest in them
14:22 unless there's some other strategy to
14:25 find out the curvature be it
14:26 straightforward probably you know a
14:28 vanishing point shirt ahead because
14:32 right now they could double the altitude
14:35 of these experiments and still be under
14:37 courage curvature right when you take a
14:41 tee and you divide it by 8,000 for
14:44 instance you're in a fraction of a
14:46 percent of altitude over the surface of
14:49 the earth and you if you expect to see
14:51 curvature you're kidding yourself you
14:55 know 80 miles is the first point where
14:57 you could be able to use scientific
14:58 instruments of photography to register
15:01 this stuff so let me throw at you a
15:04 different tact here what I'm going to
15:09 show it there you know basically give
15:11 you is an idea that I think we can use
15:14 to prove or disprove Flat Earth but this
15:17 is a theme of thinking that I want you
15:20 guys to use for all the evidence either
15:22 way right so the South Pole the South
15:27 Pole is the focal point of a lot of the
15:30 research right because on one side of
15:34 the fence the South Pole is
15:35 Continent 12,000 miles around roughly
15:38 and you know it's a very jagged edge
15:41 thing you know it's not like it's some
15:43 perfect circle down there currently by
15:46 the way in 2017 it is now bigger
15:49 I saw one report bigger and more frozen
15:52 today than it has been in recorded
15:54 history
15:55 so so much for global warming right but
16:02 on the other hand of the Flat Earth side
16:03 of things you have not a continent but a
16:07 border right this is border that goes
16:10 all the way around the earth and it's a
16:13 big ice barrier just like Game of
16:15 Thrones animation at the beginning now
16:18 what's on the other side of that barrier
16:20 we don't know it could be more ice could
16:23 be lush land could be a temporal anomaly
16:27 could be heaven could be a dome wall
16:30 where you go up and you can knock on it
16:33 we don't know but in order for it to be
16:37 a border there's a very distinct
16:39 mathematical difference for it to be an
16:42 island slash continent it's 12,000 miles
16:45 around for it to be the smallest border
16:48 that we can estimate according to like
16:51 the UN logo for instance it should be
16:55 60,000 miles around
16:57 supposedly Captain Cook navigated down
17:00 to it and got all the way around it
17:03 after several years of miscalculations
17:06 because he thought he was going around a
17:07 continent and he was going the inside of
17:10 a border he made it 60,000 miles all
17:14 right well even with errors 60,000 miles
17:17 is a lot longer than 12,000 miles right
17:21 we're talking 48,000 miles more around
17:27 this thing so four times longer around
17:30 this thing than just the base
17:31 circumference of the continent of the
17:33 South Pole of Antarctica right ah this
17:38 is where we come into some easy science
17:40 if you want to prove that the world is
17:43 flat let me give you another test you
17:46 can do it's a little difficult
17:49 but it's very interesting it's difficult
17:51 and it's easy depending on what kind of
17:53 person you are what resources you have
17:55 now what if I said to you you think my
18:01 house is a 1200 square foot house I've
18:05 given you a map of my house and the only
18:08 way that you're going to really confirm
18:09 is 1200 square feet even if I lock the
18:13 front door and say you're not allowed
18:14 inside you could walk the perimeter of
18:16 my house right and okay I see I look it
18:20 looks like a bathroom window over that's
18:21 a oh there's a sliding glass doors I can
18:24 see inside but if I said to you well my
18:29 1200 square foot house is really a 6,000
18:32 square foot house now I'm telling you
18:37 that or you've heard a rumor that that's
18:39 the case I'm still telling his 1200
18:41 right here the neighbors like now dude
18:43 this thing's like 6,000 you don't even
18:45 know it's huge now the only thing you
18:49 would have to do to prove that it's a
18:52 6,000 square foot house without being
18:53 able to gain entry I mean you're not
18:55 allowed to step on to the Antarctic
18:57 continent because of all these treaties
19:00 that were passed right in early 50s all
19:03 you would need to do is walk around the
19:06 perimeter of my house and perhaps with
19:08 the cellphone start taking pictures of
19:11 weird little turns and strange things
19:13 and balconies and and big long
19:16 straightaways of walls that in
19:18 themselves just to turn it into a box
19:20 would be more than 1200 square feet now
19:25 some of the estimates I've seen in other
19:26 videos put the wall around Earth at a
19:30 hundred thousand miles all right that's
19:36 eighty eight thousand miles longer than
19:41 this recorded supposedly continent of
19:44 Antarctica now don't forget the old map
19:46 that was copied in one 1309 from a
19:49 previous map that you know has the
19:52 Antarctic completely mapped out without
19:56 snow on it of which nASA has said is
20:00 accurate
20:02 and it was longitude longitudinal and
20:04 latitudinal correct
20:06 which I guess longitude was not invented
20:10 by then according to the white man but
20:15 we should be able to sail a boat near
20:20 the coast at least invisible range of
20:22 the coast of Antarctica and just record
20:27 what we see
20:28 and according to flood earth the most
20:32 conservative estimate which I think Eric
20:34 Dubay stops around 60,000 miles you're
20:40 going to be looking at potentially 80
20:43 plus percent eighty-five percent roughly
20:45 of every surface anomaly you see when
20:49 you are sailing around Antarctica will
20:53 be of protrusions and inlets and various
20:57 land anomalies that have never existed
21:00 in any map because according to Flat
21:03 Earth people
21:04 eighty-five percent of the continental
21:07 coastline of the border hasn't been
21:11 discovered or revealed through Google
21:13 Earth or any other mapping process right
21:17 so that is a theme of thinking that I
21:21 think that we can apply to Flat Earth
21:24 experimentation now will tell you that
21:30 what's interesting about it is that we
21:32 have my close close friends here you
21:35 have folks that are I have friends of
21:37 mine that are completely convinced it's
21:38 flat for all kinds of reasons but they
21:41 also kind of have no ability to grasp
21:44 gravity as an ether wind right and
21:48 what's funny is I'll say well you know I
21:51 believe it's round dude of expanding
21:52 earth at a minimum now it could be that
21:56 expanding earth could somehow achieve
21:57 itself on a disk I'm totally open to
22:00 that but I haven't heard anyone attempt
22:02 that sort of explanation but I'll show
22:07 the video the Neil Adams video of the
22:10 world ripping apart and how much it
22:11 makes sense with all the history that we
22:13 have heard
22:16 the age of the ocean experiments which
22:19 have nothing to do with conspiracy these
22:22 German scientists had figured out that
22:24 the place the oceans are no more than 65
22:26 million years old when they reversed the
22:29 the level of salt and the water as it
22:33 gains more and more today they just
22:35 reverse the algorithm back exponentially
22:37 inverted and they find out that the
22:38 oceans oceans aren't that old
22:42 but I'll hear people say all that
22:44 expanding everything that's [ __ ] and
22:48 I don't know what kind of mind can look
22:52 at the experiment of Neal Adams and
22:54 instantaneously say that that's [ __ ]
22:58 it would seem as difficult to believe as
23:03 anyone saying one where the other round
23:06 or flat the Pacific Ocean and the
23:10 Atlantic Ocean on all maps that have any
23:15 sort of contour to them on all Google
23:17 Earth stuff which is derived from
23:19 satellite photographs that are ancient
23:21 or high-altitude photographs there is a
23:24 seam right down the center of both
23:26 oceans matching the shape of the
23:30 continents on both sides with those
23:33 seams down the center you have to bring
23:35 it all back together and then again you
23:39 get a ball that's really small
23:41 one-fourth the size of Earth one-fourth
23:45 the size of disturbance and he throw
23:47 wins and thus one-fourth of gravity that
23:50 we have today now there's been some
23:54 incredible incredible research by the
23:57 Flat Earth community about the fact that
23:59 the Sun sets the Sun setting is the
24:03 number one reason why people I think on
24:06 earth believe that it is round and this
24:10 idea that the bottom disappears from
24:13 hotels and ships and all this other
24:16 stuff now what's interesting is a bit of
24:19 a conflict inside of the Flat Earth
24:22 community for this evidence because
24:25 people have been telling you in the Flat
24:27 Earth community that the whole of the
24:28 ship does not
24:29 appear first at the bottom of the hotels
24:31 and cityscapes of Chicago are not really
24:34 missing from the photograph and they are
24:37 they completely are right but this
24:41 individual studied the that I apologize
24:43 for not knowing his name he studied all
24:47 the signs that basically is kind of
24:48 above board saying that the atmosphere
24:50 acts like a lens with just the
24:54 refraction 'el correction of light paths
24:57 to your eyeball on a surface like ours
25:00 could be flat changes angle changes
25:04 which you can see he had this table
25:09 experiment which I'll try to insert over
25:11 my talking here where he essentially
25:14 bought a filter that represented this
25:17 the same type of refraction that they're
25:19 talking about with light inside of a
25:22 atmosphere with water in it and he had a
25:27 light in the background pretending to be
25:29 the Sun and as he pulled this lens back
25:33 towards the Sun or maybe pulled it for I
25:36 can't remember the sunset in the camera
25:39 filming the light so it looked like the
25:43 flashlight light bulb was actually
25:44 sinking on the other side of the horizon
25:49 and at that moment you realize that what
25:56 you're so certain about may need a
26:00 little bit more analysis now one of the
26:05 tough things about being a father affair
26:07 i think is that by changing this one
26:09 perception of the world from
26:11 heliocentric to a disc you know
26:14 surrounded by a barrier of ice which we
26:17 know is the antarctica you immediately
26:19 challenge a tremendous amount of other
26:23 you know commonly believed things in the
26:26 world right and so all you really want
26:30 to do is prove that it's flat it doesn't
26:33 rotate and potentially there is
26:35 something much bigger going on by us
26:38 being here right
26:41 but now before you get a chance to prove
26:44 that first level of clean the problem
26:49 for you is that now people are running
26:52 at you with everything else that is
26:54 heliocentric globe evidence in their
26:57 repertoire right moon missions Mars
27:00 missions all of the satellites that go
27:03 up into space and so now you're
27:08 overwhelmed trying to fend off
27:09 everything and you try to quickly divide
27:12 up your resources hey once you go handle
27:14 this I'll go handle this and call me
27:17 back but really what your focus is is
27:19 trying to prove that it's flat what's
27:23 interesting and frustrating is is that
27:24 you get out there and perhaps you were
27:27 never a science guy you were never a
27:29 space person you never paid two cents to
27:34 the moon missions right but the second
27:38 you start listening to people who are
27:40 bringing up this latter thing and they
27:43 start showing you these computer
27:44 rendered pictures of satellites around
27:47 Earth with horrible versions of the
27:49 earth underneath depending on what
27:50 decade you're looking at these
27:51 photographs then all of a sudden you're
27:54 sort of awake and disenfranchised to
27:57 these other agencies you're starting to
27:59 go man I never knew that NASA lied so
28:01 much I never even thought about NASA
28:03 when I was thinking about whether or not
28:04 the world was flat around but now it's
28:06 in my face what the hell am i the only
28:11 one paying attention you know have you
28:14 ever had that that feeling when you're
28:17 watching a sports game when either the
28:20 player or the referee either plays badly
28:24 or has a bad call and you think to
28:26 yourself gosh you know I saw it I saw it
28:30 as a complete rookie that this wasn't
28:31 the way to do the play or this wasn't
28:33 the way to do the call and those people
28:36 are a hundred percent dedicated to that
28:38 profession and they can't get it
28:39 remotely right it's it's anomaly you
28:43 know that's created through just
28:44 mistakes that people make we think that
28:47 they shouldn't have the ability to make
28:49 mistakes but it's just that weird
28:50 feeling and when you when you wake up to
28:53 some of these
28:54 conspiracy truths you are saddled with
28:59 this almost jaw-dropping day-to-day
29:03 moment this feeling of what the hell was
29:08 everyone asleep when this stuff was
29:10 happening how is the moon missions been
29:12 allowed to stick around for 50 years
29:14 well the evidence was right in our face
29:19 the truth of matter is they were
29:21 geniuses in the 60s and were able to
29:23 essentially throw in over the over the
29:27 wall in a way that you know the
29:29 intellect of that time was unable to
29:31 track what they did but now we have
29:32 plenty of software plenty of software to
29:36 pick everything apart the other one is
29:41 that we have sort of experiments that I
29:43 don't think actually prove anything
29:45 necessarily because they're working in
29:47 like relative gravity you know bubbles
29:51 in a way that people don't understand it
29:55 things wouldn't things would still be
29:58 the same way on a round ball as it would
29:59 on a flat disc and one of them is using
30:01 a level and this idea that you can take
30:05 a level and say Kansas level it out get
30:11 in your car drive to California which
30:13 should be tipping quite a bit from where
30:15 you are and it's still level and so they
30:18 think oh that's proof it's like no
30:20 that's not proof even under a
30:23 heliocentric ball with ether gravity the
30:28 bubble that's in your little doodad is
30:30 getting adjusted as you turn right the
30:34 gravity is identical in proportion in
30:37 Kansas as it is in California your level
30:42 to the tangent of the curve at best but
30:45 you're still level to the tangent of the
30:47 curve it will not be changed now the
30:50 gyroscope is a completely different
30:53 thing why someone hasn't spun a
30:55 gyroscope in Miami Florida just get in a
31:00 truck and RV spin a gyroscope pill
31:03 make sure you spend 10 of them just keep
31:05 them powered
31:07 drive from Miami all the way to Los
31:10 Angeles and take a look get inside a
31:15 commercial jet just bring a little
31:17 gyroscope box you know some will tie
31:20 anything everyone get on a flight in
31:21 London and turn on your gyroscopes and
31:24 go to Cairo go to Madrid come to America
31:31 go to go to the Virgin Islands really
31:34 cross about 50% of the curvature of the
31:36 earth and that thing should be on its
31:38 side because it's going to stay
31:41 perpendicular to London and as the plane
31:43 goes around the edge it's just going to
31:45 continue turning inside your chamber why
31:48 the hell do we have to rely on
31:49 scientists or pilots to tell us what
31:52 these things are doing or gyroscopes
31:55 hard to find the other one that I'm
31:58 actually really surprised we haven't
32:00 seen our engineering students using 3d
32:03 software to test a lot of the theories
32:06 of how would how would things behave
32:10 attached to a ball this as big as the
32:13 earth with 1g so you have to dial in the
32:17 1g of gravity towards the center of this
32:19 ball game we want to recreate their
32:21 claim before we try to do anything else
32:25 different spin it a thousand miles an
32:29 hour at the equator see what happens
32:33 Engineers let's put an atmosphere on
32:36 that and let's see how with gravity
32:38 pulling on the atmosphere and then
32:40 turning the ball how would we see the
32:43 atmosphere behave because you know I'm
32:47 staring straight ahead out my backyard
32:48 I'm looking at some pretty fluffy clouds
32:50 and they are not really moving that fast
32:52 and you know they're moving on to my new
32:55 detail but it's not flying by my head
32:59 and I'm sure that those clouds are
33:01 anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 feet near
33:04 at least right not a lot of detail up
33:07 there well on flat earth that makes
33:10 complete sense right who knows what
33:13 makes the atmosphere turn and a flatter
33:16 if is it the Sun whizzing by the moon
33:19 whizzing by what makes it happen
33:21 the Sun is almost directly overhead
33:24 right now it's about two o'clock in the
33:26 afternoon well let's see what happens
33:31 college students are going to college
33:33 for special effects and they have access
33:35 to all kinds of you know water plugins
33:37 in Maya
33:38 alright da one up turn it into
33:42 atmosphere getting the Terrigen for take
33:46 a look move it around we really haven't
33:51 done anything but scratch the surface of
33:53 trying to prove the Flat Earth is one
33:56 way or the other right but the other
33:59 side it's very interesting and it
34:00 continues to manifest is the spiritual
34:03 side of the implications of a Flat Earth
34:08 that once you believe that the world is
34:11 round you supposedly have lost your
34:13 entire connection to God and once you
34:15 believe it to be flat you have regained
34:18 your full communion with the Creator
34:21 now the whipping about this whole
34:24 spiritual side of this thing is that for
34:27 me personally you know when I hear
34:30 people say and I saw this yesterday in a
34:33 couple comments and people saying you
34:36 know if you believe in the ball you know
34:41 you have lived your entire life feeling
34:44 it's insignificant as if God is either
34:49 not there or so distance from us from
34:54 you that you you just have no ability to
34:58 be spiritual and what's really strange
35:03 is I grew up thinking it was round my
35:05 whole life for sure without any question
35:07 and never felt like I was alienated from
35:10 God nor insignificant I guess the notion
35:14 is is that if the world was you know
35:17 round and there's a bunch of galaxies
35:19 out there that supposedly you know if if
35:24 they're if a lot of life-forms have been
35:27 created in the universe that
35:32 God has an inability to remember you
35:36 personally it's just too many people in
35:39 the universe and you don't get loving
35:41 care you know and I've said I've done a
35:45 lot of spiritual stuff lately and in the
35:47 episodes and part of it for me is to say
35:49 well if you believe in God and
35:51 especially sort of a biblical God with
35:53 the firmament quotations in it you know
35:57 God used to walk around this planet a
35:59 lot used to be here you used to tell us
36:02 do stuff usually pretty outrageous
36:05 things but he was here if you believe it
36:08 and without the world changing its size
36:11 or shape because if you believe it's
36:13 flat you believe it's always been flat
36:15 and doesn't matter if a bunch of people
36:17 think it's round it's still flat and God
36:20 would still be hanging out but he
36:21 doesn't since the printing press God has
36:24 not made it a commonality to come down
36:27 and say hello Joseph Smith being one of
36:31 the only people to claim otherwise right
36:32 I think that there's a flaw in man which
36:38 is a very interesting subtle flaw in the
36:40 way that we behave and it's obviously
36:42 socially conditioned into us but one of
36:47 these things is if you have ever been
36:49 afraid of something
36:51 maybe you've been afraid of something
36:53 your entire lifetime there's a bizarre
36:55 thing that some humans believe that
36:58 everyone has also been afraid of the
37:01 same thing and once they have figured
37:04 out how to get past their fears they are
37:07 so overjoyed with that experience that
37:11 they rush outside and start screaming
37:12 the solution to everyone else when most
37:15 people aren't scared of it and I think
37:19 it's it has to do with the same chamber
37:22 in the brain that has to mature which is
37:25 that moment when you were a kid and
37:27 someone said to you you know just
37:29 because it's raining outside honey it's
37:31 not raining anymore you know where your
37:33 grandma lives that may not be raining
37:35 down the street just because it's hot
37:38 here doesn't mean it's hot everywhere in
37:40 the world and your brain has to go to
37:43 like this global
37:45 perspective in order to understand that
37:48 and so I see that same sort of immature
37:55 circuit when someone starts to try and
37:57 tell me that bully I bet you felt super
37:59 insignificant just because you thought
38:01 the world was round you know again
38:04 Douglas Adams in Hitchhiker's Guide he
38:06 does a really interesting job talking
38:08 about the total perspective vortex which
38:10 is a comical torture device of which the
38:13 CFO Beeblebrox was actually put inside
38:15 of he's the only one that really
38:17 survived it but it normally fries the
38:20 mind of a person that goes into it
38:21 because it shows you the total
38:24 perspective of your insignificant mass
38:27 and energy as compared to an infinite
38:31 universe and I'm going to do another
38:34 little hitchhikers guide reference here
38:37 because this might actually make some of
38:39 you some money as I said in a previous
38:44 episode one of the big things that they
38:46 did in the history cos guide of the
38:48 galaxy was they built this computer
38:49 ironically called deep thought and it
38:53 was to generate the answer to life the
38:55 universe and everything and it thought
38:57 for something like 7 million years 11
38:59 million years whatever it was and all
39:01 these generations of people that hooked
39:03 it up kept you know spawning and
39:06 spawning and spawning until it finally
39:08 gave up its answer and everyone else
39:09 everyone's waiting outside they're all
39:11 having a big giant parade or just
39:12 waiting for the answer and the computer
39:14 wakes up and he tells them you know I
39:16 got your answer but I don't think you're
39:18 going to like it they're like oh but you
39:20 must tell us he goes and you're really
39:21 not going to like it oh but you have to
39:23 it was ok your company this is huge
39:27 thing he says the answer is the answer
39:29 is 42 and they're like what are you
39:34 kidding me 42 what what is that you know
39:38 because I think the problem is is that
39:40 you haven't really figured out what the
39:42 question is and this is what earth is
39:44 right earth is the computer that
39:45 generates the question but everything
39:48 got messed up
39:49 so they never really get the question
39:51 now the association with Flat Earth is
39:54 this
39:55 when when they heard that was going to
39:59 take 7 to 11 million years to come up
40:01 with the answer he said don't worry you
40:04 guys just go out there and write about
40:07 what answer it might be once you argue
40:12 back and forth as to whether or not it
40:14 matters make yourself a tremendous
40:16 amount of money get on some lecture
40:17 circuit where you can talk and talk and
40:19 talk about the answer and your
40:21 descendants in your descendants you'll
40:22 make a tremendous amount of money just
40:24 talking about what I might say at the
40:26 end of the day what I haven't seen and
40:31 someone really take on the Flat Earth
40:32 from a literary standpoint being fair
40:35 right to say will we ever know what
40:39 shape the world is have the guts to say
40:43 NASA is a bunch of lying [ __ ] right
40:47 that you don't have the evidence that
40:49 you think you have and then you got a
40:54 bust the balls of those doing
40:55 experiments in the Flat Earth side to
40:57 shake out the ones that are ludicrous
40:58 you know again hot air balloons that are
41:02 never going to see the curvature of the
41:03 earth it's a pointless exercise until
41:07 you can get the guys in Utah who did
41:09 that was it the rocket that was 73
41:11 kilometers up or something like that
41:12 that's getting close
41:14 that's getting real close but you got to
41:17 convince those people with those
41:18 experiments to stop putting fisheye
41:19 lenses on their cameras you know you
41:23 have teaching technology where it's like
41:24 your rocket is going to be spinning
41:26 around like crazy and we have to either
41:28 put a camera unit in there that's on
41:30 some you know spindle that won't rotate
41:33 in proportion to the way that the
41:36 fuselage is rotating but there's a whole
41:43 philosophy according to Flat Earth that
41:46 no one's really engaged just yet perhaps
41:48 it's in the works
41:49 I think the episodes I have made on Flat
41:53 Earth would probably be a pretty good
41:54 primer for such a book it's going to
41:58 take some dedication
42:01 I think - if you're a flat earth
42:02 enthusiast your biggest challenge is to
42:05 not embarrass yourself with some of the
42:09 material I've mentioned at the beginning
42:11 of this episode but I think that the
42:14 photographic proof of of let's just say
42:19 there's a lot of people that show
42:20 photographs locally here on the surface
42:23 of the earth and of course that the
42:24 beach looks flat the desert looks flat
42:28 etc etc as if it would look any any
42:31 different on a round sphere it would
42:34 look just like that so if you put out a
42:37 bunch of stuff that is sort of it
42:40 doesn't really prove anything
42:42 then you're injuring your movement
42:43 you're injuring the conversation that
42:46 you would rather have so my thing is to
42:49 stick with your smoking guns if you're
42:52 going to stick with Flat Earth theory
42:53 you've got to stick with the gyroscopes
42:55 you've got to get someone who's not on a
42:59 telephone interview to say look I
43:03 studied as a sniper I studied as an
43:05 artillery guy I was in the Navy and we
43:09 can't shoot anything we can't see there
43:11 is no Coriolis effect calculation
43:15 correction differential in our
43:17 calculations we simply can only shoot
43:19 what we can see because all the
43:21 interviews I've ever ever heard are some
43:24 dude on the phone never the guy in the
43:27 studio or the big guy in the studio who
43:30 talked to someone on the phone or talked
43:32 to someone in person we've got to get
43:34 some of these people to come out and say
43:36 you know I was in Desert Storm I was in
43:39 the whatever invasion for 10 years and
43:43 at no point do we calculate for the
43:46 curvature of the earth the other thing
43:49 I've seen is that for the experiments
43:51 that I see that are people doing balloon
43:52 experiments and long-range photography
43:55 experiments the posses that come
43:59 together to conduct these experiments
44:01 are hugely a high percentage of people
44:04 who are very serious very informed non
44:06 emotional people that just want to get
44:08 to the bottom of the question and then
44:11 they allow in sort of these
44:14 you know transient folks that are just
44:17 kind of walking through town and they
44:20 could give a [ __ ] if anything goes
44:22 correctly they don't really understand
44:23 the experiment they like being a part of
44:26 a movement and they're just dead weight
44:30 they create more confusion than clarity
44:35 all right so I mean one of the footnotes
44:38 I would say to you guys is if you're
44:40 going to get into experiments I think
44:43 you should become damn near militant
44:45 about who gets in and who doesn't and I
44:47 think you should set a cap you know what
44:50 if you only to launch a weather balloon
44:52 it only takes five people so there you
44:55 go there's a five person cabin oh sure
44:58 you're more than welcome to watch over
45:00 there you're not welcome to touch
45:02 anything to contribute you're not to be
45:05 standing around looking at the metrics
45:07 coming in and then just cap it once you
45:12 fill the five positions with five
45:13 serious candidates that's it you don't
45:16 look for six even if someone's
45:19 contributing money if they are stooped
45:22 they get to be a part of the system if
45:24 not it just had to be a silent investor
45:26 and you report back via phone or
45:29 whatever how you're doing I saw probably
45:35 one of the cooler experiments it was the
45:38 second one of this particular team and
45:39 they had built a pretty ingenious unit
45:42 but they lost the camera you know they
45:46 had two cameras one on the bottom one on
45:47 the top one on the bottom was getting
45:49 all this incredible footage but when the
45:51 when it popped the camera basically
45:55 ripped off with this thing it could have
45:57 been the wire actually the cord getting
45:59 stuck around the bottom and literally
46:00 just yanking this thing off the off of
46:04 its main mount but they did a brilliant
46:05 job putting this thing together and they
46:07 actually had altimeters
46:08 reporting down to the earth they had a
46:11 you know a satellite dish they could
46:13 point directly at the where's a
46:15 satellite one they could point directly
46:16 at the balloon and get data and get the
46:19 live feed from the camera and so even
46:21 though they lost the camera they have a
46:24 lot of excerpts of what they were seeing
46:27 the camera up above stopped at 40,000
46:29 feet but the eventual altitude was like
46:32 118 thousand feet but now the group of
46:36 folks that put this thing together and
46:38 launched it it was pure [ __ ] chaos I
46:42 mean it was so tough to watch a bunch of
46:45 people with selfie cams and just it went
46:49 on for it was almost real-time and
46:52 believe me they're not Jimmy Fallon
46:54 trying to keep you entertained properly
46:57 so I think that when this kind of stuff
47:00 gets produced like that it seems to be
47:03 so many voices going around and so many
47:06 people off-kilter and you have the you
47:09 know three or four guys that are all
47:10 into the me show right they don't give a
47:13 [ __ ] if you see anything about the flat
47:14 earth they just want their face on the
47:15 internet because we have such ends or
47:16 injured souls right that you can't focus
47:20 on what's going on you know it doesn't
47:23 need a personal twist to it right if I
47:26 ever personally launched one of these
47:27 things I'm not I'm out of the game I'll
47:30 say hello at the very beginning this is
47:32 what we're going to do L give you a
47:33 little tour of the hardware and then
47:34 once we launch if we're going to do
47:36 anything real-time it's going to be me
47:40 taking all the data and putting it in
47:41 some composite screens so you can see it
47:43 and then you make your own decision if
47:46 you can chat in the chat thing but it's
47:47 not going to be me filming myself the
47:49 whole time trying to be funny so I think
47:53 that these I've seen another one in the
47:56 UK I believe where they were trying to
47:57 film a person rowing down a famous
48:01 stream which I think was used in the
48:03 past to prove the world was flat and it
48:07 just got really super hot muggy day and
48:09 so by the time the kid got down there
48:11 ways the refraction off the steamy water
48:13 was just killing it because the original
48:16 experiment was done in winter ish you
48:19 know fall spring timeframe so it was
48:21 sort of not frozen but very dry air
48:24 right but that particular group seemed
48:29 to be just so willy-nilly people are
48:31 bringing random hardware random cameras
48:33 to the thing and no one was taking
48:34 inventory of okay there are certain
48:36 experiments we can do with these really
48:38 high-end cameras
48:40 who is serious about this who knows how
48:42 to actually take a picture and it just
48:45 just looked like some kid you know
48:47 scrounged up 600 bucks and was didn't
48:51 know how to hold a camera still people
48:53 would show up to events like this with
48:55 their batteries nearly empty I mean how
49:00 crazy ignorant is that don't bring your
49:03 camera if you don't have the wherewithal
49:05 to charge of the night before and if you
49:07 wake up in the morning and find out you
49:08 didn't charge it don't bring it you
49:11 can't charge it and use it in the
49:13 timeframe that the experiments going to
49:14 happen so just just cut your losses man
49:17 just go there and watch and stay out of
49:19 the stay out of the experiment don't
49:20 mess anything up so you know I've been
49:24 harping recently on the video that I saw
49:29 recently that was trying to save it I
49:31 think it was um truth is stranger than
49:36 fiction Channel I think that maybe the
49:38 guy he's the one that said you know stay
49:41 ignorant God will punish you if you
49:43 learn about him that's what the Tower of
49:45 Babel experiment was all about that man
49:47 tried to reach into the sky and God you
49:49 know being the [ __ ] baby that he is
49:52 you know creates 12 tribes 12 different
49:55 languages and we're all confused warring
49:57 for the rest of time right and you know
50:01 he put a point on it that he believes
50:03 that's the way the world works which
50:05 means his channel in my mind just turns
50:07 off permanently right anyone who
50:09 believes such an asinine thing doesn't
50:11 have any other information for me to
50:12 take right
50:15 but that sentiment has been around
50:17 lightly I mean I've rarely ever heard
50:19 that sentiment where it's it's you know
50:23 God's an [ __ ] on this almost
50:25 intellectual level but there are people
50:29 out there that worried about finding the
50:32 the firmament dome and that once you
50:33 knock on the wall it's all hell breaks
50:36 loose you aren't supposed to find the
50:38 wall and we got to reset the experiment
50:41 so there's going to be another fake noah
50:43 parable where everyone's wiped out and
50:45 the place goes back to scratch right
50:48 what if the big trick is just
50:51 God takes you and plays hide and go seek
50:54 it just puts you in a world and you're
50:58 supposed to find him and that's the game
51:01 he's just hiding in the universe it's
51:03 not impossible obviously he could keep
51:05 us so far away we wouldn't be able to
51:08 find him and we could play
51:09 hide-and-go-seek with our kid and give
51:11 him a plane ticket to Hawaii and we're
51:13 in Boston and yeah the kids never going
51:15 to find you not for decades so that's
51:19 not fun you would play hide-and-go-seek
51:21 in the house you know your kid can find
51:24 you but until your child does find you
51:27 your child can't see you but they're not
51:29 worried because they're like this is fun
51:31 this is what I like to do mom's going to
51:33 be cool and you know what I'm going to
51:35 catch her I'm going to catch your I'll
51:38 be the winner so be the loser and then
51:41 we're going to switch and she'll be the
51:42 winner and I'll be the loser and this is
51:44 fun little game there's this whole
51:47 dilemma about God being you know my
51:50 sorry man being made in God's image
51:53 because the question soon arises in your
51:56 head will I like a fart joke there's God
51:59 like a fart joke you know I like to do
52:06 things that maybe aren't good for me
52:07 does God do that too I mean how much am
52:10 I made in God's image if you ask a
52:13 Mormon they tell you that that means
52:15 that he's a he's a white guy he's
52:17 Charlton Heston they really believe that
52:19 God's a white male and he has flesh and
52:23 bone and that's why you have to keep
52:25 your flesh and bone into the next world
52:27 which I guess if someone gets cremated
52:29 they think that you're just you're
52:31 [ __ ]
52:31 you know you can't go anywhere but you
52:36 know you want to think about the fact
52:37 that why would God keep us in a petri
52:39 dish what's the point there he could put
52:45 us in a much bigger container but he
52:47 doesn't he keeps the center of this
52:48 contact lens of container which you know
52:53 in a way makes God kind of small now
52:57 maybe he's got like bubble wrap paper
52:58 everywhere right in every little bubble
53:00 is a new world and we're all side by
53:03 side
53:03 and maybe there's some you know design
53:08 flaw or design feature inside man that
53:10 when we get around you know hundreds of
53:13 billions of others like us
53:14 it just goes to [ __ ] somehow so it's
53:17 better for us to be in this particular
53:19 experiment for those of you have seen
53:22 chemistry experiments where they will
53:25 have those grids of little test tubes
53:27 and you see the person doing a little
53:28 you know dosing every single one of
53:30 these things and then they put them off
53:32 or sometimes they shake them sometimes
53:33 we freeze them whatever they do they're
53:34 trying to see how cultures grow
53:35 overnight try to do a DNA test what if
53:41 we are one of those little test tubes
53:43 all right I guess one of the horrific
53:48 notions that men can conceive of is that
53:54 God doesn't give a [ __ ] about us at all
53:58 it's not an absolute doesn't give a [ __ ]
54:01 about us because obviously somehow we're
54:02 being maintained here and I'm not
54:04 necessarily saying this is true but what
54:07 if God sets it all up as a video game
54:09 walks off itself sustains it really does
54:13 self-sustained hey and your
54:15 reincarnation loop thing is is going to
54:17 happen - that's just the way it works
54:21 I'm sure that there's some of you that
54:23 have thought okay what if either God
54:26 created us and was really actually
54:29 walking around us more often or an alien
54:32 race made us and dropped us off and
54:34 whatever and did they you know did they
54:38 sit around talking to us was the
54:40 Nephilim and the Anunnaki and the jinn
54:44 and all these folks were they here to
54:48 help us get started and then they just
54:50 take off like they don't want to see the
54:52 fruits of their bounty the fruits of
54:54 their scientific experiment gone right
54:56 have they just turned into UFO people
54:59 talking to French guys and craters but
55:03 what if you find out that you know we're
55:07 here we punch through the wall we find
55:10 the people on the other side they're
55:11 humanoid or humans and they've been
55:14 around longer they have punched through
55:15 their wall million years
55:17 ago they have been visited by all the
55:19 you know life forms in the universe that
55:23 are in our region and they discussed at
55:26 great detail and they simply tell you
55:28 well it looks like our the Creator
55:31 Kem's comes through periodically and
55:33 creates things and you know it won't
55:37 come back in your time timetable you
55:40 guys are going to have to exist on earth
55:43 for another million years before it
55:46 comes around again but whatever it is
55:50 this conversation with this alien race
55:51 that's on the other side of the
55:52 firmament wall isn't exactly uplifting
55:56 it's not negative and that there's any
55:59 harm they might tell you but don't worry
56:01 you know there's a firmament dome over
56:03 all of our areas there's you know
56:06 there's the water and stars aren't
56:08 really star stars or these word you know
56:10 particles up there and once you go up
56:15 high enough you don't see them anymore
56:16 but we're safe there's no there's no
56:19 meteorites they're comments that are
56:21 coming at us you've completely
56:22 misunderstood what those are planets I
56:25 but these they're just these little tiny
56:26 tchotchkes you know they don't really
56:28 have any big role they play in our lives
56:30 so you won't have any cataclysmic event
56:33 from space all those things you think
56:35 are craters they're actually volcanoes
56:38 the moon will the moon's part of the you
56:43 know a node that holds us all together
56:45 we all have a white moon it's crazy we
56:47 all have white when in fact we've
56:48 there's a rumor that way down over there
56:50 there's two white moons but then there
56:53 people are strange they've got two heads
56:55 you know whatever are you ready for
56:58 information that could be on that level
57:02 because there's this as this thing of
57:05 like okay it's flat then what what's
57:08 next you find out it's flat you knock on
57:10 the front of the wall how does it change
57:12 your life you know I've talked it linked
57:14 about this in previous episodes and
57:16 here's the main reason why I always go
57:18 down the Cerebral for flat earth some of
57:23 you are so passionate about flattered
57:24 that you're dividing up your family
57:26 friendships and your personal
57:28 friendships
57:28 if someone doesn't believe or some
57:31 chastises you you're losing your
57:33 relationships with these individuals in
57:35 general when you communicate with the
57:37 world and say a public forum YouTube
57:40 whatever Facebook you're losing
57:43 connections there too
57:44 and you're starting to frown on
57:46 mankind's intelligence due to your utter
57:48 belief in flutters and what you believe
57:52 to be smoking guns and their inability
57:53 to see it after you show it to them so
57:57 if it's that important to you and it
58:00 could be it could be that important to
58:03 all of us to be honest if we knew the
58:05 truth then I say go balls to the wall go
58:10 Richard Dreyfuss Close Encounters
58:13 you know he didn't just see UFOs he went
58:18 home and built this shape of a pyramid
58:20 in his living room until he figured out
58:25 it was actually shaped like a devil's
58:27 mountain his wife took the kids and left
58:31 he never saw his wife and kids again if
58:35 you watch the extended version he threw
58:41 down he found his answer now I don't
58:47 know how you find your answer on a
58:48 terrace besides somehow getting an
58:50 expedition across the South Pole you
58:55 know one of the anomalies that he's
58:57 saying is that they can't fly over the
58:58 South Pole because the instruments get
59:00 so cold they can't operate but they can
59:04 fly how high-altitude jets way up in the
59:08 sky you know 80,000 feet or more we have
59:14 satellites up there work just fine
59:17 so we have all the technology supposedly
59:19 to conquer high-altitude cold weather
59:22 but no one's able to put anything
59:24 together and we can fly supplies to the
59:26 Antarctica you know grant sits on this
59:29 in the edge but isn't it strange that
59:34 there's no television show billionaire
59:37 or whatever that is said okay I'm going
59:40 to quickly do two things I'm going to
59:43 rape the money out of flat-earthers
59:46 and I'm going to bodyslam them on the
59:49 ground by proving that this thing is a
59:51 globe and they put together you know I
59:55 don't know a fleet of c-130s that are
59:57 completely outfitted for high-altitude
59:58 cold temperatures or they get a balloon
60:01 or they get whatever and they fly right
60:05 over the South Pole videotaping the
60:07 entire thing I mean what would it take
60:09 to fly over a 12,000 mile wide thing
60:14 I'm sorry circumference excuse me right
60:17 it's just basically a day flight from LA
60:21 to New York that's about as far as we're
60:24 talking so while we sit around and watch
60:26 a video for what amounts to be about
60:28 five and a half hours and boom the
60:31 world's flat boom the world's around why
60:33 isn't anyone going for this seems like a
60:36 very quick way to make a buck and then
60:41 the whole world goes ah or this [ __ ]
60:46 flies into a firmament dome wall and we
60:50 all go oh my god check that out so for
60:56 those hanging on to round I would say
60:57 why isn't even done that and you know
61:00 you might say oh because it's stupid
61:01 okay if you think there's a big group of
61:05 stupid people out there there's nothing
61:07 more satisfying than I guess taking all
61:10 their money right so there you go put
61:13 sponsorship in this thing and everyone
61:16 will continue watching then the headline
61:19 will go out the earth is round or the
61:24 other anyway I think you you get what
61:29 I'm saying here I just wanted to put a
61:31 quick sort of update out there I don't
61:33 know if I'm going to use a number or
61:35 just make it a special report I just
61:39 want us to kind of you know stop what
61:41 we're doing and trying to find out or
61:43 prove that it's flat or round and you
61:46 know globish and take a look at what
61:48 we're doing you know we still on track
61:51 are we becoming an acidic group of
61:53 people one way or the other
61:55 does that what we really want to
61:56 and so on and so forth so anyhow deep
62:01 thoughts radio.com for all the feeds
62:03 there's video if you're on audio audio
62:04 if you're on video that's all I'm saying
62:07 today take care of yourself and someone
62:10 else and I'll see you in the next deep
62:12 thoughts over now
