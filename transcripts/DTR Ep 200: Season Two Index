00:08 [Music]
00:17 Oh
00:23 [Music]
00:28 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:30 deep thoughts this is episode 200 we
00:35 have finished season to season our
00:38 episode 199 is encoding inside so this
00:44 is called the season 2 index
00:46 last year I called it the glossary and I
00:49 was using the wrong word so what this is
00:52 is your new you never heard this channel
00:54 before or whatever reason you haven't
00:57 heard season 2 episodes and so what I do
01:00 is I go through 100 episodes and just
01:02 briefly give you the footnotes of why I
01:05 made the episode well then I think it's
01:07 a good episode or a shitty episode and
01:10 just sort of help you guys out so
01:13 without further ado let's move along so
01:17 the very first episode of season 2 101
01:18 is about MK ULTRA which is a real
01:23 clandestine program by the government
01:26 that they started using Nazi resources
01:29 after World War Two and it was really
01:31 trying to figure out how to control the
01:33 brain how to control the mind through
01:35 torture through sound waves through all
01:38 kinds of different techniques it
01:40 actually ended up yielding Manchurian
01:42 candidates like sirhan sirhan a few
01:46 others they they actually ended up
01:49 paying thing for people who are damaged
01:53 by the program it's one of the only
01:55 things the government's ever done that
01:56 was really bad they had to acknowledge
01:58 that they did it but they got away
02:01 scot-free so you know the precursor to
02:05 this show which I had a co-host that we
02:07 did just a straight up podcast was a
02:09 called MKULTRA radio which you're still
02:11 getting the podcast from that domain for
02:14 deep thoughts radio and so I just
02:17 thought it's time to go in and go deep
02:19 on it because when we covered it in the
02:20 other show they just were kind of
02:21 bouncing around too much which is why I
02:23 made this show in the first place
02:26 102 is holographic universe and what I
02:30 do is I go through the book holographic
02:31 universe and a lot of the principles of
02:34 what that means because there's a lot of
02:37 I think folks that
02:40 can feel this other reality and the and
02:44 you know it's not another reality but
02:46 it's the way we come together using
02:48 frequencies and what-have-you there's a
02:50 lot of implications once you understand
02:53 that we are the combination of a bunch
02:54 of frequencies that you you actually
02:56 gain control over your life in doing so
02:59 and understanding that I'm going to
03:04 apologize ahead of time if this is all
03:05 Wendy and the mic $1.99 is also Wendy
03:08 summers moving in you know Potter is
03:11 pushing cold air out 103 is about
03:15 growing up as very few views because no
03:17 one wants to be lectured to however you
03:21 know there's two folks that I have found
03:25 in the world you know there's a person
03:28 who is striving to create a version of
03:31 themselves that they would call being
03:33 grown up and then there's a bunch of
03:34 people that don't want to be preached to
03:35 because they understand they haven't
03:37 grown up you know of course there's the
03:40 third which they do know they're totally
03:43 well formed and fully formed and they
03:45 don't need to be talked at by anyone so
03:49 is it just some of my thoughts you know
03:52 my angle on the whole thing is that I
03:54 grew up in the Midwest and in the
03:56 Midwest you have a lot of wisdom and
03:58 knowledge handed down from older people
03:59 you know a lot more people in the
04:01 Midwest than you ever know in the city
04:03 like hundreds of times more people in a
04:06 small town if you're in town of 10,000
04:08 people the likelihood that you know
04:10 5,000 of them is pretty high but if you
04:13 grew up in a town like Los Angeles for
04:16 all the surrounding people's about 25
04:17 million people I think you'd be lucky to
04:20 know 100 but no the wave at them another
04:23 whole family history who's related to
04:25 who and etc etc so there's just a lot of
04:28 things I had imparted on me when I was a
04:31 kid that I think it's missing from the
04:33 big the big world you know 104 is about
04:38 the alien invasion hoax Wernher von
04:41 Braun's assistant in the late 70s prior
04:44 to his passing I believe in 78 said that
04:46 he claimed that the government was going
04:48 to try and create a fake alien invasion
04:51 to kick off a new world order by making
04:53 everyone panic in
04:54 side the barn so I go through who is
04:58 actually rumored that this would
04:59 actually occur and then we just start
05:01 dissecting how on earth would this
05:03 actually be done let's just say it's our
05:05 job and we have to fake alien
05:09 landings aliens and you know UFOs in the
05:11 sky and so it's actually a fairly what I
05:14 would say healthy exercise and perhaps
05:17 dismissing the option or giving it some
05:22 validity and then if it ever happens if
05:24 you've seen this episode you won't panic
05:26 as much as other folks who will be
05:27 panicking 105 the age of robotics this
05:33 episode is about this coming age of
05:36 Robotics where we're going from factory
05:38 floor robots that aren't the slightest
05:40 bit you know formidable to the ones that
05:44 are now going to start policing the
05:46 streets writing you traffic tickets
05:48 perhaps you know conducting riot
05:52 suppression activities you know in
05:55 Dallas when they have the shooter in
05:57 Dallas last year you know they killed
05:59 them with a robot so I talked a lot
06:03 about thx 1-1 3-8 as well which is I
06:06 believe a full prophecy of what the
06:09 world will be if we don't make some
06:10 serious changes 106 is character
06:14 development this is for those of you
06:16 interested in writing screenplays I have
06:17 probably four videos on screenplays and
06:19 a screenplay list doesn't get watched
06:22 that much because obviously you guys are
06:23 coming in for a different you know realm
06:26 of information what I will tell you
06:27 about the whole thing going back to
06:29 season or schepis ode I believe it's
06:32 seven and it says it's eight
06:33 unfortunately I should watch on a vid me
06:35 where I corrected it you know if you
06:39 think to yourself well I don't screen
06:40 right there's no reason for me to watch
06:41 this I would suggest you go back to that
06:44 season 1 episode 7 and watch it because
06:48 you may actually have a story in you and
06:50 even though I'm talking about the format
06:52 of screenplays it's completely
06:54 indicative of writing in any format that
06:56 you want from monta novel the stage play
06:59 to teleplay so you may have a talent in
07:01 you that you just are unaware of and i
07:04 would love to see what you create 1:07
07:07 pause
07:08 activity again not a lot of views it's
07:12 sort of a you know a feel-good self-help
07:15 episode but the idea is in this episode
07:18 is that we know we need to be positive
07:20 to get through life but some people
07:22 don't know they need to be positive to
07:23 get through life and sometimes without
07:26 actually saying it hey you know being
07:30 positive is an art being positive is
07:32 something that you can pretend to be and
07:34 your body will follow your emotions will
07:37 follow you can put a smile on your face
07:39 when you don't feel like smiling and
07:41 suddenly it'll make you feel better but
07:45 so I go through sort of my what my
07:48 coming-of-age and my sort of awareness
07:53 that this is something you need to
07:54 discuss otherwise you don't really have
07:56 a grasp of the benefits of it want to
08:00 wait
08:01 alien intent this is sort of breaking
08:04 down the idea that we love to believe in
08:07 aliens because it's just a luring right
08:08 I mean the idea of meeting of you know
08:12 potentially a race from another planet
08:14 that's millions of years old or another
08:16 dimension or what have you but what we
08:18 really do is say what would they need
08:20 from mankind by putting ourselves in
08:23 their shoes we can reverse engineer some
08:26 basic thoughts about perhaps what we
08:29 would look forward to if they would
08:31 arrive here and sort of dismiss some of
08:33 the low-hanging fruit of what they
08:34 probably wouldn't be interested in and
08:37 this is obviously peppered into a lot of
08:39 other alien episodes but this is going
08:41 straight at the jugular 109 is the
08:44 apocalypse the apocalypse is something
08:48 that you know Preppers get into I may
08:50 actually do an episode on Preppers in
08:52 season 3 but this sort of breaks down
08:55 you know what would our apocalypse be
08:58 why would it be brought about how would
09:01 it be brought about and you know perhaps
09:04 how will we you know survive it because
09:08 again we talk about a lot of things for
09:10 the romantic arc of the storyline but we
09:12 don't really talk about the metadata and
09:14 the subtext of what we're talking about
09:16 you know who would do such a thing what
09:19 would they do what would it mean except
09:21 right 110 is reptilian aliens for any of
09:26 you who've studied David Icke you have
09:28 definitely bumped into this theory even
09:30 if you don't know about David Icke and
09:31 in the UK he's the one that really you
09:35 know brought in the forefront reptilian
09:37 aliens have been part of cultures for
09:40 thousands and thousands of years and so
09:43 what I do is I break down sort of where
09:46 this came from or the designation
09:48 reptilian came from out of you know Carl
09:51 Sagan's rFactor brain essentially you
09:54 know those who run the world tend to be
09:56 very stoic and obviously don't seem to
09:59 have any empathy or sympathy for
10:01 humanity and so calling them reptilian
10:04 aliens is very easy because they tend to
10:07 behave and that our factor brain type
10:09 but we talk about the principles of
10:11 shape-shifting what that would mean the
10:14 idea that the queen is a lizard and all
10:16 these other things and how they're
10:17 supposedly slipping out of their shape
10:19 on TV we talk about those goofy videos
10:21 on YouTube where the compression codec
10:24 has failed because someone had a shitty
10:25 connection but they're recording their
10:27 screen and every time there's an
10:28 artifact in their face
10:29 where they move it creates seemingly you
10:33 know slit eyes and a bunch of other
10:35 artifacts and I break it down for you so
10:37 you understand that is not them
10:39 shape-shifting back into their native
10:41 form that's just a video codec problem
10:43 111 fake space programs you know you
10:47 love it we all know that JPL and NASA
10:51 are essentially in the picture selling
10:54 business making 60 million dollars a day
10:57 that they can then filter into military
10:59 research what have you their idea is
11:01 that you would never pay for a war
11:03 machine constantly building up where
11:05 they're doing missile research and
11:07 Tomahawk missile stuff right and Moab
11:09 [ __ ] and so we essentially break down
11:13 where their Achilles heel is and there's
11:17 several Kili SEALs
11:18 obviously this is metabolised up into
11:20 what we now know us flat earth fodder
11:24 because when you can't trust your space
11:26 program and that your your mouth pieces
11:31 like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye
11:34 simply are experts in memorizing and
11:36 repeating things and not really using
11:38 their brain you get a really [ __ ] up
11:40 society right 112 destination dream this
11:45 continues a dream series that I started
11:47 in season one this is really about what
11:50 is the dream world that we're in you
11:53 know we go to sleep what are the
11:56 attributes of of your dreams and you
11:59 know I always pose the question why do
12:00 we dream you know we when we're asleep
12:04 our bodies are completely functional our
12:06 brains are completely functional yes
12:08 they're sort of on a reduced energy
12:11 consumption model but I think that in
12:15 parsing the dreams the dream series on
12:17 this show has actually brought for it so
12:19 many amazing correlations between us as
12:22 people we don't really sit around and
12:24 compare dream notes and this shows been
12:26 able to get people to talk about stuff
12:28 and compare things and it's really
12:30 fascinating 1:13 perception I'm just
12:35 going to go real quickly to this one
12:37 this episode is all about being aware
12:41 that you have a perception which creates
12:43 a paradigm I've got a paradigm episode
12:45 come and so I'm not going to duplicate
12:46 too much on this but this is to make
12:48 sure that you understand that everything
12:50 that you see is based on your eyes your
12:53 ability to take in the five senses that
12:56 you have and create a reality out of it
13:00 essentially the next one up is a special
13:04 report called no 4 no forests on flat
13:06 earth for those of you who are aware of
13:08 this there was a Russian gentleman that
13:10 proposed an interesting theory that a
13:13 lot of the mountains that we see that
13:15 are made of silicon hexagons are
13:18 actually the byproduct of big giant
13:21 silicon trees that used to litter the
13:23 earth although there's very few stumps
13:25 to prove them that they exist and I
13:28 essentially got into it I listened to
13:30 the the original episode when it was in
13:32 its original Russian before it was
13:34 subtitled so you know it wasn't the most
13:38 complete review of his theory because it
13:42 was sort of hard to understand them but
13:43 I think I got the gist of it but I call
13:47 [ __ ]
13:48 inside my special casino 114 alien
13:52 abductions this is just based on the
13:56 absurdity in my mind that you know that
13:58 the people like Whitney streamer Whitley
14:02 Strieber will have you believe that all
14:03 of the mysteries of mankind and humanity
14:06 are inside our [ __ ] and that aliens
14:08 have to come down and do massive
14:11 exploration anally to figure out where
14:13 you know what but what we're hiding up
14:16 in there you know keep us human I can
14:19 only imagine that with each trooper has
14:21 some sort of anal regiment and in order
14:22 to explain to his part ologist he came
14:25 up with this idea next up is a special
14:29 report on the Netflix original series
14:31 stranger things which I was very
14:34 captivated by and it went around
14:36 Southern California in it just a
14:38 whirlwind of people saying oh my god you
14:40 got to see this you got to see this some
14:42 of the folks that watch this show were
14:44 very concerned but what was about some
14:47 of the negativity now MKULTRA episode
14:49 101 is actually inside the stranger
14:51 things show it's an encounter program
14:53 that the girl does have some obviously
14:56 supernatural capabilities and so they
14:58 sort of whitewash it but they talk about
15:00 MKULTRA in the show and so a lot of
15:02 folks were concerned about the negative
15:05 imagery going out to the public my
15:08 opinion is it was good that if anyone
15:11 watches stranger things and then types
15:12 into YouTube or Google MKULTRA they're
15:16 going to be heavily educated on the
15:18 extent of which the intelligence
15:20 agencies will go to figure out the human
15:23 mind including torturing human beings
15:26 115 existentialism I'm going to tell you
15:30 that I'm personally extremely proud of
15:32 this episode you know what I do is I I
15:35 tie around with the notion that you know
15:39 what if what if one of the biggest
15:40 secrets of the universe is that you
15:42 actually control it your instance of the
15:45 universe and you believe you can't
15:47 because you think that other people own
15:49 other areas of their life and perhaps
15:52 they do but if nothing else your halo
15:55 influence in your own life might be
15:57 heavily controlled by you which will
15:59 then give you
16:01 amazing control of your future 116
16:04 findings story this is another
16:06 screenplay writing episode it's all I
16:08 got 156 views which is really funny one
16:11 of the hardest things you do when you're
16:12 writing a screenplay or a story of any
16:13 kind is to find your story you have a
16:16 premise in your head which is maybe
16:18 someone travels through time but you
16:20 don't have a reason why anyone gives a
16:22 [ __ ] and this is an episode based on
16:25 this and I should say I was writing a
16:29 script at the time which was very
16:31 intense and a sequel to an existing
16:33 franchise and so I was knee-deep in this
16:36 and trying to figure out why no one
16:37 cared about the second sequel so they we
16:40 so that they we care about the third
16:42 sequel which is the one I wrote 117 the
16:47 physics of symbolism this breaks down
16:51 that we all know about symbols in our
16:56 world we know about sacred geometry but
17:00 what I put forth is you know when you
17:03 draw something in the ground or carve
17:05 something out of stone you are
17:07 controlling the frequencies in the
17:09 universe when they hit that shape right
17:12 so you put a pentagram on your forehead
17:14 you are now disturbing light being
17:16 absorbed into your head to the degree
17:18 that the ink can disturb the frequency
17:20 so you know there's a possibility that
17:24 there's a real science to manipulating
17:27 reality with symbols but if nothing else
17:30 the warning goes out be careful what you
17:32 put on your body be careful what you put
17:34 around your house because you may be
17:36 drawing certain frequencies that are bad
17:39 for you and it may not be related to a
17:41 devil or anything it just might be that
17:43 when you mess with frequencies at
17:45 certain stages at certain places into
17:47 certain degrees you may actually end up
17:49 causing yourself harm so be careful 118
17:54 GMO foods genetically modified organisms
17:59 is a new product created by a company
18:01 called Monsanto because they make a
18:03 product called roundup which is made
18:05 from a chemical called glyphosate GMO
18:08 foods in a nutshell is essentially the
18:11 ability to
18:13 reduce world population through
18:16 sterilization because you're eating a
18:18 terminated gene sequence you're also
18:20 eating a toxin which can give you cancer
18:22 you don't take your vitamins and it's
18:25 something we should stop at our earliest
18:27 convenience
18:29 119 cognitive dissidence a very popular
18:33 word that none of us knew until YouTube
18:34 existed as my friend Jud skeptic would
18:36 say this is the ability to look at
18:39 reality see it for all that it is and
18:41 then [ __ ] yourself that it's not
18:43 because it's an inconvenient truth for
18:45 you once you build up the motor inside
18:47 your mind to lie to yourself there's
18:50 nothing that will stop the lies from
18:52 manifesting when someone tells you
18:53 something - doesn't make any sense
18:54 there's a warm fuzzy in there because
18:56 you've got a machine in your brain a
18:58 cogwheel
18:59 collection in your mind that says oh
19:01 yeah I love it when I totally lie to
19:03 myself and I double-talk myself
19:04 doublespeak myself right so that's what
19:07 this is about 120 fictional realities
19:11 well we all know people have those right
19:14 this is essentially a deep dive into the
19:16 art of creating fictional realities so
19:20 that we can deal with life and it's
19:23 obviously become a disease on one side
19:26 it doesn't harm anyone half the time
19:28 where you just want to pretend like you
19:30 just have a false ego that helps you get
19:34 through everyday you know anyone who's a
19:36 celebrity has to deal with fictional
19:38 realities because they look in the
19:40 mirror and put you know they take craps
19:42 they put one leg in and a pant leg at a
19:44 time and they know that they're normal
19:47 on the inside they just have a talent
19:50 that makes them feel bigger than life
19:51 but it's now become a disease where it's
19:54 fake news it's you know folks that don't
19:56 want to deal with anything that's
19:58 remotely tough in life 1:21 false Flags
20:02 man who doesn't know what a false flag
20:04 is this is when your government
20:06 conspires against you to create an event
20:09 that is blamed on one group but it's
20:11 actually self created such that you will
20:13 rationalize war it's almost always that
20:16 case or they're trying to put you in
20:18 such a state of trauma that they can
20:20 program your mind which is where you
20:22 need to go and look at
20:25 season one left-brain right-brain
20:26 episode 122 finding god this isn't a
20:32 religious episode this is really about
20:34 the various debates of who God could be
20:37 who God might be and sort of the path
20:41 that you would take to take what you
20:44 know and what you've experienced and
20:46 find some celestial central
20:47 consciousness within your ability to
20:49 believe 123 surveillance well I am in an
20:56 episode in season one that's called how
20:58 they spy on you and this is essentially
21:00 a more focused advancement on
21:01 specifically the surveillance that's in
21:04 the world for those of you worried about
21:06 watching this show
21:07 belonging to a Facebook group and
21:09 getting sucked into the system just be
21:11 aware that I'm aware of that and I duly
21:16 apologize and hope that you know and
21:17 pray at some point we have an option
21:19 that isn't so embedded 1:24 calming your
21:24 soul I've had an amazing response from
21:27 this episode from people that need it
21:29 and if you feel like you need your soul
21:34 calm that you're a little bit more tight
21:36 chested or what-have-you
21:38 based on the reviews that I've gotten
21:40 from this episode it's quite effective
21:42 for giving you the means to recognize
21:45 what's making you stressed out and to
21:48 give you means to calm down that that
21:51 stress because you don't deserve any of
21:53 that and it'll just it'll make you sick
21:55 eventually 1:25 getting back up the key
22:00 to life is getting back up as Samson
22:04 said in the HBO series carnivàle dying
22:06 is the easy part
22:08 living is the hard part that's all about
22:10 getting back up again your humble
22:13 narrator has gotten up several times in
22:16 his lifetime and so I do feel like I
22:18 come with a certain level of expertise
22:19 for at least what I need to get up I've
22:22 had a pretty good response from this one
22:23 as well the next episode was a flat
22:27 earth the SIOP special report and this
22:31 is sort of where a lot of people are now
22:34 they're in between the globe earth and
22:36 flat earth and they accuse the Flat
22:38 Earth of being a saw
22:39 so what I do is I go through the
22:41 benefits of it being a PSYOP what on
22:44 earth would someone gain by making us
22:47 distrust NASA and JPL distrusting you
22:51 know the heliocentric globe model it's a
22:54 it's a fascinating thing and there's
22:56 this document called the cognitive
22:58 infiltration I believe I talked about in
22:59 this episode which was posted by one of
23:02 you thank God and so we just review it
23:05 1:26 secrecy this is based on a
23:09 conversation I have with the bartender
23:10 and she kicked off a very interesting
23:14 conversation about how she can't get
23:17 into religion because there's too much
23:18 secrecy around religion she's really
23:20 talking about the Vatican for the most
23:22 part but it really kicked off the idea
23:24 that we do have secret societies which
23:26 we all sort of you know poopoo and we
23:29 say look we don't wanna be involved with
23:30 that but we have a lot of normal
23:32 institutions that exercise complete
23:34 secrecy and I'm not talking about Apple
23:36 Computer auditing the iPhone 8 I'm
23:38 talking about
23:38 you know religious institutions that
23:40 have these coveted secret chambers and
23:44 rooms and processes and that sort of
23:46 thing 127 friendship sounds fufu right
23:52 it sounds a little self elcome booyah
23:54 trust me it's got value for you the main
23:57 thing is is that we miscategorized
23:59 people all the time as being friends
24:02 best friends when they're really just
24:03 acquaintances the other thing I get into
24:06 is before you call someone your friend
24:08 there should be something that defines
24:10 that it's not that you just like being
24:12 with them you are willing to sacrifice
24:14 for them a little bit for best friends
24:16 there's almost nothing that you won't do
24:18 for them and you have a yearning every
24:20 day to be with them some of you are
24:22 married to them thank God 1:28 this is a
24:26 really popular episode it's called the
24:29 space exists what I put forth in this
24:33 episode is that I have tons of buddies
24:35 that have been in the special effects
24:36 industry their entire lives for 25 plus
24:39 years and none of them have dreamed
24:41 about being in space even though they
24:43 create all the space scenes and all the
24:44 television shows all the movies that
24:46 you've seen and I think out of every
24:49 single person that's commented we've
24:50 only had like two or three people
24:51 claimed to have
24:53 dream in space being on a Star Trek
24:55 Enterprise I talk about the fact I've
24:57 seen every single Star Trek episode from
24:59 this 1967 all the way up to 2005 at
25:02 least twice if not four or five times
25:05 and I've never had a single dream about
25:07 being on the Star Trek Enterprise but if
25:10 I play fallout 4 for two or three hours
25:12 I dreaming about being in a
25:14 post-apocalyptic world so what's the
25:16 problem with dreaming about space
25:17 perhaps it doesn't exist 1:29
25:21 consciousness well what is consciousness
25:25 is basically what we go through with
25:28 this and I'm just going to leave it at
25:30 that 1:30 this episode's done really
25:34 well it's called them now a lot of times
25:37 you'll find yourself in a conspiracy
25:39 conversation and you're talking about
25:40 banking cartels royal families and
25:43 various other kind of deep state shadow
25:45 government agencies and them as who
25:48 we're talking about and you're the
25:49 people on the other side of conversation
25:51 will sometimes say well who's them and
25:53 they think they got you right they don't
25:56 have to deal with reality because
25:57 they've got a little loophole for
25:59 pushing out running away right this
26:03 episode talks all about who they are and
26:05 their motives and what they're really
26:07 scared of which is us taking away things
26:09 from them which honestly if they just
26:11 leave us the [ __ ] alone we would leave
26:13 them alone 131 mass media woo boy this
26:18 was recorded way before the election was
26:21 super duper hot and they're in the form
26:24 of fake names accusation so this gets
26:27 hit essentially where media was before
26:30 mass media took over our perception of
26:32 the world and it's a really good
26:34 precursor to a couple of their episodes
26:36 that are coming here
26:37 132 fabric of society well whether or
26:42 not we like it or not we're all
26:43 connected and there are a lot of forces
26:45 and thought processes and paradigms that
26:48 we adopt to consider ourselves a society
26:52 it's a very fragile connection that can
26:55 be easily
26:56 I think tampered with which is your
26:59 false Flags come in and mass media comes
27:01 in coincidentally and so that's what
27:04 this episode is about
27:06 1:33 morality this is really about the
27:10 idea that we don't want to be tied down
27:13 and have someone preached us and tell us
27:15 what we can and can't think right but
27:18 morality degradation unchecked can lead
27:22 to some severe problems for society
27:24 right so you watch a little bit of porn
27:26 you're like eh I just watched a little
27:27 bit of porn it's cool unchecked that
27:29 vector goes way off the rails really
27:32 quick and starts really [ __ ] up
27:33 society creating pedophiles creating
27:35 rapes because in their mind they want
27:38 something that no woman wants to give
27:40 them no child should ever be involved in
27:42 and so they cross that line and that's
27:43 where you've got a we've got to take
27:45 some lessons from our elders the reason
27:47 why everyone was uptight in the 50s was
27:49 that morality had become this
27:51 hand-me-down group of wisdom which
27:54 although brilliant and the way society
27:55 would actually prosper it wasn't well
27:57 explained because they've been passed
27:59 down so much we didn't know why we were
28:01 passing it down and this gets at the
28:04 heart of the matter
28:06 1:34 episode I'm fairly proud of the
28:08 Roswell UFO crash in 1947 I will simply
28:12 say this is all about the crash I went
28:15 into this with a complete angle and
28:18 theme to debunk the [ __ ] out of this and
28:20 I had my ass handed to me to the point I
28:24 now believe that something did crash and
28:26 something was out of this world I do not
28:28 believe it was a weather balloon I don't
28:30 believe it was some covert aircraft
28:32 blamed on the Russians I link in the
28:35 description all of the videos that I
28:37 believe for the interviews that were the
28:38 most compelling so enjoy
28:40 135 dreamed reality this episode is
28:45 about potentially our dreams are another
28:50 reality we think we live in this reality
28:54 because it's so clear it's so vivid
28:56 the five senses are pumping when you go
28:58 into a dream obviously you'll lose a lot
29:00 of your senses especially the
29:02 instrumentalities of your body so we
29:05 analyzed the difference between the two
29:08 1:36 a cashless society our cashless
29:11 society there is a giant force to take
29:14 away cash from our pockets
29:18 on one level it makes complete technical
29:20 sense why the hell would you want to
29:21 have a pocket full of change why would
29:23 you want to have to carry a $20 bill and
29:24 all this kind of stuff in a perfect
29:27 society with good people running the
29:29 world empathetic non reptilian people
29:31 running the world this would be
29:32 fantastic I totally support it the
29:35 problem is those [ __ ] I'm sorry the
29:37 good people don't run the world the
29:39 [ __ ] around the world and therefore
29:40 the ramifications on society is
29:44 horrifying
29:45 that they could control you completely
29:48 by controlling your credit stick right
29:50 1:37 is called the awakening this is
29:55 really what it sounds like for those of
29:56 you who've gone from a state of almost
29:58 you know comatose
30:01 matrix living to a side where you
30:05 realize maybe you can't trust what you
30:07 thought you could trust there's a lot of
30:08 emotional arcs with that and there's a
30:10 lot of problems with trying to inform
30:14 your loved ones that you're going
30:15 through this experience and so this is
30:18 an episode for you to try and compare
30:20 notes for what's happened to me
30:22 personally what I've heard is happen to
30:23 other folks to hopefully soften the blow
30:25 and give you some tools to be awake but
30:28 not be a you know perceived as crazy
30:31 1:38 empathy empathy and sympathy are
30:34 often confused feeling sorry for someone
30:37 is sympathy feeling what they feel is
30:39 empathy there are forces whether it be
30:42 intentional or non-intentional that are
30:44 successfully erasing empathy out of this
30:46 world no one gives a [ __ ] about anyone
30:48 else anymore they don't think about
30:50 anyone elses feelings when they do
30:51 something 1:39 interdimensional life
30:56 well aliens could come from another
30:59 planet or they could come from another
31:00 dimension in this episode we look
31:02 through all of the implications of what
31:04 that would mean you know where would
31:06 they be how would they be here perhaps
31:08 they're here where they're in a
31:08 different frequency perhaps they're
31:10 observing with us observing us tampering
31:12 with us and again we we always reflect
31:17 back on if you had this capability of
31:19 traveling three dimensions what on earth
31:20 would you need from mankind 140 freedom
31:25 from religion religion is a control
31:28 apparatus to make us tax ourselves
31:30 that's why I was originally
31:31 created is to keep the people from being
31:34 chaotic
31:35 it builds morality into behavior as I
31:38 had to describe to me religion is the
31:40 first time that someone could get
31:41 married and stay connected because there
31:43 was a paradigm of commitment and there
31:45 was a paradigm of protection whereas
31:47 someone is not supposed to cheat on
31:49 someone else
31:50 this also frees you up from being
31:53 controlled by a religious apparatus it
31:56 doesn't say you have to give up religion
31:58 it just says you should have a
32:00 perspective of what it is to be perhaps
32:04 a spiritual person but outside of the
32:09 paradigm of manmade stories 141 code of
32:13 man okay so say you're free from
32:17 religion then what is going to hold
32:19 together the morality of man we don't
32:23 have a code of man that is taught in
32:25 schools a lot of folks know about common
32:27 law do no harm this is what this is
32:30 about if we're going to free ourselves
32:33 of man-made religions which are there to
32:35 tax and repress and to control then we
32:39 have to have replace it with something
32:40 that is coming from a secular standpoint
32:42 doesn't erase spirituality but we have
32:44 to have some basic rules which we do
32:46 have laws we have Constitution we know
32:49 how to behave but most of those are
32:51 derived from religion so there are
32:54 benefits on both sides
32:57 1:42 alien spicing this episode is about
33:01 the fact that the missing link from
33:04 anthropology is massive there's no
33:07 explanation of how we went from hominid
33:08 to homeless avian sapien it does appear
33:11 and I've said it in just a recent
33:13 episode it does appear that we are
33:16 spliced that we have been created almost
33:19 instantaneously in the timeline of this
33:21 planet whether it be God or an alien
33:23 something used what was here to create a
33:27 basis for what we are there's genetic
33:30 blockers and stuff I talked about as
33:32 well if you dig 142 definitely see
33:34 episode 2 from season 1 evolution 143
33:39 from the void this is a concept put
33:43 forth by a
33:45 so for Jean Bossier Lord he was a French
33:47 philosopher who said that voids are
33:51 wonderful because voids create invention
33:53 he talks about in the book Walt Disney
33:56 being stuck in Missouri and having to in
34:00 order to entertain himself and create
34:02 something exciting for his mind he
34:05 became an animator first an illustrator
34:07 cartoonist and an animator and we have
34:10 to allow voids to exist in our life in
34:13 order to invent with cell phones
34:16 especially it kills the void it kills
34:18 society's invention America has been
34:21 known as a country that invents you're
34:23 opposed in that country a set of
34:24 countries that invents if we get too
34:26 strung out on cell phones and other
34:28 [ __ ] pastimes we will train our
34:31 children to be as stupid as stupid can
34:33 be and believe me you don't want to live
34:35 in that world
34:37 1:44 being offended in this episode are
34:41 basically assert that only children get
34:44 offended adults don't get offended and
34:48 what I say is being offended the
34:49 [ __ ] emotion you're either pissed
34:51 off at you're not but being offended
34:54 adds a little bit of extortion on to
34:57 being angry being offended says you
35:01 offended me
35:02 therefore you owe me a prize and that's
35:05 all that is to think about the
35:07 presidential campaign of 2016 Hillary
35:12 Clinton runs on a platform of being
35:15 offended and you over the presidency
35:17 because you can be offended you can't
35:20 hire someone else to do the job because
35:22 he offended right 145 focus focus is
35:31 something like positivity someone has to
35:33 remind you that you must do it there's a
35:36 great book out there that I'm reading
35:37 right now called the one thing and I'm
35:39 going to probably do an episode on it
35:41 but it is essentially focus pick
35:45 something in the beginning of your day
35:47 that is imperative it is the most
35:49 important thing that you can accomplish
35:51 today to get the biggest goal that you
35:54 have in your life and just focus on it
35:56 but I talked about my mentors
35:59 teaching me about this 146 the dream
36:02 room sort of an extension from
36:05 destination dream we simply break down
36:09 all of the elements of what makes up a
36:14 dream why you know how is the dream
36:16 realm different than this room and again
36:18 what is reality between the two 147
36:22 taking charge this one has actually also
36:24 done extremely well with the folks that
36:26 like the calming your soul and getting
36:28 back up video taking charge is another
36:33 one of these things if someone just
36:34 simply needs to whisper it in your ear
36:35 but once in a while Tara tell you to
36:37 your face it's time to take charge
36:39 you've been waiting around for someone
36:41 to give the command let's give the
36:43 command let's roll and sometimes that's
36:46 all it takes so this is my little gift
36:48 to you to hopefully get you to get up
36:52 and go right 148 do Tomic bombs exist
36:57 this is one of my favorite subjects I
37:00 just was talking about it last night but
37:02 the idea is did they fake the atomic
37:06 bombs that we have seen go off around
37:08 the world simply using conventional T
37:10 and T e regime onaka shot Nagasaki
37:14 should be absolutely radioactive today
37:16 but they're not they're fine a lot of
37:18 pictures of firebomb Tokyo were actually
37:22 passed off as Hiroshima so there seems
37:26 to be a correlation between what they
37:28 claimed to have happened from an atomic
37:30 bomb and what is actually happened to
37:31 Tokyo vers using fire bombing so we're
37:35 not sure but I break it all down in
37:37 there
37:38 149 patients we all know we need it we
37:44 don't like to be lectured about it but
37:46 this episode is actually done extremely
37:48 well with the comments of people who
37:49 have actually finished the episode to
37:51 say that it really does call out the
37:53 various elements of what patience is 150
37:57 marketing probably the most definitive
38:01 conspiracy body on planet earth is a
38:04 marketing department what is their job
38:06 to sell you [ __ ] you don't need and
38:08 convince you that you need it if the
38:10 definition of a conspiracy is two or
38:12 more people
38:12 conspiring against another one or more
38:16 people than marketing departments are
38:18 exactly that definition so what I tried
38:20 to do is pull your head out of marketing
38:23 so you can see it so it's like they live
38:25 by John Carpenter you see the
38:27 brainwashing within marketing and you
38:29 avoid developing loves for things that
38:31 you don't need so you can save your
38:32 money and do something else much more
38:34 powerful in your life with that same
38:36 resource 151 telepathic sales so this
38:42 isn't my idea but the someone noticed
38:44 that the double helix you know created
38:47 by nucleic acid that makes your DNA is
38:49 shaped exactly like an antenna we know
38:52 the universe is nothing but a ton of
38:53 frequencies so would seem that we have
38:57 the ability to communicate between us
38:58 and we know this from experiments
39:00 without actually communicating with
39:02 words and so we are a hive mind right
39:07 and we could give you existentialism a
39:09 few episodes coming up here you'll also
39:12 realize that you actually control the
39:15 world when you learn a new word and you
39:16 start hearing it all the time it's not
39:17 simply because the you now recognize the
39:19 pattern it's because you're projecting
39:21 it into your future
39:23 1:52 the shift this actually did way
39:27 better than I thought and it was an
39:28 episode that I created where we're now
39:30 getting to a point in society we can see
39:32 fake news we do know that our
39:34 politicians are [ __ ] and I think that
39:37 with obviously the recent changes in
39:39 America we're seeing a shift it's it's
39:44 you know put up or shut up you know
39:48 don't say you're our leader and don't
39:50 lead us don't say that you're an
39:52 American president and don't do [ __ ]
39:54 dick for the company the other country
39:55 excuse me right
39:56 doesn't matter what side of the fence
39:58 you're on we've had some doozies
40:02 1:53 heaven and hell I think it's absurd
40:06 the definition of heaven and hell is
40:08 utterly absurd both cases there's no
40:11 need to be punished forever for anything
40:12 that you did and there's no reason that
40:15 you'd ever want to be in any nirvana
40:16 state of pure happiness constantly
40:20 doesn't make any sense you wouldn't be
40:21 able to know what happiness was after a
40:23 few hundred years because unless you
40:26 rotate through all the emotions on the
40:28 color wheel of thought and feeling
40:30 you're not going to notice what
40:33 positivity is versus negativity right
40:37 1:54 life before 9/11 so those of you
40:42 are at least 40 years old or above
40:45 you'll remember that life was pretty
40:47 [ __ ] awesome before 9/11 the problem
40:50 is is that we haven't taken up any
40:53 objectives to erase all these tyrannical
40:57 control mechanisms like the TSA it needs
40:59 to [ __ ] go away you know for people
41:02 to [ __ ] and moan about a border north
41:04 or south on the American soil but they
41:06 keep the TSA it's [ __ ] ridiculous
41:09 you're trying to catch terrorists coming
41:10 into the country but you don't care if
41:11 they walk across the border give me a
41:13 break
41:14 we need to work to undo everything
41:17 that's happened since 9/11 in terms of
41:19 roading our laws getting rid of
41:21 surveillance the violations of the all
41:24 attend Bill of Rights
41:27 155 throughout all the episodes I will
41:31 mention references to Twilight Zone
41:32 episodes and so I thought I'd take a
41:34 time take time out to really call out
41:36 the episodes that I think are fantastic
41:37 if you've not watched every single
41:40 Twilight Zone episode which i think is
41:41 around a hundred ninety you're in for a
41:43 treat
41:43 and even if you have and you haven't
41:46 watched them since you've awakened
41:48 you'll be absolutely shocked at how
41:50 unbelievably awake Rod Serling was who
41:53 made the show it's Rod Serling not Rod
41:56 Stirling I see that in the commentary
42:00 one small one fifty six Fame this is a
42:03 garage episode I remember this actually
42:06 that's quite a few views this is
42:10 actually very important if you've ever
42:11 sought out Fame I have been very blessed
42:14 in my lifetime to work with very famous
42:16 people and I mean ridiculously famous
42:18 people household words I see their lives
42:21 and I see the ones that have dealt with
42:23 it beautifully and I've seen folks get
42:26 eaten alive by it and so in this episode
42:29 i reaiiy tamai x' what fame is and I
42:33 dismiss virtually every element of it
42:35 until you hopefully no longer have the
42:38 desire to be famous you
42:39 have the desire to accomplish something
42:41 in your life and you know that if you do
42:43 create something in your life this
42:44 wonderful fame follows all right one57
42:49 finding the matrix there's a lot of talk
42:52 about the world being a simulation and
42:54 so what this episode is about is to
42:57 itemize what we see in this reality and
42:59 see what part of it actually feels like
43:02 a computerized matrix you know and
43:05 regardless of how you want to parse
43:07 reality it does behave like a computer
43:09 it does doesn't mean we're in a goddamn
43:11 computer but who cares if we were 158
43:15 betrayal
43:16 very simple if you've ever been betrayed
43:19 and you are struggling with that the
43:21 byproduct and the damage of being
43:23 betrayed in your life and you want to be
43:25 free from that feeling you want control
43:28 over your life this episodes for you
43:31 their humble narrator has experienced
43:33 several versions of betrayal 159 cult
43:39 tribal news eventually did make a fake
43:42 news episode but tribal news is the
43:46 precursor to say we are tribalistic
43:48 about where we get our news from
43:50 essentially who we allowed to paint
43:53 reality in our lives right I think that
43:56 we have made the mistake of allowing too
44:02 many people the privilege of telling us
44:04 what our reality is and I think we've
44:06 over blown what we need to know about
44:09 other parts of the world but this is
44:12 essentially the episode about the
44:13 loyalty to your news source and our
44:18 yourself from it 160 atomic life this
44:22 really talks about the fact that all
44:24 mass in the universe that creates us
44:27 potentially has an equal role in
44:31 communicating because let's face it we
44:34 we are beings that can store information
44:36 about our lives and we are beings that
44:38 can communicate information that we have
44:40 attained and somehow we say that that my
44:45 barbeque out here and a couple furniture
44:48 items I have here in the whole house
44:49 itself doesn't have that capability but
44:53 when you really break
44:54 the fact that we're all made of the same
44:55 stuff there's no reason why it shouldn't
44:57 be 161 aliens among us this really talks
45:03 about all the theories that we have
45:05 aliens that live here on earth the
45:07 claims that we have you know 27 species
45:10 of aliens some would look like us don't
45:12 something again walk among us and they
45:14 have like bizarre eyes and noses and
45:16 that kind of stuff it's kind of funny
45:17 when you look at it but I also break
45:19 down essentially how fragile is the
45:22 definition of alien life what is that
45:24 you know is it a weird shrimp or is it
45:29 something that has to have almond eyes
45:31 right 162 this is an episode I'm fairly
45:35 proud of called paradigms and it's all
45:38 about how we form reality through
45:41 creating rule sets that become paradigms
45:44 and it could be it's it's obviously
45:46 something that we need to do as children
45:48 so we can figure out where the hell we
45:50 are and interact with world but as we
45:52 get older it gets out of control and we
45:55 lose our own identity to the paradigms
45:57 and you know we can also make money with
45:59 some of the paradigms but in the end you
46:01 don't want to lose who you are as a
46:02 human being by doing it
46:05 163 nuclear holocaust so those of us
46:09 that question whether or not atomic
46:11 bombs exist it's an interesting proposal
46:15 that discuss the nuclear holocaust but
46:17 this episode goes with the fact that
46:19 they do exist or the idea that they do
46:21 exist and starts to analyze how absurd
46:24 the use of nuclear weapons are and so
46:27 the idea that we're currently right now
46:30 as of this recording you know worried
46:32 about North Korea who doesn't have a
46:34 nuclear bomb among them if they ever get
46:35 accused of detonating a nuclear bomb I
46:38 can guarantee you it's a false flag
46:39 coming from somewhere else
46:41 essentially this just breaks it down 160
46:44 for this episode is done extremely well
46:46 it's called the moon the moon if you
46:48 haven't delved into it as an extremely
46:51 mysterious object if you watch the
46:54 episodes coming up here called do
46:56 craters exist we'll get even further
46:58 into this but virtually every single
47:01 thing about the moon doesn't make any
47:02 sense at all and so I basically autumn
47:05 eyes that 165 is
47:07 done extremely well which is
47:09 moon-landing hoax part two I can assure
47:12 you they'll be part three in season
47:13 three for sure if not a couple we didn't
47:17 go to the moon really sorry if you
47:20 haven't seen the moon hoax video part
47:22 one and season one you'll definitely
47:23 want to see that before you watch this
47:24 episode
47:25 I've been debriefed at least once by
47:28 folks deep in NASA as you can probably
47:30 possibly get it said look we tried we
47:32 couldn't so we faked it so did everybody
47:35 else who faked all their other moon
47:36 should 166 entitlement this is all about
47:40 those social justice warriors about the
47:43 fabric of society that wants to
47:44 essentially give up on ever becoming
47:47 anything because society's [ __ ] up
47:48 education so kids are getting these 125
47:51 thousand dollar debts with no
47:52 opportunity or potential getting hired
47:55 and so their fallback plan is to hire
47:57 someone like Bernie Sanders to pass out
47:59 popsicles every single day so they don't
48:02 have to work 167 the mental coup the
48:07 mental coup is about that emotion you
48:09 have when you think you need to do
48:11 something drastic to change the world or
48:13 change your life and it's scary that you
48:17 don't think you should be having that
48:19 thought because well gosh you know just
48:20 not a violent thought or something like
48:22 that not all about violence or anything
48:23 but it's just about the notion of
48:25 engaging your mind at that level of
48:28 responsibility that unfortunately is
48:30 happening on our watch the world is
48:32 screwed up on our watch we need to do
48:33 things to fix it
48:36 168th creating the universe one of the
48:39 exercises you'll hear me do throughout
48:41 all the shows is we pretend that we are
48:43 hired to do something and once you put
48:45 yourself in the shoes of being hired to
48:47 take care of something it changes the
48:49 entire interpretation of everything that
48:52 you think is in the universe so we take
48:55 on the job of creating the universe
48:56 within this episode break it down I'm
48:58 actually kind of proud of this one 169
49:01 Morgellons disease well for those of you
49:05 who know this is a full breakdown of
49:06 Morgellons disease for those of you who
49:07 don't know this is the breakdown of what
49:11 is said to exist again I have never met
49:14 anyone who actually has it but I've seen
49:15 pretty convincing specials on TV about
49:18 it but who knows it could be all
49:19 [ __ ] but it says idea that
49:21 there's a fibrous growth that comes out
49:25 of crystal using the piezo effect we
49:27 think the crystals might be coming out
49:28 of either food supplies a lot of
49:30 chemtrails and it can create these
49:32 cylindrical wormy substances in your
49:37 mind we have found supposedly patented
49:39 nanotechnology for bioengineering in
49:42 human beings as a result of researching
49:44 Morgellons disease but knows 170 state
49:49 of mind this is right up there with
49:51 patients with positivity someone doesn't
49:55 remind you that everything that you
49:56 think at any one point in time is a
49:58 state of mind you may not have the
50:01 manual transmission on your
50:03 consciousness that you really really
50:04 want so it it talks about the state
50:08 change in your mind from second to
50:09 second have you ever been completely
50:11 phoric and then being completely angry
50:13 well there's a state change in your mind
50:15 that lets you switch between the two if
50:17 you recognize this is happening you gain
50:19 a tremendous amount of control over your
50:21 life so that's what this episode is
50:23 about 171 electrical universe super
50:27 proud of this episode there's a whole
50:30 set of emerging cosmologists that are
50:33 now wreaths rowing the creation of the
50:36 universe and a completely electrical
50:37 substrate this is using plasma energy
50:40 using hiring constructs like electrons
50:43 we use for electricity but it breaks it
50:46 down and it talks about all the
50:47 influences just within our solar system
50:49 of what that implication means 1/72
50:53 flutters revisited so this is an episode
50:56 just kind of rehashing and updating all
50:59 the current theories and thinking and
51:01 anomalies that the Flat Earth community
51:03 has to deal with 173 pendulum of belief
51:08 I love this one because it talks about
51:11 the oxymorons that people hold within
51:14 their systems they believe one thing but
51:15 not another thing right they are willing
51:17 to believe that there are alien bases on
51:20 the Dark Side of the Moon but they can't
51:22 possibly believe that the moon landing
51:25 was a hoax so they're able to believe
51:27 absolutely extreme ridiculous theories
51:29 and not ones that make complete sense
51:31 that you could back up the physics and
51:33 engineering
51:35 174 benefits of Flat Earth very simple
51:38 as one of my buddies said you know you
51:41 can ask someone why they think it's a
51:43 globe and they barely have any answers
51:45 if you ask them I think it's flat they
51:46 have hours and hours and hours of proofs
51:49 and so there is a great benefit to
51:52 studying Flat Earth to increase your
51:54 level of science to realize that NASA
51:56 and GPL have been lying generally about
51:58 everything they've ever claimed 175 an
52:03 AI universe this is an extension of you
52:07 know finding the matrix this is another
52:09 deep dive on the artificial intelligence
52:12 that we think we see within the universe
52:14 it's sort of a precursor to another
52:16 episode that's coming up here 176
52:20 destiny this analyzes whether or not we
52:24 actually have them whether we can create
52:26 them what it means to develop one to
52:28 pursue it and essentially just talks
52:32 about the anatomy hopefully giving you
52:33 more control over your goals in life by
52:39 breaking it down
52:41 177 the Flat Earth simulator
52:43 well this goes in and says the Flat
52:46 Earth is the case but what does that
52:48 mean what is it built out of is there a
52:51 hard shell above is there a water bubble
52:53 above what does it mean to be inside
52:55 this thing what is what is it trying to
52:57 accomplish because it suggests that
53:00 we're in a very intelligent apparatus
53:03 with very intense objectives next one is
53:07 a special report called doom and gloom
53:08 this one did extremely well and I think
53:13 it's very poetic at this point in
53:16 history that we do have a lot of folks
53:18 that are very doom and gloom they just
53:20 are getting to a point where they're
53:22 saying oh my god you know this whole
53:23 society is all screwed up simply because
53:25 the fake news zeroes in on a couple
53:27 Berkeley
53:28 you know protests a couple weird murders
53:31 here and then it makes you feel like the
53:32 whole world is exactly the same way you
53:35 know when you were kid you get rained
53:36 outside and you thought the whole world
53:37 was experiencing grain and you find out
53:40 oh no it's just your little circle of
53:41 life so hopefully this prize people out
53:45 of that 178
53:48 taking action it's a an extension of the
53:51 other episode which really just again
53:54 says look you most likely are sitting in
53:57 your home with at least the feeling that
54:00 there's something that you should be
54:01 doing that would benefit society benefit
54:04 you and make you more happy and so this
54:06 is episode that helps you dive inside
54:08 yourself and find those elements and go
54:10 forward 179
54:13 UFOs this talks about UFOs talks about
54:17 all the sightings that I'm aware of and
54:19 the very species of the sightings and I
54:22 think dismisses a few of the sightings
54:23 due to plasma ball energy escaping the
54:26 mantle earth but it just talks about it
54:29 straight up 180 entrepreneurship all I
54:35 can say is I've been entrepreneur since
54:37 I was a little kid I have been in and
54:39 out of all kinds of different business
54:40 deals this episode is for you if you are
54:43 on the precipice starting a business or
54:45 you've started a business and you'd like
54:47 a little bit more opinions about what
54:50 you might be able to do to increase your
54:52 productivity and profits 181 Santa
54:56 Clause I had fun with this episode but
54:59 it's all about the idea that we we
55:03 struggle with whether or not to raise
55:04 children with a belief of Santa Claus in
55:06 this modern age because it is you as a
55:08 parent lying to your child to create
55:10 them a little moment of you for magic
55:12 which is great when they're young but as
55:14 they get older what is it uh what does
55:16 it do it teaches them in the end that
55:18 adults will lie to them on a just a
55:21 sub-theme it also preps them to believe
55:23 in a religious deity for the rest of
55:25 their life
55:26 right if you go to the episode I had I
55:28 think it's like episode for season 1 why
55:31 we believe which is my favorite episodes
55:34 ever did it really just simply says a
55:36 lot of this imaginary stuff we teach our
55:37 kids is the precursor to say you have to
55:40 give up all of these but you can keep
55:41 Jesus Christ in your future whatever
55:43 deity you believe so we've primed them
55:45 on fiction and we let them again become
55:48 subjugated to religions as we move
55:50 forward 180 to fragility a man this
55:54 subject comes up all the time among my
55:57 friends where we talk about the fact
55:59 that Humanity is the most fragile
56:02 this planet yeah we run it how's that
56:04 possible so enough said 183 is another
56:10 dive into Flat Earth it's called a
56:12 flatter dilemma I'm actually pretty
56:15 proud of this episode as well but this
56:16 talks about the idea that you know for
56:20 those of us are sort of on the fence we
56:22 definitely see the point of the Flat
56:23 Earth folks there's other theories that
56:25 really seem very heliocentric if you're
56:28 on the fence you're stuck between a rock
56:30 and a hard place
56:30 how do you live every single day not
56:33 knowing where you are use a lot of folks
56:36 that are Pro Flat Earth but they say
56:38 look I don't know that we're actually on
56:40 a disc I don't really know that there's
56:42 a dome overhead and all that stuff right
56:45 180 Ford Gnosticism now the definition
56:50 of Gnosticism and Gnostics has had many
56:54 redefinitions over the years the various
56:56 groups claimed different benefits from
56:57 it and so the definitions are very
56:59 obscure what my current take on
57:02 Gnosticism is is that you're able to
57:03 draw out of the universe the very truth
57:05 of the universe and if you gear up your
57:08 life to communicate with the universe
57:09 spiritually you will get the answers
57:12 that you're looking for and I mean as
57:14 revolutionaries you can possibly
57:15 conceive it will reward you but if you
57:18 don't know it's there you won't go to
57:19 the trough to get the information so
57:21 this episode is to teach you which you
57:23 can do that 185 capitulation this is the
57:28 name of the game right give up give up
57:31 and give in because bull you can be a
57:33 part of the tribe that the fake news
57:35 makes you believe is really there which
57:37 it's not right so this helps you
57:40 recognize where you might have
57:41 capitulated recognize where other people
57:43 are capitulating in a tribal sense and
57:45 to keep yourself out of that realm and
57:47 perhaps help society stay free of this
57:52 problem
57:53 186 dream people I love this episode
57:57 this is about looking at everyone you
58:00 meet in your dreams and realizing that
58:02 they're not full-fledged human beings
58:04 they're actually these weird apparitions
58:06 of beings I don't mean visually but I
58:08 mean spiritually and physically there
58:11 there are always people you seem to know
58:13 what you don't know
58:15 there are your relatives and your
58:16 friends this is really talking about
58:18 everyone else that you don't know in
58:20 your dreams
58:21 187 this one did extremely well this is
58:24 called what if you're wrong and this
58:26 just reminds us all that as sure as we
58:29 are about things it's really good to
58:32 keep a good auxiliary connection to
58:34 humility just in case you're wrong and
58:37 it's healthy to always look at both
58:38 sides of the fence you'll find that when
58:40 you're in conversations with people
58:41 about things you're passionate about
58:43 whether or not you absolutely believe in
58:45 your heart of hearts it's flat it's nice
58:47 to be able to see it from their
58:49 perspective the entire time such that
58:51 you don't come off as a jerk right a
58:54 closed-minded jerk we don't want
58:55 closed-mindedness to follow
58:56 open-mindedness right 188th is rather
59:00 esoteric it's called solutions and it's
59:02 really about the process of how do we
59:05 engage society and start trying to find
59:07 solutions I have another episode I'm
59:09 putting out as $1.99 which is saving
59:12 humanity it's going to be an advanced
59:14 discussion on the same thing but this
59:17 sort of gets the pump primed 189 as I
59:20 said fake news this goes right the
59:22 jugular of what makes news fake a lot of
59:26 the I think cautions we need to have
59:28 about taking news from folks and to know
59:31 that we don't need all the information
59:32 of the world we simply don't one nighty
59:35 very important for me personally which
59:38 is the question why it's a good always
59:41 ask the question why but in the end
59:42 sometimes it's used as a defense
59:45 mechanism to say I don't want to listen
59:47 to what you're saying so I'm just going
59:48 to throw out why and I know that you
59:50 don't really know the reason why
59:51 everything happens so as long as I can
59:54 find one attribute of your claim that
59:56 you don't know the full explanation of I
59:58 don't need to listen to you so we talked
60:00 about that defense mechanism 191 meeting
60:04 an alien this is a result of a question
60:07 I our conversation I had with young
60:09 woman recently and she said look that
60:11 part freaks me out I'm not sure
60:13 society's ready for it I want to be
60:14 ready for it so I take meeting and
60:16 eating and I slow it all the way down
60:18 and I reiterate what on earth would they
60:20 need from us probably not that much 192
60:25 is policies of the universe
60:27 this is about the fact that the universe
60:29 seems to have a lot of rules and once we
60:33 realize what those rules are we can
60:35 start questioning them like why can't
60:38 ghosts show up and say hello there's a
60:41 rule right we don't have our dead
60:43 relatives walking in the room with us
60:45 constantly having conversations about
60:47 what it was like to be alive God doesn't
60:49 come down and talk to us there's rules
60:51 there's policies and that's what this
60:53 episode is about next one up is a
60:56 special report unfortunately it's about
60:58 elite pedophilia but it talks about
61:00 pizza gate it talks about all the
61:02 implications of the stories that we've
61:05 seen break over the years that have been
61:06 covered up not reported on by the fake
61:08 news to protect these [ __ ] it
61:10 talks about the fact that they hide
61:13 themselves in law enforcement they hide
61:14 themselves in military agencies so they
61:16 never have to worry about getting caught
61:18 because they control all the
61:19 investigations 193 reincarnation this is
61:25 essentially what I believe for sure
61:27 we are reincarnated 194 horoscopes
61:32 spelled horoscopes this is about folks
61:37 that wake up every single day and
61:38 relinquish full control of their life to
61:40 arbitrary [ __ ]
61:43 means of determining what's going to
61:45 happen with their life instead of
61:47 controlling it which is the gift we've
61:49 been given as sentient beings people
61:52 give up and they give up because it has
61:55 tradition around it so I'm trying to
61:59 convince you guys to control your own
62:00 life 195 toxins this is heavily
62:03 requested tell me what you think is
62:06 toxic what you think's okay so we can
62:08 stay healthy 196 program universe this
62:14 is an extension off of policies of the
62:16 universe which is essentially we're
62:19 running a program right now without you
62:21 like it or not there's every single rule
62:23 of the universe that holds this place
62:25 together and gives us the ability to
62:26 communicate it's based on a program if
62:29 you're an engineer you know this program
62:31 is utterly and completely perfect we
62:32 don't see flaws we don't drive down the
62:34 street and all the sudden we're in Tibet
62:36 and then all of a sudden we're in China
62:37 number back to where we work there's no
62:39 flaws in Dell effective it is
62:41 real might be an organic indication of
62:43 some flexibility in the program then I
62:46 have my doubts
62:47 197 new craters exist this is tied into
62:52 Flat Earth but it's really related to
62:54 the idea that the moon and every other
62:56 body especially earth has these things
62:58 we call craters except they are
62:59 completely symmetrical they are round
63:01 they are not elliptical they do not have
63:03 skid marks there's no visual indication
63:06 or physics indication that these things
63:08 could possibly be craters
63:09 I think they're volcanoes I think it's
63:11 the inside erupting 198th why Flat Earth
63:17 why flutters the idea is if Flat Earth
63:21 exists it's done for a very intentional
63:25 reason right
63:26 why that's all we ask can we go through
63:29 every implication if you were the
63:32 creator whether you be an alien or God
63:34 why would you need to do this what is
63:36 what is the outcome that you're looking
63:38 for God supposedly knows everything so
63:40 there's no mystery for God why would God
63:43 creatives why we got to put us in here
63:45 if it's an alien what could they get
63:48 from looking at us right
63:50 perhaps they're trying to learn
63:50 something about themselves and 199 is
63:55 saving humanity and this is going to be
63:59 an episode it's not released as of this
64:02 recording that is going to be about what
64:04 can we do to really increase the fabric
64:07 of society in a way or strengthen fabric
64:10 of society in a way that actually
64:11 immediately benefits Society and it's
64:15 going to start from the self and move
64:16 its way through to actually interacting
64:20 with society so for those of you who
64:23 have joined me through all the episodes
64:25 of season 2 super duper appreciated
64:28 season 3 is already amassing episodes
64:31 I'm just working on probably the intro I
64:34 am going to take probably a couple more
64:37 weeks just as a break because I want to
64:40 really think it through part of the way
64:42 that I do anything in my life if I try
64:45 to bring something to finality one of
64:47 the little tricks I play with myself is
64:48 to think of it finished and I'm looking
64:52 back on it five years from now you know
64:54 and what would be
64:55 my regrets you know a lot of time regret
64:58 is is based on the idea that we we
65:03 didn't put enough we didn't put as much
65:04 effort in as we could have so you look
65:06 back and you go god I really should have
65:08 should have worked harder so my
