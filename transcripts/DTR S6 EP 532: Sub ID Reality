00:11 [Music]
00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen
00:37 today i'm gonna go a little uh i'm gonna
00:39 get a little out there for you
00:41 but i think this will potentially change
00:45 the way you view
00:47 reality a little bit more now a long
00:50 time ago
00:51 i did an episode called consensus
00:53 reality
00:55 which was the theory that we are all
00:58 agreeing on
01:00 reality and that's therefore it is what
01:03 it is
01:05 and what i mean by that well i mean the
01:07 earth
01:09 you me what we look like what's possible
01:12 what's not possible all that stuff
01:15 and friends of mine in the recent
01:20 days weeks you know we talk about
01:23 there's an awakening going on
01:25 and that means multiple things in
01:29 society today
01:31 one of them is the political red pill
01:33 that everyone keeps talking about
01:35 and then there's a bigger one
01:38 that a lot of other people are talking
01:40 about which is that we are sort of
01:41 having the age of aquarius right for a
01:43 lack of a better reference
01:46 this is a moment when we're waking up
01:49 to a huge huge shift
01:53 in our consciousness
01:56 which allows us to understand the
01:58 universe and ourselves in it
02:00 if consensus reality was say like a 101
02:05 course from college this is going to be
02:07 the 201
02:08 course so now you understand the first
02:11 part
02:12 and now we're going to go into the
02:13 second level
02:16 only difference being this is my hunch
02:18 this is my theory
02:20 uh brontosauruses or thinning one in
02:23 thick at another and then at the other
02:25 end
02:25 that's my theory i was gonna clear my
02:27 throat but i won't do it
02:29 so what i'm hearing from my friends is
02:31 that they're realizing that there's law
02:33 of attraction
02:35 uh and you know i think it is absolutely
02:38 100 percent real
02:40 i have friends of mine living in
02:42 california now
02:44 who are from different states internally
02:48 to the united states and they are
02:50 realizing that wherever they go
02:52 in this town of huntington beach they
02:54 are finding
02:56 effortlessly people from their
02:59 hometown multiple people from
03:02 the same high school and this is not a
03:06 it's by a big city but the high school
03:08 is like
03:09 almost as intense as me finding someone
03:11 from my hometown in this place
03:13 which i never have this friend of mine
03:16 is telling me about meeting all these
03:18 people
03:19 from her home state of ohio and now
03:22 i'm because it's been like six months
03:25 and now i'm finding
03:26 that wherever i go some dude's shouting
03:28 about being from cleveland or
03:30 cincinnati or something and i'm like i'm
03:32 not getting this from any other state
03:34 i'm just getting it from her state
03:36 because she's telling me that she's
03:37 running into this and it's affecting me
03:40 and i think it's amazing and wonderful
03:42 and so it's happening
03:45 this is uh the second of january right
03:48 now
03:49 uh on new year's eve i'm hanging out
03:51 with some friends
03:53 and the conversation starts without me
03:56 saying anything
03:57 about the law of attraction about
03:59 connections about
04:00 how just knowing one person and
04:05 knowing how they're remotely connected
04:06 to a project that would be really cool
04:08 to get into and then
04:09 switching restaurants switching days
04:11 switching whole crowds of people
04:14 they end up bumping into people that are
04:16 connected to all those things and stuff
04:18 goes down business gets signed and it's
04:20 just amazing
04:22 and that this has been happening more
04:24 and more that they realize
04:26 that this is the way things happen
04:29 meaning they're learning about this
04:32 law of attraction inadvertently without
04:35 a name
04:36 and it's just starting to take effect
04:38 and what's funny is these individuals
04:40 know very well the theory of law of
04:41 attraction
04:42 but in articulating for
04:46 10 minutes or so about these cascading
04:48 moments that have happened throughout
04:50 2020
04:51 there's no mention of law of attraction
04:53 and if i say oh were you talking about
04:54 law of attraction
04:55 oh yeah yeah yeah it's funny it's just
04:58 interesting
04:59 again if you don't have words for things
05:00 then you can't conceive things
05:02 if you can't conceive things these
05:03 things can't be controlled at a minimum
05:06 and sometimes can't happen at all so
05:11 i want to say this correctly as not to
05:14 sound
05:15 you know snobbish or arrogant or
05:18 whatever
05:20 because i know that there's plenty of
05:21 you out there
05:23 that have the same exact experience that
05:25 i have routinely
05:26 and it's it is special of course that
05:29 when it happens
05:30 but doesn't necessarily make us special
05:32 when it happens
05:34 it's just something that you've tuned
05:36 yourself to you
05:37 are a microphone that can pick up a
05:38 frequency range
05:40 and the more that you become enlightened
05:42 aka seeing more
05:45 your radio picks up more frequencies and
05:48 therefore more
05:49 avenues of information diagnostics
05:52 connections all occur for you
05:54 your brain is a muscle that
05:58 i believe the more you exercise it the
06:02 more
06:03 you what you're doing is you're mapping
06:07 more potentially physical neurons
06:11 together which are sort of like the
06:13 memory in a computer
06:15 remember memory in a computer only holds
06:18 what's loaded into it when your computer
06:20 is powered on when you power your
06:21 computer off memory is typically either
06:23 random or cleared
06:24 so you load up your computer it takes
06:27 stuff from the hard disk
06:28 whether it's an ssd or not irrelevant
06:32 it moves into temporary memory in the
06:34 cpu and it starts executing instructions
06:37 you don't want to shut your computer off
06:39 because you know you're going to lose
06:40 everything that's in there
06:41 and that's the memory in your computer a
06:42 lot of old farts
06:44 will reference hard drives as memory
06:47 whatever
06:49 so i think that our brain is
06:52 simply memory containers for perhaps
06:56 what's going on any one moment
06:58 and it's freely interchanged just like a
07:00 computer with the hard drive which is
07:01 your soul
07:02 that has access to the great mother
07:04 cloud
07:05 that is the universe and perhaps god
07:08 him or herself i don't think i'm
07:11 mentioning
07:12 god as a her to appease in the sjws i
07:15 seriously
07:16 have thought god was probably a female
07:18 at best because she gives birth
07:21 doesn't just create things but it's
07:24 probably a combination of both anyway
07:26 so i take this recent experience
07:30 home i guess for me technically it was
07:33 last night
07:35 and part of it occurred to me right when
07:37 they were talking and then i finally
07:38 mulched it a little bit later
07:41 because there was a little note in the
07:42 example that i heard
07:44 which was that this was happening to a
07:47 friend of mine
07:48 who's a business owner but she also has
07:50 her employees
07:52 and this particular moment one of her
07:54 boys is
07:55 living with her because she hasn't found
07:57 a place in this area and so both of them
07:59 are going out and
08:00 compounding this law of attraction both
08:03 of them know about all the circumstances
08:04 that would be great if they met these
08:06 people and got these projects
08:08 and it seems to become increasingly
08:09 easier
08:11 when the two of them venture out into
08:13 the world
08:15 so i started thinking and started
08:17 getting
08:18 some sort of chronological version
08:21 of this theory because i just wanna
08:25 i want to share with you this technique
08:27 that i've learned
08:29 which is that sometimes we contemplate
08:31 something
08:33 and we don't move it over time meaning
08:36 take into account how this particular
08:40 let's just say fact about something
08:44 is true today but if you apply time to
08:47 it
08:48 it evolves and becomes much
08:51 more explainable and it also
08:55 evolves from perhaps either less
08:59 less of that experience occurring to
09:01 more experience of that occurring or
09:02 perhaps
09:03 more of it occurring unless occurring
09:05 today or
09:07 what is occurring stays steady but its
09:10 impact
09:11 varies and i'm so i'll make sense to you
09:13 in just a second here
09:15 so it's hard for us to
09:18 to contemplate consensus reality
09:23 simply because and this is funny because
09:26 man is so arrogant that man you know
09:28 knows how the universe started went to
09:29 the moon
09:30 blah blah blah every time we need a
09:33 little shot in the arm
09:35 based on our i guess genetic
09:37 insecurities
09:38 we're willing to write blank checks left
09:40 and right
09:42 but let me ask you when i say we are
09:45 conceiving of
09:46 the shape of the earth let's just say
09:49 and let's say
09:50 further back we conceived as the earth
09:53 as a flat surface and therefore it was
09:58 due to our inability to travel like
09:59 magellan or like
10:01 christopher columbus or what have you we
10:03 were not capable of
10:05 personally confirming such a thing nor
10:07 would we want to
10:09 because our ship's going off the edge of
10:10 the earth and we're i guess yelling back
10:13 it's
10:13 it's flat you know we got it right now
10:15 we're dying right nobody wants that
10:17 eventuality
10:18 when it comes to exploring whether it's
10:21 flat or round even today if you could
10:24 go to the south pole and you're a flat
10:27 earther today and you're like hey i
10:28 think i'm going to find the dome edge
10:31 but if in doing so for some reason you
10:33 were going to potentially die
10:35 and you didn't have an internet
10:36 connection to at least call back on
10:38 facebook
10:39 live and say look i'm here now i'm going
10:42 to die but at least i was the first
10:43 person to really confirm this to you
10:46 if you couldn't do that you probably
10:47 wouldn't do that and you'd be like well
10:48 let's think of another plan i don't want
10:50 to be the only guy on earth who dies
10:53 and then my body's you know whatever
10:55 rotting out there harvested by the
10:56 government to
10:57 throw me away or whatever you wouldn't
11:00 do it
11:01 so i think that when we get to these
11:04 bigger concepts
11:05 like consensus reality we
11:08 shy back we also don't want the world to
11:12 be
11:15 as dynamic as this theory suggests
11:19 because what am i suggesting my what i'm
11:21 suggesting as long as
11:23 an entity of media be a television
11:27 film internet news magazines and just
11:31 papers and conversation because what
11:34 happens today in today's society
11:36 when something becomes popular you were
11:38 told who to hate
11:39 who to love who's the hero who's not a
11:41 hero
11:42 and thus they would have total control
11:45 to shape the world like a 12-sided
11:46 tetrahedron right
11:49 okay we don't want that and we don't
11:52 want someone to infect us with some evil
11:56 etc etc turning the world into even a
11:58 worse place than it already is right
12:00 uh i think the world's a great place but
12:02 you know there's some bad factions out
12:03 there we don't want to gain
12:04 any more traction than they already have
12:08 and this goes down to the esoteric of
12:11 someone
12:12 telling you something you don't want to
12:13 hear but since you heard it
12:15 you manifest it you mean there's kids
12:18 eating kids i mean adults eating kids
12:20 and politicians eating
12:21 drinking adrenal crohn's and all that
12:22 kind of stuff once
12:24 we start hearing these things and
12:26 focusing on it to quote unquote get rid
12:28 of them
12:29 what if that forges more paths for them
12:32 to
12:33 do what they do maybe i mean
12:36 it's not something we want to think
12:37 about but it could be
12:40 but here's what this episode's about
12:42 this episode is about
12:45 an advancement to the theory now when
12:48 you think about consensus reality
12:50 what i was saying was that we consent
12:52 that the world's a particular way but
12:54 you might say
12:54 no everyone totally disagrees man you
12:57 got atheists and christians
13:00 you got left and right everywhere ying
13:03 and yang everywhere
13:04 on any one concept there's an
13:05 anti-concept
13:07 so how on earth would this work it
13:08 doesn't seem like it makes any sense
13:11 okay well this is where i'm going to
13:13 take the pie slice
13:15 i shouldn't even say that the layer cake
13:17 the cake that's not a layer cake is
13:18 going to become a layer cake
13:20 we're going to cut it in half this is
13:21 the bottom half of the cake and top half
13:23 of the cake
13:24 top half is what we're going to call
13:25 consciousness that which you can discern
13:29 and recall in your memory in your brain
13:33 now we know how this works if we sat in
13:34 a smoke lounge with
13:36 10 guys and we start talking about
13:37 whether or not christ ever existed
13:39 whether or not i went to the moon
13:40 whether or not jfk
13:41 was eh there's going to be someone in
13:44 the room that's going to differ
13:45 from someone else so it's quarantined
13:48 that type of communication
13:51 but and i know some of you believe this
13:54 is
13:54 more of a theory than reality but
13:57 there's
13:58 the freudian subconscious hmm
14:02 subconscious is always referred to as
14:05 you know usually the id or the child
14:07 within you
14:09 it is a lot more delicate it gets afraid
14:13 it doesn't really know what's going on
14:15 necessarily outside of its
14:17 central core inside your
14:20 i guess brain mind which is obviously a
14:23 marriage of your body and your soul
14:26 but let's just say the it's the
14:30 subconscious
14:32 acceptance meaning it has to filter
14:35 through the consciousness
14:36 to be really stored in that pantry of
14:39 ours that i always refer to that has
14:41 a pile of true things a pile of fake
14:43 things
14:44 or false things and a big pile of maybe
14:46 in the middle
14:48 probably with maybe being a lot bigger
14:49 than either one of the other piles
14:52 let me propose to you this what if the
14:55 subconscious of man
14:57 freely exchanges ideas
15:01 what if it is truly the subconscious of
15:03 man
15:04 that is forging this reality not the
15:06 consciousness
15:07 the consciousness is your gift to have
15:08 an identity
15:10 the subconscious is more again
15:13 fundamental
15:14 not necessarily feral but definitely a
15:16 lot more
15:18 susceptible to change and
15:21 having acute spikes in
15:24 frequency based on change
15:27 but maybe there's two layers to your
15:30 subconscious
15:32 you have the consciousness which is sort
15:34 of the big brother
15:35 freaking out the little brother and you
15:37 can create weird state changes where
15:40 subconsciously you have
15:43 like ptsd you have the event that's lost
15:45 inside your mind
15:47 and you your subconscious is still
15:50 suffering from the event but your
15:54 consciousness
15:55 for whatever reason due to the shock and
15:57 the trauma of the event
15:59 has either pushed it out because it was
16:00 severe abuse
16:02 or it was an ied bomb that blew up
16:06 and literally physically shocked your
16:09 mind
16:09 your brain inside your skull for being
16:13 able to function properly
16:14 thus just like they say when you get on
16:16 the back of the head you can lose up to
16:18 10 minutes of your short term memory
16:20 and you wake up and you don't remember
16:21 what happened
16:23 and someone else has to reconstruct it
16:24 for you oh okay
16:27 and then every bit of pain anxiety you
16:30 feel
16:31 you can link it back to a well-described
16:33 event
16:34 and it's our soldiers mainly
16:37 in this world all countries of course
16:39 they experienced these horrific things
16:41 and no one was there either everyone
16:43 else died and they
16:45 were the only one that survived creating
16:47 survival guilt and that sort of thing or
16:50 everyone lost 10 minutes or someone just
16:53 didn't see what happened to you
16:55 and so this thing happens and it
16:57 manifests
16:59 but there could be a deeper level inside
17:01 of our
17:02 mind that is the more survival track the
17:06 more instinctual track
17:07 the one that you built as a baby so that
17:09 you could start interacting with this
17:11 world
17:12 unless you die of starvation or what
17:15 have you
17:17 by the minimum you don't really
17:18 communicate with your parents that well
17:20 you know which is super important
17:22 imagine it is this deep basement
17:25 of our subconscious that is not
17:29 associated with reactionary emotions
17:33 but is merely the bedrock that you built
17:36 as a child
17:38 it could be even a reality that's handed
17:42 to you partially from
17:45 genetics who knows or could be even
17:48 predisposition due to genetics right
17:51 we know that musical families tend to
17:52 remain musical they pick up an
17:54 instrument and they do extremely well
17:56 because their neural net was configured
18:00 to be really intuitive with processing
18:04 that data going through
18:06 it's it's sort of like a graphics user
18:09 processor
18:11 regressors reset them it's sort of like
18:14 a graphical
18:15 processor unit gpu in your computer that
18:18 runs the video card
18:21 being engineered to process
18:24 triangles or quads for 3d games
18:28 so it's designed to do that sort of math
18:31 super fast whereas your cpu
18:33 it could do the math pretty good but
18:35 it's more of a brute force
18:36 not really designed to do that because
18:38 it's doing all kinds of other math
18:40 i'm related to video processing of 3d
18:42 stuff
18:44 for your computer geeks you will totally
18:45 get that
18:47 so now with our new advanced 201 theory
18:52 let's take it over time you might think
18:56 that this technique might create a more
18:58 chaotic present time because we have a
19:00 lot more people on earth
19:02 than we had in the past that's just a
19:04 mathematical certainty
19:07 i'm going to suggest the exact opposite
19:10 we are more locked into this reality
19:13 right now
19:15 because we're all there's so much force
19:19 being applied to the current theory
19:21 because there is so much solidification
19:23 of the concepts that we have adopted
19:26 because it's constantly being reinforced
19:28 almost like
19:30 a network like a neural network or an
19:32 internet network
19:33 you know no one worries about one
19:36 internet hub going down you can still
19:38 use the internet it's just going to be a
19:40 little slower because it's going to
19:41 wiggle past
19:42 wherever the problem is that's the
19:44 beauty of the internet and why it was
19:45 designed the way it was designed
19:47 but now imagine this isn't it
19:49 interesting
19:51 and it's it's almost every single one of
19:54 every og listener i guarantee you've had
19:56 this thought
19:57 a million times with almost without
19:59 exaggeration
20:01 you've noticed that over the chronicles
20:03 of time as either
20:05 accurately or inaccurately documented
20:08 man further back was far more spiritual
20:13 god always showed up and did things not
20:15 necessarily the god of christianity but
20:16 every god
20:18 every annunaki god every egyptian god
20:20 native american god south american god
20:22 african god etc as time
20:26 progressed we lost that and now we're
20:29 sort of going into transhumanism
20:32 we are trying to approach mechanical
20:35 solutions to the human body and the
20:37 human psyche
20:38 there's if you study shadowrun
20:40 role-playing game they're
20:41 back in the 80s they completely
20:43 conceptualized putting
20:45 new nervous systems in your body to
20:48 replace your nervous system so you could
20:49 draw a gun faster
20:51 you could put hard drives in your head
20:52 because we didn't have ssd at the time
20:55 they really thought out this whole
20:56 process we're losing god
20:59 of the spiritual nature and we're
21:01 gaining a god of faux science
21:03 and transhumanism of all types
21:07 there's people like bill gates that
21:08 think there's they have the right to
21:10 genetically
21:10 alter you now i think that most of us
21:13 assume
21:15 it is simply because man has discovered
21:17 more about the universe that
21:19 we became more technical and thus
21:23 the replacement of the unknown for the
21:26 quote-unquote
21:27 known is how we have developed over time
21:32 but if everything is a matrix created by
21:34 this conscious
21:35 this consensus reality thing
21:39 through this deep id subconscious
21:42 mechanism then that is just an evolution
21:45 of the game we invented excuses of why
21:49 things
21:51 are the way they are instead of
21:53 endorsing
21:54 and embracing the unknown as a gift of
21:58 your dreams you ever go in your dreams
22:01 and start going okay wait a minute stop
22:03 everybody
22:04 what's this building doing here what who
22:06 are you i don't know any of you people
22:07 why do i feel like i know you why
22:09 did i just have sex with you you don't
22:12 do that
22:13 you cruise through a dream like oh yeah
22:15 man and you'll leave a room
22:17 with like a certain configuration of
22:18 furniture and people and you step
22:20 outside
22:21 and you look at the landscape and that's
22:23 cool and you go back inside the room's a
22:24 little bit different
22:26 hey man you're losing no comfort over
22:28 that change
22:31 and that is why i think dreams are the
22:33 playground
22:35 of real consciousness but here
22:39 you'd have a cow if your room changed
22:41 just because you went in and out of it
22:43 and then no matter where you went
22:45 everything changed constantly it's
22:46 generally the same purpose but it's like
22:48 oh my god i was married to you two
22:50 seconds ago and now i'm married to you
22:52 you know
22:53 i debate on how far back to go in this
22:55 concept but
22:57 i think i'm going to go back way beyond
22:59 the form of man
23:01 we're going to jump around and we're
23:03 going to use genesis here in a second
23:06 but let's say that we are the soul
23:08 beings and we are
23:11 living in a more emotional state of
23:13 being in the universe and not one of any
23:15 tangible matter
23:17 we are happy most the time because how
23:20 could you be unhappy
23:22 we don't die there's no lack of life
23:26 and we can go anywhere in the universe
23:28 it's sort of like a whale swimming in a
23:30 deep ocean
23:31 go anywhere you want do anything you
23:33 want meet new people whatever you got to
23:34 do maybe there's no
23:35 even concept of marriage or anything
23:36 there's no procreation why
23:38 we're all here all of us but forever is
23:41 a long time as
23:42 prince said we're cues from star trek
23:46 and we get bored and so we want a
23:49 different way to exist
23:52 and we're brilliant we're all knowing
23:54 because all everyone knows everything
23:58 no secrets it's beautiful but we realize
24:01 that there's an
24:02 interesting game that someone figured
24:04 out
24:05 serendipitously perhaps intentionally
24:07 perhaps perhaps like the borg we all got
24:09 together one moment went
24:10 yeah let's do that and we create this
24:14 temporary vessel
24:15 mechanism it wasn't necessarily humans
24:18 at first could have been some blobby
24:20 thing that just kind of lives and dies
24:21 and
24:22 we feel that don't we have a realm for
24:25 it perhaps it is tested first in the
24:27 dream realm
24:29 i always say the dream realm is the
24:32 student films of the gods right
24:35 but over the course of infinity
24:38 we come up with this reality the one
24:41 we're in right now
24:43 i think that if we were truly spirits i
24:45 think one of the
24:47 beauties of being alive is the act of
24:51 creation
24:52 and creation entails tremendous amounts
24:55 of other
24:56 disciplines design purpose
24:59 so things have no purpose they just look
25:01 pretty but that's a purpose it looks
25:03 pretty
25:04 have you ever looked around the world
25:05 and said looks like everything's
25:06 beautiful that's alive like i said in
25:08 many episodes
25:09 how do you think that happens because i
25:11 think living beings
25:13 way outside of the human form design
25:15 them
25:16 everything in this planet that's alive
25:18 is gorgeous the only thing that might
25:20 look ugly is man's creation
25:22 but as everything that comes into
25:25 existence typically follows
25:28 what usually happens in the invention of
25:30 a particular solution
25:32 that is the first time that solution has
25:34 ever been invented
25:36 it usually starts off fairly primitive
25:39 and advances
25:40 as one generation or one effort
25:44 in this particular case stands on the
25:47 accomplishments of the previous effort
25:49 and then of course we as the potential
25:53 guests of this west world we're
25:56 definitely coming down into our own
25:57 creation we made disneyland and now
25:59 we're coming down into it
26:01 why do children die why do children
26:03 suffer every once in a while
26:04 because over time we figured out that
26:07 well one no one's actually dying you're
26:08 just going through a situation
26:10 that suffering is a completely different
26:12 thing when viewed from the outside
26:14 entities of souls it is an emotion it is
26:18 a feeling
26:20 as much as you might dislike it
26:23 while you're in your human form as soon
26:25 as you pop out you realize you got
26:27 another slice
26:28 of the trivial pursuit pie you were a
26:31 sports person once
26:33 then you were a scientist then you're a
26:35 celebrity whatever it is
26:37 one case you die young one case you live
26:39 to be one of the oldest people on planet
26:41 earth
26:43 but this world is forged and i can't go
26:45 to adam and eve just yet because we have
26:47 to set the foundation
26:50 let me ask you if we had perhaps a
26:52 hundred thousand
26:54 homo sapien sapiens on this planet being
26:57 upgraded from the concepts learned from
27:00 chimpanzees apes and hominids they went
27:04 back to the drawing board
27:05 and simply created man realizing that
27:08 communication would probably be a major
27:10 upgrade
27:11 to the current form of yelping and
27:13 screaming
27:14 in the jungle we have a re-articulated
27:16 skull
27:18 we can pronounce the labels properly
27:21 this ups the game tremendously
27:25 now they're not gifting us with writing
27:26 yet they're not getting it gifting us
27:28 with iconic language or phonetic
27:30 language of any kind
27:31 they're simply saying just like ringo
27:33 starr and caveman
27:35 there's a little language starting to
27:36 develop
27:38 now with language and this refined body
27:42 you no longer are in a feral state of
27:44 being a creature
27:46 just simply going for the fundamentals
27:48 of life
27:49 eating and screwing and sleeping which
27:51 is really what animals do
27:54 now we can bring from our soul-based
27:57 realm
27:59 all of the art and invention limited
28:01 only by
28:02 the form of humanity that we have
28:04 created
28:05 maybe we evolve here on earth just a tad
28:09 we certainly evolve when we procreate
28:11 with other
28:12 people that don't look like us we create
28:14 hybrids of
28:15 amazing construction but we're here now
28:20 and we brought with us the toolbox
28:24 and that toolbox is this sub id
28:29 this non-emotional functional
28:33 sort of library of all the
28:36 schematics of what we have constructed
28:39 this world to be
28:40 but we don't want to keep making the
28:41 trip back and forth in order to
28:43 influence the design of our area
28:46 exclusively we'll still do it but at
28:48 some point
28:49 we don't want to fiddle with the
28:50 simulation
28:52 if you ever play a multiplayer online
28:54 game you know that the designers don't
28:56 go in and start designing the new level
28:58 while you're playing the game and all
29:00 sudden
29:00 [Music]
29:01 mull hill is a mountain and a mountain's
29:03 a valley it doesn't happen
29:04 they release expansion packs and then
29:07 you're introduced to the
29:09 new world typically because they know
29:10 you're sold on the old one they don't
29:11 want to change that too much although
29:12 world of warcraft did that one time
29:15 sort of finishing their initial concepts
29:18 which is cool
29:19 but they let us have i mean we are them
29:22 they are us
29:24 we are all in this together the toolbox
29:28 is that
29:29 as we desire to change this design
29:33 they build in this beautiful system
29:36 and the beautiful system says well we
29:39 don't want to have
29:40 one person rule the whole world and as
29:42 soon as they
29:43 think that things should be different
29:45 then everyone else has to tolerate it
29:47 so they build in a consensus system a
29:50 consensus reality system driven from
29:52 this sub
29:53 id and we think things and we talk about
29:57 things and we agree on things and we
29:58 philosophize and we tell
30:00 funny stories about gods and and
30:03 everything
30:04 everything that we can conceive of we
30:06 communicate with
30:07 hence this show and so very slowly over
30:10 time
30:11 we start to architect the world while
30:13 we're here but now imagine there's only
30:16 again a hundred thousand people here now
30:19 to the degree that we communicate
30:21 changes can occur much quicker because
30:23 we are going to convince the hundred
30:25 thousand humans on this planet
30:26 that things are actually a particular
30:28 way and not another way
30:30 and then all of a sudden who knows i
30:32 mean we're all asleep because we're
30:33 sleeping in the same region in the same
30:35 time zone on earth
30:36 things start to change could even be
30:41 that the mandela effect is nothing more
30:43 than this system
30:46 and that the internet hit a critical
30:47 point in 2013 where the differences
30:49 between our
30:50 consensual realities simply average out
30:54 if there's more people who believe one
30:56 thing or it's communicated to you
30:59 that more people believe something then
31:01 you're willing to relinquish your id
31:03 subsystem to the other concept within
31:06 their id subsystem
31:07 and the berenstein barrier suddenly
31:09 becomes the berenstain bears now
31:12 you simply capitulated to the change
31:15 but when you found out there was a
31:16 mandela effect if you did have one
31:19 then you have to take into account that
31:22 there was a moment of rejection
31:24 of the kubler-ross effect you weren't
31:27 necessarily maybe angry but you were
31:29 definitely disoriented when you started
31:30 hearing the contradiction to your own
31:32 beliefs
31:34 but then just like everybody we went
31:36 into a denial
31:37 then we go into a negotiation process
31:39 where we're like
31:40 how could that be and then you just kind
31:43 of like you give up and you
31:45 you agree you join them thus the change
31:48 becomes permanent
31:49 in your reality but you have fond
31:52 remember
31:52 memories of the other one and we know
31:54 that there's a group of people that will
31:58 accept things a lot faster than others
32:01 so the less people that there are on
32:02 earth this concept becomes
32:04 much more malleable and much quicker
32:08 and easier to change all reality
32:12 the more people that are born well the
32:15 schematics are
32:16 more like the consensus and therefore
32:20 you're having an epiphany to say
32:22 can't we just all get along can't we
32:24 just figure out how to solve
32:26 world hunger power all this kind of
32:28 stuff
32:30 but too many people aren't thinking
32:32 about that very issue so their
32:34 schematics got dust on it
32:35 and it's the old schematic there was a
32:38 huge transformation
32:39 in this world history of thinking the
32:41 world was flat
32:42 to thinking it was round it took
32:45 hundreds of years to happen
32:47 but if you do your research you will
32:49 find out that people
32:51 way before the formal individuals that
32:54 were saying it was realm
32:57 there were people hundreds of years ago
32:59 whole civilizations remember the
33:01 egyptians
33:02 definitely appear to have believed the
33:04 pre-dynastic egyptians
33:06 which aren't egyptian probably their
33:09 symbols for a year
33:10 was a circle around the sun their symbol
33:12 for month was a circle around the moon
33:14 well somehow they figured that out
33:17 maybe they're just the first descendants
33:19 of this experiment
33:20 and thus they knew how they built the
33:22 world they knew how they built the sun
33:24 it was just an arbitrary system to
33:26 create an ecosystem of life
33:28 and so it stuck but then
33:32 as man was placed on this giant twenty
33:35 four thousand mile around
33:36 ball and they could no longer see the
33:39 curvature
33:40 of the original design they fell into
33:42 flat earth and thus the world was flat
33:45 perhaps for hundreds of years maybe
33:47 thousands of years maybe tens of
33:48 thousands of years
33:50 until someone just arbitrarily suggested
33:55 it might be wrong and so through
33:58 presentation
33:59 through validation by the authorities
34:03 it starts to round off
34:07 but now for those who don't believe it's
34:09 round truly don't believe it's wrong and
34:11 you could get together with flat earth
34:12 people
34:13 say in the village then it becomes a
34:16 city
34:17 then it becomes a state in a country
34:20 just like the twilight zone where the uh
34:22 the kid wishes everyone into the
34:23 cornfield where he had just that part of
34:25 the earth was the only thing existed in
34:26 the entire universe
34:28 you could get your own little slice of
34:30 reality
34:32 now let's go back to adam and eve so you
34:34 have this
34:36 garden of eden and you would imagine
34:40 that just like world of warcraft it
34:42 turned it originated in the 90s as
34:44 warcraft it was a pretty
34:47 limited world it's a flat earth for sure
34:50 inside the computer
34:51 you can't just go forever in one
34:52 direction like you can in world of
34:54 warcraft
34:55 they experiment first with a little
34:58 playground
34:59 a sandbox they're creating vegetation
35:02 and you know the way that the story
35:04 might work is that
35:05 all of that low-level life form
35:09 i don't mean to insult plants being
35:11 probably the og's of consciousness in
35:13 this universe
35:15 but that goes first it's a much more
35:17 primitive system they're coming up with
35:19 chemistry and mathematics
35:22 all the principles of life then man gets
35:25 placed in there their ultimate creation
35:28 maybe monkeys went first and hominids
35:30 went second
35:32 then they finally just pulled back but
35:33 it looks like we have that evidence here
35:35 on earth as well which is very
35:36 interesting
35:37 but when the devil talks to eve
35:41 about the eating the apple
35:44 he says to her god is hiding a bunch of
35:48 things from you
35:49 and if you eat this apple you will see
35:52 all that is unseen
35:54 that could be a metaphor and i'm
35:55 stretching here a little bit i know
35:58 but what if it's just a metaphor for
36:01 understanding that you have the ability
36:04 to change reality
36:06 because boy did it ever change their
36:08 reality didn't it
36:10 stuff got more real pain nakedness all
36:12 that stuff became a realization
36:15 well if man is peaceful
36:18 and calm war isn't a thing because
36:21 there's
36:22 everything's plentiful no one has to
36:25 take anything from anyone because
36:26 there's plenty why would you
36:28 and if someone did take your stuff off
36:30 your plate you just reach over and get
36:31 another plate no big deal
36:33 you must be more hungry than me is what
36:34 they think
36:36 what is this saying hell is the path to
36:38 hell is paved with good intentions
36:42 but because ultimately we are a
36:43 soul-based being
36:46 whether or not there's good and evil
36:47 maybe just the perspective of being
36:50 in a human body or any other form of
36:53 life
36:54 because if you can't kill each other if
36:56 we can't kill each other in soul form
36:58 which seems plausible and obvious i
37:00 think
37:02 then there's no fear once you pop out
37:04 nothing bad can happen to you
37:06 nothing perhaps even hell is a construct
37:10 of man
37:12 because evil is a construct of man our
37:15 perception of evil
37:17 now i think we do need to hang on to
37:19 certain definitions of evil
37:21 because i don't think i personally want
37:23 to live in a world made out of hillary
37:24 clinton's
37:26 but now there's a more sinister thing
37:29 i'm going to mention with this
37:30 particular
37:31 theory now there'll be a handful of you
37:34 that have seen the movie what the bleep
37:35 do we know
37:37 and of that handful there'll be
37:40 an additional group of you that saw the
37:41 movie the secret and probably somebody
37:43 that saw the secret and didn't see what
37:44 the bleep do we know
37:46 both movies are based on manifest
37:48 destiny
37:50 the secret went a little bit further in
37:52 in a
37:53 interesting way in that they said in the
37:55 trailer of the movie
37:57 that the elite of the world understand
37:58 manifest destiny and use it to their
38:00 advantage constantly
38:03 well we believe we are always the
38:04 subject of something
38:06 and therefore we're waiting for someone
38:08 to tell us it's okay to do what we
38:09 already know
38:10 we should be doing remember there's
38:12 plenty of people that
38:14 can work their butts off at home as long
38:15 as they're working for someone else but
38:17 the minute you see jess t
38:18 you should stop working overtime for
38:21 your employer and getting no pay for it
38:23 and develop your own business and do
38:24 exactly what you do but do it
38:26 independently
38:27 so you have some retirement and some
38:28 control over your life and they just
38:30 cave
38:31 oh i can't do that why because no one
38:33 told me to do it
38:35 perception is everything what the belief
38:39 do we know is a quantum physics movie
38:41 it's a neural peptide movie it is based
38:43 on science except the one lady who's a
38:45 channeler
38:46 at least that's what her career says
38:48 underneath her nameplate
38:50 it's like why did you put her in that
38:51 movie everyone else is a phd professor
38:55 she might have a phd too but i don't
38:57 know what it's in
38:59 and she might be a wonderful person i'm
39:00 just just saying it was a weird
39:02 i would expect the channeler to be in
39:04 the secret
39:05 but now what if this little mechanism
39:08 i'm talking about
39:09 probably goes under a different name if
39:10 it's real
39:12 but let's say the controlling forces of
39:14 this world understand that this is the
39:16 way it works
39:17 perception is reality and not just as a
39:20 metaphor
39:21 but as a straight-up scientific
39:24 reality-based
39:25 matrix based methodology of changing
39:27 everything
39:29 there's a lot of things that these
39:30 elitists are trying to tell our children
39:31 to confuse them
39:33 a lot they're trying to confuse us with
39:36 science they're trying to confuse our
39:37 genders
39:39 trying to confuse everything well
39:41 there's a
39:42 basic explanation for that you want to
39:45 get at the kids so they adopt your new
39:47 paradigms of crazy
39:48 and therefore the world changes when the
39:50 boomers die off when gen x dies off
39:53 maybe the millennials too they're trying
39:56 to program the kids
39:58 well there's a mechanical version of
40:00 that without any of this theory being
40:01 true
40:02 of course but what would be the forces
40:06 to give people the perception that
40:09 something is true
40:11 we talk about all the time between flat
40:12 earth and round earth
40:15 we talk about matrix to not matrix we
40:17 talk about
40:19 rocket engines weren't working in the
40:20 vacuum of space
40:22 pushing off of nothing but having all
40:24 this effect on the vehicle
40:27 perception where did we get the
40:29 perception that these things were
40:31 one way or the other media
40:35 marshall mcluhan you don't know about
40:38 marshall mcclellan
40:39 you got to do a deep dive into his
40:40 writings if you want to just read a
40:42 great article by marshall mcluhan i
40:44 think it's 1968 he took an interview
40:46 with playboy magazine
40:47 it's a long article is a deep article
40:52 and you'll find out how deep that dude
40:53 was but he's the guy that coined the
40:54 phrase media
40:57 and the number one thing he said was
40:59 it's more important that you understand
41:01 the me
41:01 the means by which you get information
41:04 than the information itself
41:06 now without being able to channel his
41:08 past to soul
41:11 i'm sure that his second most important
41:13 thing that you need to realize
41:14 is the information itself but why did he
41:18 say the method of the information
41:20 being transmitted to you is more
41:22 important in the information itself
41:24 seems sort of counter-intuitive
41:25 seems almost like the irrelevant has
41:27 been put in front of the relevant
41:30 well with our mechanism it has to do
41:34 with absorption if i walk up to you
41:37 today and i said hey man aliens
41:40 just landed on earth and you're like
41:42 what you know if i
41:44 really uh have integrity with you you
41:46 might go along with it for a little
41:47 while but even
41:48 if i had really intense integrity with
41:49 you you're going to take a few steps
41:51 back and
41:52 okay how you feeling today you got a
41:54 fever or anything you know
41:57 but if i brought up my telephone and i
42:00 said i just
42:01 no dude look look at the hook and i just
42:03 bring out a tell us i just recorded this
42:04 and all of a sudden spaceships are
42:06 landing on the beach down there and
42:08 aliens are popping out
42:09 and and it's convincing it's then all of
42:12 a sudden
42:13 oh my god he's telling me the truth it
42:16 could all be cg
42:18 it could be someone pulling it could be
42:19 some cg artist that made this awesome
42:21 scam
42:21 they passed it out to a thousand people
42:24 on plenty to pull this trick on people
42:26 and all of a sudden you believe it
42:28 because it's visual
42:30 maybe there's some sound involved so
42:33 what marshall i think was getting to is
42:34 if you were to read that in the
42:35 newspaper
42:37 uh war of the worlds was from 19
42:41 it's like 36 or 39 somewhere in there
42:43 orson welles
42:44 got on the radio and said that the world
42:46 was being invaded
42:48 and they also made all the provisions to
42:50 make sure that
42:52 no one was going to cut off the radio
42:53 program was never going to go to a
42:54 commercial
42:56 he just wanted it constantly but we'll
42:57 cause a huge panic because everyone
42:59 at the time believed the radio was real
43:02 today that would never work
43:04 if the only information you got was from
43:05 a radio station
43:07 you just go outside and go man i don't
43:08 see anything you put on youtube and all
43:10 also it's not there so then that radio
43:12 broadcast is not real
43:15 but you keep up in the game it becomes
43:17 real
43:18 you know the one thing i forgot in my
43:20 alien invasion episode
43:22 was the onslaught of media that could
43:25 make that real
43:26 think about what's going on in america
43:28 right now where we've had a
43:29 record-breaking
43:31 um i know i say this about kicking off
43:34 the
43:36 keyword thing president selection event
43:39 where fraud is everywhere man i mean
43:41 unbelievable right
43:43 and people like nope not me it's like
43:45 shaggy wasn't me
43:47 i mean just think about the cognitive
43:48 dissonance that's going on remember what
43:50 you train your brain to do is what it's
43:51 good at
43:52 so all these people swallowing that pill
43:54 oh my god they're gonna be injured for a
43:56 life let alone the
43:57 little shot in their arm but okay
44:00 so there's been a lot of like propaganda
44:03 around
44:04 the weather around the temperatures of
44:07 earth
44:08 it's so bad that geologists with degrees
44:11 are buying this stuff left and right
44:13 unbelievable running out of fresh water
44:15 i just still love that one
44:18 it just means you have no i mean like
44:20 you need to take a meteorology
44:22 course at least in college if you're
44:24 gonna buy that one
44:25 but let's say they wanted to create the
44:28 uh
44:30 the perception that the sun's getting
44:32 hotter and we're all gonna burn up
44:34 or sun's getting colder and we're all
44:35 gonna freeze to death
44:37 it's going through a cycle it's gonna
44:39 last a thousand years so man's gonna
44:40 have to climb into holes you know
44:42 but nobody believes that someone tells
44:45 you that story everyone's like yeah
44:46 whatever i gotta pay my bills and they
44:47 just don't pay attention to it but they
44:50 turn on their media machine
44:52 and they just start projecting this
44:54 reality
44:56 every place you go they spend a trillion
44:59 dollars on road signs on
45:02 apps to follow it and all the news media
45:04 which is complete crap is
45:06 is publishing this scientific magazines
45:09 are coming out you can't go anywhere
45:10 without
45:12 a sign warning you about things they
45:13 tell the cities that are all co-opted by
45:15 these scumbags
45:16 they put up those road signs that you
45:18 know usually say accident ahead move
45:20 aside
45:21 buckle up don't drink and drive
45:22 fireworks are illegal this year
45:24 and it just says brace for impact brakes
45:26 right you know
45:28 even though it's only 100 degrees out
45:30 the signs say it's 140 out and everyone
45:32 just thinks it's 140
45:33 just because everywhere they go they
45:36 don't have a thermometer in their house
45:39 they get it from an app they get it from
45:41 a tv they get it from their neighbor
45:42 they get it from that
45:43 thermometer in your car which is always
45:45 20 to 30 degrees hotter than it is
45:47 then they go all and get all the pundits
45:50 all the neil degrasse tysons and bill
45:51 nye the douchebag guy and they
45:53 run it on tv constantly and
45:56 automatically they know they have the
45:58 majority of the world in their back
45:59 pocket because the majority of the
46:00 world's asleep
46:02 so they're sucking this down like crazy
46:05 and they're redoing their schematic
46:07 for the sub id so you don't believe it's
46:10 true
46:11 but god damn it it starts getting warmer
46:14 for real
46:16 you live in the south pole as a
46:17 researcher or you're in
46:19 northern russia all the ice starts
46:21 melting
46:23 oceans start going up now the
46:26 inconceivable the scientifically
46:28 impossible
46:31 without major major changes to the world
46:34 is suddenly happening
46:36 they start to tell you the earthquakes
46:38 are all about to happen they're going to
46:39 happen in the next week
46:41 and here in la or san francisco they all
46:43 concentrate on it and
46:44 boom we get the big ones two of them
46:47 separate ones
46:48 mountain st helens explodes again or or
46:51 yellowstone park explodes right that's
46:53 the big one that we're all worried about
46:56 chaos starts to ensue simply because
47:00 they infected our minds with the
47:02 perceptive reality
47:03 slash perceptive truth perceive truth i
47:06 should say
47:08 which just like you know
47:11 pouring water down inside of a a well it
47:14 goes all the way down to the deepest
47:16 darkest parts of your mind
47:18 and of course i would assume that they
47:20 would know how to say this in a
47:21 particular way
47:22 and augment it by you know visual
47:26 confirmations
47:27 it just sinks right in man and
47:30 everything changes
47:32 the thing is is this isn't an all or
47:34 nothing situation
47:35 and what i mean by that is it's not a
47:38 situation where you have to convince the
47:39 entire world
47:41 of anything because there's micro
47:43 fractures in this situation
47:45 micro changes that can occur that could
47:47 send a particular population
47:49 into a dire situation
47:53 brazil and venezuela were not
47:56 in the state that they are in now having
47:59 endorsed socialism and a dictator which
48:01 is always the
48:02 process right they were not bad off 20
48:05 years ago
48:06 but today the murder rate is insane
48:09 kids killing kids i mean teenagers
48:11 killing teenagers it's
48:13 god awful horrible thing if you live in
48:16 america
48:17 or study america are you just old enough
48:20 to know
48:21 the way america was you look back on old
48:25 television shows like george and gracie
48:27 or any of the shows what's my line any
48:30 of those old shows back in the day
48:31 radio shows whatever and americans were
48:34 nice people
48:36 you know when you go to asia and a lot
48:38 of like vietnam
48:39 and japan and thailand or
48:44 taiwan or something like that you bump
48:46 into the most friendly people on planet
48:47 earth
48:49 there's a bunch of videos out there that
48:51 are the cultural differences between
48:53 japan and america and a lot of them the
48:55 kind of the don'ts that you're
48:57 not supposed to do or the dues
49:00 that you're supposed to do is based on
49:02 courtesy and honor
49:04 of old people versus young people
49:07 and america doesn't have it it's like no
49:10 one gives an f right
49:12 well how did we get that way and you
49:15 know again i understand there's plenty
49:16 of
49:17 sociology that can explain all this
49:21 but we now live in a really messed up
49:23 america
49:24 super messed up inconceivable things
49:27 that are
49:28 that are absolutely linked with the
49:30 demise of mankind
49:32 are being popularized and we can't seem
49:34 to to kill it
49:37 but in the last four years in america
49:39 there's been a support mechanism here
49:42 via the white house to bring back those
49:44 old ways
49:46 and so would awaken the beast
49:50 of people tolerating this media blitz on
49:54 who we are as people
49:56 and so there's now going to be probably
49:59 some form of major event
50:01 in this country to take back the country
50:04 and sort of regress us maybe 50 60 years
50:07 without all the prejudice of course
50:09 hopefully the racism that we used to
50:10 have all the bad stuff can stay behind
50:12 but the good stuff that we had being
50:14 kind and courteous to each other can
50:15 move forward
50:17 sort of the way we should have done it
50:18 from the very beginning but then again
50:21 you have to screw up sometimes before
50:23 you figure out how to do it right
50:25 it was just a microscopic moment in time
50:28 when mankind here in america was
50:31 really pretty well balanced again racism
50:34 aside
50:36 so what does this mean to us on a daily
50:38 basis if this had any truth to it
50:40 whatsoever
50:41 i'm gonna assure you that the other that
50:43 the excuse me the advice i'm gonna give
50:45 you to manage this sub id
50:47 is good advice no matter what and
50:48 probably stuff you already do
50:50 and we've been kind of echoing this
50:52 theme throughout other episodes
50:54 never before in history and it's a
50:57 double-edged sword what i'm about to say
50:59 has it been important for you to think
51:01 for yourself
51:04 what i'm not saying is that you have to
51:06 contradict
51:07 other people as a form of empirical
51:09 behavior
51:12 or sorry imperative behavior we all know
51:15 the contrarian i'll probably make an
51:16 episode on contrarians
51:18 this season we have to police
51:22 the information coming inside of us and
51:25 we have to police it on a
51:27 only i should say this is really for
51:29 america i'm sure that europe
51:31 has definitely this is true as well but
51:34 we have to make sure that whoever
51:36 tells us quote unquote who the enemy is
51:40 you can't listen you got to make up your
51:42 own mind whether or not someone's a bad
51:44 guy or a good guy
51:46 you do ideas on how to run your life we
51:50 have to make sure that these are good
51:51 ideas
51:52 but just like dr sawwell was talking
51:54 about the scottish
51:56 in england they advanced
52:00 by copying the good things from the
52:03 british
52:04 and then they excelled intellectually
52:06 beyond the british because that was a
52:09 it was a thing they were focused on
52:10 getting intelligent working on english
52:12 instead of celtic languages
52:14 and then immediately they found out hey
52:16 we're not dumb we just couldn't
52:18 communicate with you so you thought we
52:20 were dumb
52:21 and here come the scientists here come
52:22 the writers here come the scholars and
52:24 the politicians and the poli-sci people
52:27 that's how they dug themself out that's
52:30 a beautiful archetype for all mankind
52:32 especially on an individual level in
52:34 america it is very dangerous to get old
52:38 very dangerous to get old it's dangerous
52:40 for multiple reasons
52:42 the two most glaring reasons is that
52:45 employment
52:46 becomes damn near impossible due to age
52:47 discrimination
52:49 that was forged into our reality because
52:52 corporations don't want to pay high
52:53 salaries for expertise
52:55 they'd rather have more errors with a
52:57 young person
52:58 at a quarter of the price than paying
53:00 for the person who's going to have less
53:02 errors
53:03 culturally speaking because america is
53:07 about consumption
53:08 as you get older if you don't wake up
53:10 and simplify your life and your desires
53:12 and what you think you need versus what
53:14 you want
53:16 you do become lazy and fat
53:19 in america you can almost equiv
53:22 unequivocally tell how old someone is by
53:23 how heavy they are
53:25 wasn't that way when i was a little kid
53:27 go look at all those movies of
53:28 post-world war ii
53:29 and the growing 50s and whatever
53:33 the obesity was almost non-existent
53:35 didn't matter how old you were
53:36 you couldn't tell anybody in my hometown
53:37 was obese or old because they were obese
53:40 but the second thing that is makes
53:43 getting old dangerous in america is that
53:45 youth of this world
53:48 doesn't feel any connection with their
53:51 parents
53:52 uh like i don't have any real major
53:55 major connection with my parents
53:57 um and it's very very different from my
53:59 connection with my mom which is
54:01 different than my connection with my dad
54:04 now my family sort of has a little
54:05 philosophy that is at least on the male
54:07 side of the family
54:09 you don't burden your kids you don't
54:12 doesn't mean the kids can't help it just
54:13 means you're not going to call them up
54:15 and say
54:16 i need to move in with you it just
54:18 doesn't happen it's never happened
54:20 in i think maybe my grandmother was
54:23 suffering
54:24 with dementia she ended up living a
54:26 little bit with my uncle but it was for
54:28 a very short period of time they put her
54:29 in a really beautiful home just down the
54:31 street i mean literally like two miles
54:32 from my uncle so it was good
54:34 that's what you get for living in a
54:35 small town a little bit more support
54:37 system and the old people hang out with
54:39 the old people but you get a big city
54:43 you can just rot in a little apartment
54:45 you can rot in a room you got for rent
54:47 and
54:47 and the only thing that's going to
54:48 happen is your landlord's going to find
54:50 your dead body
54:53 it's sad the big thing in japan
54:57 is that the the elderly of japan are
55:01 highly respected and you treat them
55:04 accordingly you know and we try to do
55:06 that in america but again
55:08 big city life it's pretty rare
55:11 depends on what neighborhood you live in
55:12 where i live it's all midwestern
55:14 standards which is good
55:15 so if an older woman was trying to get
55:17 into a department store and the doors
55:19 weren't automatic someone's going to
55:20 rush up to help her out
55:22 you going to los angeles good luck
55:25 now the other thing too is i believe
55:26 that if this were even true
55:29 and let's say that massive change is
55:31 possible
55:33 again they could technically
55:36 get everyone to believe the world is
55:37 flat and then it would go flat
55:39 instantaneously well once you get the
55:42 majority of people to believe it
55:44 i know that sounds outrageous and i'm
55:45 only saying that as an example but i
55:48 don't think that they
55:49 are disappointed with the way the world
55:53 is perceived
55:54 i don't think they're disappointed with
55:56 the class structure
55:58 that they have taught us is the way the
56:01 world works
56:03 people who and i just it was one of the
56:05 listeners i want to
56:06 thank this person for sending me this
56:07 video
56:09 actually they posted on facebook on our
56:11 facebook page
56:13 it was a video of a guy i don't even
56:15 know who it was but he was just kind of
56:16 a radio
56:17 podcasty thing with some pictures going
56:19 by on youtube
56:21 and the dude was like really angry at
56:23 the beginning of the video or very
56:24 determined i should say
56:27 and he said you know the most because
56:30 well the biggest screw-up that we're
56:31 making as mankind is believing that any
56:34 other man
56:34 on this planet has authority over us
56:37 because that's the biggest problem that
56:39 we have on this planet
56:41 well that's a perceptive thing isn't it
56:43 what do we talk about when we talk about
56:45 children
56:46 perception of your capabilities is
56:48 everything
56:49 i watched the uh was it the
56:53 the white underbelly channel uh it's
56:54 like forget the exact name but it was
56:56 like it's the guy
56:57 who does all the interviews with people
56:59 on skid row
57:01 he's actually branched out and filmed
57:03 some things that are really disturbing
57:05 he has a video of with an inbred family
57:08 i think in like north carolina or
57:09 something and he goes to north carolina
57:11 he never has left the studio in
57:12 all the videos i've ever seen he's
57:14 invited he's always interviewing
57:16 prostitutes and pimps and
57:19 drug addicts and all kinds of stuff it's
57:20 very educational it's amazing
57:22 you really get a perception and he
57:24 interviews him for like half an hour to
57:25 an hour
57:27 a lot of these people will say you know
57:29 i got into drugs because this or that
57:31 and of course their families are always
57:32 broken somehow
57:34 but a lot of them will say that they
57:36 like a prostitute will often tell a
57:38 story where she
57:39 is dominated by a quote-unquote pimp
57:42 who farms her out to guys right and
57:45 he'll ask him you know what
57:47 made you surrender yourself to this pimp
57:51 when you can go down the street and get
57:53 that kind of business all day long
57:56 and honestly they they don't talk about
57:58 the territorial
58:00 stuff anymore like it used to be that if
58:02 you went down to a corner and started to
58:03 try to trick
58:05 if a pimp said in his brain i own that
58:07 corner you can't do it you got to work
58:08 for him or he's going to kill you
58:11 a lot of these prostitutes actually work
58:12 independently because the internet
58:15 there's a lot more avenues for finding
58:17 traffic
58:18 those are typically slightly more
58:20 sophisticated operations
58:24 but a lot of them are just simply saying
58:25 well this person
58:27 was the first person to tell me that i
58:29 had any qualities whatsoever
58:32 and that's what these pimps do i've been
58:34 on the streets of new york and the
58:35 streets of l.a and
58:37 i've heard the pimps doing their spiel
58:39 man they've got they've always talked
58:41 about how they got this
58:43 this spiel they do and it's they say the
58:45 same thing
58:46 just slightly evolved from the previous
58:48 attempt and it's their game they're
58:49 running the game on the girl
58:51 and they just and they know everything
58:53 these girls can possibly say back and
58:54 they have the perfect thing to say to
58:56 infect their brains
58:57 with like you're more secure with me i'm
58:59 going to take everything from you
59:01 your money but you won't want for
59:03 anything you'll have nice stresses
59:04 you'll be protected anyone messes with
59:05 you you mess with me i get old blah blah
59:07 blah
59:08 and it's interesting there was one i
59:11 watched last night which was
59:12 also sort of massively disturbing or
59:15 this woman
59:17 was a survivor of incest and it was that
59:20 her grandfather was this complete pedo
59:22 had raped his daughter
59:24 for a little while there she thought she
59:25 might be his doc his
59:27 his daughter and turns out that he'd had
59:30 his tubes tied before they had ever
59:32 before he started raping her mother
59:35 but they asked because i went when they
59:37 asked her like when did this start she
59:38 said
59:38 14 years old first time it ever happened
59:41 and it was sort of infrequent but
59:43 she went off and she said that her big
59:46 problem was that she was this big rebel
59:49 which is very interesting the whole
59:51 thing you can't tell me what to do
59:52 man that is the recipe for screwing up
59:55 your life
59:56 to the infinite degree but she said that
59:59 he would always tell that she was a lady
60:01 after doing what he did
60:03 don't don't forget you're a lady and he
60:05 would gift her things
60:07 and sort of be like that boyfriend or
60:10 that husband that you could never find a
60:11 real life
60:12 and so even though she hated it
60:15 she said there was this sick weird thing
60:18 that he was giving me something i wasn't
60:20 finding anywhere else
60:23 i should tell you the parenting is a
60:26 very simple job that you just got to do
60:28 and the number one thing you can do is
60:30 give your kids
60:31 accolades tell them they can be anything
60:33 that they want to be ask them what they
60:34 want to be just the question of what do
60:36 you want to be when you grow up
60:38 that is not just a little game that is
60:41 forging a higher level of success and
60:43 perception of the future with goals
60:47 in your child so the reason why i
60:49 mention this is
60:51 this system could work in a microcosm as
60:54 well
60:55 it's not just psychology psychology is a
60:58 medium by which you get to that sub id
61:01 and then one concedes one agrees
61:04 on perception of reality and thus here
61:06 goes
61:08 people are alcoholics or drug addicts
61:10 who get out of the addiction
61:13 a lot of times they get out of addiction
61:16 through religion
61:18 very common thing the ultra strong can
61:21 get out without religion because they've
61:23 simply
61:24 self-perceived this reality of them
61:27 being on drugs as being the worst thing
61:29 on ever they're taking inventory every
61:30 time they wake up hung over
61:32 or when they go through withdrawals and
61:34 they
61:35 own their mind and they man handle
61:37 themselves out of it
61:38 now it's no criticism of the other way
61:41 if you can get out of it you do whatever
61:42 you need to do blow up balloons if that
61:44 helps you
61:45 but what does religion do religion flat
61:47 out tells you what's good and what's bad
61:50 any religion this is against the rules
61:53 and if you believe in a hell boy
61:54 it's really motivating if you can truly
61:56 perceive that
61:58 so religion what is religion
62:01 religion is a schematic that you can
62:04 adopt
62:05 and drop straight into your programming
62:07 down to that sub id
62:09 and adopt it and it becomes real
62:12 now i've talked at length in 500
62:15 episodes here and there
62:17 about the fact that there seems to be
62:21 this is what i alluded to in colliding
62:23 realities oh i hadn't this concept was
62:24 not in my mind at all when i did that
62:26 episode but that we can show people
62:30 evidence
62:31 of scientific conflicts for that day in
62:33 september
62:35 and no matter how much you can prove to
62:37 them on paper that the science doesn't
62:39 support the assertion
62:41 they need to believe all these people
62:44 died the way that they died
62:46 you could have a shooting that happens
62:48 and it may be one of those ones where
62:50 maybe nobody was really hurt
62:52 but they want those people to be dead
62:54 because that way they don't have to get
62:56 down into that system because whatever
62:57 whatever reason
62:59 they have a warm fuzzy with the massacre
63:01 story and not a warm fuzzy
63:03 with an alternative where no one got
63:05 killed
63:06 i have you know been around the united
63:10 states
63:11 as a kid obviously as an adult
63:15 travel the world just a tad and what's
63:18 interesting is
63:19 and something i think about as i get
63:21 older is
63:23 the subtleties of our behavioral
63:25 differences between human beings
63:27 especially men to men
63:30 and if you've ever experienced this
63:32 you'll know what i'm talking about i'm
63:34 pretty sure most of you have had it
63:36 whether you consciously realized or not
63:38 this might be a fun exercise if this is
63:39 the first time you've heard of this
63:40 but it applies to this theory you'll
63:45 see people interact with other people
63:47 and sometimes you see someone that
63:50 sort of behaves like um
63:53 like there's a there's a suspicious
63:55 behavior to them
63:56 and that they're treating you like
63:58 you're suspicious
64:00 they're fine but they treat you like i
64:03 don't know
64:03 you just said that thing and i don't
64:05 know if i believe you and
64:07 whatever man you know i'll find out
64:09 later if i believe that's real
64:12 and when i was younger especially i
64:14 found that behavior really annoying like
64:17 and it's because i tell the truth
64:20 and so if i'm bringing information to
64:21 you to the best of my ability it is the
64:23 truth right
64:24 i could be full of [ __ ] sometimes but
64:26 whatever
64:28 but they have obviously run into or were
64:30 raised inside of
64:32 a deceptive envelope of reality
64:35 they have potentially experienced tons
64:38 of people lying to them
64:40 and so in order to police the
64:41 information coming inside their mind
64:44 they're suspicious are there more
64:46 tactful ways to be suspicious
64:49 probably there's probably ways to go oh
64:51 yeah really wow that's cool yeah
64:53 inside your brain you're going no way
64:54 whatever
64:56 but you keep the other person
64:58 comfortable nothing else you milk them
65:00 for everything that they think is one
65:01 way or the other
65:02 it gives you more fodder to go and
65:04 evaluate things later
65:06 i like to get everything out of
65:07 everybody if someone's telling me a
65:08 theory i don't believe
65:10 uh in the past i would have stomped in
65:12 there no way
65:14 does this this when i was younger and
65:16 now as i get older i just sit there and
65:17 go oh really
65:18 well that's cool well tell me more about
65:20 this more about that i just dig and dig
65:22 and dig and they can leave the room
65:23 after two hour conversation
65:26 not realizing that i haven't said a word
65:27 really i've just been a reflection
65:29 session
65:31 i think i recently said this but i'm
65:32 going to say it again
65:34 that old saying if it seems too good to
65:36 be it probably is
65:39 now that is one that's dealing with a
65:42 notion of fortune
65:44 if someone's promising you a free
65:45 sandwich
65:47 or i just keep saying sandwiches free
65:49 lunch right free lunch
65:51 is probably not free there's some other
65:52 thing to it i've seen this and
65:54 experienced this in my life
65:55 countless times more times that i'd like
65:57 to admit
65:59 all right well we look at our
66:03 existence and it seems like
66:06 most of the definitions of reality
66:08 immediately lead to infinity
66:10 how big is space infinite how long have
66:13 we been here forever
66:14 all those little sayings seem to be
66:18 it's like it's counter-intuitive to our
66:20 inner core
66:22 because perhaps as our consciousness
66:26 our human consciousness here's that
66:27 subject matter
66:30 we definitely try to solve for it in our
66:32 minds right someone says
66:34 well space is infinite and then
66:35 sometimes you just go okay whatever
66:38 i'll take a number two spicy or
66:42 you sort of send a query almost like
66:45 maybe a
66:46 math problem out to your soul who then
66:48 hands it off to the universe
66:50 i think sometimes it comes back and says
66:53 not really
66:54 but don't worry about it doesn't matter
66:57 and so we're left with an uneasiness
66:58 that's kind of like
67:00 really you know infinity can't exist
67:03 because
67:04 infinity means that it's growing
67:06 constantly if the
67:07 if the universe was infinite it'd have
67:09 to be an is of infiniteness
67:11 which means there's any border the
67:12 borders continuing to grow or just
67:14 is infinite out there makes no sense
67:16 does it
67:18 but if you're in a matrix that's
67:20 dictated by subid schematics
67:23 well that could be the perception that
67:25 we have because we haven't completed the
67:27 simulation
67:29 why are there stars in the sky maybe
67:31 it's just for decoration
67:33 maybe it's to beckon man to try to
67:35 travel in the stars
67:37 maybe there's a hidden code in it don't
67:40 get me started thinking for yourself
67:42 is not a contradictory exercise i want
67:44 to say that twice
67:47 it just means that you're going to need
67:49 perhaps a little more data than we
67:51 shared with you initially about a
67:52 particular concept
67:54 for you to completely digest it and
67:58 part of it has to do with that alarm
68:00 system that goes off
68:01 like my my last example which is
68:04 someone's telling you something and for
68:06 some reason you have a hesitation
68:10 it's because perhaps you looked it up in
68:12 the universe is mega database up
68:14 there in the real cloud and it's coming
68:16 back no
68:17 but i'm not going to send back in the
68:19 query
68:21 the solution because you don't deserve
68:23 to know everything just because you
68:24 asked a question about it
68:26 that'll impact the simulation and thus
68:29 everyone would know everything the
68:30 second they asked a question about it in
68:32 their mind
68:33 there's a limit don't want to mess up
68:35 for everything
68:37 this is no matter how you slice it a
68:39 limited form of existence
68:41 it is if you think about your soul
68:43 continuing to live forever
68:46 which is a little bit easier to digest
68:47 in space being forever
68:50 then this reality is okay and every
68:53 reality is okay
68:54 anyway i want to share that with you
68:56 guys because uh
68:58 it was fairly interesting to me
69:01 and just thinking i mean the way i think
69:03 about it is you take
69:04 pre-dynastic egypt very small population
69:08 initially
69:09 and they're able to do things
69:13 why are they able to build the pyramids
69:16 because they perceived
69:18 the capability to do so they weren't
69:19 told no first they were told
69:22 why not they had an idea to do something
69:25 that was perhaps never done before
69:27 and so whatever mechanisms they used to
69:29 do it
69:30 they were just available limestones
69:32 didn't weigh two and a half tons apiece
69:35 at the smallest possible stone but
69:38 you can factor this schematic system
69:41 into everything
69:42 how tall are we how smart are we how
69:44 long do we live
69:46 imagine man being fairly immortal until
69:48 a man perceives death
69:50 and then through maybe fear or curiosity
69:52 we manifest
69:53 mortality it can go in all dimensions of
69:57 all things
69:59 and that for me is really interesting
70:02 not sure you can make a movie out of
70:03 this but
70:03 it seems like there's a little thread
70:05 there for a book anyway
70:07 let me know what you think in the
70:08 comments and if you haven't been to
70:10 deepthoughtsradio.com please go and just
70:11 bookmark it
70:12 it's got everything up there you need
70:15 make sure and uh
70:16 like and subscribe if you dig it uh our
70:18 subscriptions and views are off the
70:20 chain man i mean it's we're really
70:22 getting super busy so
70:23 for all the to all the newcomers thank
70:25 you for joining hopefully we can keep
70:27 you entertained
70:28 these are the episodes that checker in
70:29 between the more
70:31 commercial topic episo episodes but i
70:34 think it's always good for you to
70:36 to reach out inside your brain and push
70:38 it in areas that you
70:40 never before perhaps have conceived of
70:44 anyway until the next episode take care
70:46 of yourself and someone else and i will
70:48 see you
70:48 in the next deep thoughts over now
70:59 [Music]
71:10 so
71:17 [Applause]
71:22 [Music]
71:24 so
71:28 you
