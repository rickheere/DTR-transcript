00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen
00:38 merry christmas it's technically the day
00:42 after christmas right now it's about
00:45 12 34.
00:49 neighbors are partying across the street
00:50 so if you hear any evps on this track
00:53 it's the neighbors next door not some
00:56 spirit
00:58 unless it's like really apparent right
01:00 so today we're going to talk about evp
01:03 or the electronic voice phenomena
01:08 some of you may have heard of this some
01:10 of you may have heard of this and forgot
01:11 about it and some of you may have never
01:13 heard of this at all
01:16 this is the
01:20 the electronic version of something i
01:22 said the other day which is
01:23 um if you can create something
01:28 very delicate in the universe
01:31 then the most delicate influences
01:34 within the universe might be able to
01:36 manipulate that
01:38 delicate device and thus communicate
01:42 with us
01:44 so i'm going to read you a little quote
01:46 from thomas edison
01:48 who supposedly said this gets the
01:50 internet so
01:52 you know who knows but it seems like
01:54 intelligent people
01:56 have this curiosity
02:00 so the quote says uh if our personality
02:03 survives then it is strictly logical or
02:05 scientific to assume that it retains
02:06 memory
02:07 intellect other faculties and knowledge
02:10 that we acquire on this earth therefore
02:13 if we can evolve an instrument
02:14 so delicate as to be affected by our
02:17 personality
02:18 as it survives in the next life such an
02:21 instrument
02:22 when made available ought to record
02:24 something
02:27 interesting now if any of you have any
02:29 more knowledge about edison's uh
02:31 little fourier into this thing now is
02:34 your time to be the expert in the
02:35 comments
02:37 now i'm just gonna preface this okay
02:40 you are listening to the voice of
02:42 someone who has
02:44 always always always since it first
02:47 occurred to me and i have no idea when
02:48 that
02:49 first happened probably
02:52 most definitely in a scientific way in
02:54 my mid-20s
02:56 and i've mentioned this a couple times
02:57 in other episodes
03:00 but there'd been you know a variety of
03:01 people that said that if there were
03:03 methods of
03:04 communicating with the present from
03:07 the other side i shouldn't mention
03:09 present like there's a time
03:11 envelope here but if they were able to
03:14 communicate with us from the other side
03:15 that they would
03:17 houdini's wife or houdini's wife said
03:19 that he said
03:22 he would try everything in his power to
03:23 communicate with her
03:26 now we're going to go through a few
03:27 other techniques that might be possible
03:29 before jumping
03:30 directly into evp so that evp has a
03:33 really nice
03:35 perspective john lennon said he would
03:38 float across the room as a feather
03:40 i'm going to give you one that that
03:45 apparently worked and i don't even know
03:47 if i should mention the name
03:49 if it's too private to mention but it
03:51 seems cool doesn't seem like it's gonna
03:52 hurt anything
03:54 but i'll pull the name just for now
03:58 i don't know if i've said the name in
03:59 the previous episodes if i did then you
04:01 know already but
04:02 a close friend of mine who passed away
04:04 told his partner hey
04:06 because his partner asked him do you
04:07 think he'll try to contact me when you
04:09 get the other side
04:11 and he immediately replied when you see
04:14 the unicorn
04:16 you'll know that's me yeah you know what
04:19 i think i already mentioned this once
04:21 it's sid meat sydney told his partner
04:24 roger
04:24 that's going to happen said mead's uh
04:28 favorite show on tv was the simpsons
04:30 believe it or not which just
04:32 i mean it's a brilliant show don't get
04:34 me wrong but just amazing he's followed
04:36 it all the way through
04:37 since the early 90s wasn't it 1990 that
04:39 show debuted
04:42 and so roger turns it on i mean what a
04:45 brave man right
04:46 turns it on downtown downstairs excuse
04:48 me and
04:50 there's an episode and he said the only
04:53 episode he watched at the time
04:55 he says there's a unicorn in the middle
04:56 of the episode and it's not the butt of
04:59 any joke it's just there
05:04 who knows right obviously the episode
05:07 was
05:07 well was probably created before sid
05:11 pass so
05:11 that influence would have to have been
05:14 um
05:15 an orchestration of time and influence
05:19 it's very interesting either that are we
05:21 living in a matrix man
05:24 now before we get into evp
05:27 and some of the principles behind it i
05:29 think it's important to remember
05:30 james randy from our previous episode
05:35 he said that you know when psychics and
05:37 what have you mediums claim to talk to
05:39 the other side
05:41 there's never any prolonged intelligent
05:44 conversation that seems to
05:47 remedy anything that seems to be you
05:49 know one good conversation where
05:52 someone is connecting a dot that just
05:54 can't be connected unless you're on the
05:56 other side
05:59 the other sad thing is if these things
06:01 were real
06:02 and all these psychics were talking to
06:03 people and all that kind of stuff
06:05 they seem to not
06:09 really gain any knowledge on the other
06:10 side
06:12 to say oh it wasn't the grassy knoll it
06:14 was the drain you know
06:16 dinosaurs didn't exist the earth isn't
06:20 round you know i mean
06:21 there's no interesting just epiphanies
06:23 like that and you know maybe there's
06:25 rural systems they don't go
06:27 spilling the beans to the living but
06:30 like james randy said he said his
06:32 grandmother because she didn't see the
06:34 episode
06:34 he said his grandmother died and and
06:37 there was supposed to be a will that the
06:38 attorney knows there was a will
06:40 but she must have either misplaced it or
06:42 hid it and nobody knew
06:44 where it was they never found it but it
06:45 is truly
06:47 the easiest way to mitigate the
06:49 inheritance
06:50 instead of letting the state get
06:52 involved and
06:53 perhaps give it to the the least popular
06:56 child for that person's
06:58 existence but this is the process of
07:03 recording something with electronic
07:04 equipment of any kind
07:07 and i really mean any kind it could be
07:09 this camera right here this microphone
07:11 which is on a separate channel
07:13 and then the way that this phenomenon is
07:15 is discussed
07:16 is that you never hear the voices
07:18 typically
07:20 while you are recording you will even
07:23 ask the questions
07:25 you say you want to talk to a relative
07:27 that just passed a friend that just
07:28 passed
07:29 you'll ask the question and you won't
07:30 hear anything when you're recording
07:32 and then when you play it back is when
07:34 you actually hear the embedded messages
07:37 and there's different classifications
07:39 the way that the messages come back
07:41 which are classified in a b or c
07:45 so i'm just going to read them to you
07:46 real quickly
07:49 class a isn't easily understood by
07:51 almost
07:52 anyone with little or no dispute
07:55 they're also usually the loudest evps
07:58 class b is usually characterized by
08:00 warping of the voice in certain
08:02 syllables
08:04 lower in volume and more distinct
08:06 sounding than class
08:07 a class b is the most common type
08:11 of evp oh excuse me not distinct
08:14 distant excuse me i'll learn how to read
08:17 one of these days
08:18 class c is characterized by excessive
08:20 warping
08:22 they are the lowest in volume often with
08:23 spring and
08:25 are the hardest to understand so
08:27 essentially
08:28 a to c it just gets worse and worse and
08:31 worse
08:32 in terms of the quality of these
08:33 recordings
08:36 now we're going to review the light
08:39 history of folks who
08:41 have claimed to have heard these and
08:44 recorded these
08:45 but i went on a binge uh because dark
08:48 five
08:49 talked about this in one of his episodes
08:54 i don't even know what year it was but i
08:56 watched it this year
08:57 probably did it this year and
09:01 you know it's it's one of these things
09:02 of um
09:04 there's this weird trend with quote
09:06 unquote researchers
09:09 and i do not mean to diminish anyone's
09:12 exploration into something whatsoever
09:15 but you'll have people
09:17 read about this they'll perhaps in this
09:20 particular case listen to something
09:22 that's fairly convincing and they're
09:24 like wow i got money i got equipment and
09:27 i got time
09:27 i got intelligence i know about this so
09:29 let's let's start doing it
09:32 and so they will attempt for a
09:35 considerable amount of time
09:36 it's a run of money this time is money
09:41 and oftentimes they won't succeed
09:45 they are very open-minded they want this
09:46 thing to occur
09:49 now in some cases they will publicize
09:51 the fact they're going to do this which
09:52 is the kiss of death
09:55 because then your character gets
09:56 involved with it
09:58 that crazy nut over there doing that
10:01 and then you let that amass on you
10:03 without results
10:06 well it would only be natural to try and
10:08 stuff it in their face
10:09 if you still believe that maybe you're
10:11 not picking up on the signal
10:12 but everyone else is who claims to have
10:15 done so
10:16 which is a handful of people and then
10:19 they
10:19 tend to go off and collaborate with
10:21 someone else so they've got a bunch of
10:23 machinery
10:24 they are recording tons of stuff not
10:27 getting anything back
10:28 then they'll go off with someone who is
10:30 famous for doing it and all of a sudden
10:32 it starts showing up
10:35 that for me is a very suspect pattern in
10:37 all things
10:39 a lot of the fake paleontology
10:43 of the study of the dinosaur is rigged
10:45 in this sort of thing
10:47 ah they read a paper from a guy who was
10:49 a darwin disciple that there probably
10:52 was a gigantic race of beings
10:54 before man it's like how do you get that
10:56 theory man
10:57 and instantaneously search search search
11:00 search six inch tooth oh
11:02 builds a tyrannosaurus rex uh out of a
11:04 tooth
11:05 right there's no replicator from uh star
11:08 trek uh
11:09 enterprise in the holodeck that can
11:11 synthesize the dna of a
11:13 of a lost tooth this is a fifth element
11:16 where you have a part of her hand and
11:17 you can make the rest of her body
11:20 so this dude who found the tooth makes a
11:22 fake dinosaur shows it in a museum for
11:24 god i don't know 30 years and even after
11:26 the guy guy's dead it's shown
11:28 and then all of a sudden the first
11:29 dinosaur bones they find are exactly
11:31 like this replica that he made
11:33 of this fake thing you know sometimes we
11:36 just got to give it up
11:38 can't believe in crap anymore
11:41 now the other thing is that what if you
11:43 are known for this kind of thing
11:45 and you know again there's this there's
11:48 this thing we have to remember
11:50 and i forgot to mention it in my
11:54 my episode about the psychics
11:57 is that you may actually have a talent
12:00 let's say you're a psychic and you have
12:02 a talent that works
12:04 or has worked unbelievably in the past
12:08 and let's say people witnessed it and
12:10 they're like oh my god that was very
12:12 legit
12:12 even james randy's going oh my god
12:14 that's amazing
12:16 looks like you really got a connection
12:18 here to the other side or
12:19 or whatever but you can't make it happen
12:22 again for whatever reason
12:24 the gift of it just eludes you or
12:27 it could be even that you're not relaxed
12:29 enough until you're by yourself
12:31 it's one of those kisses of death where
12:34 it's like the guy in e.t you know elliot
12:37 meets e.t
12:38 and it's all good and fun and games
12:40 until the government shows up and the
12:41 one dude that shows up inside that
12:43 little
12:44 you know uh plastic tent he was a guy
12:46 that said he had seen e.t a long time
12:48 ago
12:49 i think that's the story and so he was
12:51 waiting
12:52 forever to see him again
12:55 so you have ufo people whitley strieber
12:58 for instance writes all the books about
13:00 ufos
13:00 it's communion
13:04 transformation or breakthrough in
13:05 transformation i think is the sequence
13:08 well maybe he was truly abducted at one
13:10 point in his life
13:12 maybe even they fiddled with him for
13:13 years when he was younger
13:15 although it's interesting how he only
13:17 wrote about it later as an adult and
13:19 meanwhile he wrote a bunch of movies and
13:20 books in the meantime
13:23 not sure about that guy and so he wants
13:26 them to come back so he writes about
13:28 them almost like
13:29 bait i dare you to come back i'm writing
13:31 books about you
13:32 come and stop me just trying to get them
13:34 to come back
13:37 so potentially someone could have evp'd
13:41 something
13:42 it's a one in a million thing they're
13:44 gonna be the only person in a particular
13:46 year a decade to ever do
13:48 it because the magic storm happened the
13:50 perfect storm happened
13:52 and they're there i mean what i had to
13:55 eat
13:56 if you've never heard this show before
13:58 this is going to sound kooky
14:00 you know when i went back to disneyland
14:02 after having that walt disney experience
14:05 you don't think i wanted to see the guy
14:06 again
14:09 but i immediately conceded that that
14:11 will most likely never happen again in
14:12 my lifetime it was a one in a million
14:14 situation
14:16 don't know why i think he was probably
14:18 just there
14:19 i was there and bob gur was there and so
14:22 there was a kind of a frequency
14:25 but the one thing i forgot to mention to
14:27 you guys
14:30 was that
14:33 in all honesty gun against my head lie
14:35 detector test connected to my body
14:37 i would have to admit that i was getting
14:41 serious walt disney vibes
14:44 for weeks if not months before he did
14:47 walk up and say something to me
14:50 almost as if he was hovering around me
14:52 and letting me have his presence
14:54 this feeling which i think a lot of
14:57 folks have that feeling
14:58 because you can see through the
14:59 corporate sponsorship you can see
15:01 through what they've done to his
15:02 franchise
15:03 and you just see his fingerprints on
15:06 things because this is again
15:07 as i always say the only park he ever
15:09 went to is disneyland which is like
15:10 eight miles that way
15:13 the only reason why i say eight miles is
15:15 my car broke down a block from the park
15:17 and i had to get it towed and that's
15:18 what i was charged for
15:21 but this evp thing they really stress
15:24 the fact that there's no
15:26 gender constraints there's no age
15:29 constraints
15:30 now i have personally never heard any
15:32 recordings that sound like children
15:35 and i haven't heard any recordings that
15:36 sound like a woman but
15:38 i'm going to read you some case studies
15:40 where this has been claimed
15:44 you know my grandmother came to me the
15:45 day she died and so
15:48 okay well that was to tell me she was on
15:50 the other side and she was okay and then
15:52 two hours later
15:53 i find out that this woman i didn't know
15:55 was near death had died
15:58 and so imagine you're recording
16:00 something
16:01 and that little bumper of life
16:04 never occurred your your grandmother
16:06 your mother your friend or whatever
16:07 never got to say goodbye
16:09 and let's just say you're of a psyche
16:11 where
16:13 they don't know whether or not you have
16:14 a good position
16:16 with the afterlife and so they're
16:18 visiting you so that they can make sure
16:20 you're okay now any of my relatives or
16:23 friends at this point could just simply
16:24 listen to this program and go
16:26 yeah we don't need to visit that guy
16:27 he's got a total belief in the afterlife
16:29 he knows we're okay
16:30 don't need to cover any bases
16:33 if we talk to him he's to say it on his
16:35 show so we better not talk to him
16:39 but perhaps a long time ago as human
16:41 beings were more stoic
16:43 less integrated with the afterlife i
16:46 guess
16:49 and everything was kind of spooky and
16:51 religious in the past and
16:54 people really felt like felt like they
16:56 needed to follow rules and if they broke
16:58 rules they were going to hell and
16:59 hell was always fire and damnation you
17:01 know
17:03 but there's some dispute about where
17:04 these voices would be coming from
17:06 and i'm actually very happy to to learn
17:10 that that's how
17:11 at least advanced the conversation has
17:13 become within that particular
17:17 i would say category of events i
17:19 wouldn't want to say industry
17:23 so the first common thing
17:26 that you would think is these voices are
17:28 from
17:30 dead people i guess technically
17:33 now technically speaking it may be a
17:36 little arrogant for us to say
17:38 every every spirit that exists out there
17:41 has been a human being
17:43 has been on planet earth and is
17:45 communicating with us
17:46 directly as a return visit sort of thing
17:51 you know i initially fell into that as a
17:53 kid when i started to think about
17:55 folks that had passed you know i had
17:58 this
17:58 weird experience i've only said it once
18:00 on a show where we had i had a distant
18:03 cousin of mine that got killed
18:05 in a in a truck accident because
18:08 uh two girls were driving the truck she
18:10 was well one girl was driving the truck
18:12 there's another girl and then my cousin
18:15 and
18:15 they were doing donuts outside of a
18:18 softball
18:21 park and there was a brand new bathroom
18:24 that had been built at a corrugated
18:25 steel
18:26 they had all been drinking so her
18:28 judgment probably wasn't the best but
18:30 she was trying to get out of the vehicle
18:31 because she was sure they were going to
18:32 crash it
18:34 the problem was a little bit of
18:37 logic was missing which is hey outside
18:40 the car you're going to get into more
18:41 trouble
18:42 because she's out of control driving the
18:44 truck right so anyway as
18:46 a result of hopping out she ends up
18:48 getting combined between the truck and
18:50 the trash
18:51 the restroom and lost her life
18:55 i was a it was between 9th grade and
18:58 10th grade
18:58 in my school 9th grade was still in
19:00 middle school 10th grade was your first
19:02 year in
19:02 high school i go into french class i get
19:06 a book
19:07 and her name is right in the front she
19:09 was the last owner of that book
19:11 this was all fresh i mean it was like
19:13 this had just happened
19:14 we just started school some weird thing
19:16 about my hometown like if any kids are
19:18 gonna die
19:19 it's just just a week before school
19:22 starts i mean the amount of crazy
19:23 accidents that have occurred
19:25 that have either taken life or severely
19:28 severely severely well we're gonna make
19:31 some new words up
19:32 one one per episode
19:36 severely injured it always happened the
19:38 week before school started it was just
19:39 weird
19:42 and so that just sort of kind of woke up
19:44 that was the event that just sort of
19:46 catalyzed my mind to
19:48 wow we die young sometimes and
19:52 it's it's i got to live my life 100 and
19:54 sort of
19:55 vicariously for these people that pass
19:58 and then a year later one of my best
20:01 buds and
20:01 my little idols man one of the coolest
20:04 dudes in the school got nailed and we
20:06 had spent the evening together the night
20:07 before and he just literally left me and
20:09 then went and
20:10 got killed on a motorcycle accident
20:14 so anyway the reason why i mentioned
20:16 that is that
20:18 you eventually start to adopt this idea
20:21 that there's probably souls out there
20:23 that haven't been
20:25 human before they've been other things
20:27 other aliens maybe even insects birds
20:29 whatever maybe they were a rock for
20:31 100 million years just cuz right
20:34 but definitely voices from the dead is
20:35 one of the philosophies of where these
20:37 voices come from
20:39 the other one is that they come from
20:42 other dimensions
20:43 which i think is sort of a
20:47 sort of a cartoon version of just a soul
20:50 that hasn't been a human
20:52 because immediately what's funny is you
20:55 get these folks that come in and start
20:56 splitting hairs and start getting to the
20:58 semantics of what's going on
21:02 with this thing and they go well okay if
21:04 they come from another dimension and how
21:05 do they know english you know it's like
21:08 really i don't know i'm just thinking
21:12 learning a language on the other side
21:13 might be really easy
21:15 i don't know the other one which i
21:18 thought was
21:19 really interesting was that they
21:20 theorized that
21:22 these voices might be coming from the
21:23 subconscious
21:25 frequencies of the gentlemen or women
21:28 who are recording this stuff i think
21:31 that was super insightful
21:34 that is one that i would not have
21:36 probably come up with without some other
21:38 catalyzing event to open my mind to such
21:40 a thing
21:42 and then of course you get your
21:44 religious
21:45 side of things which is that these are
21:47 either angels or demons
21:50 now i have a very close friend of mine
21:53 who is extremely credible human being
21:57 and she told me a story about being in
21:59 her home
22:00 at the time she lived in england and her
22:03 parents bought a really cool old
22:05 home pretty damn big and
22:08 her and her boyfriend had been chilling
22:11 out in the room
22:12 and she was the only one in the house
22:14 with this guy
22:16 and at one point there's like just a
22:18 second story to the house i don't think
22:20 there was a third but maybe there was
22:22 but anyway she's up
22:24 in the living area of the home and she
22:26 had
22:28 gone to her sister's room to try and see
22:30 if she was home i think
22:32 and i don't know if it was when she
22:35 touched the doorknob or approached the
22:37 doorknob but she said she heard
22:39 literally a monster on the other side
22:42 of this doorway
22:46 and she said it growled at a level that
22:49 was
22:51 sonically loud you just gigantic
22:54 it seemed to have volume on the other
22:56 side you know if you were to
22:57 a cat barking on the other side or
22:59 meowing excuse me
23:00 a dog barking and then a tasmanian devil
23:03 or a demon on the other side that might
23:05 be as big as um
23:07 you know andre the giant or something
23:09 it's going to have a different tone of
23:11 voice and she said this thing was just
23:13 ferocious insane and
23:17 she said for the rest of her life she
23:18 was like look
23:20 i don't know why but demons can
23:23 penetrate this universe i don't know why
23:25 they do it
23:26 she did it didn't say anything it just
23:29 essentially warned her not to come in
23:31 the room now the other thing was
23:33 just like me and the kitchen and the
23:35 macaroni and cheese
23:37 thing from the previous episode
23:41 the boyfriend was there and both of them
23:44 just nearly
23:45 wet themselves on this thing because it
23:47 was like both of them are like
23:48 what's going on man and she said it was
23:51 so inhuman
23:53 that it couldn't have been someone
23:55 playing a prank on them on the other
23:56 side plus pranks always
23:59 always you know sort of pan out right i
24:02 mean they you know someone's like i got
24:04 you man you know you son of a [ __ ] you
24:06 know that didn't happen
24:07 no one was in the home now the other one
24:10 is the shortwave radio solution which is
24:14 it's a hoax and i can say most
24:17 definitely
24:18 from the dark five episode on evp just
24:21 look up dark five channel
24:22 episode evp and you'll find it there are
24:25 definitely
24:26 charlatans out there it's very very
24:29 similar to
24:31 the god bless him i don't i think he was
24:34 american but i'm not sure
24:35 some of you may have seen this there was
24:38 a guy out there who
24:40 said he could channel aliens from
24:42 another from other planets and he would
24:44 sit in his
24:46 chair and it was like at will he could
24:48 just contact these beings like they were
24:49 never busy they were never asleep
24:52 and the funny thing was is that he
24:54 invented this
24:57 claim back in the day when
25:02 x minus one was on the radio
25:05 forbidden planet the movie was just made
25:08 uh you know other things
25:10 and so the guy would tense up in his
25:13 chair
25:14 close his eyes which is typical of
25:16 someone who
25:17 is scared a bit
25:21 of the hoax you know don't look at me
25:23 while i do this right
25:24 and he would talk like this and he would
25:27 talk
25:28 like i mean i can't even do it but he
25:29 was talking like one of those robots
25:31 from the 1950s
25:32 it was like by your command you know
25:34 it's like one of those kind of voices
25:36 and he just thought why on earth would
25:38 that be the case
25:40 why on earth would anyone have to change
25:42 the voice of the receiving person
25:45 if i was channeling to you i'm giving
25:47 you impressions of what i'm saying
25:50 and you may or may not ever hear my
25:52 voice in at all
25:54 but this idea that channeling
25:57 in his particular claim would have been
26:00 someone has
26:02 completely and utterly taken over his
26:05 body so he's not really channeling
26:07 as much as surrendering his body to be
26:09 completely controlled
26:10 which is a very classic thing uh that
26:14 seance people do
26:16 and then i guess it would be and this is
26:19 where it gets a little silly
26:20 think about all the conversations we've
26:21 had about how the soul
26:24 is who you really are and your body is
26:26 the trumpet
26:27 and your mind is the song that pushes
26:29 through the trumpet
26:31 and so you just have an instance of your
26:33 consciousness which is what you
26:35 are there's what you are in this world
26:37 visible to the rest of us
26:40 locked ethereal beings so the way that
26:43 we speak
26:44 the way that i'm speaking to you right
26:45 now is built out of
26:47 50 years of muscle memory in my
26:50 cerebellum
26:52 how i stress my vocal cords how i make
26:54 things happen
26:55 is based on my body if i took over your
26:58 body
26:59 it's like that old movie with lily
27:02 tomlin and steve martin which i think is
27:04 all of me
27:05 where they swap consciousness there's a
27:06 bunch of those movies out there
27:08 and he talked in her voice and she
27:11 talked in his voice now there was a
27:12 mannerism
27:14 it's like jack black being the blonde
27:15 and jumanji
27:18 but it's still his voice for the most
27:20 part
27:22 so this idea that an alien comes in your
27:23 body and brings with it some legacy
27:26 muscle memory where would that be coming
27:28 from but
27:29 maybe because the brain doesn't store a
27:31 damn thing that might make some sense
27:33 but this guy was just
27:35 he was just some tom fully malarkey man
27:39 in my opinion now i watch
27:43 and if you guys are interested in this
27:44 subject matter at all this is going to
27:46 be seem like a little bit of a left
27:47 field thing but this is related to radio
27:49 technology
27:50 especially radio technology as soon as
27:53 radios were invented
27:54 there is a wonderful channel
27:58 on youtube if you are interested in the
28:00 fundamentals of electronics
28:02 it's mr carlson's lab it's a dude in
28:05 canada
28:06 he's one that just seems like one of the
28:08 nicest souls on planet earth
28:10 he restores old electronic equipment and
28:13 one of his specialties
28:15 are these restorations of old radios
28:19 he buys them from you know estate sales
28:23 gets them on ebay
28:25 his only requirement is that the case
28:27 itself the dials
28:29 all the molding the buttons that those
28:31 are in pretty damn good condition
28:33 because it doesn't matter beyond that
28:34 point he can
28:36 restore this thing in the restoration
28:40 process
28:40 he takes you through and some of these
28:42 videos are half an hour because he fixes
28:43 them so easily
28:45 and some of them are two hours long but
28:47 you will learn so much about
28:49 electricity about how components work he
28:52 has classes on his patreon
28:55 with how to learn electronics he even
28:56 has a lot of free courses up there you
28:58 can watch
29:01 but you will learn well the first thing
29:04 he'll do
29:05 and this applies to this episode trust
29:06 me he
29:08 you know finds there's no motherboards
29:10 back then so there's like a chassis a
29:12 big
29:13 metal chassis and they have tubes in
29:15 them which are giant versions of
29:17 components we have that are tiny and
29:18 then they have these kind of wax
29:19 capacitors on the bottom which look like
29:21 big
29:22 m80s and he'll do a huge restoration all
29:26 those components
29:27 and then he has to calibrate it and
29:30 calibration has to do
29:32 with sometimes crystals that have to be
29:34 aligned
29:35 but a lot of it has to do with the
29:38 the tuners in the front and the couple
29:42 i forgot what they're called but they're
29:43 the
29:45 they're the units that adjust the
29:47 frequency that the radio picks up
29:50 and usually what ends up happening is as
29:53 the electronics inside the radio from
29:55 like 1938 was one i just watched and he
29:58 restored this thing
29:59 man it just plays radio stations just
30:02 like
30:02 yesterday it was just really cool but
30:05 people will get in there and i've done
30:06 it as a kid and you get in there and you
30:08 put your little
30:09 uh plastic screwdriver in there because
30:11 they're all electrically charged
30:13 sometimes these chassis are so hot
30:16 depending on how you put the plug in the
30:17 wall because they don't have one of the
30:18 little plugs being bigger than the other
30:20 to isolate the chassis properly
30:22 he always converts it up but sometimes
30:25 these chassis can kill you
30:26 if you don't fix it before you touch it
30:28 it's crazy the last components are
30:30 real high powered electrical stuff even
30:33 just a bolt
30:34 that just looks like a little tiny nut
30:37 can kill you i mean it's just gonna be
30:38 really careful with this stuff but you
30:39 have these plastic screwdrivers they can
30:40 adjust in
30:42 the calibration you usually couple in
30:44 them
30:45 depending on which band how many
30:46 bandwidths that it's able to
30:48 to grab onto this one from 38 had like
30:51 five different bandwidths it was just
30:52 amazing when you watch the guy calibrate
30:56 a radio and i've probably seen him do a
30:58 dozen
30:59 at least you'll realize that
31:02 you'll be picking up a lot of scratch
31:04 from a lot of different areas
31:06 because of 2020 we really became aware
31:10 that
31:11 churches use shortwave radios to
31:14 broadcast into
31:16 cars in case you don't want to go inside
31:18 the church is full or you just rather
31:20 sit in your car
31:21 and you can sit out there and as he's
31:23 preaching inside and everyone can hear
31:24 him in the pews on the speaker system
31:26 it's also being broadcast in a shortwave
31:29 radius around the church
31:32 and so you can pick it up in your radio
31:34 eventually drive in theaters do that
31:36 today now
31:38 which is so sad because something about
31:40 putting that
31:41 ugly ass speaker on your car window is
31:43 just wonderful
31:45 so in terms of someone recording
31:46 something and trying to pick up
31:48 any certain frequency in the world it is
31:52 absolutely positively simple
31:55 to infect someone's recording process
31:58 with a voice
31:59 on the dark five episode you have some
32:02 that are very
32:04 i guess type c or b the really difficult
32:07 ones to hear and then you will hear
32:09 an a and when you hear an a which is you
32:11 know everyone in the room would just go
32:13 well gosh there he is you know whoever's
32:15 talking to us is right there
32:17 it really seems to me just like mr
32:20 carlson's lab he's just picking up
32:22 something local and someone's outside
32:23 going hey
32:24 my buddy is the psychologist that this
32:26 guy is collaborating with because the
32:27 guy who started doing it has been doing
32:29 it for five years
32:30 never picked up one evp now he's
32:32 collaborating with my buddy he's famous
32:33 for recording evps and now we have to
32:35 deliver the goods
32:36 so his buddies outside a little you know
32:38 military radio
32:40 pushing in the frequency obviously being
32:42 very careful not to over
32:43 stimulate it but remember cb radios
32:47 they could do it you just have to know
32:49 the frequency
32:51 that's being sensed in order to
32:54 push a frequency on it
32:58 but now what's interesting about it is
33:00 that
33:02 before we get into these case studies
33:06 you still to to mr randy's
33:09 point you don't have someone immediately
33:13 identifying themselves you don't have
33:15 someone i mean even if it was a demon do
33:18 you ever see exorcist
33:21 for those of you missed it yeah linda
33:24 blair
33:27 who i've met one day i'll show you the
33:29 picture but linda blair
33:32 was this little kid and she's possessed
33:34 by the devil and here come the preachers
33:36 and her mouth was insanely
33:39 bad and she was drilling into them
33:43 that she knew where their mothers were
33:46 and
33:47 and you know just just pushing all their
33:49 buttons psychologically
33:51 and it worked several times
33:55 now if this was a demon wouldn't they
33:57 come in as a relative
33:58 and start misguiding you very
34:00 specifically very quickly
34:01 identifying themselves as whoever you
34:04 want to hear
34:05 but then let me give you an example of
34:07 the way a demon might communicate with
34:09 you
34:10 one they might be like needful things
34:12 the book the stephen king wrote and have
34:13 you go off and do little tiny things in
34:15 your life
34:16 that would then you know destroy your
34:18 life or
34:20 let's say that you're a widow or widower
34:24 they come back as your husband or your
34:26 wife and they they then
34:28 engage you on a level that because the
34:31 demon would know everything about your
34:32 life wouldn't they
34:33 and then they kind of get your
34:35 credibility that they're real
34:37 up and then all of a sudden they would
34:40 start telling you how they didn't they
34:42 didn't love you at all how you were
34:44 this or that all of your worst fears and
34:47 insecurities about your relationship
34:50 would just be right there on the tip of
34:51 their tongue telling you how bad you
34:53 were
34:53 to destroy you wouldn't a demon do that
34:56 in all my research i haven't heard
34:58 anyone
34:59 claim that the voice was coming after
35:02 them
35:03 sort of in a personality level so i'm a
35:06 little dubious about that now if it's an
35:08 angel
35:09 well our you know of all the beings that
35:11 might talk to you
35:12 an angel would have most likely the
35:14 biggest rule set
35:16 up of communicating with the living
35:19 through some evp
35:20 thing it would almost be like they get
35:21 in trouble with the big man
35:23 if they did such a thing but then what
35:25 would an angel say
35:28 encouraging things
35:31 would they forecast something you better
35:33 be careful
35:34 something's coming don't know
35:38 but i haven't heard any conversations
35:39 that have been translated that sound
35:41 like anything an angel would say to you
35:45 so i think that that's just low-hanging
35:47 fruit and you know you gotta
35:49 study all your options
35:52 so one of the first recorded ones was in
35:53 1940 by a guy named reverend
35:56 drayton thomas who was
35:59 collaborating with a woman named gladys
36:02 osborne
36:02 leonard well these two names are these
36:05 people man
36:06 just getting together probably creates
36:07 some havoc in the universe right
36:10 but she was a well-known medium of the
36:13 time and we're talking about 1940 so we
36:15 just came out of the dust bowl it's kind
36:16 of that carnival
36:18 time and the more primitive man is the
36:20 more man will believe
36:21 of course maybe that's a good thing
36:23 maybe it's a bad thing don't know but he
36:26 said that working with her
36:27 he had recorded several voices
36:31 and then he later claimed that one of
36:32 them was his father
36:35 very interesting now in terms of
36:38 again these stories go dry very very
36:40 quickly how to find the recordings it's
36:42 very very difficult
36:44 in some cases but how would you know
36:47 what one was your father
36:48 and then if some guy tells you no no one
36:51 was my dad
36:53 well i would have to tell you my dad's
36:55 still living but if he were to contact
36:56 me
36:58 afterwards or any of my friends that
36:59 have passed away there would have to
37:01 have been
37:02 something that only the two of us would
37:05 know
37:06 you know and i'll give you an example
37:08 that's totally fictitious right
37:11 one of my buddies keith he died of like
37:14 spontaneous brain tumors
37:16 i mean he was fine and then like uh 13
37:18 months later he's dead
37:20 crazy young guy 46 years old from
37:23 hunting to beach
37:24 and he moved to my hometown in kansas
37:27 and now i live in his hometown
37:28 so bizarre but he and his wife got
37:30 married on the beach down here
37:32 apparently after like knowing each other
37:34 for about 30 days and they stay together
37:36 till the end man they'd still be
37:38 together today if if he hadn't passed
37:41 but now he knows something about my
37:43 goals with him
37:45 that i don't even think his own family
37:47 knows that these this is one of my goals
37:49 which is that
37:51 and i've mentioned him once before but
37:52 he used to restore like harley bikes
37:54 really old ones
37:56 indian bikes and old trucks old pickup
37:58 trucks from the 30s and 40s
38:01 and he was also a house builder i mean
38:03 dude just like he could do anything
38:05 most humble dude on planet earth and
38:08 that's just kind of how i wanted to
38:09 retire i wanted to move back to my
38:10 hometown just chat with him
38:12 just go out and do crap so if i ever
38:14 picked up on a voice that identified
38:16 itself as keith
38:18 i'd be waiting for him to say something
38:20 like you know i'm sorry we didn't get a
38:22 chance to build the bike sorry we didn't
38:23 get a chance to do this or that you know
38:25 and something or i used to paint murals
38:29 outside of his house
38:30 using smoke bombs and if he said
38:33 something like man you know i really
38:35 appreciate those
38:35 i really missed those smoke bombs i
38:37 really missed fourth of july with you or
38:38 something like that
38:39 then man i'm getting closer now of
38:42 course the demon could
38:43 say the same thing but then it would
38:45 have to turn dark and i know that my
38:47 friend keith would never say a dark
38:49 thing between the two of us
38:50 ever and so these are the kind of
38:53 elements in those claims that i would
38:55 have to hear in order to
38:57 to buy it and i just don't know of any
39:01 specifics and they always lack
39:03 specificity when they claim these things
39:06 okay so another one is a uh this is a
39:10 crazy
39:10 name to say it's adela von
39:14 zfoslay i don't know and raymond bayless
39:19 so this it's s-z-a-l-a-y
39:23 i'll try to find these people's pictures
39:25 and put it up there and if i can find
39:26 some of the recordings i'll try to
39:27 insert it in the episode for you
39:30 but this is uh zale guy
39:34 or zfole guy he got some 78 rpm pack
39:38 bell recorder
39:40 record cutter and player i guess and he
39:43 tried from the late
39:45 1930s into the 40s the early
39:48 40s to recording and get some of this
39:51 going and wasn't able to
39:52 find any success
39:55 and then he teams up with raymond
39:57 bayless who claimed that he could just
39:59 do this at will
40:00 in the 50s and all of a sudden using a
40:03 radio that
40:04 zfele put together they had
40:07 much better results as it was described
40:12 i'm going to be honest that sounds like
40:13 the one that's the
40:15 the one where it's just a voice
40:18 talking right back to this guy on the
40:20 radio that i heard on the
40:22 dark five it should also be noted that
40:25 most of this occurred right when radio
40:27 first came out and it sort of boils away
40:30 now
40:31 but again most of you who are interested
40:33 in evp and you might be drawn to the
40:35 episode by evp
40:36 experiences you're probably the expert
40:38 and could probably guide us to much
40:39 better videos
40:41 so let this just be a little hub for
40:43 those of us that are interested in more
40:44 stuff
40:45 now another guy named marcelo bachi
40:48 there's a restaurant down the street
40:50 called bocce which is amazing
40:52 but towards the late 40s he
40:56 um claimed to be picking up
41:00 voices from a vacuum tube radio
41:03 of the deceased that's all he said and
41:06 again
41:06 it's one of these situations where let's
41:08 say i put together
41:10 something in my house here and it's
41:13 super sensitive and then
41:14 i'm doing all kinds of things i can do
41:16 to perhaps improve the integrity of
41:18 picking up other shortwave radio and i
41:21 don't tell anybody i'm doing it so no
41:23 one can broadcast it in my house
41:25 something to confuse me right no
41:28 they didn't easily have this technique
41:30 in the past okay so i'm not
41:32 dragging anyone over the coals for not
41:34 pulling this off in the past
41:36 but today we have cell phones and you
41:38 know video cameras and all kinds of
41:40 stuff so it's not a problem
41:42 for me to completely document
41:45 the attempt to do such a thing it's like
41:47 i could do a video like this and not
41:49 release it and then say okay
41:50 what i'm going to be doing is this is a
41:52 little radio i work with mr carlson in
41:54 canada i come up with this really
41:55 sensitive radio
41:56 he has no idea what i'm doing and i got
41:59 a recording device hooked up to it
42:01 maybe even find out what this bocce
42:03 guy's radio was and buy the same thing
42:06 and then pull off this experiment and
42:08 now if i have any successes
42:10 it's all going to be recorded live
42:14 but now we'll we'll get into other folks
42:17 uh
42:18 attempting to do this as well and uh
42:22 that'll help us button it up
42:25 now there's two catholic priests father
42:28 arnetti and father gamali
42:32 i think i'm saying these right actually
42:33 i think i'm saying i'm wrong but
42:34 whatever
42:35 so they were recording gregarian chants
42:38 at one point
42:40 and they kept having uh the microphone
42:43 break
42:44 the microphone cord would break and so
42:47 at one point uh gemelli
42:52 said that he said a little prayer to his
42:54 father and said you know please
42:56 help me with this situation or will you
42:58 help me with the situation
42:59 and apparently while every quarter still
43:02 going
43:03 he claimed to have heard his father say
43:06 you know of course i shall help you i'm
43:08 always with you
43:10 now it's probably italian converted to
43:13 you know translated to english so it
43:15 seems a little formal way to respond
43:17 of course i shall help you i mean that
43:19 seems like something you write down on a
43:20 piece of paper not something that you
43:21 say
43:22 but i'm assuming the translation is
43:24 where that comes from
43:26 now i like the thing that i'm always
43:28 with you because
43:29 that is something i think is very godly
43:33 statement that's a very spirit thing to
43:35 say and it is something that
43:38 is i believe true and something is
43:40 rarely ever
43:42 said when talking about the afterlife
43:47 so the guy that's known as the father of
43:50 evp
43:50 which i don't understand how that works
43:52 but this guy's uh
43:54 frederick george jensen
43:58 i think that's i'm saying that decently
44:00 1959 this dude is recording bird sounds
44:04 and he said that at one point he could
44:06 hear his mother say
44:08 in a very endearing way frederick you're
44:11 being watched for a drink my little
44:13 frederick
44:14 can you hear me and he said it was his
44:16 mother
44:18 apparently he wrote two books voices
44:19 from the universe
44:21 and radio contact with the dead so he
44:24 really
44:24 monopolized this thing up into a
44:26 profit-making situation
44:28 now obviously i haven't read those books
44:32 the books i would hope would say
44:36 something about this is exactly how you
44:37 pull this off
44:39 because there's there's um going back to
44:42 james randy's sort of mindset the
44:43 skeptic mindset
44:45 the idea would be if this is so
44:48 prevalent
44:49 and capable that this would have utterly
44:52 exploded to the point where someone
44:54 would have created an invention
44:56 that you buy and you put it in your
44:58 house
44:59 and you just keep it around in case you
45:02 lose somebody
45:04 perhaps someone i mean if someone's 95
45:06 years old okay
45:07 and they're you know their eyesight is
45:09 bad their body's kind of giving up
45:12 their need to to go come explain
45:15 something to you unless it's like james
45:16 randy's
45:17 grandmother who's like oh by the way i
45:19 put the
45:21 i put the wheel stuck on the underside
45:23 of a cabinet in the kitchen just because
45:25 it was like a place i used to hide other
45:27 things and
45:28 i just thought i'm sorry i forgot to
45:29 tell one of you guys i didn't think i
45:31 was going to die when i did
45:32 so thought i had some more time to tell
45:34 you about this
45:35 that makes sense but the fact there's no
45:39 just kit some heath kit you could buy
45:42 to give you this capability seems a
45:44 little suspect
45:45 why are why are so few folks from the
45:48 other side
45:49 communicating like this seems like
45:52 everybody
45:53 should be afforded the same thing if
45:54 there's no rule in the universe that the
45:57 afterlife can't come talk to you through
45:58 a radio
46:00 so one of the guys is a latvian
46:03 psychiatrist
46:04 or psychologist i should say excuse me
46:06 and he was dr
46:08 constantin raldev raudive
46:11 raw div always some weird name when it's
46:14 something awesome
46:16 no offense to foreign languages or
46:17 foreign names but he had heard about
46:20 this other guy's work and his two books
46:23 and so he immediately started recording
46:26 in the 60s and he said by 1967 he too
46:29 had recorded his mother essentially
46:33 talking saying his name his childhood
46:35 name and then saying this is your mother
46:38 and he supposedly has recorded thousands
46:40 of evp recordings
46:43 interesting now i will tell you that if
46:46 you go out and try to listen to some of
46:47 these evp recordings if they're not type
46:49 a
46:50 or class a recordings where you can just
46:52 simply hear it right
46:54 the other two take a tremendous amount
46:56 of imagination sometimes you'll hear
46:58 this and
47:00 it's sort of like the beatles album that
47:02 said you know turn me on dead man
47:04 you sort of you hear that and then
47:06 you're like they'll tell you what you're
47:07 hearing and then your brain
47:09 sounds it out it sort of snaps
47:12 the sound into place
47:15 so there's a couple george and jeanette
47:17 meek m-e-e-k
47:20 they i guess have recorded hundreds of
47:23 hours of this in the 70s and 80s and
47:25 allegedly
47:26 they said they captured the voice of dr
47:28 george jeffries muller
47:30 who was a nasa scientist who passed away
47:32 in 1967.
47:35 okay so those are the big ones
47:38 those are the big ones that uh made it
47:41 into the
47:42 worth mentioning column now let's look
47:45 at this
47:46 again let's pull back a little bit and
47:48 say
47:50 isn't it interesting that the
47:51 individuals that wanted to record evp
47:54 immediately found results even if they
47:56 took 10 years to do so
47:58 they all got results well let me ask you
48:01 this
48:02 do you have a family member at least in
48:04 your past if not present
48:06 that has a scanner in their house
48:09 listening to everything in a small town
48:11 that's a big deal in a small town
48:12 it's actually kind of cool but boy you
48:15 can't get in trouble in a small town
48:16 with the police and not come home and
48:18 have your
48:19 mom or dad just up your up your snuff
48:22 because uh they heard the whole thing on
48:25 the air
48:26 sometimes that can be kind of
48:28 nerve-wracking too cause they'll say
48:30 something like uh
48:31 oh it was a big accident at so and so on
48:33 so so street and your parent is sitting
48:35 there
48:36 just waiting to have someone identify
48:38 the person
48:39 especially if they say the word fatality
48:40 or something they're just on
48:42 edge of course today we have cell phones
48:43 so it's much better back in the day it
48:46 was
48:47 pretty rough on the system and there was
48:50 always arguments about stop listening to
48:51 that damn thing you know
48:53 driving me crazy driving yourself crazy
48:55 me crazy
48:57 but let's look at the overall proposal
49:00 that's going on here
49:02 just pull out of evp for one second and
49:04 just simply say
49:06 you're at some military briefing or some
49:08 intelligence briefing
49:10 where money is not an object invention
49:13 is just a fingertip away
49:17 and somebody asked somebody else in the
49:18 room so what is this whole thing this
49:20 evp thing
49:22 well apparently there's a reliable way
49:24 of talking to the dead
49:26 and someone in the room hears then from
49:29 military
49:30 government some rich person
49:33 just a rich person alone
49:36 and you think about okay what would that
49:39 mean if that could be done
49:43 well how much could you learn
49:46 from dead people and
49:50 there might be a bias from the dead
49:52 people right so say the military says ah
49:54 well we would really like to know where
49:56 tesla left all of his stuff that uh
50:00 john trump wouldn't got
50:03 we'd like to talk to anybody anyone
50:06 famous
50:07 or or i should say worthy of
50:11 interviewing after their death perhaps
50:13 they can reveal something
50:16 if you're dead then you we assume you
50:20 would have access to
50:21 all of the world meaning you could
50:24 remote view you could say hey could you
50:26 tell you love america
50:28 i'm going to be talking to abraham
50:30 lincoln
50:31 and the republic is under attack in
50:33 2020. so let's have a conversation with
50:36 abraham lincoln and let's find out okay
50:40 hey we need a coup de gras we need that
50:42 death blow
50:43 to knock these mfr's off the planet
50:47 hit him where they don't know we know
50:49 they exist
50:51 so anyone out there who believes in
50:53 america and that republic apologize to
50:55 my
50:56 non-american listeners i'm just giving
50:57 you an example substitute your leaders
50:59 and your objectives
51:03 please come in abe lincoln
51:06 and so they would listen and hopefully
51:09 abe would come in and go
51:11 you know they're all hiding in sri lanka
51:13 you know whatever
51:15 now i'm unaware of evp government
51:17 research but we know that
51:19 remote viewing became a multi-billion
51:22 dollar
51:23 research project between the russians
51:25 and the united states citizens
51:26 very sorry united states intelligence
51:28 excuse me so it seems like that would be
51:31 really valuable capability doesn't it
51:36 now of course everything can be
51:37 subverted but at the same time
51:40 if laymen have not only
51:43 done it but documented how to do it
51:46 down to the hardware then it would seem
51:48 that anyone who
51:50 really wanted to talk to someone you
51:51 lose a loved one you
51:53 lose a child a wife a husband a father a
51:56 mother
51:57 and you feel like they got pulled out of
51:58 this universe way too soon
52:00 celebrities to pass away
52:03 i just watched this uh british 60
52:05 minutes on george michael
52:07 you just look at these people who pass
52:09 so soon and you're like oh my god
52:12 i don't know what you get off of him if
52:13 you got a chance to talk to him but
52:16 there's plenty of case scenarios where
52:19 this would be
52:20 very desirable and money wouldn't be an
52:22 object even if someone said well the
52:24 radio you need to buy is going to cost
52:26 you 50
52:26 000 even if that's all the money you had
52:29 sometimes you'd be like i will give you
52:32 a hundred i'll give you a 50 bonus
52:35 if you can just organize the
52:37 conversation between me
52:39 and my past relatives but i want to hear
52:42 real information don't tell me you just
52:44 love me and everything's okay
52:46 i already assume all that that doesn't
52:48 have any value to me
52:51 but i want a conversation right off the
52:54 bat
52:57 within the second half of the military
52:59 conversation someone would say all right
53:00 all right
53:01 i heard this kind of crap before uh what
53:04 is the current claim how does this work
53:05 and then some expert who's been studying
53:07 this goes okay well it comes in through
53:09 three different classes
53:10 a b and c a's great b's
53:14 rough and c is really hard to hear
53:19 okay well we also have technology
53:22 that unscrambles things
53:26 d scrambles things
53:29 so let's say you had a furry voice you
53:32 also
53:32 might create a device that says okay i'm
53:35 talking into this 58 mic right here
53:39 this is one of the most famous mics in
53:40 the world it's a hundred bucks
53:42 all those nerds out there buying five
53:44 thousand dollar mics and
53:45 dangling in the scene so you can see it
53:48 they're just wasting their money trust
53:49 me
53:51 but the military could easily create a
53:53 device that says okay everything's going
53:55 into the input device is being
53:57 recorded not only on the track that's
53:58 trying to pick up this evp but it's also
54:00 being sterilized in a separate track
54:02 that's going to be used digitally now to
54:06 pull off what we put in so the only
54:08 thing left
54:10 is what we didn't put in the system
54:12 therefore you have the cleanest digital
54:14 evp recording on planet earth it's not
54:16 slopped into everything else
54:19 and you know there's a sensor there's a
54:20 couple sensors inside this
54:22 it's actually stereo mic so just the
54:24 second the sensor is done
54:26 you get this copy sent off to this other
54:28 device and then the wire that's going
54:31 all the way to the machine that may be
54:33 where the evp is starting to occur
54:35 is the differential they have
54:39 the capability of enhancing photographs
54:42 like in blade runner
54:43 they can take really blurry crap and
54:45 make it super duper clear
54:46 through all kinds of fuzzy logic and big
54:48 machine learning
54:50 i guarantee you we have probably never
54:52 seen it in public
54:54 but the stuff you've seen in sci-fi
54:56 shows is
54:57 probably damn near capable
55:00 and it's almost capable to a point where
55:04 i think one of them i can't remember
55:06 what the hell show it was
55:09 it was a star trek it was a star trek
55:11 where they actually triangulated the
55:12 face of someone behind
55:14 a crowd of people and they were using a
55:17 bunch of like ambient reflection
55:20 information retracing information to say
55:22 okay well there's a little bit of a blue
55:23 haze there and a lot
55:25 instead of figuring out what the person
55:26 looked like behind the crop now that
55:28 might be a little
55:29 much of a stretch the audio man do we
55:32 have that down pat
55:35 so it would seem in addition to all that
55:40 you know legitimizing of the evp system
55:42 the military
55:44 and again all kinds of intelligence and
55:47 all these professors
55:49 would have legitimized it and maybe
55:52 maybe it does work and everyone's still
55:54 pooh-poohing it so it never gets any
55:56 gets any uh attention that seems really
55:59 hard to believe
56:02 because there's always someone out there
56:03 with money man my science teacher in
56:05 high school
56:06 like i told you guys this dude built his
56:09 own synthesizer from scratch
56:11 he built an observatory inside our high
56:14 school
56:15 meaning they built he built the dome
56:18 he built a star projector from scratch
56:21 man
56:21 he drilled i think 1100 holes
56:25 in this piece of mylar or something
56:28 with the exact drill bit size
56:32 to make sure the star map was showing up
56:35 properly
56:36 and he said he broke so many bits it was
56:38 crazy
56:40 and he turned this thing on i'm just
56:41 like oh my god dude
56:44 this dude could build any he ground his
56:45 own at 13 years old he ground his own
56:47 reflective lens telescope
56:49 with the piece of glass stuck inside of
56:51 a um
56:52 trunk of a tree that's him at 13 years
56:55 old you mean to tell me if this dude
56:57 who lost his wife just before i i met
57:00 him
57:00 that's how i learned about cancer and
57:02 physics all at the same time
57:05 if he thought he could talk to his wife
57:08 i guarantee you he would have built that
57:10 system and
57:11 and worked on it endlessly until he got
57:14 the
57:14 nightly conversation with his wife until
57:16 he joined her
57:18 i looked up my teacher he's still alive
57:19 he's in his 80s now
57:22 crazy again the other one
57:26 is foreign countries foreign countries
57:28 that take this stuff a little more
57:29 seriously
57:30 i think russia has always been a very
57:32 open-minded society with
57:34 many things that the west minimizes
57:37 you know they believe in the meridians
57:39 of the human body
57:42 the way that the in my opinion qi or
57:45 ether moves through the body they
57:47 understand
57:48 you know acupuncture is nothing more
57:50 than freeing up the chi
57:52 to move through your body more
57:54 efficiently because you developed
57:55 currents of qi
57:56 that are blocking things that's ether
57:59 men
58:00 it just is i was watching a video the
58:04 other day
58:05 from a doctor who said he had
58:08 developed a tremendous amount of pain in
58:12 his body
58:13 and so he went to the formal doctors and
58:16 found out very quickly that all they
58:19 were doing was prescribing drugs to him
58:20 turn him into a pharmacy but then he
58:22 went to an acupuncture person
58:24 and he said they poked me with a ton of
58:26 needles and even though it exacerbated
58:28 the pain
58:29 i was having as soon as they were done i
58:32 never had the pain again
58:34 he says i know i can't go back to my
58:36 fellow doctor friends
58:38 and tell them my success because they're
58:41 so close-minded
58:42 due to med school that he'll be a
58:44 heretic of some sort
58:46 how pathetic is the world man but i
58:49 think the russians
58:52 who are very into this kind of thing i i
58:54 don't know anything about the
58:55 association with russia and evp
58:57 but they would be the kind of country
58:58 they'd be like okay we built this little
59:00 toaster
59:02 and here's the conditions of which you
59:04 use them and
59:05 and here's usually how you solicit the
59:08 dead
59:08 and believe and maybe a little handbook
59:10 that says by the way you may not receive
59:12 any message from your relatives but you
59:14 may receive someone who lived in your
59:16 house before you who passed away
59:18 who just always thought this house was a
59:20 super comforting place to be
59:22 and so they kind of retreated back to
59:23 this home
59:26 to kind of live out their years or maybe
59:28 they died in the home
59:30 while disney didn't die in disneyland he
59:32 died in like cedar cyanide or something
59:36 he's at the park trust me he's at the
59:39 park
59:41 i think edison's take on the thing is
59:43 just fascinating if that story is true
59:46 because it's the it's a telekinesis
59:49 story i just told
59:51 where you find a delicate
59:55 balance of force that would take the
59:58 most
59:59 measurement of change to see the effect
60:03 occur and with evp
60:06 it is a brilliant idea from edison to
60:08 say look i'm going to make a radio
60:11 that is so absolutely sensitive
60:14 that it would pick up
60:17 you know signals from the other side and
60:19 think about tesla for one second
60:22 because i don't know if there is uh this
60:24 is what's the big mystery to me
60:27 let's say this stuff is totally legit
60:30 and simply because we haven't tried we
60:32 haven't heard it and so it's easy for us
60:33 to to dismiss it
60:36 it's interesting that a mother of a
60:39 random mother of one of the
60:40 scientists or enthusiasts would hear
60:43 their mom
60:45 because at some point there's a
60:47 mechanism on the other side that makes
60:49 this possible
60:50 if it were true meaning the mother would
60:53 have to learn
60:54 electronics to some level because if she
60:57 didn't learn how to
60:58 disturb that electromagnetic frequency
61:01 then she would never be able to
61:02 communicate with her son
61:04 all right tesla is a guy that understood
61:08 electricity
61:09 like no one else on earth
61:14 and i it was really strange about that
61:15 statement is i think we're pretty sure
61:18 even in 2020 the tesla remains if he had
61:22 stayed alive
61:25 let's see he was uh he's probably about
61:27 180 right now
61:29 i guess it'd be about 160 something
61:31 anyway
61:32 that dude would be able to make sweet
61:35 love to your
61:36 to your electromagnetic frequency inside
61:38 your calibrated radio
61:40 wouldn't he wouldn't he be able to do
61:43 that i mean this guy could probably play
61:45 a symphony to us just with his
61:47 fingertips playing around with stuff but
61:49 his ability to communicate that with us
61:51 would be
61:53 i think absolute if this technology
61:56 actually can do
61:56 what we think it can do now it could be
62:00 the
62:01 it could be the game of the and i don't
62:05 mean to insult anybody
62:06 but it could be the game of the layman
62:07 the layman doesn't
62:09 sanction themselves to communicating
62:11 with the living because they don't see
62:12 the ramifications of doing so whereas
62:14 maybe a tesla
62:16 being highly intellectual might say
62:19 i shouldn't do this because i don't want
62:21 to infect the future
62:23 with any inspiration that isn't organic
62:27 maybe now the other side of the game
62:30 would be other forms of communication
62:34 that it just begs
62:40 it just begs the notion that this
62:42 wouldn't be the only method that they
62:44 would be using to communicate with
62:45 us so you have evp let's just say it's
62:48 totally legit
62:51 there are some hoaxers in there but
62:52 there are some
62:54 maybe even more than 50 of it is real
62:56 all the recordings we've ever heard
63:00 okay but now we have television
63:05 now we have cell phones now we have
63:08 earbuds
63:09 imagine just put your earbuds in which
63:12 are
63:14 probably functioning on milliamps
63:17 and so you would think that earbud every
63:21 once in a while will come up with a
63:22 signal
63:24 maybe some artifact on your television
63:27 shows up
63:28 some symbol that is most definitely a
63:31 relative symbol
63:34 maybe they always liked you know how
63:36 many of you have a relative okay
63:38 that collects unicorns collects turtles
63:41 collects
63:43 princess dolls or whatever they're a
63:45 collector and they always have this
63:46 thing
63:48 and all they need to do is show you that
63:50 thing
63:51 and you're like oh my god i you know
63:54 let's just fictitiously say that you
63:56 do not you never thought it was a good
63:58 idea to collect all this stuff and you
63:59 thought it was a huge
64:00 mess when they passed that you had to
64:02 find someone to take all this stuff off
64:03 your hands
64:05 maybe kept a couple out of nostalgia and
64:08 so you're not one prone to together this
64:10 simply because the other person
64:12 passed and then all of a sudden it shows
64:15 up
64:16 i'm like man i'm not even a fan of this
64:18 and there it is on my tv
64:20 some unicorn blemish in my
64:23 4k television which was only there the
64:26 night before
64:27 stayed there for about 10 minutes i even
64:29 walked up to it and looked at it
64:30 maybe you can grab a cell phone picture
64:32 of it whatever and then
64:37 case closed the other one is
64:41 the sort of the ufo picture argument
64:44 which is
64:46 well actually spans history for a long
64:48 time
64:50 before the printing press god was on
64:53 earth a lot
64:55 right and then the printing press sort
64:57 of calmed down a bit of those rumors
64:59 a bit of that evolution no new gods
65:02 anymore
65:03 whatever we had by the time the printing
65:05 press came around it's pretty much what
65:07 we have
65:08 joseph campbell was probably the only
65:09 people that said he met a bunch of
65:11 angels and had a big experience but then
65:13 again his stuff's always sequestered
65:14 away
65:16 he lies about trans uh translating
65:20 ancient arabic which he wrote the book
65:23 of
65:24 abraham but what he was really staring
65:26 at was a funeral
65:29 notice of a death of of someone in egypt
65:33 i think it might have been a pharaoh but
65:35 i'm not sure but he was reading
65:36 you know now we know how to read that
65:38 when he was doing this fake translation
65:40 and he was full of it and he said that
65:42 you know native americans had the wheel
65:44 and iron
65:45 you know or yeah iron and steel swords
65:47 and all the stuff they didn't have
65:50 and so the guys busted
65:53 but when does this phenomenon of evp
65:55 arrive well it arrives right when radios
65:58 arrive and then it sort of ends
66:01 the last thing i read to you was a
66:03 couple in the 80s
66:05 now there was one sort of central theme
66:08 now they i think we're using an
66:09 oscilloscope
66:13 they tend to be using older radio
66:15 systems to make this happen now that
66:18 could be that those radio systems are
66:19 the ones that
66:20 have this happen you think mr carls
66:24 was in mr carlson's lab that dude would
66:26 be picking up evps all the time
66:29 maybe he's not listening for them but
66:31 they're coming through don't think he
66:33 records them either so this
66:34 idea of having where you can hear them
66:37 while you're recording but you hear them
66:38 when you play it back and maybe that's
66:40 part of the gimmick
66:43 but it seems that when something becomes
66:45 popular
66:47 it becomes noticed which might be
66:50 discovering something and then everyone
66:52 can get into it but then it dies off
66:56 could you imagine old 30s and 40s radios
66:58 selling for hundreds of thousands of
67:00 dollars because those components
67:02 actually pick up evp and the modern
67:04 systems don't
67:06 imagine the quote-unquote authorities
67:08 find out it really does work
67:10 and so they scramble to re-engineer
67:12 radio so that it can't pick up evp
67:16 still wouldn't stop the modern age
67:17 because we'll go back get all radios
67:19 like mr carlson does
67:21 ufo sightings were really popular when
67:24 35 millimeter film
67:26 was the method by which we took
67:27 photographs now that we have digital
67:30 devices it has tempered quite a bit
67:33 again a lot of uh
67:34 art students are creating fake ufo reels
67:37 just to test their skills
67:39 and it comes out later it was
67:42 you know some art student the the siren
67:45 sounds that the
67:46 they keep telling you about the ones
67:47 where this this incredible wailing noise
67:50 happens in russia happens in the woods
67:52 and
67:53 it's like some crazy psyop from space
67:56 where someone's put a satellite up there
67:58 and they're just
67:59 broadcasting something down there are
68:02 videos this did occur
68:03 several times but someone quite
68:06 immediately
68:07 the russian one it was the sound that
68:09 was coming out of a soundtrack from a
68:10 movie
68:12 so the only thing that was going on was
68:14 that no one could locate the speakers
68:16 but there someone was playing this
68:17 really really loudly from
68:19 a sci-fi program and it happened to
68:23 correlate with that
68:24 series that i think neil blumkamp made a
68:27 couple of those movies
68:28 and i forget the freaking name of the
68:30 theme of the movie but he made like two
68:31 or three of them
68:33 and those sounds i believe were in his
68:35 movie so it kind of
68:37 was a beautiful viral marketing
68:39 technique to get everybody into alien
68:41 stuff so when his movie releases
68:42 everyone's just on the i gotta see
68:44 something alien because there's this
68:45 weird stuff going on
68:47 we're just kind of in the mood to do
68:48 that you know
68:50 if evp is real like i said
68:55 the quality of evp today should be
68:57 absolute
69:00 if the afterlife is interested in
69:03 communicating with us there's a million
69:05 techniques you know
69:06 ghosts in general that are visible
69:11 again the one i saw was mind's eye so it
69:13 was inside my head
69:15 i didn't get any sense that it was
69:16 visible
69:18 in the outside world okay well that's a
69:20 technique
69:22 then there's the actually making an
69:24 apparition in the room
69:26 which what does that require well if we
69:29 understand that photons are a verb
69:31 then they just shake the room and it
69:34 doesn't have to be
69:35 abraham lincoln sitting there you know
69:37 holding his coat and got his beard and
69:38 his hat on and starts reading you know
69:41 the gettysburg address he doesn't have
69:43 to go that far
69:45 you just are maybe hurting you're
69:48 sitting in your bed at night that
69:49 normally has someone next to you
69:51 and that person's missing and you're
69:54 just staring into the darkness of your
69:56 room
69:57 and you're just saying you know come say
70:00 something to me man do something
70:02 obviously we're not going to have a
70:02 conversation necessarily unless you're
70:04 evp
70:05 things but just make a little light in
70:07 the room go to the filament of a 60 watt
70:09 light bulb that is currently off and
70:11 just
70:12 run your soul through that thing super
70:13 fast like like superman and get it to
70:16 excite just a little bit
70:19 maybe those requirements are a little
70:21 high
70:23 what if there's a a force that a soul
70:27 sorry a forced maximum that a soul could
70:29 exert on this reality
70:32 and so we have to temper all their
70:33 techniques of their communication
70:35 to devices that run on milliamps or even
70:38 smaller amounts of electricity
70:41 there was a great episode of star trek
70:45 i think it's um enterprise
70:48 which was from 2001 to 2005
70:52 where one of the beings it was maybe i
70:54 don't know it was jakote i can't
70:55 remember a few were
70:57 there's a few episodes where spirits of
71:01 quote-unquote dead members on on
71:04 the enterprise whichever episode or
71:06 season you might be
71:08 this might be in but one of them got
71:10 stuck on the outside
71:12 and they were chasing the ship and they
71:15 were on the outside of the ship at the
71:17 inside of the ship and
71:18 it ended up where the being had figured
71:21 out that if they put their hand through
71:22 an led
71:24 in the ceiling that it lit and so they
71:27 kept hitting it
71:28 in morse code but mars code wasn't used
71:31 anymore in the future
71:32 but they had managed to do kind of an
71:34 sos sort of thing you know one two three
71:36 one two three one two three
71:38 and i think eventually someone picked up
71:40 on it and they figured out oh my god
71:41 they're actually alive
71:43 we got to do xyz to bring their body
71:45 back
71:47 love star trek for that kind of thing so
71:50 imagine we've got some sort of well
71:53 think about this man this is my cell
71:55 phone right here okay
71:57 all right well it's got miniaturized
71:59 components
72:01 and if you go look at mr carlson
72:03 carlson's lab
72:04 again the laptop i'm using is the one i
72:06 repaired the um
72:09 the diode on the blue and the power
72:11 supply fed the computer too much stuff
72:13 thank god but it fried it straight off
72:15 the board
72:16 and so i had to get in there and you
72:19 know find it which was pretty easy it
72:20 was all burned up but the pad came off
72:22 the board i mean it was just really
72:24 insane everything i tried to fix the pad
72:25 didn't work so i ended up fixing it for
72:28 about a dollar 60 by getting a new diode
72:31 in there
72:33 okay so you're you're on a telephone
72:35 which has got mental miniaturized
72:37 components
72:38 the amount of electricity these phones
72:39 use is less and less every single year
72:42 because everything gets miniaturized
72:44 so the full functionality of a resistor
72:46 a diode a capacitor coil a cpu
72:49 is all just tiny tiny
72:53 disturbances in the force okay well
72:56 what's memory
72:58 what's a hard drive what's an ssd
73:04 it's a bunch of ones and zeros
73:07 being stacked up inside memory all right
73:11 so you have this device and you
73:15 you stored a word file somewhere on your
73:17 device
73:18 and they just go into the file and they
73:21 start flipping bits
73:23 to the point they put a message in one
73:25 of your text files
73:27 again they disturb some pixels on your
73:29 screen
73:31 they put the tron logo right on your
73:32 screen you know
73:34 and so you see it and you're like oh my
73:36 god i don't think that the afterlife
73:39 would lack
73:39 any uh creativity
73:43 when it comes to these kind of things do
73:44 you i mean do you think they
73:46 i mean you got tesla next to you you got
73:49 faraday through tesla with you you got
73:51 steinmetz with you you got all these
73:52 super geniuses
73:54 uh richard feynman oppenheimer all these
73:57 guys that really built things in the
73:59 world
73:59 unlike einstein and they're sitting
74:02 around just going oh my god we could do
74:04 so much and
74:05 hey you by yourself trying to hit that
74:08 bit on the ssd is not going to make it
74:10 happen
74:10 but if we line up all of ourselves up we
74:12 get a million souls
74:14 to line up and we're all going to pounce
74:16 that bit at the same exact time
74:18 we'll get it done we'll get it done
74:22 if body surrendering possession works
74:26 you're sitting there typing your little
74:28 email to your friend or whatever
74:30 texting something and this thing this
74:32 friendly
74:33 possession occurs and they take over
74:36 your fingers for a split second even
74:38 just erase your consciousness for a
74:39 split second
74:40 they've taken over and now you're just
74:42 like
74:43 you're typing some message from them to
74:46 you but you're going about
74:47 either saving in a file or you're about
74:49 to transmit a text to somebody
74:51 but it's right there in front of you i
74:53 don't know why these things wouldn't be
74:55 the next
74:56 stage up the radio was simply a
74:58 mechanism because it was susceptible to
75:01 modification so why wouldn't this start
75:04 going up into other devices
75:06 why stop there if one of you is super
75:09 technical
75:10 and you think man i know why and please
75:13 put that in the comment below
75:16 because i would love to advance the
75:18 theory even more because if you come up
75:20 with restrictions and we can get around
75:22 them when that being exciting like
75:24 episode two and if any of you've ever
75:27 done this
75:27 i'd be really interested either you were
75:29 present when it happened
75:30 or you tried it yourself and you had
75:32 some success i mean
75:34 guide us to your files man so we can
75:36 hear it i'll put it in an episode
75:39 dedicated to you if you've done research
75:42 in this
75:43 and you think you've heard very credible
75:45 situations
75:47 do please share that as well you know
75:49 we're stuck in one of these situations
75:51 where it's like
75:52 i don't know if you're like me one of
75:55 the reasons why they're communicating
75:56 with the dead
75:57 which i hate saying that computing
76:00 communicating with the formerly human
76:03 is so appealing to me is that this
76:04 universe gets boring after a while
76:07 it really does man you're just like all
76:09 right what am i gonna do
76:10 i'll do this to make money and maybe
76:12 some arbitrary group of people thinks
76:14 that that's really cool
76:16 i mean if i could tell a story and and
76:18 really affect people in a positive way
76:20 that's that's euphoria but i mean you
76:22 know going off and creating another
76:24 video game or
76:26 whatever we need something new man we
76:30 need a new frontier right we need
76:31 something really fun
76:33 and i think that that's this is an
76:35 interesting little
76:36 kind of fourier into the possibilities
76:40 that perhaps
76:42 there is a mechanism to help them
76:44 communicate with us
76:46 and just to kind of pull back to a very
76:48 esoteric
76:49 thing which i'll relate to this
76:55 i'm going to give you just the just
76:56 occurred to me so take that crazy
76:58 example i gave you with
77:00 a potential true telekinetic thing where
77:03 i talked about the
77:05 piece of pottery hanging on a fishing
77:07 wire and then
77:08 concentrating on it we could get it to
77:09 turn one way or the other
77:12 because it's such a minimal amount of
77:14 force to make this thing move it's if
77:16 it's holding still it is just a
77:18 miraculous
77:19 event that someone didn't open the door
77:21 the heater didn't turn on
77:22 someone you know took their sheet and
77:25 went woof like that and the thing would
77:26 start spinning it's how sensitive this
77:28 thing was
77:31 and so imagine every communication
77:33 protocol that we've ever created
77:35 outside of true voice and apparition
77:38 visions which again if one ghost is
77:41 possible in this world
77:43 in a visual form then all ghosts are
77:47 capable of doing it all of them and
77:50 i know that a lot of people would would
77:53 see a ghost in their bedroom and
77:55 absolutely be traumatized for the rest
77:57 of their lives you know that's the case
77:59 but your relatives your friends they all
78:03 know if you're the kind of person to be
78:05 able to handle it and yeah
78:06 i don't think that any one of us would
78:09 ask to see a ghost
78:11 than actually see one and not have our
78:12 heart rate go through the roof
78:14 but it would be almost like crying for
78:16 happiness and not crying for sadness
78:18 your heart rate goes up because you're
78:20 happy
78:20 not because you're terrified and so i
78:23 think that
78:24 there are plenty myopic very stoic
78:28 phds out there that have dead loved ones
78:31 that they know that if they came back in
78:33 an apparition this loved one's going to
78:35 do
78:35 just fine communicating with the other
78:37 side but a protocol for communication
78:40 is usually some form of morse code it's
78:42 some form of binary some form of
78:44 ones and zeros that make things happen
78:48 so just as a ridiculous example
78:51 imagine taking this porcelain on a
78:52 string thing something else on a string
78:55 things on strings and you line up a
78:58 bunch of them
78:59 you line up like uh stranger things did
79:02 when she wanted to talk to her son which
79:04 was
79:04 stuck in the other dimension she had
79:06 created a
79:08 it was brilliant i love it man it was a
79:10 through z on the wall
79:11 using some childhood you know education
79:15 decals and then she put christmas lights
79:18 on every single one of the letters
79:19 that were off it wasn't plugged in
79:23 and the kid would come in and turn the
79:24 light on and just like a ouija board
79:26 spell
79:27 something to you of course ouija boards
79:29 are accused of doing the same thing
79:31 i don't trust any situation where human
79:33 beings are touching the device you know
79:35 that's uh
79:36 potentially moving it where their
79:38 subconscious wants it to go or whatever
79:40 but i know some people that's a pretty
79:42 legit scary
79:44 ouija board things but again you know
79:46 sometimes you have like your hands
79:47 someone else's hand and it's just like
79:48 one guy's pulling your leg right
79:51 but so you line this thing up whatever
79:53 it is it could be electromagnetic
79:55 stimulation that signifies the ascii
79:58 character set
80:00 all uppercase and then they just start
80:03 talking man
80:05 just like you didn't you wouldn't even
80:07 have to even be there
80:08 you set the device up you put digital
80:10 devices to sense movement voltage spikes
80:13 and the computer is just recording the
80:15 letters while you're asleep
80:17 while you're away put this thing in a
80:18 basement then all of a sudden you come
80:21 back and there's you know
80:23 william shakespeare's next piece it says
80:26 sign francis bacon
80:28 anyway this stuff fascinates me i had
80:30 the evp thing on my phone for a very
80:32 long time
80:35 maybe if record the helicopter flying
80:37 over and then slow it down and play it
80:38 back it's like
80:41 we are watching you i keep thinking
80:44 the helicopter guys have to be looking
80:46 down at this patio going
80:47 what in the hell is that guy doing and
80:50 we can fly by at one o'clock in the
80:52 morning four o'clock in the morning and
80:53 this dude's got all these lights on
80:54 because it's way brighter
80:56 where i'm sitting than where you're
80:57 seeing it after the filter goes on
81:01 i'm definitely interested in your your
81:03 take on this because
81:05 you know if we had deep thoughts
81:06 university this would be a whole wing of
81:08 the college man we'd be coming up with
81:09 all kinds of devices
81:11 studying all the previous claims the
81:12 hardware that was claimed to be used
81:15 the parameters in which the hardware
81:17 supposedly achieved successes
81:21 and you know i think we would target
81:23 very specific individuals
81:26 and i don't know if it's one of these
81:27 situations where it's like ufos are
81:29 always claimed to
81:30 be showing up in very remote locations
81:34 because there's not to be mass knowledge
81:36 of their existence
81:37 just yet in any type of proven
81:40 day the earth stood still landing in
81:42 washington dc sort of situation you know
81:46 and so perhaps these are mothers talking
81:48 to sons and that sort of thing
81:50 because we know there's a massive
81:52 connection between mothers
81:54 and their children which is straight up
81:58 psychic and amazing again when i was in
81:59 my first
82:01 first and only car accident here in
82:02 california at 18.
82:04 i got home and just like elvis said with
82:06 his mother when he got about a car
82:08 accident
82:10 he didn't have voicemail back in the day
82:12 but i did and i had a little voicemail
82:14 machine you know
82:15 and was recording on my on my voicemail
82:18 when i got home
82:20 and he's like where can i just try to
82:22 make sure you're okay i just had a weird
82:23 feeling and i was like holy crap that
82:25 stuff's real
82:27 a mother can sense when her children die
82:30 so much so that militaries have used
82:34 i think it was the german military they
82:37 were taking rabbits
82:39 and they'd have a mother have like four
82:41 or five rabbits and they would put the
82:42 child
82:43 rabbit on a submarine then they would
82:47 put like ekgs and
82:50 and various neuron sensing equipment on
82:54 the brain of the mother
82:55 and then they would kill the kid
82:58 bunny out there on the submarine and the
83:01 mother's brain would go nuts
83:03 and they realized this is 100 percent
83:05 and it was so
83:09 reliable that they developed emergency
83:11 protocols using these rapids meaning
83:14 it was to say let's say a submarine was
83:16 going to go out and find out
83:18 if the foreign fleet was out there so
83:21 instead of transmitting a radio signal
83:23 back home that might
83:24 expose their location they killed the
83:26 rabbit and that would tell the
83:28 ground forces hold you know don't deploy
83:30 any more boats
83:32 wait till we get back with the
83:33 information
83:35 i mean that's huge that's a whole dark
83:36 five episode on that
83:39 so there's a lot more to this reality
83:42 and so i am not
83:45 i'm not inclined to dismiss everyone's
83:47 evp experience i do believe i've heard
83:50 some shortwave radio
83:51 malarkey but other than that i'm just
83:55 trying to find out why it happened
83:57 predominantly between the 1940s and all
83:59 the way up to the 80s but you never know
84:01 if the 80s is true
84:02 i don't know
84:06 maybe and then why it sort of died off
84:08 as a
84:10 pastime when we have the internet man
84:12 the internet should be able to
84:13 harvest together everyone who's had a
84:16 success
84:18 therefore understanding the hardware
84:19 requirements and then those who wish to
84:21 experience it
84:24 i have a very close friend of mine who's
84:26 been to
84:28 south america she's done ayahuasca for
84:32 four weeks had eight different doses had
84:34 amazing experiences
84:36 she's also been to just every
84:40 every single cool thing like sound bass
84:43 and
84:44 and just she's been to foreign countries
84:46 and went to temples and stuff
84:47 extremely open-minded person and
84:51 she would be a kind of person that could
84:53 get into this and probably find the
84:55 success in it because she has extremely
84:56 open mind
84:59 and i don't know if it requires an open
85:00 mind you know maybe you don't it
85:02 shouldn't
85:02 honestly if it's being recorded but for
85:05 those of you out there nice to know a
85:07 bunch of these guys in the game industry
85:08 who are like sound engineering experts
85:10 you
85:11 you deal with sound processing chips
85:14 you maybe even be deep in the government
85:17 and unable to communicate with any one
85:19 of us but you have the equipment
85:20 to filter out sounds or you've got a
85:22 buddy or relative or son or a daughter
85:24 that knows how to do this kind of stuff
85:26 it might be fascinating to say i'm gonna
85:29 throw you something
85:29 really crazy evp blah blah blah you
85:32 think you could hook me up a radio that
85:34 could do such a thing
85:35 and just have fun maybe you're the 2.0
85:37 of the whole movement
85:40 anyway let me know what you think and on
85:43 that note please go to
85:44 deepthoughtsradio.com and bookmark that
85:46 baby so if we get moved around
85:48 uh then we are good you can still find
85:51 me
85:52 i will say that in the midst of this
85:55 censorship which we haven't had any five
85:57 packs
85:58 destroyed recently uh it usually happens
86:01 like when i don't release episodes
86:02 but because i did i think i did five
86:05 days with five episodes
86:06 at two o'clock in the afternoon us time
86:09 pst
86:11 are view viewerships off the chain
86:14 and i got a notice inside my youtube
86:17 studio
86:19 application telling me oh my god
86:21 whatever you're doing is blowing up your
86:22 views your views are up 61
86:26 so when i told you we were getting
86:27 massive views
86:30 that's the case we hit 60 years of
86:33 listened
86:33 hours on youtube which is
86:36 for our little tiny show with almost no
86:38 subscriptions and all that kind of stuff
86:40 we're doing good
86:41 i i don't think anyone else really
86:43 calculates that metric so i think some
86:45 of these folks probably have like
86:46 a thousand years if not more but for a
86:50 little tiny show that nobody knows about
86:51 i think that's pretty good
86:53 so anyway feel free to pass it around
86:55 again everything he needs on the site in
86:56 terms of audio and video
86:58 social media ways to donate all that
86:59 kind of stuff we do have a patreon
87:01 patreon will get you the episodes if i
87:04 stick to this new format which i'm going
87:06 to
87:06 release everything around noon to two
87:10 o'clock california time
87:12 that gives european uh folks a chance to
87:15 listen to it when they get home it'll be
87:16 a little late for you guys if i do it at
87:18 2 i know
87:19 so i try to get around noon but my
87:20 sleeping habits are all messed up right
87:22 now
87:23 but i'm also trying to pipeline
87:24 everything so the audio is ready
87:26 the second i release the episode so
87:28 those of you only listen to podcasting
87:30 get it whenever you want to hear it i
87:32 know some of you work late shifts and
87:34 this is sort of a nice
87:35 little break so i i
87:38 very much respect that and thank you for
87:39 listening anyway take care of yourself
87:42 and someone else and i'll see you in the
87:44 next deep thoughts
87:45 over now
