00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen on
00:34 this windy day I decided to put my cap
00:38 on today it totally removes all the hair
00:42 problems that this winds gonna cause
00:43 it's like the maximum amount of wind
00:45 eNOS that I can record over select you
00:49 guys won't hear it on the mic but I'm
00:51 gonna get obliterated by it
00:53 so there's your intro it's a beautiful
00:56 day there it's it's a normal California
00:59 sky and that there's not a single cloud
01:02 in the sky horizon to Horizon this is
01:06 the way it was for the first at least 10
01:09 years me being in California there's no
01:13 clouds made by planes so that's good so
01:20 I was sitting my house today I'm
01:23 thinking jeez I've been working straight
01:27 for a couple weeks
01:28 very few breaks making shows for you
01:30 guys is my my big break I'm having one
01:35 of those mid week weekends where I
01:38 worked through several weekends because
01:42 I love it and there's just a point your
01:45 brain just goes I dude go play video
01:48 game go relax go to the beach just do
01:50 something else because your brain needs
01:52 a break so today we're gonna do I'm
01:57 gonna try to focus on an article that
01:59 came out this morning which is this big
02:02 deal about the Pentagon releasing
02:07 further descriptors in the English
02:10 language that they actually recognize
02:11 something called UFOs unidentified
02:14 flying objects
02:17 it's interesting you know for those of
02:20 us who've heard the crazy conspiracy and
02:22 I say that sarcastically because we
02:25 don't know if it's crazy or not I did an
02:27 episode on it which is that at some
02:30 future point after a bunch of covert
02:33 technology is developed the main
02:37 controlling forces of the world the top
02:40 governments will work together to create
02:41 a global conspiracy where they're gonna
02:46 fake an alien invasion and then boom
02:51 it's all under one control apparatus and
02:53 they win so just to visit that real
02:58 quick because the more you know you hear
03:00 those conspiracies you respond to them
03:01 and then you think about it for a couple
03:02 years you're like wait a minute here now
03:04 what would logistically that require any
03:09 time you were to bring together all the
03:10 major states you know China Russia
03:14 America the EU Britain maybe a couple
03:19 folks each southern continent you know
03:25 Africa really doesn't just have one guy
03:27 that runs a place or one girl it runs a
03:29 place and neither does South America so
03:31 it's a little tougher to kind of piece
03:33 those together Trudeau will do anything
03:37 anybody tells him to do I mean that to
03:40 the extreme but who could bring all
03:43 those people together and pull a Cyrus
03:48 you know we're gonna run this place and
03:51 I'm in charge who's gonna agree to that
03:56 Russia is not gonna agree to have
03:59 America run the place America is not
04:00 gonna agree to have rushed and run the
04:01 place even if you could draw up a bunch
04:03 of weird bankers and monarchs that'll
04:06 say oh no the lady is like give me a
04:08 [ __ ] sword I will supreme executive
04:11 power and everyone's gonna go shut up so
04:17 I think the first equation there is an
04:21 absurd inability for this to actually
04:26 occur we're never gonna get everyone on
04:28 the same page it's not gonna happen
04:31 at the top level but then a couple other
04:36 things occur to me which I think you're
04:37 kind of interesting one imagine that was
04:41 your objective and you started it
04:42 somewhere in the 70s
04:44 you're gonna develop technology maybe
04:49 based on a couple captured ships again
04:51 you're looking at a guy that believes
04:53 that night
04:54 47 Roswell actually occurred and you
05:00 know again I set out to disprove that
05:02 which I know is a very famous line that
05:06 people will say to get you coast into
05:08 something but man you go watch my
05:09 episode I think out of the dozen videos
05:12 that I used to get gained my opinion I
05:15 put them all in the description with you
05:19 know narrations of who was which part of
05:22 the video I actually watched and now
05:23 like 50 percent of them have been turned
05:25 off like entire channels disappeared you
05:29 know no violations just turned off it's
05:32 kind of weird but you would have to
05:36 start as soon as possible dividing the
05:38 technologies in half anything that's
05:39 awesome and amazing goes into the black
05:41 pile meaning you can't see it as a
05:43 normal citizen without queue clearance
05:45 and everything else turns into a turbine
05:48 a windmill the solar panel and you get
05:52 to just have all superior technology
05:54 that be the first thing you'd have to do
05:57 is start dividing up the technology and
05:58 then of course if you had the most
06:00 brilliant minds in the world they're not
06:01 gonna want to work on a turbine they're
06:03 gonna work on an antimatter engine or
06:04 some sort of ether with displacement
06:06 motor then you have your geneticists
06:10 that are gonna want to splice human
06:13 children with some bizarre you know
06:16 mantis insect so they look really
06:19 strange and then they keep doing that
06:20 until they find one that can actually
06:21 function such that when they roll these
06:24 things out these dudes come out and they
06:26 actually have the capability of not only
06:29 communicating with us but you know
06:31 operating ships and all that kind of
06:34 stuff so I mean it's like if you start
06:35 to see the heavy lifting that would have
06:37 to happen to pull one of these things
06:38 off but another thing occurred to me
06:42 because we you know if you're fairly
06:45 objective about UFOs you kind of have to
06:47 do both sides of the equation at all
06:49 times if not more than two but one is
06:53 you know they most likely exist I mean
06:55 again my friend's father told him as a
06:58 test pilot back in the 40s that you know
07:01 a spaceship came up to his ship and
07:06 waddled around and messed around the
07:08 strobes around the outside of this 32
07:10 foot disc and he was fearing for his
07:14 life thought he was gonna die cuz he
07:16 thought this thing was gonna force him
07:17 to course-correct
07:19 at whatever high altitude he was at but
07:21 he took his whole life to tell his son
07:25 he was literally on his deathbed before
07:28 he told the son here is his son is a
07:29 special effects guy in Hollywood it's
07:31 like you know why wouldn't it be one of
07:34 these situations where it's like oh that
07:36 man there's nothing there stuff you do
07:38 on TV well I've seen in real life what
07:40 you know wouldn't it be a story like
07:41 that some guys just dropping a mad
07:43 science and some Thanksgiving dinner
07:44 no wait still he's literally in the
07:46 hospital on his deathbed literally I
07:49 mean I hear these deathbed things all
07:51 the time
07:51 online and when it's a friend of mine
07:55 who is a real straight shooter it has a
08:00 completely different impact to you when
08:02 you hear it you're like oh my god this
08:03 dude it's never lied to me before and
08:06 and he's telling me a very intimate
08:08 thing that happened between he and his
08:09 father he said his father was really
08:11 quiet stoic kind of classic you know
08:14 turn-of-the-century kind of guy from the
08:16 19th century to the 20th century but
08:21 what has been the sort of angst for the
08:23 UFO community it has been that we think
08:32 the government has information and
08:34 they're hiding it from the rest of
08:35 humanity we have no indication that the
08:40 aliens need to hide it from us we
08:44 obviously if the Roswell thing is real
08:47 in 1947 all the eyewitnesses that are
08:50 non-military that are very simple people
08:53 just citizens of Roswell if any of their
08:56 you know on-camera testimony over the
08:59 course of 40 years it bears any truth
09:02 then the ship didn't mean to crash it
09:05 just fell out of the sky whether we
09:09 knocked it out of the sky on accident or
09:11 it just had a malfunction we won't know
09:16 it's hard to believe that we could
09:18 manufacture what
09:19 to injure either serendipitously or
09:23 intentionally a ship because the ship
09:27 would have the requirement of traveling
09:30 through the universe which has got to be
09:31 at a massively hostile environment from
09:34 time to time it's like us perfecting
09:38 radar s perfecting a laser weapon or
09:41 whatever it doesn't make sense but you
09:47 know how we we understand the television
09:51 and and movies are all in the press of
09:54 all different kinds from newspapers to
09:56 magazines to online stuff but you know
09:59 back in the day television it's all a
10:02 project Mockingbird sort of situation
10:05 the military decides what everybody's
10:06 supposed to say sellouts like Anderson
10:09 Cooper go right in and just just they've
10:14 sold their soul a long time ago so just
10:15 keep going right but predictive
10:19 programming is a gigantic thing and you
10:22 know the theory behind the most popular
10:26 definition of predictive programming is
10:28 that they have a rule that they must
10:31 predict what they're going to do they
10:34 have a telegraph requirements so if
10:37 they're gonna pull a big FF they roll it
10:40 up into the Simpsons they roll it up
10:42 into X Files they you know again we even
10:45 had a video game and Electronic Arts
10:48 that when that day happened in September
10:52 of 2001 I believe we had a box on the
10:55 shelf that showed planes going in to
10:58 those two buildings it was a game
11:02 created by a guy named Neil Young who
11:03 runs Zynga right now I believe and the
11:08 game was over it was pulled off the
11:09 shelf that was it but it was also an
11:11 episode in x-files and the May of that
11:13 same year and the writers are now come
11:15 on said a yes and some black hats came
11:18 and told us to write that into a script
11:20 so wouldn't that be a great idea but
11:23 imagine this thing happened in 47 and
11:26 it's real and saying now you have a bit
11:28 of a concern there's additional
11:31 sightings because who knows
11:33 what the hell's going on let's just say
11:34 that they're really fascinated with gaia
11:39 soul earth and they're all kind of
11:42 visiting like Fifth Element they're just
11:44 big giant cruise ships out there it's
11:46 all stealth and they're just having fun
11:49 but every once in a while someone takes
11:50 a little speeder down and gets caught
11:52 little teasers running around the
11:54 universe and so the government goes into
11:57 like the initial phase which does hey
11:59 let's hide all this lets denial this but
12:02 the citizens keep amassing views of UFOs
12:07 so you're like to him what are we going
12:09 to do with this whole thing and then you
12:12 could do a very interesting thing which
12:14 is to desensitize it and go the other
12:16 way the Pentagon the military works to
12:22 finance as many UFO sighting UFO based
12:26 movies television shows even the
12:29 independent art students they just grant
12:32 them money and say okay if you're
12:33 willing to create this thing where the
12:35 CFO flies around Mexico City yeah we'll
12:38 give you what do you want five grand
12:39 there's some of your rendering costs get
12:42 to it and then they just spring up all
12:45 over the world and now you can't trust
12:47 anything because there's so much fakery
12:49 out there that if anything real were to
12:51 occur nobody knows the difference
12:56 so that just occurred to me the other
12:58 day I thought it's kind of interesting a
12:59 little spin that could be taking place
13:03 because once we see them try to you know
13:05 desensitize us to all the crazy you know
13:08 satanic rituals that are going on why
13:12 would it stop there would it would just
13:14 be a philosophy to handle all things you
13:16 just take that out you know the
13:17 archetype and you move it all over the
13:18 place but here you know I'm gonna go for
13:22 this I spend at least five minutes on
13:25 this thing I've said a couple times in
13:28 previous videos you know the whole UFO
13:31 phenomenon and the UFO business did a
13:35 MUFON does a pretty good job but in
13:40 terms of an overall attraction in the
13:42 world it's sort of like trying to get
13:45 kids to look at
13:47 arkaid animations you know you crank the
13:50 thing they got a little video and air
13:51 and you're watching something yeah it's
13:53 okay but it's not getting compared to VR
13:56 goggles or some other immersive video
14:00 game or television show and so nowadays
14:04 the people report seeing a UFO nobody
14:06 gives a [ __ ]
14:07 oh wow some more lights over Phoenix
14:10 some more you know wheel covers being
14:14 thrown in front of a camera and I think
14:18 it has to do with the same thing that
14:21 happened which is the printing press
14:23 killed the mythical God I can't say
14:27 there's a Savior here anymore walking on
14:29 water and casting demons into pigs and
14:31 all that stuff and curing leprosy and
14:33 deafness and death itself you can't
14:36 claim those things because everyone's
14:38 got a cell phone everywhere you are in
14:40 the world there's two cameras in
14:42 everybody's hands and you know even the
14:44 crappiest cameras got 1080p but now most
14:47 cameras are 4k sound and everything used
14:51 to be it took your cell phone and you
14:52 filmed a concert and you came home and
14:54 it was just god-awful the sound was
14:57 horrible maybe your video was okay but
15:01 nowadays you can take a camera to a
15:02 concert and you're gonna have you know
15:06 damn-near live album quality recordings
15:08 that they were selling you in the 70s
15:10 but kiss alive you know
15:13 and so the mythology of this whole thing
15:16 this whole movement has slowed down
15:18 considerably
15:20 you know it's almost as if a UFO were to
15:25 have a cul-de-sac in front of my house
15:27 right if I were to walk out there and
15:30 here comes a UFO it's radius this or its
15:35 diameter is a little bit shy of the
15:37 cul-de-sac itself by maybe 10 feet so we
15:40 got a nice 5 foot walking area and it
15:43 just comes down hovers and I got my this
15:45 camera my cellphone whatever and I'm
15:48 filming it and it but it doesn't land
15:52 and no one gets out and it takes off
15:54 there's no real form of like close
15:57 encounter piano plane to communicate
16:00 I don't know how much people would care
16:04 and I'm willing to bet that regardless
16:06 of how HD I got that footage I think a
16:10 bunch of people wouldn't believe it I
16:12 think even if I watched it I might be
16:14 like and it looks like CG you know the
16:18 more perfect and smooth the craft would
16:20 be the more it would look like just
16:22 entry-level 3d it's like some art
16:25 student pulling this thing off right but
16:29 the big deal in the article was at the
16:30 Pentagon actually used the acronym UFO
16:32 and I forgot I forgot they have another
16:38 one e AE s or something with has like
16:41 aeronautical something or others other
16:44 acronym they've been using for years to
16:46 avoid saying UFO because that would
16:49 validate the whole theory to the
16:50 humanity and slight you know for me it's
16:55 sort of like just call a spade a spade
16:57 would you so we can get this
16:59 conversation to mature a little bit over
17:01 all these years but there was an analogy
17:05 I gave to a friend of mine last night
17:08 because we were talking about you know
17:12 the pyramids and how amazing those
17:16 things are how shrouded they are in
17:19 terms of their true in operation and
17:21 intent to being built again I just said
17:24 an episode the Egyptians had never left
17:26 behind blueprints of how they built
17:27 those things but then they have all
17:28 their blueprints for how to embalming
17:30 you get to the other side and then I I
17:33 just thought about it for a second I
17:34 thought you know the the pyramids are
17:37 interesting and this is gonna link back
17:38 to UFOs first what second what if I'm
17:44 just gonna use the United States of
17:45 America as a quick example what if in
17:48 central Kansas in like around Hutchison
17:51 Kansas which is really around the center
17:54 of the United States from coast to coast
17:56 there was a giant hammer like a Thor's
17:59 hammer submerged into the soil a little
18:04 bit so it stands up you know so that big
18:06 ball big you know lump of steel at the
18:08 ends there big handle and it looks like
18:12 it's built for a giant
18:14 might be a mile tall sort of thing it's
18:17 huge but it's just there and society
18:22 grows up in the African area then goes
18:26 into Europe and then migrates across to
18:28 the Americas we find the Native
18:29 Americans here they're like worshipping
18:33 this hammer thing and so we eventually
18:38 get inland enough and we see this thing
18:40 and we bring all of our quote/unquote
18:44 science of you know Galileo Copernicus
18:47 and you know we're trying to look at
18:49 this thing objectively and going whoa
18:53 could this have happened
18:55 you know through natural phenomenon
18:57 you'd have the jerk-offs from the
18:58 Smithsonian know this is totally a
19:00 natural formation Smithsonian probably
19:03 try to steal it well let's just say it's
19:06 so big they can't be stolen like you
19:08 can't steal the pyramids they're just
19:11 too big be a catastrophe d1 dismantle
19:16 one of those things right you know now
19:18 that just think about them thinking
19:20 somebody's gonna try to sell that one to
19:21 Egypt we're gonna take it apart to
19:23 better understand it then we'll put it
19:25 back together because it's gonna fall
19:27 apart if we don't take it apart when
19:29 they move all those priceless statues in
19:31 Egypt it's like really and they just cut
19:35 these things up they cut up these
19:37 statues and move them and it's like
19:40 really that's the only thing we can do
19:42 is is cut these things up and move them
19:45 you can't build a building around it if
19:46 there's gonna be a bunch of water a man
19:48 just layin some cement just in case the
19:50 thing we go visit it we go down
19:52 underneath the doodad and say this had
19:54 to be in case because that water is
19:56 corrosive I mean Jesus all these things
19:59 should be encased that have weather
20:02 issues because they're extremely
20:05 important I know that these the pyramids
20:07 are 455 feet tall well how tall is the
20:11 average building in this world way
20:12 taller than that in terms of a
20:13 skyscraper if it's going to have a
20:17 weather issue surround it with something
20:18 so we can preserve it forever it's a
20:21 it's a thing anyway we get this Thor's
20:23 hammer and we're all sitting here in the
20:26 quote unquote modern society
20:28 I think about the profound nature this
20:31 would have on our minds you're staring
20:34 at something that belongs to a God in
20:38 relative terms if it was Thor's you know
20:43 now you believe in Asgard asgaard you
20:51 believe in this place he comes from now
20:53 all the mythology around Thor has some
20:56 potential validity
20:57 you know the dwarfs build the tools for
21:02 the gods maybe they're real now
21:04 but you have this constant nagging
21:07 single point of of question / answer
21:11 hovering in the middle of a desert you
21:13 know whatever a field or some sort right
21:15 should be pretty cool in a desert or in
21:18 a field kids they grew up in the area
21:22 well they're growing up next to this
21:23 thing like all the kids that grew up in
21:25 Cairo I mean what a while last thing to
21:27 happen you know you're just like yeah
21:28 there's the pyramids I've always seen
21:29 them my entire life
21:31 yeah you know and the rest of us are
21:34 going do you realize how amazing this
21:36 stuff is I mean just the Mayan writing
21:39 is unbelievable Aztec writings
21:42 unbelievable I mean wow the pre Incas
21:46 wherever they were Machu Picchu all
21:49 these amazing places in Turkey and South
21:51 Africa and all these other places so son
21:55 hinge was rebuilt in 1954 but it did
21:58 exist at a separate location all knocked
22:00 over but still some of these things are
22:04 just phenomenal to stare at so why
22:07 mention that little diversion well
22:10 imagine you're the military which is
22:15 this name for a group of people that
22:18 serve their country and they keep
22:20 escalating up through the ranks and to
22:22 the point where they get inside these
22:26 super high clearance areas and again
22:27 most of the guys that are probably
22:30 around anything like that if that stuff
22:33 exists they're more of your probably
22:36 intellectual intelligence people are not
22:39 probably the folks that have served in a
22:41 DES
22:41 it's fighting some enemy somewhere but
22:45 they're protected by those folks you
22:46 know your camo dudes or whatever but now
22:50 you're in a warehouse and you got this
22:51 ship you know again when I was leaning
22:55 over like bob lazar in my brain saying
22:57 that there was like I think his number
23:00 was like nine ships he said all of them
23:03 but one had injuries on the outside of
23:05 the ship but the one he's supposedly
23:09 working on and s4 is absolutely pristine
23:12 and perfect all right again I said it
23:16 once and I'll repeat it again they say
23:17 you know he said that s4 was south of
23:20 area 51 well now we have map technology
23:22 I don't see any other location south of
23:25 area 51 that are blacked out by the map
23:28 folks you know so you know who knows if
23:32 that's real baby s4 is underground who
23:34 knows but you're staring at this thing
23:37 you're staring at a spaceship and now
23:42 you can't think about reality the same
23:45 way that you did before well anyone
23:50 that's seen a UFO if you really have and
23:53 it's not just some dot in the sky mean
23:58 balls of light up in the air that move
24:01 around hey man they they could pass for
24:03 UFO especially if they don't move like
24:05 aircraft but there are drones up there
24:08 flying around that are white and then
24:12 all of a sudden you know the Sun hits it
24:13 in a particular way and you're getting a
24:14 big you know eyeball full of overexposed
24:18 light and so it looks like this star who
24:21 knows but if you're really staring at a
24:24 UFO but that's a game-changer that
24:29 changes your whole life but then just
24:33 like this Thor's hammer example you're
24:35 sitting there staring at something and
24:37 you know without the gods coming down
24:40 and telling you you know or something
24:44 like you know Thor reaches down thanks
24:45 man thinks we're holding onto this it
24:47 takes off I got some [ __ ] I got to do
24:49 we're just sitting there staring at
24:51 something that has proof of a higher
24:52 intelligence
24:54 of capabilities that we no longer have
24:56 or have never had but now we can't think
25:00 the same apparently I got this fly it
25:03 really digs some show but now let's
25:07 stick UFOs and that's hybrid a little
25:10 bit with some of these theories about
25:12 being dropped off because I say that
25:16 throughout my episodes and I've done
25:18 some episodes that really get into that
25:19 whole idea
25:20 Planet X asserted that idea you know
25:26 according to David Icke the word Zulu
25:29 means people from space you look at the
25:35 Aztec and Mayan artwork and you've got
25:39 these pieces are work that look like
25:41 guys inside spaceships you have
25:46 illustrations in the deserts of Peru
25:48 which look like space guys almond eyed
25:54 statuettes and all kinds of things have
25:56 been made all over the world from South
26:00 Africa to Asia
26:02 there's almond eyed little dolls holding
26:05 babies and the one that David Icke
26:08 always likes is his shaman dude never
26:11 pronounce the guy's name but he's got
26:13 this necklace that has an almond eye guy
26:15 with a phallus and it's designed to fit
26:18 inside the the woman which looks human
26:23 as if you know again this is some
26:26 ancient theory of history this is not
26:30 even a theory it's supposed to be the
26:31 ancient documentation of our past then
26:37 you have movies like Star Gate which
26:38 portray the pyramids as a landing
26:41 structure for a larger pyramid spaceship
26:43 I thought that was pretty ingenious to
26:46 be honest it doesn't appear to be like a
26:49 little belly door that opens up the you
26:52 know like imagine you landed on the
26:54 pyramid but you exited in the lower part
26:57 of your ship and then you actually walk
26:59 down the corridor the interior of the
27:01 pyramid and you walk out doesn't seem to
27:04 be any way to get in from the outside
27:06 but now one of the things
27:08 it's always sort of a thorn in the side
27:09 of the theory that we were dropped off
27:11 is that whoever did that if that were to
27:14 occur essentially took everything with
27:17 them but they used to get here right we
27:20 don't have a tricorder as far as we know
27:24 it's been found in the desert we don't
27:26 have spaceships that were abandoned we
27:28 don't have you know these pods that you
27:31 see in Star Trek whether you bring it
27:33 down and they set up people to hang out
27:35 on earth and so there's no real evidence
27:40 other than craftsmanship that makes us
27:43 go whoa there's this crazy bowl that we
27:48 found in Egypt that is we assume abhi
27:52 this is wild folded it looks like metal
27:56 but it's a perfectly symmetrical thing
27:59 that looks like some bizarre
28:01 three-dimensional fan blade thing and no
28:04 one's quite sure what it is it has very
28:05 little practical value because of its
28:07 shape and so some people have insinuated
28:11 it has to do with you know a part of a
28:13 motor part of maybe a some sort of
28:16 crafting tool but it's not made of
28:18 material strong enough to to really
28:21 craft limestone or granted especially
28:23 which are the two primary stones they
28:25 used on the pyramids themselves and
28:29 regardless of how advanced you think the
28:31 pyramids are the temples the temples
28:34 have some progressive architecture the
28:38 dovetails with the Greek and so you have
28:42 these pillars that hold up the temples
28:44 and as man perfected structural
28:49 architecture mathematics we were able to
28:53 move these pillars further and further
28:54 apart and that is one methodology that
28:57 anthropologists use to gauge the
29:00 intelligence of a particular region so
29:05 in Athens the Parthenon has pillars that
29:08 are further apart than the pillars that
29:10 are in the temples of Egypt even within
29:13 Egypt you have them starting out very
29:14 close together and then moving further
29:16 apart but you know nothing changes this
29:21 sense of awe when you see the footage
29:24 come back from Egypt where people walk
29:25 you through the temples with these HD
29:27 cameras and they start filming all
29:28 around you know and you start seeing
29:30 these gigantic pillars they're so ornate
29:34 hieroglyphs you know encircling a lot of
29:37 them the palm tops that were carved in
29:43 stone beautifully symmetrical I mean
29:46 once you get into 3d software what's
29:48 interesting is is one of the most
29:50 alluring things you can do is use the
29:53 tools that duplicate a particular object
29:55 in a circle and some software is really
29:59 good at it and some software is really
30:01 shitty at it but if you want to create
30:04 like a UFO and you we're gonna first
30:07 recreate the saucer thing that's pretty
30:09 easy and then you want to put like
30:11 underneath you know and have lights to
30:13 go around in this perfect circle but you
30:14 have to create a light of a certain size
30:15 and then you can only distribute that
30:17 light so many iterations before it's
30:19 gonna start overlapping it's too big you
30:22 want to make the thing a little tighter
30:24 so you adjust the count you just the
30:25 radius you just the curve and you're
30:27 putting this thing together and you
30:30 start to realize that even with
30:31 automated software that's a fairly
30:34 intricate process and now when you look
30:36 at the fact that the Egyptians you know
30:39 had these stones that they kept cutting
30:41 and stacking on each other to make these
30:43 pillars when you look at the the Roman
30:47 columns they're all embossed right they
30:51 have these beautiful scenes down the
30:53 down the pillars and but they had to
30:55 count how many would work around the
30:58 outside and because these pillars
31:00 typically get a little smaller and
31:05 radius at the top versus the bottom so
31:08 then you're starting off with slightly
31:10 thicker lines at the bottom and they get
31:11 thinner as they go to the top but it all
31:13 beautifully distributes around the
31:14 column the craftsmanship is insane I
31:18 mean insane and so when you start
31:21 looking at the columns on Egypt which in
31:25 my opinion and my understanding is some
31:27 of the oldest columns we've ever found
31:28 in world history and you've got you know
31:32 it looks like palm leaves at the top
31:35 there's all kinds of different plants
31:37 that ornate the top of these things but
31:39 they're perfectly distributed around the
31:42 outside edge of the top so someone's
31:44 measuring things off figuring things out
31:46 it's super duper mathematical and then
31:48 it's not just lines it's beautiful
31:51 curved Leafs that's been you know sort
31:55 of impressionist sticks that make up
31:58 these pillars Wow
32:01 I mean we were SuperDuper smart back in
32:05 the day and I get the sense that the
32:08 average citizen had more knowledge than
32:10 the average citizen today but now let's
32:14 look at this whole thing about UFOs and
32:15 Pentagon and then the von braun's
32:18 secretary who said that von Braun said
32:20 that they were planning already in the
32:21 mid 70s to create this alien invasion
32:24 then of course Reagan gives his weird
32:26 speech it's us exactly the same thing
32:28 and what if there was an alien invasion
32:29 we'd all have to come under one new
32:31 world government blah blah blah and
32:33 Reagan's whole objective I think was
32:35 really just we could set aside our
32:37 differences and get along yeah I don't
32:38 think he was really talking about the
32:40 New World Order but who knows right the
32:45 guy went to a Bohemian Grove let's not
32:47 overlook that I mean President Reagan
32:51 went to Bohemian Grove potentially for
32:53 25 years before he ever got in office as
32:55 president so he may not have been as
32:59 clean as you think so I like the fact
33:01 that our current president has never
33:02 been but we have this globalist movement
33:06 don't we we know it's happening right in
33:09 front of our very face they're trying to
33:12 corrupt us morally at the same time
33:15 shaming everything that's the opposite
33:18 and they want to shame both sides of the
33:19 fence as much as they possibly can
33:20 because all they want is to incubate
33:22 divided and that sort of thing but now
33:25 what if the military said we want this
33:30 no real thing to happen because we
33:32 answer to a bunch of corrupt factions
33:34 and again I think that's drastically
33:36 changed last couple years United States
33:37 I hope but wouldn't it be in their best
33:40 interest to go ahead and release all the
33:42 information wouldn't that create some
33:45 unification between man if I
33:48 of all these governments hiding and
33:50 coveting information because again we're
33:52 not talking about the United States
33:55 giving up secrets about how their
33:58 particular capture ship works and who
34:03 knows if the Russians have their own
34:05 capture ships you never hear about that
34:07 you've got Mexico well you got a bunch
34:09 of South American countries that have
34:11 released their airforce footage of
34:13 chasing all kinds of weird stuff from
34:17 cylinders to space like saucer things
34:20 the Russian military commanders have
34:23 been very in my experience very
34:26 forthright about the fact that UFOs do
34:29 exist and they don't know what they are
34:31 and the last division out of Russia was
34:34 that there are several types okay I
34:39 don't remember Russia ever saying they
34:42 captured one but according to you know
34:45 the all-american cowboy thing we've got
34:50 nine of them you know according to Bob
34:52 Lazar Roswell again if there's any one
35:00 moment in history that I think has some
35:02 potential validity for America having
35:05 captured one of these it's the Roswell
35:08 crash of 1947 again I did an episode on
35:12 that if you're interested but what if
35:17 you know photographs leaked and it was
35:20 sorry I don't even leaked it's literally
35:22 there's a press conference the Pentagon
35:25 uses Donald Trump uses whatever general
35:29 so-and-so and they come out maybe all of
35:31 them just stand up there on one
35:32 particular day and they say we're going
35:35 to release part of what we know about
35:39 extraterrestrial life and visitation to
35:41 this planet and they fill out say we
35:44 have been visited by beings from another
35:47 place in the universe we definitely do a
35:51 wonder to this whole debate of what
35:54 shape the earth is if you think about
35:57 how many problems they could potentially
35:58 solve if they put a few Peppard lies
36:01 into that whole thing
36:02 might validate the moon missions and
36:04 that kind of thing right but they show a
36:07 photograph or photographs of ships that
36:11 they have here are 10 photographs of
36:14 ships that we have one is fully pristine
36:16 and the other one's suffered mechanical
36:19 failures we shot him out of the sky not
36:22 knowing exactly what they were but we
36:26 also here's the second part of the game
36:28 they could show us photographs movies of
36:32 the actual beings that they captured in
36:36 these ships at least with Roswell the
36:38 story is is that there's three survivors
36:40 or three sorry three people three aliens
36:43 ones mangled beyond belief dead the
36:47 other one is fatally wounded but still
36:50 squirming around it initially and one is
36:53 perfectly pristine the other thing was
36:56 that he was able to set out in the
36:57 desert and as the archaeologists and his
37:00 students came up the the random family
37:03 that came up to it with the
37:04 eight-year-old kid
37:06 it wasn't visibly dying the military guy
37:12 that was able to walk around with the
37:14 dude for a while didn't talk about him
37:17 you know panting for air so it was as if
37:19 whatever they used to breathe was
37:23 happening naturally
37:25 it wasn't dying it wasn't gasping that
37:27 sort of thing so this being lives and we
37:31 have to assume there would be some form
37:33 of communication we could come up with
37:34 even if they were telepathic someone
37:36 could simply just be the mouthpiece and
37:39 say oh he's saying this he's saying that
37:41 write that down but how would that
37:44 change the narrative in the world for
37:47 how we view all things you know the the
37:49 typical ridiculous story we hear which
37:53 is that the military believes that we
37:55 would panic to death if we heard that
37:58 there were UFOs and aliens because
38:00 people who believed in religion
38:01 would somehow I don't know Jim Jones
38:06 themselves I don't buy that for a split
38:09 second I think through the kubler-ross
38:12 negotiation phase you would have some
38:15 pretty clever
38:16 negotiations that would be someone going
38:18 well you know the you know how they say
38:19 aliens are real you saw the photographs
38:21 right and in some devout Christian
38:24 priests or Reverend or whatever and
38:29 they're gonna have some quippy little
38:31 thing it's like well God you know God
38:32 created the universe and God created
38:34 we're just one of his children and
38:35 doesn't mean Jesus isn't you know this
38:38 is that any other thing I think that's
38:41 what would happen we'd get over it but
38:44 there's there's kind of two there's two
38:45 theories as to what's happened what
38:48 would happen and then what has happened
38:49 as a result of bumping into these UFOs
38:51 and potentially meeting them one of them
38:54 is that you know we sequestered this
38:57 anyone that we've ever captured and we
38:59 interview them and keep them out of the
39:00 public eye until they pass away and it's
39:05 supposedly that imbued the military with
39:08 all kinds of technology silicon chips
39:10 fiber optics velcro such a joke velcro
39:16 is a very natural thing that happens
39:17 with flowers you know in terms of
39:20 beaming light through you know extruded
39:23 glass well we've been doing that since
39:25 we found glass for the very first time
39:30 microchips you know I can understand
39:33 what people think that that's alien
39:34 technology but once we realized that
39:38 light can change the property of
39:41 chemicals you know once you start
39:43 developing silicon it gets exposed to
39:46 light it erodes and someone figures that
39:48 out plus is a conductive surface and so
39:50 we simply create a highway of layered
39:54 silicon to create logic gates you know
39:59 maybe it's easy to say that because it's
40:01 already been invented
40:02 I just have a lot of faith in humanity
40:05 to figure out some of these things when
40:08 man learned how to create aqueducts and
40:10 Phil you know move water around and
40:12 irrigate a field and especially Rome's
40:15 advances in water movement for me you
40:20 have the base theory of how you move
40:23 electrons through creating physical
40:26 gates physical limitations what do you
40:28 think an old
40:29 tube radio was doing so the flip side is
40:33 the other sort of theory we have to
40:35 postulate because it's never occurred
40:37 which is okay they come clean and they
40:40 go clean on the photographs of the
40:42 vehicles the photographs of these
40:44 creatures these other beings I don't
40:47 mean to to attempt to demean them by
40:52 calling them creatures these other
40:54 beings intelligent life and then they
40:58 the third thing is the fantasy which is
41:01 that they would tell us the humans that
41:03 have interacted with these individuals
41:05 they start to disclose everything that
41:09 they know about these folks where they
41:10 come from in the universe what their
41:12 objectives are how long they've been
41:14 watching us whether they participated in
41:16 our very creation and so that each
41:19 individual thing that would be revealed
41:21 would be something that would have to be
41:24 debated in some you know think-tank
41:27 somewhere is okay well you know they
41:29 actually did participate in creating us
41:31 they've shown us evidence that they
41:32 created us they've shown superior
41:34 knowledge of genetics they taught us
41:36 things about our own bodies we never
41:37 even knew we're in there all kinds of
41:40 wild inhibitors to keep us from seeing
41:41 them or whatever and so then they have
41:44 to go well we can tell them this much
41:46 but not that much you know because that
41:48 would be a little too alarming but now
41:50 here's the interesting thing you know as
41:54 well as I do there are people out there
41:56 that can tell you anything and sell you
41:58 anything and they can control your
42:02 anxiety and they do test groups that
42:04 bring in folks that are likely to just
42:06 lose their minds and they test tiny
42:10 smidgens of the information well what if
42:13 you know how would you respond if you
42:14 heard that this was the case and you
42:18 know notoriously you'd have someone go
42:20 well that can't be true and you know the
42:23 person talking to them was like well no
42:25 it's definitely could be true because it
42:27 is true that's a ton and so they figure
42:31 out what to say do these individual
42:34 groups there's that Twilight Zone I've
42:37 been to several times about the guy
42:39 named frisbee he's the big tall tail guy
42:42 that owns
42:43 hardware convenience store or whatever
42:45 and the old men go in there listen to
42:47 him lie about all of his degrees and
42:49 everything he's invented until two
42:51 aliens pull up in front of his gas
42:53 station to get some gas and they he lies
42:57 to them about how brilliant he is and so
43:00 they get they could develop an interest
43:02 in him because they're like oh my god we
43:03 want to capture one human being on earth
43:04 that knows everything and this guy's got
43:06 36 degrees the guy lies about inventing
43:09 the car that they're in I mean he's just
43:11 he's crazy liars it's a fantastic
43:13 episode but the when he gets captured by
43:15 them he realizes they've never heard of
43:19 a lie before and so they can't process
43:22 the fact that he's been telling tall
43:24 tales he's honest with them he's like oh
43:26 you know I understand why you guys think
43:27 I know everything cuz you don't know
43:28 that I'm spinning a yarn man I'm pulling
43:32 your leg and they're like what are you
43:33 talking about what's that mean he goes
43:34 I'm a liar I'm the biggest liar has ever
43:37 been and they're like what is a lie and
43:41 he goes what do you mean you don't know
43:42 what a lie is and so that's where Rick
43:46 Gervase got his script idea for the
43:48 whole thing and so what if our alien
43:51 friends won let's say there's a model
43:56 where they're all coming from the same
43:58 place even though according to Bob Lazar
44:01 they have a bunch of different car types
44:02 or they got Buicks and forwards and
44:05 testarossa's and Bentley's cuz they all
44:07 come in with different spacecraft which
44:11 has always bothered me as a kid of like
44:13 some guys like I got the legit
44:15 photograph of an alien spaceship and
44:17 it's just some corny looking [ __ ]
44:19 thing you just thinking geez man I have
44:24 had as a child you know those tops that
44:28 they used to give you it used to be the
44:29 top you pull it what the coordinate
44:30 would spin then there was one as you
44:32 pump them from the top terrifically
44:34 boring toys but there's tops there's
44:37 this just you know stamped steel tops
44:40 from the 50s 60s and 70s that look like
44:43 after UFOs these guys were submitting so
44:45 it's like a big stretch huh you got tons
44:48 of photographs from the past what just
44:50 looks like a wheel cover been thrown in
44:52 the sky he's had a photograph taken of
44:55 it and of course you hear all these BS
44:57 experts back in his 70s and 80s well
44:59 we've had photo photography experts look
45:01 at this on a computer and it's so real
45:04 and it's like oh really now everyone's
45:06 got Photoshop more like [ __ ] there's
45:09 nothing you guys could have done to
45:11 validate this into reality it is simply
45:14 an object that's been tossed in the sky
45:17 and it's in focus of course the depth of
45:20 field never pay the plays a role in this
45:22 thing so but let's just say that you
45:26 know there's one theory that they all
45:28 come from the same place and then what
45:30 is that place I did an episode on
45:34 interdimensional beings and so there's
45:38 this this idea that they come from
45:40 really far you know far away's planet
45:43 Iran some Sun somewhere and like the the
45:46 constellation Virgo or something like
45:48 that I always think it's funny that we
45:51 say they come from a constellation
45:52 because the constellation doesn't have
45:55 any reality once you leave our position
45:59 in the universe and I guess you could
46:01 say I go I go in that direction it would
46:03 be like the best you could do right but
46:06 the other theory would be that we have
46:08 several different you know beings coming
46:12 in from another planet when that like
46:14 I'll just remind you when Steven Greer
46:16 did his disclosure project almost 20
46:19 years ago now all these folks from the
46:24 military and some from the press went up
46:27 to a podium and said look I was involved
46:30 in this particular sighting in whatever
46:33 capacity some people are soldiers some
46:35 people are just press folks some people
46:37 are just you know guys around the radios
46:41 at night saying look these broadcasts
46:43 were made and these people didn't know
46:44 what they were looking at and some
46:45 people said it was a UFO and they said
46:47 it took off and and one guy you know
46:50 comes out and says well I know for a
46:52 fact there's like 27 of them
46:54 27 species that are here on earth today
46:58 and they visit us and then that's when
47:01 someone from the press said okay well
47:03 what do they look like and the guy just
47:05 bottomed out because he was only willing
47:07 to tell the lie he wasn't willing to
47:09 back it up
47:10 if any evidence and he's like ooh they
47:12 all look like us you know or some of
47:14 them look just like us you know and so
47:16 the you know the going theories of what
47:20 these folks look like our you know the
47:23 gray alien almond eyed creatures
47:25 according to Whitley Strieber there's
47:27 another subspecies to that group where
47:29 you have the tall beige females that are
47:32 like six feet the four-foot gray males
47:37 and then you have these even shorter
47:39 folks that were like World War one
47:41 helmets which is absolutely larious with
47:43 these perfectly round eyes and they are
47:46 the kind of soldiers who serve these
47:48 other folks and again whit whit Whitley
47:52 Strieber is the only guy that I've ever
47:53 heard talk about that particular race
47:56 which i think is interesting you know
47:58 Courtney that guy he has met them so
48:00 many times he should know their first
48:01 and last names and their full objective
48:03 on earth and of course he wrote his book
48:06 transformation and breakthrough which
48:09 tries to go into exactly what they're
48:12 doing they're good in some people's eyes
48:14 and they're demons and other people's
48:16 eyes they're evil angels and other
48:18 people's eyes which is another word for
48:19 demon and then you have the David Icke
48:23 reptilian thing which again there's
48:26 ridiculous evidence that people believe
48:30 this I mean and I don't mean the belief
48:32 is ridiculous I just it's like
48:34 unbelievable that there are statues that
48:36 surround the Windsor family that are
48:40 these lizard males that are hybrid into
48:44 these females it's it's really wild and
48:50 what's interesting finding those
48:51 photographs is now more and more
48:54 difficult but thank God I cut them into
48:56 my initial episodes on this so you can
48:58 go look at my Lepus odes on youtube and
49:00 see those things the other funny ones
49:04 are insect-like beings and they people
49:11 say that um they considered the greys to
49:14 be fairly insectoid which i think is
49:16 weird
49:16 they're very humanoid they just have a
49:19 much more refined skull the only hair
49:23 according to Whitley Whitney Whitley
49:25 Strieber excuse me
49:27 they photosynthesize on their skin but
49:30 then then again and they have little
49:32 spacesuits on so I'm not sure how that
49:33 works
49:34 Oh quick guys just get our suits off so
49:35 we can breathe you know and then there's
49:38 all the humanoid variations there's this
49:42 variation that is like Elon Musk's
49:45 ex-wife who's in Westworld she's the one
49:49 that greets William in the subway to get
49:51 him all dressed up for his first outing
49:55 and it's because the eyes are further
49:58 apart so the bridge between the eyeballs
50:00 is spaced out more you have the French
50:06 guy I forget the name of his whole
50:11 movement but he has his whole thing with
50:13 these beautiful sort of Norwegian people
50:17 the Norwegians have been earmarked as
50:21 being some of these the Basque the Spain
50:24 Basque race that has a unique brain I
50:28 forgot what exactly what it is about the
50:30 Basque brain that is different but
50:32 that's one of these sort of anomalies
50:34 where we even the scientific community
50:36 goes and their brains are different I
50:38 can't remember what it is obviously
50:40 something extremely subtle but now think
50:43 about all this sort of end-of-days thing
50:46 I had to hear more end of day stuff
50:48 yesterday again once evil just runs
50:52 loose on this planet then everybody
50:54 starts you know who's the subject to the
50:57 pains of you know the ruling class doing
51:02 what they do they just default to the
51:04 end of days and again it's just this
51:07 hope that it's [ __ ] coming I don't
51:11 know but now what would you do if some
51:17 of this information started coming out
51:20 how would it change your daily thing I
51:22 mean you know we all know we have to go
51:24 to work the next day so there's that
51:26 whole thing wouldn't it be an
51:29 interesting time and an interesting era
51:32 where
51:34 you know for all we know these aliens
51:37 are here and then we're like oh my god
51:41 dude you're from beetlejuice yeah why
51:44 did you say something well you know I
51:46 was was to say anything would go back
51:48 home we talked to this eyeball on a
51:50 screen in our living room he tells us
51:53 our commands for the day and we're not
51:55 supposed to but now we're in this era
51:57 everyone's coming out you know once the
51:58 guys from Venus came out with the the
52:02 third eye on their forehead and the
52:04 Martians with the extra arm they said
52:08 well screw it you know everyone's coming
52:09 out we're just gonna come out think
52:12 about the conversations that you could
52:13 have they're all over the place we start
52:16 having summits all around the world
52:18 inviting all these aliens oh and if they
52:22 were to have any communication
52:22 capability with their homeworld
52:25 especially if they're in two dimensional
52:27 ah well now we could start bringing the
52:30 two worlds together then we find out
52:33 whether or not we live in a peaceful
52:34 universe or if we live in a star trekky
52:38 sort of hostile you know conquering
52:42 space thing with the Klingons and the
52:44 Romulans and the Vulcans and etc etc
52:47 hopefully the Borg don't show up part of
52:51 me wonders if this information that's
52:53 just recently come out where again the
52:55 United States Pentagon finally uses the
52:57 acronym UFO it's coming out in the 21st
53:02 century again we've had now thirty years
53:05 of the most unbelievably detailed space
53:07 movies television shows the CG is so
53:11 incredible that if we ever do meet a
53:13 real alien it's going to be pretty
53:14 anticlimactic I would imagine you know
53:18 not to our to our benefit hopefully
53:20 right we don't need a HR Geiger's
53:23 monsters climbing all over our planet
53:24 turning us apart and using us as hosts
53:28 to just state their next you next of kin
53:30 what if this article had released in
53:32 1975 how would that have changed things
53:38 probably would have had more impact a
53:40 little bit I mean it's not really a big
53:43 deal you said UFO okay
53:48 and the thing is is that one thing we
53:50 don't really come to terms with is what
53:53 if you were in charge of this project
53:55 Bluebook
53:57 you know military investigation project
54:00 majestic and you're assigned to
54:03 researching this
54:06 all right well 47 dit happened out of
54:08 thin air if that Roswell crash really
54:10 occurred then they didn't plan it they
54:13 didn't know this thing was coming in as
54:14 far as I know it's never been
54:16 insinuating anything I've ever read or
54:17 heard so now you've got this
54:21 responsibility of filtering everything
54:23 that's coming into the military the Air
54:25 Force whatever it sees are collecting
54:28 the information police departments and
54:30 you've got a bunch of scammers you got a
54:34 bunch of scammers coming in making up
54:36 stories and so now you're sitting there
54:37 in living room after living room
54:39 expending millions of dollars keeping
54:43 everybody employed asking questions as
54:46 all this data comes in you're trying to
54:48 sift whether or not someone's lying to
54:49 you with another there's any evidence of
54:51 it the less teeth the guy has the less
54:54 IQ the guy has you're just gonna
54:56 deprecated their information because
54:59 they're more impressionable you just
55:01 have to it's just human nature now when
55:04 you're head of physics at MIT says he
55:08 saw something or she saw something Dan
55:10 now you're going oh well that's
55:12 interesting this is someone who's highly
55:14 educated perhaps knows a lot about
55:17 aerospace at the same time and we have
55:21 to take this differently so you're
55:22 trying to develop a protocol to process
55:24 you know millions of claims of seeing
55:26 UFOs faked photographs real photographs
55:29 potentially that was super encouraged
55:32 that when I watched a few videos today
55:33 trying to break down this you know the
55:36 the significance of the Pentagon's
55:38 statement that one of the things that
55:41 they did have to acknowledge occurs is
55:44 what I've told you on the show which is
55:45 the ball lightning which comes out of
55:48 the bowels of the plasma earth right so
55:50 you know in rockier areas where there's
55:53 no vegetation it's just stone all the
55:55 way down that this stuff will glob
56:00 together and finally make its way out
56:02 it just can pop out in the desert this I
56:04 used to used to be some photos and
56:07 videos of people in the desert
56:09 filming this occur and you know they
56:13 didn't know what they were looking at
56:14 they just saw these perfect chrome
56:16 spheres flying around and they're like
56:18 oh my god you know this thing's right
56:20 here right in front of me it's real now
56:22 it's not an intelligent life it's just
56:25 plasma you know moving in a really high
56:27 rate of speed and light can't puncture
56:30 it so it reflects and therefore it's
56:32 mirror based the more it spins the more
56:34 saucer-shaped it gets elliptical so even
56:39 if we open the door to this UFO box and
56:44 we start really assessing information we
56:47 have this huge burden on our hands of
56:49 sifting through all the crap and because
56:53 crap is free and there's a bunch of
56:56 people out there that need attention and
56:58 you're gonna have an infinite supply of
57:00 it now of course the other avenue of
57:03 sightings has to do with very mortal man
57:05 things which is when they develop sr-71s
57:09 and be b-2 bombers and flying triangles
57:12 the aurora thing they create all these
57:17 sightings our wright-patterson Air Force
57:18 Base has had some of the most prolific
57:21 and consistent views of weird things
57:26 foreign countries actually see a lot of
57:28 our aircraft but we don't worry about it
57:29 because if you fly a b-2 bomber over
57:31 some tribes in Africa they don't care
57:35 those people have no access to what
57:37 we're doing and they're probably one of
57:38 the only communities that doesn't have
57:40 functional cell phones and cameras
57:43 here's that old rumor that it just
57:47 remains a rumor which is that when
57:49 George Lucas went to Africa to film his
57:52 tan doing shots
57:53 the locals said oh you know you're back
57:56 and we're like why what are you saying
57:58 we're back and the rumor was that they
58:00 said well this is where they filmed the
58:01 moon missions I thought that was cool
58:05 be a smart idea right get way out there
58:08 in the middle of nowhere anybody who
58:11 sees what you're doing they just have
58:12 access to no one so you're just
58:14 you're creating a sort of quarantine
58:16 environment by design it's brilliant I
58:20 personally don't think they worked
58:21 outside like that but then again I
58:24 probably don't have Mission 15 through
58:26 17 memorized in my brain but now if you
58:31 were the ruling class and this kind of
58:33 stuff was actually occurring and you did
58:34 manage to recover ships and you may
58:36 should talk to a few these little dudes
58:38 there might be a control mechanism
58:40 that's in place that is trying to that's
58:42 basically the force that's keeping this
58:44 information from becoming public there
58:47 isn't any concern about religious
58:49 communities imploding or chaos and suing
58:53 like the Orson Welles War of the Worlds
58:55 broadcast and was 1939 or something like
58:57 that what they want is you to understood
59:03 that they are the ones in charge and if
59:05 you're going to get anything from anyone
59:08 it's through them and they will sanction
59:10 out technology education revised history
59:15 and just keep you stupid keep you in the
59:20 dark and feed you [ __ ] right yeah
59:23 I'm gonna mention something here because
59:24 it just occurred to me you know when you
59:28 there's there some of you've heard this
59:31 recording but there's a recording made
59:34 in the mid 90s and it was interviewing
59:38 an intelligence officer who had retired
59:40 and he essentially gave this phone call
59:44 and maybe I have the date wrong as to
59:47 when he recorded this but I thought it
59:48 was portrayed to me in the mid 90s but
59:51 the guy is saying whatever you do do not
59:56 watch television don't listen to the
59:59 radio don't take an idiot any of the
60:01 information that is being presented to
60:04 you as entertainment because it is
60:06 designed to entirely indoctrinate you
60:08 away from reality now what's interesting
60:14 is is that now because of the internet
60:18 and because of crappy television crappy
60:20 movies and again there's great
60:21 television too but they are there are
60:25 more people on this
60:27 on this continent of North America that
60:33 do not watch television than anytime in
60:35 my personal history of life because when
60:39 television starts debuting in the 40s
60:41 here in the United States it was a race
60:43 to get a television to show the the
60:47 neighborhood that you were wealthy
60:48 enough to do such a thing and then you
60:50 had this amazing form of entertainment
60:51 and back in the day it was probably
60:53 pretty cleaning stuff good entertainment
60:56 right I do think it's funny that just as
60:59 a small digression here televisions have
61:02 always been stuck at 60 frames a second
61:04 and we're told that that's what the
61:07 brain uses to animate things in the mind
61:12 but when you ask Hollywood how many
61:15 frames do you need to create motion they
61:17 say 24 and now it's like digitally
61:21 speaking it's like 29.97 or whatever it
61:23 is and of course some folks are now
61:26 pushing for 48 frames a second and some
61:30 people want more net but people are
61:32 starting to get sort of headachy when
61:33 they watch the movies that have high
61:34 frame rates so it has been
61:39 misrepresented to us the 60 frames per
61:41 second was necessary to create motion
61:45 then when you do research on the
61:48 frequencies that put the mind in a state
61:50 of suggestibility 60 frames a second is
61:53 the golden mean of incubating the mind
61:56 into forms of suggestibility now most
62:00 computer monitors today I think are
62:02 around 75 Hertz so I don't know if
62:07 computer monitors have the same
62:08 capability I think that's an interesting
62:10 one but now we have a bunch of people
62:13 not watching till television again we
62:16 watch little little tiny televisions
62:17 called cellphones but now what has been
62:21 sort of the byproduct of recent history
62:26 well in the last 15 years we have the
62:29 great awakening incubating up people are
62:32 waking up now more than ever could it be
62:36 a direct correlation with less ingesting
62:39 of
62:40 Media could we have inadvertently taken
62:44 the advice of this agent simply because
62:47 the product isn't as plentiful I was in
62:53 a meeting last week where we sat down a
62:57 bunch of will some individuals we're
63:00 extremely brilliant we sat down and
63:02 talked about it and one of the guys
63:03 again is this thing I lamented to the
63:05 previous episode here just so well
63:09 researched and things that you and I
63:11 talked about and this guy had the facts
63:14 and I didn't realize it but there has
63:17 been this very conscious realization by
63:20 the cable companies that they are
63:23 creating too many channels that it
63:26 becomes so overwhelming that they turn
63:29 on their TV they push the Guide button
63:32 they see you know thousand two thousand
63:35 channels up there and because 99.9
63:39 percent of its [ __ ] people turn the TV
63:42 off and go you know what I don't think
63:45 I'm gonna continue buying cable I'm
63:48 gonna buy Netflix Hulu HBO I'm just
63:51 gonna on-demand everything that I want
63:52 and when they realize okay they kill the
63:57 the family ritual of watching TV as a
63:59 pastime again sports fans have it bad
64:02 because they're always tracking sports
64:03 and they ingest metric tons of
64:05 commercials and indoctrination
64:08 once you pull out of this ritual meaning
64:12 you're not
64:13 ceremoniously indoctrinating your mind
64:16 you start to wake up you start to think
64:19 critically and sometimes it works
64:21 sometimes you have the ability thing
64:23 critical and critical subjects come up
64:25 and so you go down a rabbit hole instead
64:27 of just sitting there going oh my god oh
64:29 my god oh my god I think critical but
64:30 nothing's coming up you know but there's
64:33 because of Game of Thrones which isn't
64:36 even cable I've been able to see
64:39 something that I hadn't seen before and
64:44 it goes something like this I have you
64:49 know my friends on social media I've got
64:51 three different accounts I use ones that
64:53 old retired and
64:54 was my public account ones that kind of
64:56 used to talk to the channel for deep
64:58 thoughts and you know I don't talk to
65:01 anybody really on these platforms
65:02 besides you guys but I noticed in my
65:07 home feed two things that go
65:10 hand-in-hand with this whole thing and
65:13 the reason why mentioning this is just
65:14 the platform for us to believe anything
65:17 huge like UFOs
65:21 my friends who worshiped now that it's
65:25 over we can say it in the past tense
65:27 until the spin-off show up but my folks
65:29 that constantly worship these television
65:31 shows like Game of Thrones which for me
65:34 is one of the slowest moving dramas I've
65:36 ever watched in my life they are also
65:39 the ones consistently posting propaganda
65:42 as fact in their home feeds so here they
65:48 are worshipping televisions and they
65:50 believe all the official stories they
65:52 believe the left extremists they think
65:55 these people like Cortes are heroes to
65:57 society and Bernie Sanders they haven't
66:01 turned the TV off yet enough to see
66:06 what's right in front of their face
66:08 could it be as simple as that that you
66:12 can't see things until you turn off this
66:14 indoctrination machine again I always
66:18 refer people back to the I think it's a
66:20 1979 movie called lookers a friend of
66:24 mine did the special effects on that
66:25 movie it's sort of a science fiction
66:28 movie but they talked about embedding in
66:31 the framerate of your TV this very
66:34 specific signal that did a pause that
66:38 puts you in paralysis so soon as you're
66:40 watching the show and it goes to
66:42 commercial they pump you for a split
66:44 second with this frequency and then
66:46 you're stunned looking at the TV while
66:48 the commercials are rolling over your
66:49 brain or whatever else is out there I
66:52 mean that movie was so ahead of its time
66:54 it predicted CG movie a CG commercials
66:57 for all the characters and the
66:58 commercials are all CG that'll be the
67:00 case in 20 years for sure and they did
67:03 this volleyball game on the beach and
67:05 then they overlaid it obviously in the
67:07 mood
67:07 it's live-action but they're suggesting
67:09 that it's all being computer-generated
67:11 and it's like wow that movie was 50 60
67:14 years ahead of its time I personally
67:18 don't see anything advancing in the UFO
67:20 community at all if anything dr. Steven
67:24 Greer if he's on the up and up and his
67:26 people on the up and up which you know
67:30 project disclosure has dozens and dozens
67:33 of supposed at eyewitness interviews
67:37 well their interviews with people about
67:38 AI witnessing certain events in history
67:43 95% of those interviews are bunk in my
67:48 opinion because the guy's telling the
67:50 stories either weren't there
67:51 but they pretend like they were there
67:52 because it gives them a sense of
67:55 importance but a lot of times they'll be
67:58 if you do the body language thing over
68:01 these interviews you see guys talking
68:03 and they seem to be really relaxed until
68:05 they start saying crossing the line into
68:09 the the unbelievable when they start
68:11 talking about aliens or spaceships
68:13 they're there they're touching their
68:15 nose or their ear and they have these
68:17 little nervous tics that start to happen
68:18 once they crossed over into the
68:20 conversation and so you're like oh I see
68:24 this is where you're nervous because
68:26 you're bullshitting the camera but there
68:29 are a couple I've mentioned in previous
68:31 episodes there's a couple in there that
68:33 look bona fide real these guys don't
68:38 don't give any indications of being
68:42 nervous with what they're saying they
68:44 have all the details that anyone asks
68:46 them and they have atypical stories
68:49 which is nice you're like okay you're
68:52 not telling me the same old story that
68:53 everyone else tells me as if it's
68:55 brand-new and of course there's always
68:58 the option that we don't like to take
69:00 and again I'm probably going to be
69:02 incapable of ever taking this this track
69:06 which is the old story of this is not
69:12 this is all BS this never happened
69:16 Roswell was a weather balloon my buddy's
69:18 father didn't see what he saw
69:21 so he made up this big story for his kid
69:23 on his deathbed I mean I think that we
69:26 the deathbed thing has probably been
69:31 abused by Liars at times but the
69:35 deathbed situation which is never truly
69:38 just the moment of dying because my
69:40 friend's father didn't die after he said
69:42 the story died later but he was in the
69:45 hospital he's in a sort of a hospice
69:46 care situation we have heard people
69:51 change paradigms at the end of their
69:54 lives
69:54 probably more consistently than any
69:56 other time in their life - a traumatic
69:59 situation you know having followed Steve
70:03 Jobs for years and sort of listened to
70:06 every word the guy ever spoke on camera
70:09 you know even though I had communication
70:11 with the guy we didn't you didn't come
70:14 back with a giant paragraph of you know
70:16 counter philosophy or anything but I
70:18 think he was pretty upfront about not
70:20 believing in anything in the afterlife
70:21 and really struggling with any belief of
70:24 God and the nice thing about that kind
70:28 of guy saying that kind of thing is that
70:29 you can at least trust what he's saying
70:31 he really is being genuine with you
70:33 about his beliefs so love it or hate it
70:36 or agree or disagree he's being honest
70:39 with you what a percent but towards in
70:43 of his life many people said that he
70:47 gained an open mind with an afterlife
70:50 almost as if he had loosened up his own
70:53 human constraints and just let the
70:56 universe kind of flow through him and it
70:58 starts to seem like oh yeah something
71:01 else is gonna happen here something else
71:02 is happening here and his last words are
71:05 supposedly
71:05 oh my like three times before he passed
71:10 as if he was seeing the other side and
71:13 for him I I would assume that it took a
71:18 lot to impress this kind of guy
71:22 this seemed like an epiphany at the end
71:25 and I think that any of you who have
71:28 stories some of you have been there when
71:29 your relatives have passed man all the
71:32 gloves come off
71:34 the persona vanishes as Freud would
71:38 label it your pretend character that you
71:41 have pretended to be your whole life
71:43 perhaps the one you wanted to be your
71:46 character which is your true self as
71:49 Freud puts it I love the way he breaks
71:51 it down it's an arbitrary designation of
71:54 various emotions but we all know we have
71:56 the the subconscious self that we're not
72:00 quite sure what's all in there
72:01 we have our character layer which is
72:03 what we sort of either deny or accept
72:07 about ourselves and then we have our
72:09 persona which is that wishful layer and
72:12 sometimes it's the layer that needs to
72:14 exist to simply communicate with society
72:17 if you find yourself fairly different
72:18 than them you know if your real raw like
72:21 a Steve Jobs I think that guy lived more
72:24 in the character form when he's with
72:27 individuals and probably almost I don't
72:31 know I know what the percentage was of
72:32 his persona in public but the guy he had
72:37 reasons to boast about himself and he
72:39 really didn't do it he could have but
72:43 their interviews with guys in hotels
72:45 with oxygen tanks a couple old farts
72:48 that I mean that respectively but they
72:52 talk about all kinds of outrageous stuff
72:54 being at area 51 with grades just
72:58 walking around it's not not a ton of
73:01 them but a couple of them talking to
73:02 commanders and having conversations and
73:04 so you're kind of going really you know
73:10 it's hard to imagine that a being from
73:15 another planets entire engagement plan
73:18 is to talk to the perceived power forces
73:23 exclusively on a particular planet right
73:25 you look down you start seeing earth
73:27 like oh this is awesome look at these
73:29 people they've created all kinds of cool
73:30 stuff now let's start talking to them
73:33 and so you either have the I'm only
73:36 going to talk to military people
73:38 potentially kings and queens and
73:42 presidents and all this other stuff or
73:44 you're going to land in you know a
73:47 baseball field and talk to people I wish
73:51 there was more I wish there was more to
73:54 talk about and again with all of the
73:58 recording devices out there is just
74:01 phenomenal how the sightings have just
74:03 disappeared I mean we get the ones that
74:06 are very anecdotal you know there's some
74:10 white lights over a particular city or
74:12 something like that but we're not no one
74:14 has really captured any decent
74:15 convincing footage of anything flying
74:18 around you know the last one that we saw
74:22 was this sort of winged thing flying
74:24 over wright-patterson Air Force Base and
74:26 bizarre thing and it was filmed by the
74:30 wife and not the husband so like the
74:32 husband has his phone and so he's not
74:35 running his camera she's got the
74:36 exclusive shot on this whole thing he's
74:38 like oh my god look at that you know
74:39 it's like supposedly someone took a 35
74:42 millimeter shot a digital camera shot or
74:44 whatever at a different location but
74:46 where's their cell phone where's their
74:47 movie every camera that exists that
74:49 doesn't have film in it usually has a
74:52 movie feature so you just reach up on
74:53 the top flip the knob you go to movie
74:55 feature BAM II hit it it zooms in a
74:57 little bit you start taking a movie so
75:01 you know I think that the only thing
75:03 that's occurred is that people have
75:04 become answer you know acquainted with
75:08 you know video composite software we
75:12 lost that that physicist I forgot his
75:16 Stanton dr. Stanton god bless that man I
75:20 think he was super cool man I always
75:24 if I were to because I don't do any my I
75:29 don't have cable on my TV anymore
75:31 haven't had it for years but anytime I
75:34 would tune into one of those shows that
75:36 was sort of a UFO G show I might skip it
75:39 until I saw him in it and I would always
75:42 continue watching to see his little
75:44 tidbits because he always came in it
75:45 from a real practical standpoint you
75:49 know my respect for him as high as it
75:51 goes in that community because I feel
75:52 like whatever he was saying it was very
75:55 genuine and he said you know I believe I
75:59 got this correct he said he never saw
76:01 anything personally but he just used his
76:04 physics degree and his logic to parse
76:07 through all the sightings that people
76:09 had claimed and you know he was able to
76:11 filter out the majority as hoaxes or
76:13 misunderstandings but there were still a
76:15 ton left and the only thing that saddens
76:19 me about his passing because we all pass
76:23 at some point is that he didn't get to
76:25 see the the landing he didn't get to see
76:30 them come down so hopefully wherever he
76:31 is he's got all the information he ever
76:33 wanted but I think he would have been a
76:35 great asset to the world had he been
76:39 alive when their arrival a curse if that
76:41 ever does occur if whatever has any
76:44 validity to occur and you know it's
76:47 funny I'll just kind of say this in
76:49 closing a lot of those zoology shows you
76:51 know and and once I grew up and started
76:53 realizing how shows are made and how
76:56 producers and directors work really hard
76:58 to validate stories to give their shows
77:00 that a little bit of a bump which means
77:03 lie okay there's been a countless shows
77:08 over the last probably three decades
77:11 where they'll interview these guys and
77:14 they'll bring out all the information
77:16 some of it very convincing and usually
77:20 shows have a little bit of criticism for
77:22 false sightings and that sort of thing
77:26 but they would ask these guys they'd say
77:28 hey do you think this is ever going to
77:29 occur and these guys would say yeah I do
77:34 I think it's going to occur soon
77:37 and I love that and I remember at the
77:41 end that you kind of gives you that
77:43 hopeful thing it's that whole poster I
77:44 just mentioned you know I want to
77:45 believe yeah of course it's the alien
77:49 promise isn't it come down and save us
77:51 from this tyranny from this craziness
77:54 you know the Babylonians kept writing
77:57 about someone coming down every three to
77:59 five hundred years resetting society
78:01 once it got too corrupted in sight Jesus
78:03 where are you guys today but the true
78:06 formula is probably this is all up to us
78:08 we need to mature ourselves I even
78:12 subscribe to a couple I recently
78:14 unsubscribe but I subscribed for a while
78:16 there for about two years to a couple
78:18 sites that were sort of aggregate
78:20 websites to pull together every UFO
78:23 sighting in the world and Coast Coast AM
78:26 does a little bit of this but they're
78:29 selling a product you know I understand
78:32 and quite frankly you probably want to
78:34 adjust at all if you need to see the
78:35 hoaxes you can keep your tabs on how
78:37 that's maturing I do think today that
78:41 military vehicles being observed is
78:43 probably a fair amount of the the claims
78:46 at this point and I you know you know
78:48 think about someone seeing something
78:50 like that depends on their intelligence
78:52 and their knowledge of covert aircraft
78:55 as to whether or not they'll just simply
78:57 go there's that there's that ship that
78:59 we've been making the the flying
79:01 triangle that goes you know Mach 13 or
79:03 something like that what I also find
79:06 interesting is that a bunch of magazines
79:08 like popular science would routinely
79:11 talk about supersonic aircraft in the
79:13 80s and 90s
79:15 if the sr-71 started flying around was
79:19 1963 but they didn't admit it existed
79:21 until 89 well it's like a little under
79:24 two decades it gets to fly around
79:26 they're almost sorry almost three
79:28 decades it gets to fly around before
79:31 anyone knows the thing exists and then I
79:34 have friends of mine there in Hollywood
79:35 that are at higher levels that have
79:39 people come up to them and tell them you
79:42 know big stories about military
79:45 technology that is off the hook
79:48 is you know anti-gravity has been in our
79:50 back pocket for 40 years that this that
79:55 any other thing and then you look at
79:56 these horrible space programs and the
79:58 lack of photographs from a space of
80:00 Earth without being a composite and
80:02 you're like how can I believe both sides
80:05 of the conversation you have all this
80:08 technology but you can't take a picture
80:10 of Earth from space I mean let me throw
80:15 this at you guys imagine that they have
80:17 lied so much about the shape of the
80:18 earth it doesn't have to be a flat disk
80:21 or anything but it could be more of an
80:22 oval
80:23 you know elliptical thing and the
80:28 problem is is that they fake so many
80:29 shots of Earth from space through the
80:32 Apollo programs and other programs that
80:34 now they got a problem they've got if
80:36 they show you a real picture of Earth
80:38 it's going to be so different it's gonna
80:40 have the Peter projection map
80:41 proportions to the continents for one
80:43 thing and now they're kind of stuck
80:46 behind a lie they can't say anything so
80:49 anyway it's an intriguing subject it is
80:52 sadly underfunded and under fueled I
80:57 think we're living in the age of the
81:00 cellphone killing the sightings the
81:02 printing press killed the gods you know
81:04 soon as the printing press came around
81:06 what new saviors did we ever have no
81:10 there's just you follow a man who's a
81:12 man man and you just follow his
81:14 indoctrination to wipe out the rest of
81:16 the world it's not like him or you
81:18 rehash the old ones and you say oh no I
81:21 dug up some gold plates that have the
81:24 real deal about this old religion and
81:27 that kind of thing it would be awesome
81:29 to see a big giant spaceship like
81:32 district 9 hovering over Los Angeles or
81:35 New York or Paris Shanghai Moscow how
81:42 awesome would that be everyone shows up
81:43 in one day one one eight one group shows
81:46 up in one day I do not have any faith
81:50 that this will happen in my lifetime if
81:52 it's true but it will be a hell of a
81:56 thing if we pass over and we get that
81:58 knowledge of the universe
82:00 just tell you know blown our minds will
82:04 be our souls will be like whoa Wow then
82:07 you go oh yeah I used to know that
82:08 before I was a human being let me know
82:11 what you think in the comments you know
82:13 have you seen anything that makes you
82:15 believe that this stuff is utterly real
82:17 have you done your research on Roswell
82:19 I was actually fairly shocked at the
82:21 Roswell episode just I mean he got got a
82:24 fair amount of views but for me if you
82:28 went down the path I went down I don't
82:30 see how you can be anything but
82:36 partially convinced this really could
82:38 have taken place and again you don't
82:41 have to tell anybody else to believe
82:42 yourself some people lie about not
82:46 believing in things because they're like
82:48 all right now of course I don't believe
82:49 in that and inside they're like I so
82:51 believe in that you know so give me your
82:54 comments love to hear it if you have
82:57 them into deep thoughts radio please go
82:58 I'm gonna give a short bumper tonight
83:00 it's where you can go audio-video lock
83:02 Facebook group Twitter page patreon page
83:05 us ease in 1 remastered that's all I got
83:09 for you today take care of yourself and
83:11 someone else I don't see on the next
