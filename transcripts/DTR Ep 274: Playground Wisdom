00:00 [Music]
00:35 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and
00:37 welcome back to deep thoughts today I'm
00:41 gonna talk about the playground and I
00:44 love titles like these cuz your guys are
00:46 like alright one of the things that
00:53 drives these episodes as the folks that
00:57 have seen dozens and dozens of these
00:59 already know as I'm always data mining
01:03 the brain trying to find out what are we
01:06 thinking about on a daily basis over and
01:08 over and over again as a community that
01:13 we don't acknowledge we don't talk about
01:14 it we haven't even realized we do it but
01:16 we do it every single day maybe we do it
01:17 a thousand times a day maybe we do it a
01:19 couple times a day my entire life as I
01:24 deal with people and have dealt with
01:26 people I should say invariably within a
01:31 few minutes of judging their character I
01:34 am comparing them to someone in the
01:36 playground one of the many playgrounds I
01:39 was on as a child you either have your
01:43 totally cool people I'm a guy so for me
01:48 it's the cool dude he looks pretty good
01:51 gets pretty good genetics on him he's
01:53 taking care of his his body he's a nice
01:56 dude he could be really arrogant cuz
01:58 he's so handsome and so smart but he
02:00 isn't
02:02 and then there's get your nerdy girl you
02:07 got your glamour girl you got your
02:09 glamour arrogant girl you got the girl
02:10 that's going to be arrogant but hasn't
02:13 yet you got the guys that when you play
02:16 soccer even though you're only supposed
02:18 to use your feet we're punching each
02:20 other in the head up above and there's
02:23 respect at the end of the game so you
02:27 got some good licks in there oh yeah you
02:28 totally did then I guess there's the
02:32 bully as well we're not gonna over
02:36 emphasize on the bully just so you know
02:38 this isn't about you know
02:41 headline news but you also have your
02:45 ball baby he's a guy he's a boy
02:50 technically which are all boys on the
02:52 playground you know and there's this
02:54 relative sort of envelope which we're
02:58 gonna get into as to how you perceive
03:00 the whole thing but you got the kid
03:02 who's not injured he's upset he's not
03:04 getting his way and he just wails like a
03:08 little [ __ ] constantly then you got the
03:12 tongue tom boy the girl that could knock
03:16 every guy out she's hot as hell doesn't
03:20 know it doesn't care never will care
03:24 I've cut one of these in my family so
03:27 this episode is to say okay for those of
03:30 you who are real good judge of character
03:31 I want to ask you personally in the
03:34 comments do you think of the playground
03:37 like I do cuz I do I went to seven
03:41 different schools before I graduated
03:42 high school now in America you typically
03:45 go to three and in preschool whatever
03:49 but you go through you know kindergarten
03:52 through sixth when I was a kid 79 in
03:55 middle school which we called junior
03:56 high and high school was 10 11 12 so I'm
04:00 supposed to go to three I don't wait the
04:02 four extra ones because I moved around a
04:04 lot in moving around you have different
04:08 playgrounds different kids different
04:09 cultures you eventually meet different
04:12 races
04:12 if you move far enough away which I was
04:14 fortunate enough to do
04:15 the playground is a very interesting
04:17 place because it has an innocence that
04:19 we all lose right
04:21 such a shame such a shame a lot of you
04:26 like me will have the memory of a bunch
04:29 of guys that got along in middle school
04:33 I mean slinging your arms around the
04:36 guys man you just all hang out together
04:38 talk to the girls they got their arms
04:40 around the girls and we're all playing
04:41 out who's gonna hook up with who later
04:43 on and go steady
04:44 who's gonna kiss while everyone else
04:46 watches and then later on you're like oh
04:51 yeah that guy [ __ ] until he got into
04:53 math blew his brains out that guy went
04:56 into the military
04:57 totally awesome maybe you know one guy
05:01 goes goes in he's obnoxious one guy
05:03 comes out he's great
05:04 one guy who totally nailed it dated the
05:08 right girl had a great family he's got
05:10 five kids happiest could be sits on a
05:13 porch fishes then you have the executive
05:17 who comes to the reunion with you know
05:20 five electronic devices that he
05:22 constantly rotates through plus his
05:23 little jaw to thing that he's using his
05:26 Bluetooth and just making sure everyone
05:27 knows that he's got a cell phone you
05:29 know I think it's really funny and I
05:31 think we all go through this I'm just
05:33 gonna segue to a little thing real quick
05:38 there are these people that get
05:42 technology for the very first time and
05:44 they're so blown away by their
05:46 accomplishment to be able to afford such
05:48 a thing and understand how it's used
05:50 that they in public will bring it out
05:52 make a phone call talk you talk to
05:54 someone try to talk a little loud so
05:56 that they can try to impress everyone
05:59 with how important they are well I think
06:01 we should cope with that eight million
06:02 dollar deal I mean I don't know about
06:04 you you know the two million dollar idea
06:06 wasn't big enough you know by the way
06:08 I'm gonna have to be back by Sunday
06:09 because my car's coming out of the shop
06:11 you know my BMW
06:13 you know face value was like something
06:16 obnoxious human beings in the end
06:20 they're really just little kids from the
06:21 playground
06:23 they got a new toy or a bunch of new
06:26 toys and they just want to show it to
06:28 you
06:28 they just want to say hey I'm not a
06:31 complete loser
06:32 I can maintain a job that gives me an
06:35 income to a point that I can actually
06:37 afford fun things so the playground
06:40 theory is gonna go for a character
06:42 judgment but I think it's going to also
06:43 kind of map up to every single one of us
06:47 every single day and there was a great
06:50 Twilight Zone episode called kick the
06:52 can I can't remember if rod serling
06:55 personally wrote it it's one of the most
06:58 brilliant episodes ever made which is by
07:01 Steven Spielberg when they did the
07:04 Twilight Zone movie in the mid 80s he
07:07 selected he select that episode for
07:10 himself I believe but the episode is
07:13 about a bunch of people and an assisted
07:15 living facility you know they're still
07:19 up and about they can still mess around
07:20 and totally take care of themselves but
07:23 they're living in a big home playing
07:26 puzzles and having fun and through the
07:30 mysteries of The Twilight Zone a bunch
07:34 of them who are still fun-loving people
07:37 and they're in their 70s and 80s at
07:41 night they turn into children and they
07:42 go out and play kick-the-can
07:44 but one grumpy old bastard refuses to
07:51 stay young inside he lets himself die
07:56 inside before he dies outside and he
08:03 can't do it he doesn't want to do it
08:06 when he's told that he could do it he
08:08 refuses it and that sucks by the time
08:14 it's all over he realizes the errors of
08:18 his way and he wants to join them
08:21 because all of them by the end of this
08:24 episode it's gonna spoil this for you he
08:27 hasn't seen a series from the early 60s
08:29 and I think it's not my fault
08:32 all of the old people that were
08:35 continually pushing this guy pushing
08:37 this guy come on come on let's do it
08:39 they run off and stay young and they
08:43 restart as children and they just
08:45 disappear into the world with all the
08:47 knowledge of being 60 70 80 years old
08:50 and so they're gonna start a life life
08:53 anew and some of them you know most
08:55 people have couples so everyone's got
08:57 their spouse and they're just like
08:58 they're freakin ten through eight
09:00 through ten years old maybe twelve at
09:02 the tops and he realizes he blew it he
09:06 runs outside he's playing kick-the-can
09:09 tile by herself in his 70s and the
09:14 orderlies that take care of the home are
09:16 like where is everybody
09:18 he's just out there by himself
09:20 essentially crying that he didn't get
09:24 his [ __ ] together one of the more
09:26 interesting parts of the Bible are all
09:30 the passages that Christ gives about
09:32 staying young on the inside to never
09:36 lose the innocence and beauty of being a
09:38 child and of course as an adult where we
09:43 rush in with our judgment when we go
09:45 yeah kid but that's [ __ ] you got to
09:47 take care of bills and life will eat you
09:49 up yeah you're right you're right one of
09:52 my good friends and former bosses posted
09:55 a post on Facebook about spanking
10:00 children and I believe the article I was
10:03 just moving very quickly I believe the
10:04 article was about how you know spanking
10:06 is bad I'm pretty sure I got the count
10:09 right my dad spanked me six times he's a
10:12 big dude and he was always like a UPS
10:15 guy or a truck driver something so
10:17 military so he didn't need a belt he
10:20 didn't need anything he just had a
10:22 big-ass hand and you know he was very
10:26 rare it happened again I've talked about
10:29 twice in one of their previous episodes
10:31 where he kind of fouled it up but
10:33 whatever bigger parent today I know how
10:37 fast you could screw things up but
10:38 nothing you know again he wasn't crazy
10:41 abusive you know
10:42 I didn't bleed but I have to say I'm
10:46 very proud of the fact that I got
10:48 spanked when I was a little bastard
10:50 because boy did that change my mental
10:53 chemistry about what's allowed and
10:55 what's not allowed and in this I just
10:59 posted a little reply and I said you
11:00 know I'm very proud of the fact that I
11:01 got spanked cuz I'm gonna spank six
11:03 times I'm pretty sure and life spanks a
11:08 lot harder doesn't it now I've got very
11:13 close friends of mine that were beaten
11:14 by their parents beaten by their fathers
11:16 and I'm not talking about that
11:18 you know alcoholic parents it's a tough
11:22 one that is not what we're talking about
11:24 I think I speak my daughter twice so all
11:27 she ever needed twice were I think it
11:30 may have caused her a little sting you
11:34 know I always would kind of pop her
11:36 diaper every once in a while and I talk
11:38 about with that my parenting episode
11:39 that when you pop a diaper the fun thing
11:41 is didn't hurt him at all it's just a
11:45 little disapproval then you give them a
11:46 big hug you know you tell them what they
11:48 did wrong and you give a big hug and you
11:49 just kind of like saying we don't do
11:51 that you know you went you went over the
11:54 edge of caution like I said don't don't
11:57 don't don't don't don't
11:58 and then you know pop wake up cuz you're
12:02 gonna hurt yourself I'm here to protect
12:03 you but this playground thing has been
12:06 on my mind my whole life like as I meet
12:08 people in boardrooms as I meet people in
12:11 restaurants or whatever I mapped them to
12:13 people that I knew in grade school now I
12:19 honestly that I guess I should clarify
12:22 the playground I'm talking about the
12:25 recess you know that time you have
12:28 between classes obviously there are no
12:33 more recesses in America after seventh
12:35 grade now middle school in America has
12:38 been adjusted since the 6th graders go
12:39 into middle school which I actually
12:40 totally agree with that I do not agree
12:43 with 9th graders going into high school
12:44 because you're just simply too
12:46 physically small in ninth grade to be
12:48 hanging out with seniors because there's
12:50 a lot of courses especially physical IDI
12:53 physical education where you might play
12:56 dodgeball with some guy benching 280
12:59 pounds and you barely weigh a hundred
13:02 and ten I was much bigger for my age
13:05 like I almost got to this size at 14 so
13:08 I was never having a gigantic problem
13:12 but I saw some scrawny dudes getting
13:14 [ __ ] destroyed in school and that had
13:17 to have destroyed who they were as like
13:19 a 50-50 chance probably less than a
13:21 50-50 chance that they were to bounce
13:22 out of being severely bruised and
13:27 destroyed by a [ __ ] volleyball coming
13:29 out of it you know 95 miles an hour
13:32 I'm just saying volleyball in dodgeball
13:34 because we used all the balls writing
13:36 that volleyball one man it was it should
13:39 have never been allowed in dodgeball
13:41 because the red ones you know they're
13:43 kind of smooshy
13:44 but it evolved all is leather and it
13:48 will leave a mark right the other thing
13:51 I want to just stress about this
13:54 playground thing is that there's a war
13:58 on for your children's brains going on
14:01 right now the globalists the Liberals a
14:04 lot of Democrats hate to even mention a
14:08 political party I hate to do it there
14:10 are liberals and there are Democrats and
14:11 they're two different things
14:12 okay but people get lured into this
14:15 [ __ ] you're essentially not supposed
14:19 to raise your child but you're supposed
14:20 to invade their body with a bunch of
14:23 vaccines and medicine
14:26 aren't you these kids have no choice and
14:28 you're sticking them with stuff that
14:29 they will biologically carry until the
14:32 day they die it's nuts but they won't
14:37 infect your kids brains early make them
14:40 question everything about who they are
14:42 like he wants your kid to be existential
14:44 about their gender before they have a
14:45 chance to just live just be it's almost
14:51 as if just coming from the Midwest that
14:55 was born in Germany came here when I was
14:57 about three and a half I guess or two
14:59 and a half or some [ __ ] I can't
15:00 remember
15:00 and I definitely bring three in America
15:05 but I lived in this tiny beautiful town
15:09 Chanute Kansas chha chha and ute Kansas
15:13 okay it's where Google's Google Maps was
15:17 a big plaque on the bottom on the center
15:20 of Main Street in Lincoln I was
15:22 beautifully quarantined into this world
15:24 with both my grandparents living in the
15:27 same town like literally like two blocks
15:29 from each other eventually my aunt's and
15:32 my uncles all lived there from both
15:35 sides of the family I lived in town at
15:38 several different locations I lived out
15:40 of town in one location so I got the
15:43 country side of it I got the city side
15:44 of it all at once great schools great
15:47 teachers but I only got to go there and
15:50 tell us about eight years old something
15:56 about three to eight the nice thing is
15:59 that's where my mind started to really
16:01 form
16:01 I had comfort I had a town that my brain
16:05 could conceive of a Township a six mile
16:08 square everything was meat and potatoes
16:12 boys and girls
16:13 husband and wife there were none there
16:17 were none of these liberal agendas
16:18 coming in from Europe destroying my
16:21 perception of the world making me
16:23 question a bunch of things about myself
16:24 and for the most part
16:28 the first two-thirds of my playground
16:30 era was completed in that little town
16:33 now the only playground in that town
16:35 that I really remember is when I moved
16:37 out to the country I went to this school
16:38 called Fairfield little dinky building I
16:42 mean if you took a natural like an
16:44 average home I mean I bet this the
16:46 school must have been 5,000 square feet
16:49 the backyard was like a giant backyard
16:53 like three or four large backyards put
16:58 together and there wasn't really a hell
17:01 of a lot you could do I think there was
17:02 a swing set there was maybe a jungle jam
17:04 or some [ __ ] like that but that is there
17:08 are so many memories from that little
17:10 tiny place I went from half a first
17:14 grade to all second grade than half a
17:17 third grade out there this is where I
17:19 had my motorcycle
17:20 that's where I just roamed the country
17:21 at eight years old parents just said go
17:24 take it you know see it come back before
17:25 dinner
17:26 so I had the freedom and autonomy and
17:29 the trust from my parents I could do
17:32 anything I wanted
17:33 constantly sir I discovered girls way
17:40 further than I should have at 7 years
17:42 old but I remember the dynamics that I
17:46 remember from this playground and I'm
17:48 hoping that while I'm talking you guys
17:50 are having your own recollections of
17:52 your playgrounds and anything
17:53 significant that you learned in a
17:55 playground that changed your life it
17:58 helped you perhaps even one that damaged
18:02 you put it in the comments section for
18:06 me so we can compare notes because I
18:10 would like to further this theory after
18:12 this episode but I probably won't make
18:14 an episode two of playground right this
18:17 is where I first like I had that the
18:19 girl that I actually really got to know
18:22 was my neighbor and the bizarre thing
18:26 was I don't remember her going to school
18:27 with me and she was about just about a
18:32 year younger than me but when I went to
18:35 school at this particular school there
18:37 was girls all the way up to sixth grade
18:38 and I just remember a couple like one
18:41 really
18:42 pretty girl it was very proper she had
18:46 brothers way older than us and so there
18:48 was nothing that we could do to shake
18:50 her up and she was older than us and
18:51 bigger than us remember because in grade
18:53 school you know it you could see how
18:55 what grade someone's in just by
18:58 measuring how tall they are it's a
19:00 different world it's a very interesting
19:02 class structure due to age and remember
19:07 looking at this girl I don't even know
19:09 who she was and just thinking wow she's
19:12 really pretty but she's no nonsense go I
19:15 could tell she was a farm girl because
19:16 we're all living out in the country and
19:18 then there was the ball baby this kid
19:22 because everyone else was just average
19:23 and normal just like me it was this kid
19:26 that no matter what happened to this kid
19:28 he would fall down on the ground and cry
19:30 and he would cry so profusely that you
19:35 know he some of these kids at lied like
19:36 autumn so ivan milk in his mouth you
19:39 know it's like we cried you just like
19:40 jeez dude shut your mouth man gross and
19:45 I remember just staring at this kid as a
19:47 child myself and just looking I'm going
19:50 what the [ __ ] is your problem right it
19:53 was in my house with my dad if you cried
19:55 my dad would mock cry right in front of
19:58 you so if you're like crying he and he
20:00 would do it if you protest cry not if
20:02 you're hurt cry if you're just making it
20:04 up you're just being a pain in the ass
20:05 he just start blubbering himself
20:07 six-foot-three guy starting to just make
20:11 fun of you basically at first I hated it
20:14 but he just showed me how ridiculous I
20:19 looked because a child protest crying
20:21 looks ridiculous don't they and it just
20:24 wiped it out of me was strange my mom
20:26 hated it when I was always yelling at
20:27 him stop that it's not that and for a
20:30 boy it works
20:33 at least worked for me I was pretty
20:37 pretty resilient little kid but I mean I
20:40 know I guess some kids cowered down it's
20:41 really strange not many
20:45 so that that kid who was sort of the
20:49 ball baby
20:50 obviously he grew up he doesn't sit
20:52 around crying today not exactly sure
20:54 where he is I don't remember him coming
20:56 to any of our reunions so go figure
21:01 again nine times out of ten the people
21:03 who don't go back to reunions are
21:05 projecting their own issues oh I hated
21:09 everybody at school well maybe you were
21:11 the [ __ ] right maybe what you need to
21:14 do is to go so you can cleanse yourself
21:17 of all your psychoses when you were a
21:19 little kid just maybe some people are
21:23 persecuted I am very good friends with
21:26 many of them from my high school who are
21:28 persecuted but they're very tough to
21:30 find right because they disappear at
21:33 that school I also had to take the bus
21:36 home and I was a latchkey kid you know
21:39 go inside the house
21:40 turn around near the garage go get this
21:42 key that's in the middle of like nowhere
21:45 in the garage unlock the door put it
21:46 back on side eat and watch Tom and Jerry
21:49 until the parents get home chill out
21:52 oddly enough I couldn't take my
21:54 motorcycle out to the middle of the
21:56 wilderness unless my parents were home
21:58 which makes no sense because I would
22:00 crash and burn like five miles away if
22:01 that was the case it wouldn't matter but
22:05 during one of the bus rides home I
22:07 learned another lesson for some [ __ ]
22:10 reason the bus driver picked up this
22:12 high school kid and we didn't have a
22:16 high school like some of this some of
22:19 the farm towns have like Fredonia this
22:22 town called Fredonia they have K through
22:24 12 all in one kind of facility I always
22:29 wanted to know what that looked like but
22:30 they pick up this absolute degenerate on
22:34 this bus and he is with a bunch of
22:38 little kids and he is unable to kind of
22:41 figure out he's with a bunch of little
22:42 kids and everyone's making fun of the
22:47 guy for something and I can't remember
22:49 what it was and I jumped on the
22:52 bandwagon at the last second
22:53 and I we were saying something to him
22:56 he had a full beard today would it look
22:59 like
23:00 just an average homeless white guy but
23:03 he comes over to me and the bus and no
23:06 one sitting next to me and he puts his
23:09 hand on the top of my head and he tries
23:13 to crush my neck he literally in any
23:17 other police situation this would be
23:20 breaking a child's neck and he pushed
23:24 and he turned and my neck went pop and I
23:28 felt weird for dates and the bus driver
23:32 pulled over immediately
23:35 grabbed this guy and threw him off the
23:37 bus
23:37 had I been smarter I would have told my
23:41 parents what happened so I could get
23:42 checked out but what was very
23:45 interesting about that was that I'd
23:46 never had anyone really sort of put
23:49 their hands on me in any other way than
23:50 a spanking or a spankings just so at
23:55 that point I learned something because I
23:57 had an adult level character attacked me
24:01 and really and cracked the [ __ ] on my
24:05 neck I mean it it was like it was bad I
24:07 could still feel to this day like I can
24:09 just hear the crack in my head and and
24:11 kind of that weird tingling sensation
24:13 when your nerves kind of even make your
24:15 nose for like you went underwater simply
24:17 because you've been injured so bad weird
24:21 but you start to learn okay it's people
24:24 bigger than you better watch your mouth
24:27 shouldn't have said anything that's what
24:28 I learned he didn't deserve to have that
24:32 said to him I'm just being a dick I'm
24:34 just jumping on the bandwagon and I paid
24:36 the consequence for it right son this
24:39 little kid and I have this motorcycle
24:40 and I lived on a circle out in the
24:44 country for those of you who lived on
24:45 circles and countries you know exactly
24:46 what they are but just imagine sort of a
24:48 round rectangle with a bunch of houses
24:50 on the inside I had a bunch of houses on
24:52 the outside
24:53 it's a gravel road and there must have
24:57 been like eight kids combined that lived
25:00 out there about my age or older and
25:04 there was a very interesting thing that
25:06 I learned
25:09 with this motorcycle Ford Eve you've
25:12 seen the movie zeitgeist actually went
25:16 down to the Egyptian theater in
25:17 Hollywood and saw it like probably the
25:19 tenth time in person and what the old
25:21 man was at the end of the film but this
25:23 film is divided into four pieces and the
25:26 last piece is all about living in some
25:27 sort of utopia without any money because
25:31 this old guy I think his name is Jacques
25:34 he went to a remote island in the
25:37 Pacific and he shows up with a bunch of
25:39 beads in in a bag because he's told they
25:42 don't have any monetary units of any
25:44 kind and so he just thought well I'll
25:46 trade these beads and so he he shows up
25:49 they they point him to a Hut he puts the
25:52 stuff in the hut he goes down for the
25:54 day and starts roaming around meeting
25:55 the people and he comes up and he finds
25:56 out that the chief and some of his
25:59 minions are sorting through his beads
26:01 and they're dividing them up and he's
26:04 like what are you doing this is my stuff
26:06 and they said you have too many and
26:10 that's when he had a an epiphany a
26:14 Eureka moment that you don't covet you
26:17 distribute and then everyone is even and
26:20 everyone is happy there are no haves and
26:22 have-nots the chief made sure that no
26:24 one found out that this guy had more
26:26 beads and everyone knows so what does
26:29 that to do with my motorcycle well
26:32 pretty much my average day on the
26:34 motorcycle was to drive in a circle for
26:36 a little while and so I got bored to
26:37 death that's one dog that was chasing me
26:40 but I would off-road because at the end
26:42 of the circle there was this path and
26:44 you could just go and go and go and it's
26:46 just beautiful Kansas plains we didn't
26:52 have wheat fields we had hay fields and
26:54 cornfields and soybean fields I used to
26:57 go to this church that was kind of
26:58 buried in the ground this round church
27:00 and so the parking lot you have to enter
27:03 the church at the base level which they
27:05 dug out this scoop in front of the
27:06 church and you go in the front door but
27:09 the rest of the church is buried in soil
27:11 with this like cone rooftop and so I
27:16 would use I would use the dugout area as
27:19 a ramp and so I just hit this thing
27:22 and I swear to god we must been jumping
27:24 15 20 feet in the air
27:25 crazy but one day I'm driving around and
27:30 the kids started making a well one of
27:33 them started kind of running after me
27:34 while I was driving by and I'm like what
27:37 are you [ __ ] crazy
27:38 take a little physics kid you bet - you
27:40 know you're gonna die here
27:42 used to put these planks of wood out
27:44 there and I'm still not understood I
27:46 think they're trying to make me wreck
27:47 and then eventually they made a human
27:50 shield across the street and so I
27:56 stopped I almost wrecked my bike doing
27:59 it I'm like what is what is your problem
28:02 what the hell are you doing and they
28:04 said we want to ride your bike and then
28:08 of course what they don't understand
28:09 they they have knots did not understand
28:11 they don't know how to ride a motorcycle
28:12 they don't know how to get into first
28:14 gear they don't know how to brake
28:16 you know they know anything about it but
28:19 they wanted they want to write on it
28:21 they never did of course the only one
28:25 who ever wrote it was my aunt and she
28:26 crashed it in like [ __ ] 300 feet and
28:29 destroyed my my gear shifting pedal of
28:32 course that's what would have happened
28:35 had these kids ridden it but it was
28:37 interesting I got to see the inside of
28:39 their brain their protests we want what
28:41 you have and we don't care if we're
28:44 qualified to have it you know that's the
28:46 disease of this [ __ ] era man these
28:49 kids you just want everything but they
28:51 don't want to get any talent whatsoever
28:53 they think if they imitate talent
28:55 they've got the real talent they play
28:57 guitar hero a lot man there anything
28:59 more Buckethead right give me a break
29:01 you think if they can tell someone
29:04 else's joke there they're a comedian and
29:06 a writer it's just like wow and their
29:09 parents are just as delusional as they
29:11 are unbelievable you just can't even
29:14 help them you can't even open your mouth
29:16 with any lucidity otherwise they'll come
29:19 after you
29:21 but we pick up and we move to new town
29:24 and this is a little fish out of water
29:28 I'm half I'm going half into third grade
29:31 like right in the middle of the year was
29:34 getting good at this
29:34 and the playground always has to do with
29:38 the kids that don't know you because
29:39 they don't have class with you and then
29:40 the kids that know you because to know
29:42 you're usually pretty cool this is the
29:45 town where my parents divorced so we
29:48 show up and we're living in a house
29:49 together and then we live in apartments
29:51 separated but I'm going to school and
29:54 there's just a few very interesting
29:56 things where you start to get taught
29:58 about the haves and the have-nots now I
30:01 feel fairly really privileged with my
30:02 motorcycle because I had something I
30:05 personally loved and I found it kind of
30:07 disturbing that kids wanted to ride it
30:10 and didn't have one that was kind of
30:12 weird when I got to this other town
30:14 though I couldn't keep my bike for that
30:17 long they had to take it away from me
30:18 and so I didn't ride again till I was a
30:20 teenager got this really awesome bike
30:24 that got taken away police were chasing
30:28 me at one point
30:29 Shirley funny and did my dad got me a
30:34 bicycle and I had a bicycle as well back
30:40 when I had my motorcycle buddies didn't
30:42 write it but my dad bought me this huffy
30:46 bike from Walmart and I was so excited
30:49 oh my god man it just was awesome but I
30:52 drove it around town and one of the kids
30:56 said oh you got a huffy that's a piece
30:59 of [ __ ] you probably got that from mom
31:01 or didn't you I'm like yeah I don't know
31:05 if it was Walmart it was something like
31:06 that
31:07 and all of a sudden I didn't like my
31:09 bike because his kid said it wasn't good
31:13 and so lesson learned right I fell prey
31:19 to some system that someone else had in
31:23 their brain and all of a sudden I had
31:26 this weird sort of downgrade in my head
31:28 Jesus I was the really cool kid with the
31:30 motorcycle and now I got this I've got a
31:32 piece-of-shit bike I kind of like this
31:34 bike but he says it's no good we did get
31:36 it at a cheap place and you know I'm
31:39 like nine trying to process all this
31:41 information right but in that particular
31:44 area what I learned it was two different
31:47 things at the playground and I must
31:50 split this in half the approach to
31:51 school was a walk to school that's
31:55 probably about a mile away tops no bus
31:59 no big deal I had a buddy named Jim he
32:06 and our good friends and just just
32:08 totally you know hung out all the time
32:10 walk to school didn't have any class
32:11 classes together we'd find each other
32:14 afterwards walk home that kind of thing
32:16 but then we had this other kid Charles
32:19 little scrawny kid his brothers sisters
32:23 were heavy into weed the brown weed back
32:26 in the day got a lot of wild experiences
32:28 over at their house but Charles got to
32:31 his thing up his ass that he couldn't
32:34 have anyone else be friends with his
32:35 friend Jim and it said three's a crowd
32:39 sort of thing right I could give a [ __ ]
32:43 right but I remember walking to school
32:45 one day and this kid starts and we're
32:49 like 910 years old but he starts you
32:52 know attacking me grab my coat throw me
32:55 around he's this little kid and I'm like
32:57 it's almost like you know a pit bull
33:00 that gets with a little puppy you just
33:02 even if the puppy's biting your tail and
33:04 hurting you you're just like oh that's
33:06 cute so his kid was so tiny and so
33:09 scrawny I'm kind of like just trying to
33:10 push him away from me like hey dude you
33:12 know you're really small you should
33:14 probably just chill out here only
33:16 happened once
33:18 we got in a fight later that day
33:20 physically it calmed down after that
33:23 100% I clipped him in his chin I didn't
33:27 get full impact by clipped him in his
33:28 chin and I think he felt his head go oh
33:30 [ __ ] I almost passed out and then he was
33:32 like I just don't like you men it was
33:36 real bad
33:36 nine-year-old brawls right but then on
33:39 the playground playground proper this is
33:42 where I met some some farm boys who
33:45 played soccer a little bit differently
33:46 like I said and it was very interesting
33:50 it was surf sort of that survival of the
33:52 fittest that every animal and every
33:54 child is understood since the beginning
33:56 of time since way before Darwin the hack
33:58 came in with his giant obvious epiphany
34:02 his Captain Obvious epiphany here I
34:04 remember playing soccer we had you know
34:08 it was weird we had like Pele's Haley
34:11 came through and touched everyone then
34:13 his coach came through and touched all
34:15 the schools and he just like we didn't
34:16 know we're meeting legends you know it's
34:18 kind of funny
34:18 and so we suck we're just playing it but
34:22 I remember I got pretty good and we're
34:25 down at the goal and I'm just trying to
34:27 maneuver away from this kid and this kid
34:29 can't can't get the ball away from me so
34:32 he just slugs me in the [ __ ] head
34:33 right in my temple he was taller than me
34:37 is more scrawny but you know scrawny
34:39 kids can punch really [ __ ] hard as
34:41 long as they pull it really fast right
34:43 and he hits me in the head I'm sort of
34:45 disoriented I'm looking up at him like
34:46 you know like hey this is football this
34:50 is soccer you don't use your hands dude
34:53 you specially don't punch anybody but it
34:56 kind of disoriented me you got the ball
34:58 away from me and then it was on and the
35:01 kid just happened to rent an apartment
35:03 just below me and he had a younger
35:05 brother he was younger than both of us
35:08 but for a little bit he dominated me and
35:12 in his own brain he dominated dominated
35:15 me he'd walk up to me and he'd be one of
35:16 those tall things where he would look
35:18 down on you and so it took a little
35:21 while for us to educate him that we
35:27 could do the same exact thing
35:28 the soccer became this sort of boxing
35:32 soccer it was really fun eventually all
35:36 got in trouble and it had to end after
35:37 about a week of that [ __ ] it was a very
35:39 interesting process of some people will
35:42 cheat and do whatever they can
35:46 especially if no one's looking right you
35:48 bump into these people in life I've had
35:51 partners recently to do this kind of
35:52 stuff they don't care it's just do
35:57 whatever you can to get ahead [ __ ] the
35:59 other guy break the rules cheat and
36:02 what's funny is is they break all the
36:03 rules everywhere else in life too you
36:07 know they we have car pool lanes here in
36:09 Los Angeles
36:10 they'll just driving them you know just
36:11 cuz it's late at night
36:13 I got tinted windows when we can see and
36:15 in the end it's not the end of the world
36:18 but at one point you're like wow you're
36:20 showing your character flaw what else do
36:23 you do in business especially that's
36:26 just exactly like this right but now
36:30 here's the other thing that you learn
36:31 for those of you move around and I know
36:34 that some of you have had really tough
36:38 childhoods I mean and I'm not trying to
36:40 paint anything tough trust me you guys
36:43 have had tough I got buddies here in
36:46 Huntington Beach they grew up in East LA
36:49 and south central gangs and they tell me
36:52 about their childhood and let me tell
36:53 you man
36:54 I'm telling you about a Walt Disney
36:55 movie and they're telling me about a
36:57 Clive Barker movie right it doesn't
37:01 matter if you had a cakewalk or if you
37:04 had a horrible thing you learn lessons
37:06 in the playground that you keep your
37:07 whole life you learn archetypes of human
37:09 beings that you keep your whole life and
37:11 I'm willing to bet
37:12 that the tougher you had it the more you
37:15 learned but I think it's interesting
37:17 that the point of this episode is that I
37:20 think we're all reflecting back on these
37:21 lessons that we learned as a little kid
37:23 and we just don't acknowledge it we
37:26 don't acknowledge it to each other oh
37:27 that's the ball baby you know but have
37:30 you've seen the movie cabin in the woods
37:32 and if you have not seen cabin in the
37:34 woods with Chris Hemsworth and a company
37:36 it is an absolutely brilliant brilliant
37:40 sci-fi horror movie that is if any of
37:44 you and it's funny it's a comedy but
37:48 there are some archetypes that always go
37:50 with those cabin movies those horror
37:53 movies where everyone goes out to the
37:55 cabin there's the jock there's the the
37:58 nerd there's the verge and you know
38:00 those different archetypes that are in
38:02 the film that movie takes a really
38:04 strong advantage of those different
38:05 archetypes and this is what we learned
38:08 in grade school and of course in high
38:11 school just to jump ahead first foot
38:14 second you have your if you've seen none
38:17 Not Another Teen Movie absolutely
38:21 brilliant parody on all the 80s movies
38:22 that were ever made that movie opens up
38:25 with this kid who's sort of the the
38:28 guide to the high school and he says oh
38:29 all you new kids here welcome he goes
38:33 you know here it's so and so high we
38:34 don't have any cliques we're all
38:36 together you know you know whatever and
38:39 then he goes okay jocks you come with me
38:41 nerds you go over there and he splits
38:43 everyone up into the cliques that he
38:45 just said doesn't actually occur it's
38:47 just utterly brilliant right so I think
38:50 it's funny that the experiences that we
38:52 have in grade school tend to help us
38:55 figure out which groups of people we are
38:58 going to be allowed to hang out in and
39:00 then the ones that we are we pick to be
39:02 in obviously some people have privileges
39:05 they can pick but if you could pick the
39:08 jocks they usually do pick the jocks
39:11 they don't say ah you know what I'm not
39:13 gonna do that I don't want to perceive
39:14 myself in the mirror every morning as
39:16 being a dick who's got to hang out with
39:18 his clicky buddies right
39:20 but then it went to Massachusetts I am a
39:24 fish out of water I'm not Jewish and I'm
39:26 not Irish so I do not blend in I said
39:30 this little explained this air of my
39:32 life a couple times in episodes the the
39:35 kids that I got I got along with all the
39:37 kids pretty much the Irish always wanted
39:40 to fight believe it or not the Fighting
39:42 Irish I mean it's just crazy they want
39:44 to be your best friend but they also
39:45 want to fisticuff after school is kind
39:47 of funny I know we're all little kids
39:49 right so it's not a bloodbath it's not
39:51 Fight Club but after about a year being
39:54 there I was there for a couple of years
39:56 I found myself really comfortable with
40:00 the black kids because they were not so
40:03 great number they're all just kind of
40:06 looking around like are these people
40:07 crazy they're crazy right you're white
40:09 aren't all these other white people
40:11 crazy and I'm like yes they are crazy
40:13 they are weird for wanting to do what
40:16 they do but the best choose the school
40:19 system is really strange and I've
40:22 described this once before
40:24 if you then you know I'm not gonna get
40:26 deeply political here but Charlotte is
40:28 or be I want it wrote the deliberate
40:29 dumbing down of America was in New
40:31 England when it all went down and I can
40:34 now reflect on my past and say oh my god
40:36 I was seeing it actually happened in the
40:38 early 80s but they actually divided the
40:40 school according to your achievement
40:42 test results and they had a B C and D
40:46 groups you're a group was your smartest
40:49 group they they divided us up in a
40:51 cafeteria so we could all see each other
40:53 and these groups B and C were the same I
40:58 was in B I think but B and C were the
41:01 same we were kind of the middle of the
41:02 road and then D well there were the ones
41:05 that got the DS they were that the you
41:08 know less fortunate or whatever and so
41:11 you would see how we're all divided up
41:13 and so then we're all clicking in our
41:14 brain all those are the smart kids and
41:17 you know smart kids it just so happened
41:19 dress better got picked up by the BMW's
41:22 in the Mercedes you know it was like
41:23 interesting the D kids have to walk home
41:26 I had to walk home
41:28 it was just interesting how that got all
41:31 split up but the playground there was
41:34 very interesting even though we were all
41:36 split up the only group that really
41:38 didn't integrate well was the a group
41:40 but B through D we didn't care about any
41:44 of that crap you know we weren't the
41:46 special ones so we all kind of clicked
41:47 together and I remember the camaraderie
41:52 of the group and then we went off to
41:56 middle school which was seventh grade
41:59 and the same group of kids came over and
42:01 then we added a bunch more because the
42:02 school is a lot bigger from other grade
42:04 schools and I was very fortunate I mean
42:07 I was an artist and the school
42:10 recognized that and so I got a lot of
42:11 out of class time to do art projects all
42:15 around the school paint the windows for
42:17 Christmas and do a bunch of like sports
42:18 art for the gymnasium and a bunch of
42:20 stuff so you know no one but the funny
42:25 thing was no one really knew besides a
42:26 couple of their art students that we
42:28 were in this group so there wasn't any
42:30 like envious nature towards us because
42:32 people were just like where is he I
42:34 don't know he's not here he's sick or
42:36 whatever but no one was like oh you got
42:38 you know you got personal time away from
42:39 class look you back I'm very happy but
42:44 what starts happening in 6th 7th and 8th
42:45 grade the hormones start heating up
42:48 right you're no longer just looking at
42:50 that girl going mmm now before I left
42:54 Kansas you know it started happening in
42:58 fifth grade you know my friends forced
43:01 me into my first kiss with my girlfriend
43:03 here we are boyfriend/girlfriend and we
43:04 hadn't kissed and we had to do in front
43:06 everyone else and then they were like do
43:07 a French kiss we're like what is that we
43:11 didn't even know and they were like you
43:12 put your tones in each other's I was
43:14 like oh she had bad breath too pretty
43:16 girl probably I did too so we weren't
43:21 really drawn to it after we did it but
43:24 there was a girl her name was Betsy and
43:27 I had a crush on her very quickly in
43:32 sixth grade
43:34 but she wasn't really paying attention
43:36 to me much she was playing hard to get
43:38 literally but I was always pay attention
43:41 to her oh I thought she's so pretty
43:43 and then I gave up I was like okay she
43:47 doesn't want to date me that's cool and
43:48 I remember being in home my dad and I
43:51 were fixing a pinball machine
43:53 we used to fix and you know just rotate
43:56 him through the house constantly it's
43:58 one of the days I it was I think it was
44:00 literally the day I reached up to pick I
44:02 had the phone in my hand I'm talking she
44:04 called me you know how the hell she got
44:06 my number
44:06 and I reached up into the pinball
44:08 machine to pull myself up from
44:10 underneath it and I grabbed the power
44:13 transformer and shocked the living [ __ ]
44:16 out of myself which was pretty funny but
44:19 now she wants to date me and for some
44:22 reason I remember hesitating to date her
44:24 and then she got angry and she was like
44:28 you were going to date me this is just
44:30 the way it is and if you don't date me
44:33 I'll have my friend's brother beat you
44:35 up I remember that was part of the
44:36 conversation I was like damn I don't
44:39 know why I resisted I still had a crush
44:41 on her I wasn't dating anybody else it
44:43 was interesting dating freakin like 11
44:46 12 years old right sounds funny doesn't
44:49 it sounds funny that you can have all
44:52 these intense experiences between the
44:54 age of like 5 and 13 and I think as
44:58 parents we forget that these kids that
45:00 we have are having these intense
45:01 experiences and it's very meaningful and
45:03 it's very formative it's intimidating at
45:08 times and we need to understand that
45:10 they live a complete and I don't - oh no
45:12 at those young ages and so did we now
45:17 sadly sadly the amount of people the
45:22 amount of adults that I run into and
45:24 their 40s now who say they can't
45:27 remember their childhood is astonishing
45:31 i I've never been 48 before I don't know
45:35 I've never had a bunch of friends in
45:38 their 40s before so I don't know does
45:41 this is this a trend that by the time
45:44 you're 40 or so toxified in the brain
45:45 you don't remember anything
45:47 and then you'll meet you know my
45:48 neighbor across the street she can
45:49 remember everything she remembers two
45:52 years old up like I do she could she
45:55 told her mom how the house was laid out
45:56 at two I guess at one point and her
45:58 mom's job was on the ground right but
46:01 think about it
46:02 just a segue for a second when we as
46:04 parents think about our kids going to
46:06 school and we're busy with our lives
46:09 depending on how old you are when you
46:11 have your kids are in their 20s your 30s
46:12 and your kids getting into you know
46:15 kindergarten first grade second grade
46:16 third grade we think that they're just
46:18 going there to learn stuff and if they
46:20 come home with any personal experiences
46:22 we're like it just goes over our head
46:24 you know like whatever study your work
46:28 study or school meanwhile your child is
46:31 being utterly molded by the other kids
46:34 they're being molded by the teachers who
46:37 are now being taught in America to
46:39 infiltrate kids brains you know some
46:42 article that came out yesterday that a
46:44 bunch of teachers told their kids to
46:46 write letters to their Senators
46:47 demanding to the Second Amendment be
46:49 removed this should be jail time for
46:53 those teachers right it's the same
46:55 liberal that would say you know the
46:57 Bible shouldn't be even mentioned in
46:59 school well but destroyed the Bill of
47:02 Rights the thing that gives these
47:04 teachers the right to be gigantic
47:06 [ __ ] [ __ ] that's what I think is
47:09 always interesting a second Amendment
47:10 hater has never fired a gun
47:14 and is generally a [ __ ] and they just
47:17 they want to get rid of the bullies they
47:19 think if they get rid of guns the
47:20 bully's disappearance hey let me tell
47:23 you man in my hometown the best fights
47:25 I've ever seen with adults beating the
47:27 [ __ ] out of each other in the middle of
47:29 the [ __ ] night in the middle of Main
47:30 Street I told the story I was running
47:32 the movie theater at like 13 years old
47:34 it's real late at night I'm just the
47:37 place is closed I've already called in
47:38 the tickets and all this other stuff out
47:40 from the bar across the street comes as
47:43 dude running dude and he's in his boots
47:46 total cowboy and then two seconds later
47:49 another guy comes out runs faster grabs
47:52 him pins him down right in the middle of
47:54 Main Street we just happened to have you
47:56 know the lights rotate off and on our
47:58 area was totally dark and he's just
48:00 pounding this guy's face he's got the
48:03 guy pinned down and he's just pounding
48:05 him in the face and this guy is
48:06 screaming for mercy you see that as a
48:10 child you're like whoa I guess that guy
48:12 pissed off the other dude and one should
48:13 be careful because the fists can kill
48:17 somebody
48:18 it's interesting you learned that in the
48:20 playground too right
48:21 life comes with tons of lessons doesn't
48:23 it I'm making this episode for a couple
48:27 reasons maybe more than two reasons but
48:29 the the first charter of this episode is
48:32 so that we can recap where we formed our
48:36 opinions about all things I want you to
48:39 think about if you can remember your
48:41 childhood
48:42 how much even before you know you got
48:46 into kindergarten how much of messing
48:48 around in the backyard taught you
48:51 something like I mentioned a few
48:53 episodes ago - my ended up real good
48:58 friends said hi to me by walking up to
49:01 me in the backyard and taking the hose
49:03 out of my hand that I was using to water
49:04 this garden my mom was doing and they
49:07 just put it in my pants you know it's
49:09 hot summer actually kind of nice but
49:11 look at this kid and I'm thinking what
49:15 is he is this funny and they were
49:17 laughing and I was like I mean I'm
49:19 playing in the water I'm already soaked
49:20 so like what how's this it's almost like
49:23 taking a hose and putting on someone in
49:25 a bathing suit and going ha ha
49:27 get wet and your sleek okay I guess
49:30 you're for like you know but it's that
49:34 dynamic of just figuring out how
49:35 people's minds think you know we are
49:38 always talking about when we're young we
49:41 have this primal innocence these primal
49:44 thoughts and the notion that somehow
49:46 these primal thoughts get disposed of as
49:49 you get older I think is probably a
49:52 little bit of wishful thinking when you
49:54 grow up in a tiny little town and you
49:56 know everyone from childhood up the
49:59 reclusive kids stay reclusive the
50:03 outgoing kids usually stay pretty
50:05 outgoing unless some traumatic event
50:07 occurs I mentioned a family member of
50:09 mine he was known as just this crazy kid
50:13 he was a he was always causing a lot of
50:16 property damage as a kid he was always
50:18 hanging out with the wrong crowd
50:20 like building like little tiny shacks
50:22 wood burned down he's always there you
50:24 know he got caught shoplifting and yours
50:29 truly shoplifters his house off but not
50:31 till later but then you know as he was I
50:35 think about 15 years old he's having an
50:37 argument with his mom his mom punches
50:39 him in the head after he turned around
50:41 popped him in his temple he came to my
50:45 house and he was crying and I I've never
50:48 seen his kid cry before and that day she
50:51 cut his balls off because he was meek
50:54 from that point on it so shook him to
50:57 his core that even though he eventually
51:01 got a girlfriend once and then he
51:03 finally got a second girlfriend married
51:04 her and had kids he's he's a meek human
51:10 being but he pretends to be otherwise
51:14 but we in a small little town now yeah
51:18 that's him he's harmless
51:22 most he'll ever do is take some
51:25 medication for being depressed and
51:26 killed somebody or so there's nothing
51:29 more precious than a young mind you know
51:31 when I became a teacher or an instructor
51:33 I should say I've never been a teacher
51:36 like full-time right never went to a
51:38 university or some school
51:40 it's a full-time job I've just been
51:43 teaching courses and probably since my
51:45 early 20s because I would always know I
51:48 you know I would always pioneer
51:49 something or go get information from
51:51 very brilliant people and then I would
51:53 have this coveted piece of information
51:54 then I would be part of the corporate
51:56 training wherever I worked or my
51:59 employees didn't know it and I wanted to
52:01 teach him but I was told very early on
52:04 that the one of the biggest
52:07 responsibilities you have is teaching
52:09 children and someone told me it's told
52:15 me in a way that was something like I
52:18 can't I can't think of how they said it
52:20 but I said it the other day the way it
52:23 was initially taught to me but if
52:24 something like that saying that says you
52:26 know it's harder for a camel to walk
52:29 through the eye of the needle than a
52:30 rich man to get into heaven sort of
52:32 thing and it was sort of under this
52:34 tense to say that if you teach a child
52:36 you're toying with your eternal
52:40 damnation in some way or another right
52:42 it was basically because you could teach
52:44 a kid wrong and you've changed their
52:47 perception of the world forever and
52:48 unless you have access to them at a
52:50 future point and they still respect you
52:53 they may not hear any different which is
52:56 why I think that all these agendas in
52:58 America teaching kids all this crap
53:01 science and turning it crap science into
53:04 crap politics is blasphemous against
53:08 humanity talk about do no harm it's
53:10 doing pure harm right teaching kids
53:13 about climate change and that horseshit
53:15 right teaching them to hate the very
53:19 foundation of this country
53:21 hey if America is so [ __ ] up then why
53:23 does everybody want to move here
53:25 but people want to come here and undo
53:27 what we are it's insane
53:29 convincing our own native indigenous
53:31 citizens to spite the foundation that
53:35 gave them the ability to be autonomous
53:38 and powerful and have the American dream
53:40 Wow
53:42 it's pretty intense isn't it isn't that
53:44 just ignorant as hell I have been in
53:47 meetings with very old men who despite
53:51 their morals are smart and they will
53:55 reference the playground they won't say
53:59 the word playground but they'll
54:01 reference well you know it's that kind
54:03 of guy and it's that guy it's that kind
54:05 of girl
54:05 Papapa and they're just missioning an
54:08 archetype that most of us learned and
54:10 met on the playground I mean I know you
54:13 get this so one thing I want to send you
54:18 off in terms of homework for your brain
54:21 is to analyze what may have taught you
54:26 one way or the other when you were a kid
54:27 to behave a certain way and then there's
54:30 always what we say on the show is look
54:33 make sure that's something that you
54:35 still value you might also rewind and
54:41 say what did I learn correctly as a kid
54:43 on the playground that I no longer
54:45 engage in today I've let Society make me
54:48 cynical it's important it's really
54:53 important to take inventory of these
54:55 things because I think there's a lot of
54:56 brilliance there
54:58 you know I think the Bible was written
55:01 by a very inspired men where it's good
55:04 very devious men where it is very
55:06 manipulative but the parts they got
55:10 right mentioned this algorithm of
55:14 childhood and I think that was a stroke
55:17 of absolute brilliance if it's truly God
55:20 coming down and becoming man well there
55:21 you go if you believe that then you
55:23 should believe this even more so I think
55:26 it's also interesting to think about the
55:27 fact that some of the most simple
55:29 fundamental things we learned as human
55:30 beings are the cornerstone of our
55:34 absolute success in this world if you
55:39 have children or grandchildren that is
55:42 why it is so important to protect their
55:44 environment when I grew up in the
55:46 Midwest
55:47 I knew that pretty much wherever a kid
55:49 grew up they were safe
55:50 yeah sure one kid one towns gonna be a
55:53 little more racist than the other
55:54 although Kansas is pretty agnostic we
55:57 borrow the good things from the north
55:58 and then we borrow the good things from
55:59 the south and we leave all the [ __ ]
56:01 out a lot of special people on that
56:04 central band but yeah you're gonna be
56:06 closed-minded here closed-minded there I
56:10 didn't worry about you know kids getting
56:12 shot kids getting into too many drugs
56:15 kids getting oversexed it's probably
56:18 different today as they the Midwest
56:21 seems to emulate la like we're still
56:23 doing the gang wars I just recently went
56:25 to Texas and wow they are still
56:29 pretending to be LA even in San
56:31 Francisco is still pretending to be LA
56:33 it's just nuts we're done with it
56:36 because we did it for 20 years and we
56:38 did it out an extreme level I think we
56:42 only really did it for about 10 years
56:43 maybe 15 tops and then the drug dealers
56:46 got tired of dying in that and the cops
56:50 got tired of fighting it and everyone
56:52 just kind of said you know aren't you
56:53 tired of this never went yeah all right
56:56 well hey good luck
56:58 you know I talked to two retired
57:01 thirty-year LAPD cops and they said it's
57:04 over he says well we'll do a traffic
57:06 stop and some little italy-- do traffic
57:09 stop and the guy in the car is one of
57:11 the most notorious
57:11 drug dealers of LA and he said the guys
57:14 out of the business they laugh it off
57:16 they have little good stories and he'll
57:17 even let the guy go because we're like
57:20 you were in the machine and you survived
57:23 and we did - congratulations enjoy your
57:26 night how cool is that right but when I
57:30 see families have kids in really bad
57:32 neighborhoods it's usually because other
57:35 they feel trapped and they can't get out
57:37 but you always can usually buy what race
57:42 you are what gender you are you can get
57:44 out and go to a better place well the
57:46 parents are so stuck on their jobs they
57:49 think they've externalized their value
57:51 in a job and said I am nothing unless I
57:53 have this big high-powered job like it's
57:56 gonna grow up in sort of a it could be
57:59 even a nice area but you know the nice
58:01 area is kind of sandwiched in really bad
58:02 areas and so the kids are gonna go
58:04 through all this crazy hell they
58:05 shouldn't
58:07 Huntington Beach California got two high
58:09 schools here one of the high schools
58:11 it's in this district is supposedly one
58:13 of the better high schools in the entire
58:14 area but the rich looking school down
58:17 the street
58:18 it's a beautiful [ __ ] school man
58:21 everyone always tells me every kid that
58:23 goes there turns into a massive drug
58:25 addict has tons of problems now I'm just
58:29 repeating what I've been told but I've
58:30 been told by this told this by at least
58:33 a dozen people over the last 15 years
58:35 and especially the kids telling me this
58:40 so it matters when your kids go to
58:43 school they're having these intense
58:45 experiences no matter how young they are
58:47 that's why it's important to talk to
58:49 them how was your day son how was your
58:53 day daughter get to know their lives
58:55 right compare your lessons that you
58:58 learned your kid gets heartbroken think
59:02 back to your heartbroken days and try to
59:04 get through it try to understand it
59:07 they're little adults believe it or not
59:10 because you know that is that old saying
59:13 as it is above so too is a below that we
59:16 use this to understand physics and other
59:17 universe works but it works at an adult
59:20 level to the [ __ ] you're dealing with at
59:24 your level it's the same stuff your kids
59:26 dealing with at their level it's just it
59:29 means the same it means the same to a
59:31 child yeah I told you about the kid in
59:33 soccer you like the box while he played
59:37 I can still remember just like it
59:40 happened two minutes ago getting boxed
59:43 in the head while I was looking down at
59:44 the ball and I remember looking up with
59:46 the kid thinking hey this isn't fair
59:50 this isn't the way this works you're
59:52 breaking the rules you're being a dick
59:53 and the funny thing is I've had that you
59:57 know 50 times as an adult
60:00 same exact thing the guys that cheat to
60:03 get ahead and as long as the teacher
60:05 didn't see it now I want 11 oh they
60:07 cheated right and it happens in all
60:10 kinds of ways it doesn't happen in a
60:12 physical way when you get older
60:13 typically it'll happen in a business
60:15 maneuver it'll happen in someone lying
60:18 about their career
60:20 I've had a good friend of mine it was
60:22 real the fact that he's been lying about
60:23 his career his whole life he's an
60:26 amazing individual if he would just go
60:28 with what he actually did he's amazing
60:30 by what he really did but he tends to
60:34 over exaggerate everything to a level of
60:36 almost hysteria I mean it's it's it's
60:40 laughable the things this guy said he
60:43 did as if no one else was in the room
60:45 the whole time it's interesting it's
60:50 like the guy that comes over your house
60:51 and helps paint like a 1 foot square on
60:54 the side of your house but then he'll
60:55 tell his friends oh yeah I painted that
60:57 house oh you did I don't remember seeing
61:01 you on the construction site oh yeah
61:03 totally
61:04 and they will have observantly watched
61:07 what everyone else was doing and so
61:08 they'll say oh yeah we had this problem
61:10 with the with the you know the cabinets
61:13 in the kitchen remember that problem
61:15 they didn't deal with it they just came
61:17 and looked at it and then they told that
61:19 story oh yeah I heard there were cabinet
61:20 problems oh yeah you must have done the
61:21 cabinet because you know about that
61:22 problem mm-hmm anyway you feel me the
61:29 moral of the story is that everything
61:30 matters protect your children's brains
61:33 because it matters go back and take
61:36 inventory of everything that you learned
61:37 that was good everything you learned
61:39 that was bad find out how you're
61:41 applying that to your current life
61:44 because you are for sure the playground
61:49 was a very powerful place for most of us
