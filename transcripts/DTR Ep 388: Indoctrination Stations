00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen on this early-morning episode
00:39 here it's about 120 in the morning
00:43 today's episode I think is pretty
00:46 important and I'm gonna call this
00:51 indoctrination stations which is gonna
00:54 sound kind of goofy you guys can think
00:57 of a shorter name put it in the comments
00:58 below
01:00 but I'm filling up my car today with gas
01:02 and I can't believe that I didn't have
01:06 this perception of this thing a lot
01:12 earlier but now in America I'm sure
01:15 they're in your neighborhood as well if
01:18 you're not here the gas station pumps
01:21 have televisions in them it's been going
01:24 on for quite a while but they have
01:27 televisions in them and the second you
01:29 start pumping your gas oh boy here comes
01:32 the the propaganda through the gas
01:36 station pump now sometimes it's silly
01:41 little things about you know Christmas
01:44 or whatever you know but that's how you
01:47 wrap it up right you know what is it
01:51 Sugar's wrapped in by wrapped by insulin
01:53 so that it enters the cell see you
01:56 reverse all that and you put propaganda
02:00 inside of a fuzzy warm sugar wrapper and
02:04 you smuggling into the brain now from
02:08 time to time I will travel quite a bit
02:12 but not a big fan of traveling myself
02:14 because I hate airports I think they're
02:18 poorly run most the time even if they're
02:20 pretty it's kind of fun when you land
02:23 obviously and you're going to some place
02:24 it's kind of cool but airports we all
02:28 know have turned into gigantic
02:30 propaganda machines and it is on the
02:34 level of you know you're getting inside
02:39 the airport and
02:40 automatically you see TVs everywhere and
02:42 you'll see TVs that are obviously
02:44 showing you where the departures and
02:46 arrivals are you know perhaps little
02:49 helpdesk tutorials about where to go
02:53 interactive ones that sell your tickets
02:56 but then you start moving into the
03:00 airport towards your terminal and in
03:04 America I'm gonna say it is 60 to 70%
03:07 all liberal news and let's just rebrand
03:12 that as fake news as ultra propaganda
03:15 and when we think of the old saying that
03:19 the the easiest way to brainwash a human
03:21 being is repetition it's what's going on
03:25 with all the climate lies that are going
03:27 on it's indoctrination about how we
03:30 should perceive their countries or
03:32 ourselves both in a negative and a
03:34 positive you know it's pretty amazing
03:36 that we're supposed to in one fell swoop
03:39 hate the Middle East and constantly
03:42 rationalize going over and killing
03:44 people over there and on the other hand
03:47 Europe is supposed to let them all into
03:50 their Nations
03:53 we'll take your pick
03:54 we're supposed to all be vegans and
03:57 we're all supposed to be vegetarians but
03:59 if you eat a bunch of stuff and get
04:03 super fat then it's bad to shame we'll
04:07 take your pick how many of you remember
04:11 watching a baseball game or going to a
04:13 baseball game and there was barely any
04:15 advertising anywhere the bleachers that
04:19 you sat in just simply had maybe the
04:21 brand of the team painted in paint
04:23 around the in a little barrier face they
04:28 were really trying to sell you whatever
04:29 product the teams were competing in the
04:33 field sold you know hats and shirts and
04:36 whatever obviously home team having the
04:39 ultimate 95 percent advantage but
04:42 they're never gonna miss an opportunity
04:43 to take some money you got your beer and
04:45 your hotdogs and all that good stuff is
04:47 all being advertised but what is it
04:48 today it's a gigantic LED circus
04:54 products you don't need they now have a
04:58 green screen behind the batter such that
05:01 when anyone's up to bat they blast
05:04 advertising behind the guy so repetition
05:09 has a lot of value repetition can sell
05:12 an advanced concept and it can sell a
05:14 brand familiarity ok well a politician
05:20 is a brand is aren't they
05:22 someone's running for president well
05:27 you're busy and you're not a politics
05:30 kind of person so the only thing that
05:31 you're gonna do is probably see a
05:33 person's name see a person's face over
05:36 and over and over again and when you go
05:38 to the voting machine unless someone has
05:40 told you something very you know acidic
05:43 about that person you're gonna pull the
05:45 lever for that person because they're
05:47 the most familiar one who's this I don't
05:49 even know this other guy the last
05:52 election we had a pretty big runoff
05:56 locally between a Republican and a
05:58 Democrat and even though all of the
06:03 nasty nasty stuff was on the Democrat
06:06 side I had a friend of mine who did vote
06:10 for that person but she said you know it
06:14 pisses me off that I saw way more signs
06:17 for the left not because I disliked the
06:21 left she said but because why didn't
06:23 that guy run harder if he wants my vote
06:25 he's got to show me he can run harder I
06:27 want to see more of his signs more of
06:29 his issues more of this and more of that
06:32 Touche right there's a movie released in
06:37 1985 by John Carpenter called they live
06:41 and it's a Rhian vision of the previous
06:47 version which I think I've only seen
06:49 morsels of it but the premise of the
06:53 story is that an actor played by Ronnie
06:57 Piper god bless him r.i.p brother he's
07:02 sort of a drifter he drifts into Los
07:04 Angeles and he runs into kind of a
07:07 sanctuary city
07:07 for homeless people and he just he's a
07:11 big tough guy you know and he just wants
07:12 a place to rest for the night while he
07:15 kind of gets his ball bearings together
07:17 as to what he's gonna do in Los Angeles
07:18 and he ends up on the edge of this
07:21 little sanctuary city in a park it's
07:24 daytime and he sees a crime being
07:29 committed at a church right next to the
07:33 sanctuary settings of watching this and
07:35 a preacher's running from some guys and
07:38 he runs over to help and the preacher
07:41 has a box like a medium-sized box and he
07:45 says take these away protect him and so
07:51 he's like he's defending these this box
07:53 with his life and so I think I can't
07:57 quite remember it's been a while since
07:58 I've seen I'm gonna watch it again here
08:00 but I think the preacher passes away or
08:03 what-have-you and he's been shot or
08:05 something like that and Ronnie runs away
08:06 at the box but when he opens the box
08:09 it's just a bunch of ray-ban Wayfarer
08:13 sunglasses they were extremely popular
08:16 in 1985 because of the reprisal of them
08:19 through the movie risky business by Tom
08:22 Cruise so he puts them on and he looks
08:28 at the city and the city looks
08:30 completely different I believe
08:33 everything that he sees - the glasses
08:35 are black and white for one thing which
08:37 is a really sweet little treatment that
08:38 Carpenter did but all of the signs that
08:42 he reads all the magazine covers every
08:46 piece of advertising in the entire city
08:48 of Los Angeles and he's downtown bye-bye
08:52 City Hall says something else consume
08:57 obey Shepard Fairey's hole obey thang
09:01 aim out of the movie they live so funny
09:04 I wore a big obey you've seen me wear my
09:07 obey shirt with the they live zombie
09:10 dude on the front I worked at Disneyland
09:13 last time I was there and it was
09:14 hilarious I would walk around I hear
09:16 people there like a guy with his
09:18 girlfriend he goes have you seen that
09:20 movie what movie they live
09:23 but anybody who's looking at the shirt
09:25 you know they can it's Shepard Fairey
09:26 will go well that looks weird but they
09:29 weren't zombies what was going on in the
09:31 movie was that the some of the human
09:33 beings that well that looked like human
09:35 beings without the glasses on are
09:37 actually aliens they can look like
09:39 zombies but they're hyper intelligent
09:42 they talk and they're among us now
09:47 what's interesting about that movie in
09:49 this subject matter is that you have an
09:51 alien race that infiltrated us and was
09:56 able to smuggle underneath marketing
09:58 material propaganda to control us I
10:02 think even one of the sciences like
10:04 procreate we live in that world and it's
10:10 not necessary to wear ray-ban glasses
10:13 that have special filters in them to see
10:16 the alien invasion it's right in our
10:19 face and it's being sold to us as
10:21 entertainment which is interesting now
10:25 let's take the world and let's change it
10:27 in your mind we do a magic wand on
10:30 everybody boom what's the magic wand ooh
10:35 it illustrates to everyone that the news
10:40 is fake that agencies lie to you that
10:46 magazines newspapers everything related
10:48 to media has been usurped again I just
10:54 mentioned it it's gonna be coming in
10:56 another episode the project Mockingbird
10:57 where they indoctrinated a bunch of
10:59 journalists to go out and push
11:01 propaganda for a reward but everyone in
11:05 one fell swoop knows that this is all
11:09 bad for you it's all propaganda now if
11:13 we just leave it like that and people
11:16 continue to look at it you would think
11:19 we're in a black mirror we're in some
11:20 dystopian 1984 movie some episode 2
11:24 season 1 of Black Mirror where you are
11:27 being forced to watch propaganda and for
11:31 some reason that people aren't fighting
11:33 back the people aren't saying turn this
11:35 [ __ ]
11:35 I don't want to be indoctrinated by lies
11:39 but that's exactly what's going on when
11:43 Ronnie Piper takes the glasses and he's
11:45 pulling him on and off on and off and
11:46 he's looking at the world that he's at a
11:48 newsstand with a bunch of magazines and
11:50 he looks at all the magazines and
11:52 they're all just covered and alien
11:54 propaganda he immediately changes he
11:58 immediately
11:58 he's just what's beautiful about this
12:01 film is that he's a nobody
12:04 as much as nobody's get in the way that
12:08 they wrote his initial initial character
12:09 and here he is becoming a superhero of
12:13 sorts against the whole world cabal of
12:17 the whole place being taken over you're
12:21 gonna have to watch the movie to figure
12:23 out how to ends here but now aren't we
12:30 the awakened of this world aren't we all
12:34 Ronnie Piper's and we don't have
12:38 sunglasses with the filter on them to
12:41 see the propaganda we have brains that
12:43 work ah huh we think for ourselves and
12:48 when there are these fake events in the
12:51 world where again people may be getting
12:53 hurt these days in the old days they
12:55 tried not to hurt anyone at all or very
12:57 few people we watched society throw away
13:01 their laws New Zealand just did it
13:04 unbelievable they create a fake
13:06 Hollywood event
13:07 I mean faked his fake is fake and their
13:11 country just goes yeah get rid of all
13:15 the the laws that protect us as the
13:17 people moving them closer and closer to
13:20 a dictatorship to a globalist
13:22 dictatorship the full-blown act of
13:27 tyranny now I know what a lot of you
13:30 guys think and I've thought this too and
13:32 I'm changing my mind a little bit or I'm
13:33 refining my brain a little bit about
13:35 this there are billions of guns in this
13:38 world billions they go back hundred
13:44 years all different calibers and kinds
13:47 rifles and shotguns
13:48 and pistols and automatic weapons and
13:51 all this other stuff and in this day and
13:53 age if tomorrow
13:55 somehow America banned guns and a bunch
14:00 of ignorant people went along with it we
14:04 know that you could go to bowling alleys
14:07 and other weird places and bars and
14:10 weird joints and you could find someone
14:12 else sell you a gun
14:14 probably a crate of them well they're
14:17 hot and you're gonna be in massive
14:19 trouble for the rest of your life you're
14:20 probably in prison the rest of your life
14:22 if you were to be caught with these
14:23 things this is the way it is today even
14:25 without the law being changed but we
14:28 envision the criminals having the guns
14:30 and therefore it's not safe for us to be
14:34 without guns now no one's really worried
14:37 about the criminals are worried about
14:38 the government but it's one of those old
14:41 sayings it's kind of how we when we
14:43 explain how money works in the Federal
14:44 Reserve we try to illustrate to people
14:46 that the interest we owe on the loans to
14:49 the World Bank's is never created
14:50 therefore the interest can never be paid
14:52 back and that blows people's and minds
14:53 every once in a while I always give you
14:56 the analogy we're sitting at a table and
14:58 it's just between you and I and the
15:00 outside economy exists and I loan you a
15:03 buck and I'm a jerk I'm gonna charge you
15:04 ten cents on the dollar for that and I
15:06 say okay and I immediately pay me back
15:08 you give me the dollar back across the
15:10 table you go wait I'll go find a dime
15:11 and you go look in your car you look in
15:13 the cushions look underneath your bed
15:14 sure enough I might even know you
15:17 changed by the time you find a nickel or
15:19 find a quarter or something like that
15:21 but in the real world of global
15:24 economies there there is no dime
15:27 anywhere else it was never made so you
15:30 can you will not find any other money
15:31 anywhere else in the world because I'm
15:33 the one that gets to create it all if
15:34 I'm the World Bank and so immediately I
15:37 passed you another piece of paper across
15:38 the table which is another loan at more
15:40 interest so that you can get the money
15:42 that you owe me on the previous loan so
15:45 you take a loan to pay off the previous
15:46 one but because of compound interests
15:49 you're gonna lose that game for the rest
15:52 of your life you will owe me more more
15:55 more or more and the only thing you can
15:57 do to stay out of being collected on or
15:59 whatever the penalty is is continue to
16:01 borrow from me
16:02 with the gun analogy they they would
16:07 most likely lock down and this will get
16:10 back to the propaganda machine here in a
16:11 second but they would lock down all the
16:13 production of weapons in the world and
16:15 make it just as protected as creating a
16:17 dollar bill or a hundred dollar bill you
16:19 can't just go out and make a dollar bill
16:21 or whatever currency you have you just
16:23 can't do it it's all wild you know it's
16:25 all these layers of foil and Holograms
16:28 and all this other stuff that detects
16:30 whether or not it's real well guns be
16:32 the same way so once they gathered up
16:35 all these billions of guns over the
16:37 course of several decades and made the
16:39 penalties so formidable you would you
16:43 wouldn't touch a gun it would be it
16:45 would be like touching a live ordnance
16:46 on the ground right you could blow up
16:48 and kill you you'd blow up and destroy
16:51 your life eventually the only people
16:54 that would have guns would be the
16:56 government and all these you know either
17:01 smarter not smart soldiers remember they
17:04 put a hundred and ten IQ cap on soldier
17:06 no sorry police officers here in America
17:09 all right now hopefully you're just
17:14 failing the test on purpose to get down
17:16 to that level but we know what happened
17:18 for the was that the UN Kofi Annan son
17:26 ran the whole program in South Africa in
17:30 Africa where they were handing out food
17:33 to people and these soldiers were
17:36 forcing women I watched videos of this
17:38 okay my own eyes
17:39 the women had to come to the truck that
17:43 had the rice and the food gonna get in
17:46 the truck and they've outfitted the back
17:48 of the truck with a place to lie down
17:50 and the soldiers have sex with the women
17:53 and then the women are allowed to take
17:55 their rice home and I don't know
17:59 anything about the culture but I would
18:00 imagine some of these women wouldn't
18:02 admit that that's what's going on now
18:05 they don't have guns but the soldiers
18:08 that are passing out the rice have guns
18:10 so if you're going to I mean they have
18:12 guns but again it's one of these things
18:14 we have to break the law to get with
18:16 need to defend themselves if all the
18:17 males in the village were to armored up
18:19 and blow these [ __ ] away and
18:22 they just take their own rice and say
18:25 look you wouldn't keep your rice keep
18:28 your rice and oh by the way Press
18:29 Reuters AP everybody
18:31 these guys are raping which they got
18:34 caught they got caught the head of the
18:36 UN son got caught running this scam and
18:40 whether or not he jumped in the back of
18:41 a truck and did it at all doesn't matter
18:43 he is the proxy by which this corruption
18:45 occurred I tell you this little story
18:49 because I want to realist rate how
18:51 definitive it is that once power gets
18:54 put in the hands of man such that they
18:58 can dominate other men and I mean
19:02 mankind it happens automatically it
19:08 happens automatically it's amazing
19:11 what's interesting and living in
19:13 Southern California in the region that I
19:14 live is that we have a lot of wealthy
19:17 people we have trust fund kids we've got
19:19 the people that have worked really hard
19:20 and they're the first-stage earners and
19:23 their family but they've got so much
19:25 money it's sick you know I went down to
19:28 the beach I drove around down there I
19:32 think it was last week you know and
19:35 there were just Lamborghinis everywhere
19:37 and it was it's it's an odyssey it's fun
19:39 to watch I mean you know because you get
19:41 to see a car that cost as much as your
19:42 house drive by and it's like wow
19:45 what the hell does that guy do to have
19:48 that vehicle and you can't help but
19:52 think that you're smart enough to do the
19:53 same thing that's the that's the other
19:55 funny thing now there's bills that come
19:57 with those kind of toys that you don't
19:59 have anything to do with but I have
20:02 another smoke shop I go to a different
20:03 one that is frequented by these people
20:06 and I did sit once last time I was there
20:10 it was I think it was full of these
20:11 trust fund kids and they were talking
20:13 about how they were spending their time
20:14 you know going out and do whatever
20:18 whatever they did but they talked about
20:19 the 20,000 air and they talked about a
20:22 person that will definitely drive one of
20:25 these Lamborghinis you got to put 20
20:27 grand down you put 2,000 a month in
20:29 and then you have like 2,500 mile limit
20:32 per year so they're not exactly daily
20:34 drivers unless you buy the thing
20:36 yourself and you can do whatever you
20:37 want with it but there's a ton of people
20:39 according to these guys that are driving
20:40 around just on the very brink of
20:43 bankruptcy to look amazing and I've had
20:46 several my friends in my lifetime get
20:48 sucked into this algorithm but now let's
20:51 go back to these indoctrination stations
20:57 are you well as put this way you buy a
21:03 ticket to fly somewhere let's go back to
21:05 the airport do you have the right to not
21:09 be indoctrinated do you have the right
21:13 to not hear CNN or Fox News or anything
21:17 else I think the answer is yes think
21:22 about how many butthurt people out there
21:24 are saying that you know baseball teams
21:26 have to change their names because some
21:28 word and the in the title of their team
21:30 offend somebody people can't wear
21:34 certain clothing to school because it
21:37 offends somebody and these people have
21:40 to pay I just heard a recent story that
21:43 a bunch of video games are getting sued
21:45 because they're not taking into account
21:48 the seeing eye and you know being color
21:54 blind they're not taking into account
21:56 colorblind settings so they're getting
21:59 suit I have been in airports at times
22:03 when things are unraveling these events
22:07 that are you know shootings and all
22:10 kinds of other stuff let's go on it's
22:12 unfolding in an airport and everyone's
22:14 staring at the monitors are trying to
22:15 get the latest information making phone
22:17 calls and blah blah blah the hysteria
22:22 that these stations create is very
22:27 effective for those who are trying to do
22:29 it there was a woman that covered a
22:34 particular school that had an event that
22:36 Alex Jones is in trouble for
22:38 I think revealing
22:41 and she did this really long documentary
22:48 on YouTube about the layers of social
22:51 media that have been built up and how
22:53 they're used to activate the different
22:55 stages in the mind of man to then
22:59 propagate and she talked about how they
23:01 networked the information together to
23:04 then go to stage 2 stage 3 stage 4 to
23:08 push into the mind of man lies as truth
23:13 and if you've been alive for the last 20
23:16 years you've experienced it so many
23:18 times and I think it's maybe time to
23:21 take a look at what our options are now
23:26 the ultimate solution would be to say we
23:28 don't want this stuff around us at all
23:32 you put the gas in your car and you get
23:34 back in your car you don't watch the TV
23:36 you maybe go to an airport and you bring
23:39 your headset so you don't have to hear
23:40 anything
23:42 someone who's got more balls than that
23:44 and more legal knowledge than I have
23:46 should probably file a suit and say I
23:48 don't want to see this crap I'm not here
23:51 to watch the news I'm here to get on a
23:53 plane and go from point A to point B
23:55 I'll look at your TV if it's telling me
23:57 something about the airport how it
23:58 functions where my flight is where my
24:01 relative relatives flight is but I don't
24:04 want to see anything else you go to a
24:06 bar you know the sports is not a bunch
24:11 of propaganda you want to watch your
24:12 favorite team while you're stuck in a
24:14 airport for the four-hour layover and
24:17 the Yankees are playing the Dodgers sure
24:19 that's not propaganda you're just
24:21 watching the game so that's okay
24:24 you want to watch an episode of your
24:26 favorite television show that's fine the
24:29 television show itself could have its
24:30 own little embedded nooks and crannies
24:32 of propaganda but overall it's a
24:35 fictional thing that's being portrayed
24:38 for your entertainment
24:40 cabs very interesting about I don't know
24:45 when Eber started but let's just go back
24:47 10 years within ten years ten years ago
24:52 cabs started having these televisions
24:54 the backseats and so the second year
24:57 ride in the car you're getting hit with
25:00 this propaganda I think about the people
25:04 that orchestrate the world they love
25:06 this they think about it as a gigantic
25:08 brainwashing mind-numbing technique to
25:11 say we got them everywhere they go the
25:13 second they step out of their house
25:15 they're being inundated in some of these
25:18 fools turn on the radio and specifically
25:21 choose to hear propaganda that's aligned
25:24 with their political party but because
25:25 we control it all okay nothing's going
25:30 out that doesn't carry our agenda if if
25:32 some talk-show host gets off script for
25:36 too many days in a row they're gonna get
25:38 a call by their station manager
25:40 the station manager would have gotten a
25:42 call from somebody else and they're
25:44 gonna get a warning you get back on the
25:46 script or you're out we'll rotate you
25:50 out it happens all the time
25:52 now obviously shock jocks and that kind
25:55 of stuff Howard Stern kind of people you
25:58 know I think his shtick probably started
26:02 off as just a very organic thing that he
26:05 was doing he had the guts to do it
26:07 it was sort of funny because it was
26:09 really like unique you know people
26:12 didn't talk like he did he pulled all
26:14 kinds of really tasteless pranks online
26:16 making prank phone calls but then in the
26:19 end because the 90s was all about
26:21 demoralizing the United States of
26:23 America we had a few layers of things
26:27 happening in the 90s it doesn't mean
26:29 that everything created wasn't
26:31 entertaining okay it just means that in
26:33 the center of probably great
26:35 entertainment was a demoralizing message
26:39 you know his show takes off every single
26:43 female that's ever been on a Howard
26:45 Stern episode is asked about their
26:47 sexual preferences and the most specific
26:51 coveted areas that any two people would
26:54 ever share and he brings it right up and
26:55 asks them if they do this particular
26:57 thing it's wild that we put up with that
27:00 stuff but if you've lived in a world
27:05 where you had some moral rules in your
27:07 household and then you break out
27:08 listen to Howard Stern say things that
27:10 your parents would never let you say
27:12 your grandmother would smack you upside
27:14 the head if she ever heard you even
27:15 repeat what he said you feel like you're
27:18 like hehe I'm being naughty I'm getting
27:19 away with things
27:21 porns like that too we had again I
27:25 mentioned this several times The
27:27 Simpsons
27:27 its entire push is that Bart is cool his
27:31 sister's a nerd and you know again when
27:34 I traveled once because the Simpsons
27:36 it's a hilarious show the writers of
27:39 that show are insanely funny I haven't
27:41 seen it a long time but I got friends
27:43 who've seen every single episode since
27:44 it started I remember the first five
27:47 episodes I thought were the the most
27:51 ingenious cartoon scripts I'd ever seen
27:54 in my life but I wasn't paying attention
27:56 to how it was brainwashing the other
27:57 side until I flew back to my home state
28:00 I was in Wichita Kansas
28:02 I just flown in my mom picked me up I
28:05 wanted to get some pizza at the mall
28:06 we go to the mall and he started seeing
28:08 t-shirts worshipping Bart Simpson and I
28:11 can't remember exactly how the caption
28:13 works but the caption on the shirt was
28:15 being a loser
28:16 it is cool that's what it meant and I'm
28:21 looking at it going oh wow this is crazy
28:25 like kids are looking at that shirt
28:26 going I want to wear this shirt I'm
28:28 gonna be an F+ student I'm not gonna
28:31 have a life I'm gonna take [ __ ] on
28:34 everybody who's smart creating more
28:36 sociopathic nerds in this world hmm
28:40 what was the two most popular forms of
28:43 music at least in the United States I
28:45 apologize yeah I don't know what's going
28:46 on in other countries over here in the
28:49 States we had grunge music and then we
28:54 had gangster rap now grunge music was a
28:58 bunch of privileged white kids
29:00 pretending to be broke and pretending to
29:02 have these depressing lives because they
29:04 grew up with a giant silver spoon in
29:06 their mouth again was Alanis Morissette
29:09 was anything but a poor kid and she went
29:12 around portrayed herself and dominated
29:14 the whole decade she's one of the most
29:15 memorable voices and she created some
29:17 amazing songs I mean again the music is
29:20 not to be criticized
29:21 but the message in the overall tone of
29:24 hey let's all go off to salvage army
29:26 places and go buy our clothes and let's
29:33 live like rapport unreal people my
29:36 family got caught up in this I did not
29:41 gangster rap well when you look at NWA
29:46 and their whole goal of showing the
29:50 world what it was like to live in South
29:51 Central hey you can get behind that
29:53 because they were trying to expose
29:55 police brutality drugs the Crips and the
29:59 Bloods all that stuff that was going on
30:01 that nobody knew anything about and I
30:04 think they were largely successful but
30:06 they lived in it it made sense to me
30:09 within what was their message their
30:11 message was to stop police brutality and
30:13 stop this degradation of their
30:16 neighborhoods and they wanted things in
30:19 life and all those dudes got those
30:21 things in life didn't they but the
30:23 previous decade in the 80s you had a
30:25 bunch of rappers coming out saying get
30:27 out of the ghetto do not do drugs white
30:29 lines remember that song you know LL
30:32 Cool J's whole mantra was getting what
30:34 you wanted in life stop whining and
30:36 moaning about how things are hard just
30:38 do it focus man all right it's been 25
30:45 years since that style of music was
30:50 hatched into the culture of America and
30:52 we're still suffering by its standards
30:55 today me Nipsey Hussle just got blown
30:58 away and a lot of people think he got
31:00 blown away because he was promoting a
31:03 bunch of lucid thoughts and especially
31:05 about some cancer cures I look at the
31:09 video him getting shot and I just think
31:11 well it's too bad that he was all tied
31:13 up in the gangster world because after
31:16 now you know now that he's been shot
31:18 history books aren't gonna have any
31:20 problem saying he was shot by one of his
31:22 fellow gangster guys and quite frankly
31:23 he might have been but how many great
31:26 minds have we lost because they got shot
31:29 by somebody and I think there's some
31:33 brilliant rappers out there right now
31:35 that are got one toe in the gangster
31:38 world and one toe in the in the wake up
31:41 world and they're a target it's not a
31:46 mystery the Tupac was blown away by a
31:48 corrupt LA comp that he was set up by
31:51 Suge Knight it's not a mystery that
31:54 Biggie Smalls was blown away in front of
31:57 the Petersons car Museum here in LA with
31:59 a bunch of CIA guys walking around the
32:00 headsets on that's a fact so these two
32:04 guys were murdered to end this feud to
32:07 probably advance some other gen of which
32:09 I am unaware of but now think about what
32:12 we're trying to do let's say you're a
32:14 truther and pick your favorite subjects
32:17 you're probably pounding your social
32:19 media you're talking to your friends but
32:22 how long how much do you get their ear
32:25 you're talking for a post you're talking
32:27 for maybe 30 minutes to a friend maybe a
32:30 couple hours to a friend but the second
32:32 they leave you they're back at the gas
32:34 station the back at the airport they're
32:36 back inside their car listening to the
32:37 radio
32:38 perhaps they turn this crap on when they
32:39 go home maybe everything that they
32:41 subscribe to in social media is full of
32:43 this stuff you do want to know what's
32:46 going on in the world so you got a
32:47 problem you're gonna watch the news look
32:50 at the news and if you don't have a
32:51 filter for how to disseminate things
32:55 that are manipulating propaganda then
33:01 through sheer repetition it will be
33:04 physically and mentally difficult for
33:05 you to constantly erase the BS that's
33:08 been injected into your mind so now this
33:11 the the new game in town and you know
33:15 most of you are completely aware of this
33:17 is to create some alter ego thing online
33:22 that has this feeling of truth perhaps
33:26 disseminates 80% truth 90% truth
33:29 predicts the future even has insider
33:33 information and then poof it turns out
33:38 to be a complete ruse and you've been
33:40 had all of us who believe it there was
33:45 this group on the internet called
33:46 Anonymous right and they are completely
33:49 they mazed I think they still exist but
33:52 the amount of times that they bragged
33:54 about things that they were gonna do it
33:56 just went on for a year after year after
33:58 year of them saying crap they were gonna
34:00 do and nothing happened
34:02 nothing julian assange he's a real deal
34:05 he's not hiding behind some mask he
34:08 really did what they said what anonymous
34:12 said they would do Project Veritas has
34:14 done things that anonymous said they
34:16 would do it's phenomenal now they're 17
34:22 movement man it's a weird one
34:26 it's a SuperDuper weird one what I like
34:29 about the place where we are with the 17
34:31 movement in 2019 is that we we will know
34:36 by the probably by fall of this year
34:40 whether or not that movement is complete
34:42 crap or real and that's nice we can just
34:46 sit back relax not worry about it
34:48 keep our eyes open I will say that pound
34:51 for pound everything that he said would
34:53 happen has either taken place or looks
34:57 like even the propaganda press is having
35:02 a hard time concealing his intent now we
35:05 know that a ton of channels and social
35:08 media outlets have been banned
35:09 completely wiped off the map
35:12 you know it's possible this channel
35:14 could get wiped off the map I have
35:17 feelings that it won't but it could
35:20 luckily we're now finding other places
35:22 to put the videos so it won't really
35:23 matter but you are if we got kicked off
35:27 this platform and we had to go to [ __ ]
35:29 shoot or bright tea on hey without those
35:31 two platforms becoming insanely popular
35:34 we just lost millions of potential
35:37 viewers didn't we not good but that's
35:41 happening and a lot of us are completely
35:44 furious about the fact that the
35:46 administration is sitting there watching
35:48 this now there have been a lot of tweets
35:49 about responding to this lack of freedom
35:52 of speech there needs to be a bill
35:57 passed to protect the First Amendment
35:59 and I don't it doesn't matter what you
36:02 think you are and turn
36:03 for private corporation there used to be
36:05 a point where they didn't let females
36:07 play golf right it's some gentleman only
36:10 late
36:11 yeah gentlemen only ladies forbidden
36:14 that's what golf supposedly stands for
36:16 it's probably [ __ ] but golf doesn't
36:18 make any sense I don't know what the
36:19 hell that word would be in the Latin
36:21 dictionary do heat a small ball and to
36:24 be small their holes you know I don't
36:25 know but they had to petition you got a
36:31 private Country Club and it can't be
36:33 discriminatory against women what was
36:36 the next one up the next one up was Jews
36:38 Jews weren't allowed to be members of
36:40 golf clubs or country clubs I should say
36:45 well they petitioned and they got let in
36:48 and then it was different races like the
36:51 blacks couldn't do it he had to petition
36:54 and they got in we've been here before
36:56 for different agendas and we got to get
36:59 in there again under the same pretense
37:01 to get freedom of speech and forced you
37:04 if you have a some sort of media
37:10 discussion board the only thing that you
37:13 could ban and erase would be a crime
37:17 there's a lot of leeway with that
37:19 there's a tremendous amount of leeway
37:21 with a crime being the reason why things
37:24 get banned I'll give you some examples
37:27 that we'll have to be careful about and
37:28 this show could would have to edit edit
37:31 some of its videos or pull videos down
37:34 completely if this kind of stuff was to
37:36 be enforced one if you threaten
37:40 someone's safety in any way shape or
37:43 form online and a word then you know
37:47 it's happening right now people can turn
37:49 in your comment to the FBI and they can
37:52 come get you with the federal marshal to
37:55 say you just threatened someone's life
37:57 online come with me you're gonna get
37:59 booked and we're gonna get you a record
38:01 going because you obviously can't
38:04 control your mouth you're a big tough
38:05 guy or tough girl when you're all by
38:07 yourself
38:08 posting from wherever you're posting now
38:10 that stuff's calmed down quite a bit
38:12 but if someone gets
38:14 you know you might have a language
38:16 barrier that simply says you start using
38:19 foul language then we have to protect
38:22 you know younger children from seeing
38:24 that younger human beings from seeing
38:26 that and so we we either ban your comet
38:29 from being viewed by people that haven't
38:30 proven their age or we because we don't
38:33 have that feature and our website and
38:35 can't afford it
38:35 we get an exemption to pull out those
38:38 comments because we just can't afford to
38:40 have that go out if you do hate speech
38:44 now there's aged speech that's
38:45 ridiculous and there's hate speech that
38:47 is very real if you're being racist in a
38:51 comment well there you go you're gone if
38:53 you are being hateful in a way that's
39:00 like homophobic or something like that
39:01 you're just way off topic
39:04 you're probably gone I mean you're muted
39:07 out of the conversation you'll see your
39:09 comments but no one else will I wrote
39:11 one of these systems 15 years ago you
39:16 know I have to say this is a little bit
39:17 of a digression but it's something that
39:22 means something to meet different
39:24 nowadays I got into a start-up in 1997
39:27 for a couple years and our product was a
39:31 chat room a Java chat room one of the
39:33 very first ones out there and I had a
39:34 lot of experience writing Internet chat
39:37 rooms and Perl believe it or not and so
39:41 I used to watch and it's so these chat
39:45 rooms were all you know sectioned off
39:46 for topics you know television shows
39:49 whatever but we have one we had this
39:51 whole wing of our site called kids
39:52 corner of course we spelled corner with
39:54 a K to make sure children had no idea
39:56 how to spell that was funny and you
40:00 would have perverts in there constantly
40:03 advertising XXX websites to the children
40:06 they'd write BOTS to inject this stuff
40:08 into the chat room and of course we had
40:11 have moderators and they're pulling that
40:12 out but a little kid could have clicked
40:13 on something or read something heard a
40:15 word and a concept they should never
40:17 here until they choose to corrupt their
40:19 mind as an adult and then when I worked
40:23 and rebuilt Gamescom for Atari
40:27 I was in charge of writing the the
40:29 chatroom technology and I started
40:33 putting together this huge list of
40:35 phonetic words I put a put together
40:38 whole list of words that were actually
40:40 the words that you're not allowed to say
40:41 and then I built a another layer on top
40:44 of that - Rhys Pell all those words with
40:46 every phonetic thing so if it was an F I
40:49 would get rid of ph GH multiple FS I
40:53 mean they do all kinds of wild tricks
40:55 and so we taught the AI every possible
40:58 way these words could be spelled I mean
40:59 so so 10 words might go to 200 words but
41:04 every time you type to chat
41:06 I would parse what you said and then the
41:08 second that you crossed that line I
41:10 would just mute your channel to everyone
41:12 else but you saw your stuff so you
41:14 thought you were knocking it out of the
41:15 park my friends that go to gyms they set
41:19 on treadmills and they watch TV and the
41:22 TV's not always controlled by the
41:24 member' and so you get indoctrinated at
41:30 these little stations maybe you own a
41:33 gym and someone comes in and says you
41:35 know what you should probably have a
41:37 hundred TVs in here and they're like
41:38 yeah if I can afford on our TVs I'd
41:41 probably have the best Nautilus
41:42 equipment - and they go oh new it is
41:44 free it's free in fact we'll even pay
41:46 you to put it in here what it's a
41:49 revenue-generating model and it'll make
41:51 my bored exercising customers happy
41:54 well sure put them all in there poof
41:58 don't forget that you know coca-cola
42:01 which is sold at Disneyland is totally
42:06 free to Disneyland all the syrup gets
42:09 given to Disneyland all the parks around
42:11 the world for free such that when you
42:14 drink that Cola and you're a Disneyland
42:16 and urine printing your mind with some
42:18 of the most and you know cherished
42:20 memories of your life you're gonna go
42:24 home and drink that coca-cola again
42:25 because it represents all these amazing
42:28 memories for you it's free to them well
42:33 as Coke make you healthier it was funny
42:36 you know Disneyland's about eight miles
42:38 from where I'm sitting right now
42:40 and ISTEP season passes when they didn't
42:44 cost a 1,200 bucks
42:46 and I would go and of course the food is
42:49 always Disneyland food you know the food
42:52 that you eat back 10 years ago was very
42:55 very processed and you know it just if
42:58 you're eating an ice cream cone you know
42:59 what you're getting into if you're
43:00 eating ice cream sandwich you're good
43:02 you know what you're getting into but
43:03 you try to eat pizza or pasta or what
43:05 have you
43:06 chicken you know it was good
43:08 old-fashioned greasy ass chicken but
43:13 then Disneyland got this you know bug
43:16 and got a lot of complaints from
43:17 somebody I don't even know who did it
43:19 they had no healthy food choices and I
43:23 remember the first two to three years
43:25 that they started offering fruit
43:28 beautiful fruit men probably all GMO of
43:31 course but they gave you a fruit and no
43:34 one was buying this stuff it would just
43:35 sit there and die and say and the way
43:38 that you know it was gonna die is that
43:40 you but you have a big organization like
43:42 that you can't have anyone going home
43:44 with food poisoning so they have to
43:45 throw all that stuff away at night if
43:46 they don't sell it so when you're
43:48 walking around at night the park closes
43:52 around 12 to one o'clock depending on
43:57 what day you go in the year and you're
43:59 walking around 11 o'clock and you're
44:01 looking at all these food you know these
44:02 some fruit bins and kiosks and they have
44:06 all the same food you saw this afternoon
44:08 and it's starting to look bad that's the
44:11 other thing you know it's been there for
44:13 a while it took a while for people to
44:16 adapt to it and we had to McDonald's
44:18 within the park one in California Park
44:21 and one over by the Mississippi boat
44:29 they're both gone now but they had to
44:33 wait to the lease game you know went up
44:34 on that I just want to make this episode
44:38 because I want you guys to be aware of
44:40 what is around you and I think it's more
44:43 powerful if we have a word for it again
44:46 I can only come up with two words for it
44:48 right now if we can come up with a
44:49 better word for it but it needs to be
44:51 something that's completely
44:52 understandable
44:55 but this is straight-up 1984
44:58 conditioning isn't it everywhere you go
45:01 whatever agenda is on their plate
45:03 disseminated from some ap Reuters
45:06 mechanism there's a reason why all the
45:10 local radio stations around the United
45:12 States of America on any one particular
45:14 week could be spliced together and
45:16 everyone's saying exactly the same thing
45:17 breaking the same story same emphasis on
45:21 the words about how dire these
45:23 situations are every economic collapse
45:27 in the world needs an ingredient
45:32 besides shenanigans that are like the 29
45:35 crash or the subprime loan Dalls loans
45:37 car crash or the savings on crash in the
45:40 80s it needs the people to believe in it
45:45 to believe that there's a reason why
45:47 they're gonna have to tighten their
45:49 belts and go with less and it's always
45:51 that go with less go with less go with
45:53 less but the idea that you need a bunch
45:57 of things that you don't need is also
45:59 right there on top you know I get these
46:04 we have a great electronic store down
46:06 the street called Fry's they are not too
46:09 everywhere in the United States but
46:10 they're spreading I don't think any of
46:12 them are in Europe but it's fr YS and I
46:17 think it's like it's one of them as an E
46:19 and it's the boot company but they are
46:23 selling well they have this thing you
46:26 can sign up and they send you this code
46:27 every single day that what the Cova
46:30 lasts for a week for some product lines
46:32 and some of the codes will only last for
46:34 a day or a weekend or something like
46:35 that as the HP helicopter flies over but
46:42 one of the emails I get every single day
46:44 is the email that sells me a new TV and
46:49 they've got you know God they've got
46:51 like 60 inch 4k televisions for 400
46:55 bucks
46:56 I mean unreal now I used to have the
47:02 well America used to be probably at
47:04 least 20 years ago
47:06 absolutely addicted electronics man it
47:08 was a way you could show off in front of
47:10 your friends you had to have certain
47:11 number of inches on your TV it was
47:13 almost as bad as you know you could date
47:16 a person and they'd say well how about
47:17 TV you know and they were more inclined
47:21 to date you if you had a bigger TV it's
47:22 just strange it's not so much that way
47:24 anymore because I think that again what
47:26 you watch on TV has a diminishing level
47:32 of reward these days but there you know
47:35 there are some great shows out there but
47:37 think about it I have more friends today
47:41 that don't have TVs in their houses than
47:43 ever before I have more friends that say
47:46 you know I don't even watch TV anymore
47:47 more than ever before because we're
47:49 going to our telephones and what the
47:52 telephone allows us to do as much as
47:53 social media might be crappy if you
47:56 don't want to be indoctrinated you
47:58 simply don't subscribe to things and if
48:01 it's using your keywords of things that
48:03 you've searched to determine what you
48:04 should watch or what would be most
48:06 likely appealing to you then you don't
48:09 get the propaganda as much but they're
48:14 trying to change the algorithm right
48:17 what they have said at YouTube is that
48:21 they've modified the recommended and
48:24 trending algorithms to filter out
48:27 conspiracy and so why would you do that
48:32 why do they put you know cyclopædia
48:35 Britannica and Wikipedia links
48:37 underneath some of my videos because
48:39 they're worried that you're gonna change
48:42 your mind that you're going to wake up
48:44 they're actively participating in a
48:47 globalist effort to keep us ignorant
48:50 about the world so one of these things
48:55 that I think that we don't want to
48:58 accept sometimes is what if we're on a
48:59 conspiracy and you can always find the
49:03 videos of that conspiracy organically
49:05 without having to subscribe to a channel
49:07 without having to do a search you're
49:09 always being presented a particular
49:11 conspiracy now at the point of this
49:13 recording I'm not exactly sure which
49:14 ones are promoting which ones aren't but
49:16 sometimes you guys will come into the
49:18 Facebook group
49:19 and you will have noticed that you're
49:22 still getting a ton of a particular
49:24 conspiracy well I think there's a lot of
49:28 evidence to suggest evidence by sheer
49:31 repetition of the pattern that they have
49:35 created a bunch of disinfo conspiracies
49:37 and they want those to be looked at
49:39 constantly and believed now why the
49:43 17:00 movement gets attacked as much as
49:45 it does is really bizarre to me because
49:50 there is a forbidden fruit mechanism to
49:53 the mind of a young person and young
49:55 people of the people they are trying to
49:57 keep from being awake but the articles
50:01 that are written about the 17:00
50:02 movement are aimed towards adults not
50:05 the kids because kids aren't gonna get
50:07 into this you know how you get kids this
50:09 is bad they're not gonna read that
50:11 article kids don't read articles until
50:13 they're probably I don't know 17 18
50:16 years old if they're an early adopter to
50:18 propaganda and normal information which
50:22 is propaganda so this is big saying that
50:25 goes around and I I do like the same
50:27 because we're definitely suffering the
50:30 slings and arrows of this particular
50:31 saying which is you don't get the flak
50:34 Fla K until you're over the target now
50:39 for any reason one of you doesn't know
50:41 what the hell that means that means when
50:43 a bomber or a bunch of fighter planes
50:47 would fly over a target that they're
50:50 about to bomb the flak guns these big
50:53 guns that shoot these rounds that go way
50:55 up in the sky and then they blow up on
50:57 their own before they hit anything and
50:59 they throw shrapnel everywhere it's to
51:01 shred the vehicles flying up in the air
51:04 so you not call the bombers out of the
51:06 sky before they drop their bombs or they
51:08 don't at least hit the sensitive targets
51:09 that drops in a field somewhere if
51:12 you're lucky or over the ocean if you
51:15 can stop before they get over your land
51:17 but we have the weirdest clarifications
51:22 going on now we expect if we say the
51:24 moon hook moon landing was a hoax yeah
51:27 of course they're gonna put something on
51:28 that if I did a dedicated episode to any
51:31 of the assassinations that have gone on
51:32 in the last century famous leaders in
51:36 the 60s they're gonna put disclaimers
51:38 underneath that we expect that there's a
51:41 lot of national pride they're trying to
51:43 protect theirs just don't wake up to
51:46 people doing this kind of algorithms and
51:48 that sort of thing but they put him
51:51 underneath the reptilian episode you
51:56 know I did an episode on reptilian
51:58 aliens and I went back to look at it I
52:00 was like oh my god there's a Wikipedia
52:02 I think link underneath it's talking
52:05 about reptilian aliens and the theory of
52:06 it all why is YouTube driving traffic to
52:11 Wikipedia there is no rev-share there
52:14 they don't own each other
52:15 there's no rev share with Britannica so
52:18 why are they driving traffic directly to
52:20 these websites I mean isn't Wikipedia
52:23 was supported by the people supposedly
52:27 and what's really funny about Wikipedia
52:29 and it's pathetic actually is it we have
52:32 a lot of amazing people in this world
52:33 that have accomplished a lot of amazing
52:35 things but if you try to start a webpage
52:37 in Wikipedia to cover a scientist like
52:39 an Eric Dollard or something like that
52:41 he may have his own page I don't know
52:42 you'll have all these [ __ ] nerd Nazi
52:46 you know information disinfo police
52:50 coming in and turning off your page and
52:52 getting rid of your page and all the
52:53 excuses that they give you are complete
52:56 lies I tried to create some pages for
53:00 some famous rockers and they came in
53:03 there and we're throwing out all the
53:07 changes throwing out the whole page and
53:08 trying to tell me that because the guy
53:10 wasn't dead yet he couldn't have his own
53:12 page I'm like what are you talking about
53:14 every single actor in IMDB that has made
53:18 a blockbuster movie has a Wikipedia page
53:20 whether it be small or big and a lot of
53:22 their spouses get little teeny tiny
53:24 pages you know like a paragraph or two
53:25 they haven't accomplished anything but
53:28 they have their own pages a buddy of
53:30 mine and and I we worked on a book for
53:33 him we published it it sold thousands
53:36 and thousands of copies and so we wanted
53:39 to put in the references section down
53:41 below you get this book if you want to
53:43 know more about this person every single
53:45 Rock
53:46 every single anybody who's in Wikipedia
53:49 can put that at the bottom they kicked
53:53 out the link saying that we were trying
53:55 to sell product you know I've worked
53:59 with the very famous eighties rock band
54:00 and it changed hands it changed
54:03 ownership so the links to the website
54:05 changed from the old guard to the new
54:08 guard but we had to fight it out in
54:11 Wikipedia and we said look you are
54:15 driving misrepresentation to our
54:20 competitor that's been thrown out of the
54:22 band meaning you're throwing them to
54:25 people that can say you know we can't we
54:27 can't drive Univ our customers to the
54:29 tour dates to the next album that's
54:31 coming out any that kind of stuff
54:32 and so I mentioned in one of the
54:35 comments look if we need to get you to
54:38 talk to our legal representation about
54:40 this we will well then that was a double
54:43 strike because we threatened legal
54:44 action against Wikipedia are you [ __ ]
54:47 kidding me
54:48 so someone could put some information
54:51 out there about you link it off to
54:54 someone who hates you and you can't
54:56 change it and if you say look I'm gonna
54:58 legally nail you for this because it's
55:01 defamation they'll double strike your
55:04 account to never be able to touch the
55:06 page until your attorneys do show up and
55:08 try to threaten these people but the
55:10 place is held together by a bunch of
55:12 anonymous nerds out there who I don't
55:15 know what they do to each other to make
55:17 sure that they've got this privilege it
55:20 is as deep state as you could get at
55:22 Wikipedia one of the other elements that
55:25 occurs a lot and it's been changed quite
55:28 a bit and it's happened in all kinds of
55:31 different areas are the rating systems
55:35 for commercial products the first time I
55:40 saw it was when Yahoo when they probably
55:43 still have this but Yahoo's Yahoo has a
55:47 movie section on their website at least
55:50 did I'm sure they probably still have it
55:51 I've gone in a million years because of
55:53 this problem but a movie would release
55:56 and within minutes of it releasing you
55:59 would have tens of
56:00 thousands of comments about how great a
56:02 movie was but once you start reading the
56:05 comments you started seeing the same
56:07 comment over and over again you start
56:09 looking at the accounts that are making
56:10 the comments they joined literally that
56:12 day their English is bad and the movie
56:18 one will not have released in a foreign
56:19 country yet it's that's another funny
56:21 one and so you started to realize these
56:23 studios were paying for essentially
56:27 fraudulent reviews so it's it's
56:30 literally happening someone from a
56:32 studio writes a check to somebody and
56:34 then writes a check to someone overseas
56:35 and you've seen those videos of it's
56:39 China Russia and India will have a
56:42 million cellphones on these like
56:46 bookshelf racks all dialed in sending a
56:50 propaganda about a particular subject
56:52 voting something up
56:54 what happened when Amy Schumer created a
56:57 really crappy show on Netflix
56:59 when efflux had a commenting section and
57:02 a thumb up thumb down when she got
57:06 nailed completely into oblivion for
57:09 creating a horrible show and just you
57:11 know what Amy Schumer's whole game is is
57:13 to sell you demoralization to women to
57:16 get you guys to absolutely screw up your
57:19 life and then feel good about it in the
57:21 end and to continue doing that that's
57:23 what her movies do - she is a shill for
57:27 demoralization you know to each their
57:32 own but if you don't want your kids to
57:33 grow up without a mentality you better
57:36 censor that stuff off the channel or
57:40 dental by the channel so I think Netflix
57:43 went all the way down to just thumb up
57:46 thumb down no comments right they change
57:50 it enough that I don't know exactly
57:51 where it is today once I find out the
57:53 integrity of information is really bad I
57:54 just stop messing around with it but we
57:58 are Ronnie Piper and they live if you're
58:01 awake you see it constantly and you know
58:05 a funny thing was that I had this kind
58:10 verse Asian with a buddy of mine I
58:11 mentioned a bit of the conversation in a
58:13 previous episode here but they're
58:15 talking about God and you know the
58:17 reality of Jesus and all that stuff and
58:21 he's sort of been in it and out of it
58:24 and he still believes that Jesus is a
58:27 real person but you know he doesn't you
58:31 know he lives by a moral code that he
58:32 learned in church and that's just saw
58:34 how he lives sort of like me yep's he
58:37 kept talking about how certain parts of
58:41 certain stories and claims over history
58:43 can't be true because God wouldn't allow
58:44 those things to happen and I said to him
58:47 oh really I said who do you think's run
58:49 in the world right now man if you
58:50 believe in religion and a Satan and a
58:52 God who runs this place right now said
58:55 you know it's Satan right and he count
58:57 looked up and he goes it was like he
58:59 hadn't really thought about it like that
59:00 and he goes well that sure is true isn't
59:02 it and I can see his mind thinking about
59:04 a million different things oh like his
59:06 whole doctrine doesn't work if you think
59:09 God needs to come down and forbid evil
59:11 from occurring then we've been forsaken
59:14 on this planet I don't think that's
59:16 what's going on but that's the attitude
59:18 you'd have to digest at least once in
59:20 your lifetime to understand what's going
59:23 on to get yourself to the next level of
59:25 ok well that's probably not the way it's
59:28 working necessarily there's got to be a
59:30 reason for this and a purpose to this
59:33 rebuilding society from the bottom up
59:36 right that's the theme of this show by
59:39 the end of by probably by the middle of
59:41 season one you know that was literally
59:43 something I was thinking about as I
59:44 chose all the episode topics and again
59:48 season one's a little boring because
59:49 it's all about the fundamentals of human
59:52 nature which isn't as sexy as moon
59:55 missions and flat earth stuff and
59:57 reptilians and aliens and all that kind
59:59 of stuff but it's it's critically
60:01 important to have the conversation and
60:03 if you don't have a circle of people in
60:05 your life that are having that
60:06 conversation then go back to season 1
60:10 remastered deep thoughts radio Calm
60:13 click season 1 get some of those
60:14 subjects refreshed in your mind and just
60:19 while we're on this subject of sort of
60:20 waking up and looking at the world
60:21 differently
60:24 I've had multiple people come to me for
60:27 a little bit of guidance and when I have
60:31 time I will lean in as deep as I can and
60:35 as genuinely as I can to help out but
60:37 I'll tell you the one episode that I
60:39 made a long time ago which I refer
60:40 people to a lot I don't know if anyone
60:42 watches it but because it comes up and
60:45 it seems to play a role in people's
60:46 lives is the friendship episode I think
60:50 it's in season one if it's not there
60:51 it's in season two but it's all about
60:54 the distinction of people that we
60:56 surround ourselves with and to ensure
60:59 that we understand how deeply we know
61:02 individuals so that we don't
61:04 sensationalize them in our lives you
61:07 know you could meet you could meet a
61:11 famous person and while you're with them
61:14 you get along great and they enjoy your
61:16 company and what-have-you but they're a
61:18 very busy person so you when you say
61:21 goodbye to them you may not see them for
61:24 two or three years I've had this happen
61:26 to me many times with some of the people
61:28 I've mentioned to you in this show it
61:31 doesn't mean that if you got back in
61:32 their circle you wouldn't be you know
61:33 right back where you left off but it's
61:37 important that you understand that
61:39 that's sort of your limitation with that
61:40 individual you'll have acquaintances
61:43 that you call your friends you'll have
61:45 people that are just your friends you'll
61:46 call best friends it's important to know
61:49 the difference because this is how you
61:52 build your perception of who you are and
61:55 as you were trying to wake up and get
61:59 this stuff away from you you want to be
62:02 with people that also don't want it
62:03 around them so when you kick up your
62:05 pastimes about how to spend a weekend
62:07 together a day together a night together
62:09 whatever you're not finding yourself in
62:12 a place that you don't want to be one of
62:15 the tough things in America is if you're
62:18 not a drinker
62:19 if you're not a drinker it is it can be
62:24 tough to spend time with people on
62:27 weekends on vacations what have you and
62:31 maybe that's when you let it go maybe
62:32 that's when you do ingest a little bit
62:34 of alcohol but if you are sort of done
62:37 with it you have seen the damage it's
62:40 done to your family and friends you
62:42 don't want it in your body because you
62:43 know it hurts your body it's going to
62:47 make you forfeit in the United States of
62:48 America more than 50% of the choices
62:53 that you have when you hang out with
62:55 people on average and as well there's a
62:59 sort of a back blow situation where if
63:03 you let them know that you don't like to
63:06 drink you will be extra uninvited you
63:10 will have people that were you would
63:11 call your friends and your new
63:12 acquaintances never report back to you
63:16 because they know they drink and they
63:18 feel judged when they're around you
63:20 whether you're doing it or not it
63:22 doesn't matter they don't like the fact
63:25 they drink either and so they have to
63:27 keep you out of their life because it's
63:28 a mirror to their thing that they want
63:32 to quit so how do we get rid of these
63:36 indoctrination stations men I think that
63:41 each each individual example has to be
63:45 handled a different way and I don't know
63:46 what you do about the ones that are
63:47 right in your face and you have to sit
63:49 in a chair waiting for your flight and
63:50 there's not much you can do I know that
63:53 at a gas station you can put the nozzle
63:57 in your tank hit the autofill go sit in
64:01 your car and if everybody at the gas
64:03 station who works there is having to
64:05 deal with this video feed people
64:07 scratching the screens with graffiti or
64:09 whatever maybe that's illegal though I
64:13 would never do something illegal but you
64:15 just never watch it and they're like you
64:17 know what we had this option you know
64:19 it's it's it's the big gas carrier
64:22 that's bringing them these pumps but
64:25 obviously they're taking a kickback from
64:27 the network's
64:28 for people watching their content so
64:31 always some financial thing but if they
64:34 start looking at the numbers and going
64:35 look we're spending a hundred million
64:36 dollars a year putting telling this are
64:39 these little iPads decide gas pumps but
64:42 no one's ever watching them we're not
64:45 gonna do it anymore
64:46 and it could go away like that
64:49 for airports well it's probably two
64:52 techniques to make it fully go away one
64:56 well there's some indirect ways which we
64:58 can talk about in a second but you could
65:00 write a letter to the airport and say I
65:03 don't want to see this stuff and
65:05 obviously they're gonna look at it and
65:06 laugh and throw it away but the more
65:09 those come in all corporations consider
65:12 a single letter of complaint to be worth
65:14 multiple letters of complaint and you
65:17 know I've heard I can't remember what
65:19 industry it was but I heard that in one
65:23 industry and I can't read what the hell
65:24 industry it was but they considered one
65:26 letter ten thousand votes against that
65:30 thing so what if there were ten thousand
65:32 letters you multiply it times ten
65:34 thousand then it starts looking like
65:37 maybe maybe this big giant pain in the
65:39 ass of keeping all these TVs everywhere
65:41 is not worth it no it's probably not
65:43 gonna happen like that for an airport if
65:46 some of you know the legal system really
65:47 well and you know all the inner workings
65:50 of how class-action lawsuits work how
65:53 he's offence lawsuits work where
65:56 someone's you know getting tens of
65:58 millions of dollars out of institutions
66:00 because they were offended about
66:02 something you know all those statues
66:04 that represent the history of the United
66:06 States are being petitioned to be torn
66:08 down someone's handling those cases
66:12 that's obviously pretty frivolous stuff
66:17 but that particular things working now
66:21 what I wouldn't particularly mind is
66:23 that you know CNN has stores inside
66:29 airports now every Airport I go to the
66:33 book stores which sell candy and all the
66:36 other chaat skis that go along with
66:38 wherever they're visiting all the books
66:41 are liberal books every single one of
66:43 them that's something that could be put
66:46 into a lawsuit there's not equal
66:47 representation for the parties when
66:49 stormy Daniels book came out it was on
66:52 the counter in a big pile of her books I
66:56 didn't see anyone walking away with the
66:58 book but they were printed and
66:59 everywhere for everyone to
67:02 because they had a leftist agenda now if
67:05 the normal stores were to do 50/50 split
67:08 representation but you had a choice to
67:11 go to a propaganda Lacey an in-store
67:15 alright well you're a person that knows
67:17 what you're doing you're walking in
67:19 there you're going to a leftist
67:20 organization you're gonna hear leftist
67:22 be use all right maybe the only thing
67:25 that you could do legally is say if
67:26 you're gonna let CNN open a store you've
67:28 must have by law a Fox News store or
67:33 some other store that's going to
67:34 represent the the right in some probably
67:37 propaganda fashion but least it's a
67:38 start right and you know there's what's
67:42 so funny about it is you have these
67:44 religious factions all over the world
67:46 that can get bent out of shape about
67:47 anything and you know those those folks
67:50 could write letters and say I don't want
67:52 my kids seeing any of this stuff it's
67:54 all stuff that our religion doesn't
67:56 allow into the minds of a child so I
67:59 don't want you to have any of it you
68:02 know good luck fighting the head lawsuit
68:05 you know it would be funny that you have
68:08 again this freedom of speech thing that
68:11 some corporation would use the First
68:13 Amendment to keep propaganda in their
68:15 gas tanks or gas stations excuse me at
68:17 the gas pump but you don't have the
68:20 first freedom of speech right to our
68:23 freedom of religion excuse me right to
68:25 keep that stuff out of your family's
68:28 life now a lot of cable boxes and
68:32 definitely media outlets and your
68:35 telephones they all have child
68:36 censorship built in again like I said
68:38 when I learned that Alexa a unit out of
68:43 B Zoe's group I was given one for
68:47 Christmas so I I definitely honored its
68:50 its use but I keep in a very specific
68:53 place in my house that only gets turned
68:54 on when I need to wake up in the morning
68:56 but I asked for it to tell me a bedtime
69:00 story and the thing made me go into my
69:05 app to turn on all this parental crap to
69:07 turn on a bedtime story and I'm sitting
69:09 there going well just don't tell me you
69:12 know slaughterhouse-five to my child you
69:15 know
69:15 just tell me Freaky Friday or something
69:18 you don't have to have me turn on some
69:20 feature to let my child hear a bedtime
69:23 story just don't tell you know the
69:25 original Grimm brothers stories where
69:27 all the kids die at the end you'll be
69:28 just fine
69:30 we have to keep the stuff out of our
69:32 lives again if you're awake you can see
69:35 stuff all day long and it won't affect
69:37 you it'll just if anything it will
69:40 infuriate you a little bit that you know
69:42 it's being played in a bunch of places
69:44 or it's a bunch of people around you
69:45 sitting there just eating it all up the
69:49 main reason why propaganda is so
69:52 destructive to society is that it
69:54 promotes divided hate hate hate hate
69:58 hate that's all it's been meant to do
70:00 the guide the minds away from the ruling
70:03 class back down to the people down below
70:06 so at the bottom of the pyramid hates
70:08 the bottom of the pyramid in their eyes
70:12 No thank you fill me I'm gonna stretch
70:14 this out any longer hopefully you guys
70:16 like the journey please let me know what
70:19 you think about this whole subject down
70:21 below and if you've been able to mediate
70:22 this stuff out of your life please share
70:24 your techniques if any of you can think
70:27 of any other strategies to legally start
70:30 pounding these things out of our lives
70:32 please share it if nothing else don't
70:35 share it and go off and do those things
70:37 some of you people are geniuses at this
70:40 stuff or you know people who are
70:41 geniuses at this stuff people have gone
70:44 through similar lawsuits in one don't
70:46 round up those people go round up the
70:48 attorneys the law firms and say look you
70:51 could make a ton of money getting a
70:52 settlement out of this thing why not
70:54 bring all that money into your
70:55 partnership anyway if you haven't been
70:59 to deep thoughts radio.com please go
71:00 it's where you can change feeds from
71:01 audio to video there's a locked Facebook
71:04 group with some of the coolest most
71:05 tolerant really tolerant people in the
71:07 world we don't promote divide we have a
71:10 Twitter account in case you want to get
71:11 the feed that way it's starting to grow
71:13 we have two ways to donate to the site
71:16 we have patreon calm it's in the link
71:20 down below and we have a PayPal link on
71:21 the website again as I will say several
71:25 times we have an all-new season 1
71:26 remastered channel on YouTube
71:29 it will only ever have as far as I can
71:32 tell now only ever have a hundred
71:34 episodes in fact it won't have all
71:36 hundred because I redid episode 17 and I
71:41 decided at the last second to go ahead
71:43 and put it into the season four as a
71:46 brand new episode which I think it's 374
71:48 somewhere in there it's the whole new
71:51 round of information that episode will
71:53 most likely get redone as I refined the
71:55 information and I forgot to mention one
71:58 of the keywords I can't remember who
72:01 exactly posted me maybe it was Tim or
72:03 Dave one of listeners posted into the
72:07 Facebook group about apricot seeds being
72:10 banned in Australia and I can't imagine
72:13 that actually being true because there's
72:16 a lot of these if you looking at a
72:17 website with just this crazy URL
72:19 please understand that's probably fake
72:22 news on a whole new level people just
72:25 trying to get you to click bait into
72:27 seeing advertising they don't even care
72:28 what they say they have no agenda
72:29 whatsoever except to beat you over but
72:34 the effect that b-17s in your body is
72:36 called the cyanide effect and so I
72:40 described it on an atomic level when you
72:43 referenced it in other conversations
72:45 they will talk about the cyanide effects
72:47 and that is essentially how it performs
72:51 when you eat cyanide it attacks your
72:52 nervous system that's why you dies I
72:54 understand it so it's attacking cancer
72:56 and everything else that's innovated in
72:58 your body on that level so that's a
73:00 little correction or addition to how
73:04 that actual vitamin works in your body
73:07 it will be a sad day if everything that
73:09 cures cancer is prescription-only or
73:12 outright banned but the idea that you
73:15 know go to any drug store in America
73:18 it's not some health food store try to
73:20 find b-17 and they won't even know what
73:22 you're talking about
73:23 that's your sign yes that's the sign
73:26 that it really works and it's gonna put
73:28 oncologists out of business globally we
73:31 are on bit shoot now so it's the
73:33 channels name is deep thoughts just by
73:35 itself I wanted to get that one because
73:40 that's how people kind of refer to it as
73:42 opposed to deep thoughts radio radio I
73:44 put on there because I thought this was
73:47 gonna actually are on the in theory do
73:49 station we had the previous channel on
73:50 MKULTRA video so anyway until we do
73:54 another episode take care of yourself
73:56 and someone else and I'll see on the
73:57 next deep thoughts over now
