00:29 good evening ladies and gentlemen today
00:33 on deep thoughts we're gonna go deep
00:36 really deep into the concept of living
00:41 in a matrix this episode wouldn't be
00:45 possible if I had made all the other
00:46 episodes about similar thinking so this
00:54 is called matrix programming and what is
00:57 it gonna be about well this is gonna be
01:01 about a an exercise this is something we
01:04 would do at deep thoughts University
01:07 where we're gonna pull back and we're
01:09 gonna say okay a lot of people have this
01:11 feeling of the matrix especially since
01:13 the movie in 1999 we have a word for it
01:15 which is fantastic and again how great
01:18 is that you know not having a word for
01:21 something means that trying to
01:22 accomplish it's gonna be increasingly
01:24 difficult to you know conversate about
01:27 but now what has been the sort of
01:32 scientific pontification is about being
01:37 in a matrix you have individuals who are
01:39 scientists computer scientists
01:43 physicists cosmologists people who study
01:46 the universe and how its put together of
01:48 course they're all standing on the
01:49 shoulders of probably Tesla's Arabic
01:54 geniuses Gesell's they're a front you
01:56 know with Einstein of absolute
01:58 theoretical moon deceivers Tesla being
02:04 one of the last people who got
02:07 everything you know but what you'll read
02:11 if you get into articles in rags about
02:14 people saying well you know there is a
02:16 lot of evidence that we could
02:17 potentially live in a computer
02:18 simulation all right and they're trying
02:21 to find correlating evidence in the
02:23 universe that correlates with how we
02:25 program computers okay it's not a bad
02:29 approach what are you gonna do you gotta
02:31 deal with you gotta use things that you
02:33 understand and things that the world
02:34 understands
02:36 probably one of the toughest things to
02:38 do is if you were to ever advance your
02:39 thinking beyond your ability to
02:41 articulate and explain it to another
02:42 human being then you would be stuck in a
02:44 vacuum of perhaps all knowledge without
02:46 the capability of sharing with another
02:48 human being well yours truly was an
02:52 engineer from a very young age I watch
02:56 computers come up from the late 70s I
03:01 became a programmer technically at I
03:06 guess you could see more 13 but I
03:10 dabbled in you know binary illustrations
03:13 at night at 11 excuse me because of my
03:15 uncle you guys know this story if you're
03:18 listening if you're listeners but what I
03:21 want to do is take us up to another
03:23 level of thinking and you guys are ready
03:28 you're hardcore people are absolutely
03:29 ready for those of you who just joined
03:31 the show because of a referral or you
03:33 just slipped into this episode I hope
03:35 you're ready I hope you're gonna really
03:37 enjoy this and if you dig this kind of
03:39 talking this is what the whole shows
03:40 about like subscribe all that good stuff
03:44 what is a program at its most
03:47 fundamental state what is a program how
03:51 would you describe it to so first year
03:53 students and perhaps junior high
03:56 you've even grade school a little bit
03:58 easier in junior high much easier in
04:00 high school because kids program at all
04:04 levels today it is wonderful I mean this
04:06 conversation is not even remotely
04:08 difficult like it was when I was a kid
04:10 but it's a collection of instructions to
04:13 tell a bunch of hardware what to do and
04:16 when to do it there are a series of
04:19 instructions that are gonna run
04:21 regardless of anything that you do with
04:23 the program once you tell it to run and
04:25 then there's a bunch of commands and
04:28 instructions that are waiting for you to
04:30 interact with the hardware device via a
04:33 mouse a keyboard maybe a touchscreen
04:35 maybe a bunch of other wild devices and
04:38 then it's going to do something based on
04:42 what you do I'm supposed to do the right
04:44 thing whatever you want it to do video
04:46 games are a great example you
04:48 such a thing your character moves so we
04:52 need to put that in our brain this part
04:54 of our quiver we're getting ready for
04:56 this battle this conversation here to
04:59 hopefully unlight ourselves enlighten
05:01 ourselves even further as to how this
05:02 could possibly have come together so
05:06 when we think about our reality we
05:10 usually from a physics standpoint the
05:15 bits and pieces that the universe is
05:17 made out of because physicists have the
05:19 responsibility of determining what are
05:22 the Lego blocks to build this universe
05:25 then once they figure out the subatomic
05:27 reality of our existence as best they
05:30 can with their albeit very close minded
05:34 thinking they hand up those sheets to
05:39 your people like cosmologists which go
05:41 okay so these are the fundamental pieces
05:43 and a chemist will go one way and a
05:45 biochemist to go the other way but
05:47 they're looking at okay well maybe the
05:48 earth is made like this maybe the Suns
05:51 made like that etc etc but even that
05:54 divides up really quickly because the
05:57 person is trying to prove the human body
05:59 which is an organic entity is sort of in
06:04 a completely different wheelhouse of
06:06 thinking then someone is trying to
06:07 figure out why rock stacks up the way it
06:10 stacks up what is a diamond exists where
06:13 the hell does cruel should come from why
06:15 is this Sun hot why doesn't it burn out
06:17 why does the earth expand 19 centimeters
06:21 a year
06:22 why did when we hit the the moon it rang
06:25 like a bell hmm if we indeed did that I
06:30 think it's very interesting when NASA
06:33 admitted that it's land a big piece of
06:36 copper we believe into the South Pole of
06:38 the moon to kick up a bunch of dust so
06:41 they could look at it in a spectrogram
06:43 try to find out what its chemical
06:44 composition was they said it ring like a
06:46 bell all right what's a weird thing to
06:49 say if they didn't do it
06:50 I think hurling a big piece of copper
06:52 out it's probably possible or though so
06:54 where it is and how big it is
06:56 so we have that tangible reality that we
06:59 always refer to on the show mmm how does
07:03 this show come about well it's a bunch
07:06 of inanimate hardware that exacerbates
07:10 the flow of electrons electrons made
07:14 possible by ether all collisions at
07:17 various speeds ether is called different
07:19 things at a very high speed is called
07:21 plasma at a slower speed it's called an
07:24 electron or proton a neutron etc so we
07:29 have all that tangible stuff too but
07:32 then we have a whole nother realm that
07:34 is ignored by scientists categorically
07:38 maybe your psychologist will think about
07:42 it
07:43 your psychiatrist might think about it
07:45 and that stuff's called love hate anger
07:49 happiness indifference the emotional
07:52 layer your Kurt's Wells you're sort of
07:56 pseudo neurologists will say oh that's
07:59 just a bunch of chemical states in your
08:01 brain they create all these amazing
08:03 passionate things and then you see a
08:07 little video of a crab protecting his
08:09 crab friend or his crab girlfriend or
08:11 whatever and little human reaches out
08:13 and grabs the claw of the one that's
08:15 being hugged and the little crab just
08:18 looks over and [ __ ] takes his little
08:20 claws get the hell away from me that she
08:22 sets the look like a girl right away the
08:25 whole thing's like a girl there's a dude
08:26 around her he could tell there and start
08:28 swatting the hand get away from her you
08:29 know he comes back over and hugs his
08:30 girlfriend right amazing okay so if
08:36 we're gonna talk about a matrix
08:37 programmer we got to take all this into
08:40 account these are the bits and pieces of
08:42 which the programmer creating the
08:45 instruction set will have to deal with
08:48 what else is out there that governs this
08:51 whole thing
08:53 well you can't hear me create phonetic
08:58 expressions in what Mike Myers so
09:01 beautifully called syllables if you
09:04 don't have the concept of time passing
09:09 now we've struggled with time on this
09:10 show I've got a whole episode on it at
09:12 time travel episodes I've got just
09:15 straight-up time episodes I believe but
09:17 it's all about the accumulation of state
09:21 changes in some database that exist
09:25 somewhere that we have access to our own
09:27 personal little database hmm for any of
09:32 you who have meditated on a subject and
09:34 you feel like you've dragged truth out
09:36 of the universe without reading a book
09:38 and you're able to deduce something big
09:41 sort of beyond your academic adventures
09:45 you start to think hmm I think there's a
09:49 database that's like the database and I
09:51 have the ability to construct a query
09:54 send it out to the universe and get an
09:57 answer back
09:58 but I must construct a query that I
10:01 understand and I must ask for as a
10:04 database programmer the field data
10:07 coming back that I will understand when
10:10 I give an example a database record is
10:13 nothing more than a little you know five
10:18 by three note card with some stuff on it
10:21 when you used to have recipe boxes go
10:24 between family members right
10:26 it was always these are the ingredients
10:28 you need in the amounts you need and
10:29 then here's the here are the
10:30 instructions on how to put it all
10:31 together how to set your oven up how to
10:34 mix everything together what order to
10:36 mix things together what not to do what
10:38 to do cook angel cake and you'll find
10:40 out there's a lot of tricks with just
10:41 constructing a cake the angel cake can
10:45 fall if it falls you have angel mud so
10:50 time is an element there seems to be you
10:55 know this rien sub interests in time
10:58 travel because of some interesting miss
11:02 directions on line one of them being
11:05 that project Looking Glass which I did
11:08 an episode on if you'd like to dive into
11:09 that please see that episode but the
11:12 subject matter comes up and I'm going to
11:13 just reacquainting
11:16 what we're going
11:19 but it's interesting how when you first
11:22 conceived of time it's always a very
11:24 linear thing I was young once and now
11:27 I'm not so young that was small once and
11:29 I'm not so small anymore if you've ever
11:33 seen a friend pass away due to old age
11:35 or relative or something you understand
11:39 that we have a limited time on this
11:40 planet no matter how creative we are
11:42 about the subject matter and so
11:45 time-travel stories typically adhere
11:49 initially to a linear time theory what's
11:53 that mean well if you go back to 1865
11:55 you might meet Abe Lincoln and your time
11:59 frame if you killed Abe Lincoln he won't
12:02 exist in your future when you go back
12:04 home to your time like you had him in
12:07 your books you killed him not John
12:08 Wilkes Booth if you killed Hitler when
12:10 he was a baby well world war ii doesn't
12:12 happen at least the way that they
12:14 planned it and pulled it off okay so
12:19 it's linear time travel lately on the
12:22 internet I find it fascinating that a
12:24 lot of people seem to be making these
12:25 videos about project Looking Glass and
12:27 their profound statement at the
12:29 beginning of the episode as if they have
12:34 the I don't know the coup de Gras of all
12:38 time travel information they're going to
12:40 let their audience know the time is
12:42 nonlinear what's that mean well that
12:45 means that there is more than one time
12:48 happening at the same time that there's
12:51 two versions usually since the way it's
12:54 told there's two versions of you there's
12:55 two versions of everything it's ever
12:57 happened and they jump to the other time
12:59 they make some changes and they come
13:01 back to this time supposedly there's
13:03 value there right it's two different
13:05 universes man if that were true a
13:09 mathematician a physicists will often
13:13 look at that and say well if there is
13:15 non linear time meaning multiple times
13:18 at the same time then one must
13:20 instantaneously acknowledge that there
13:22 is infinite time meaning every possible
13:26 conceivable thing that could happen in
13:29 the universe at any time or place
13:33 has happened and if you are traveling
13:37 between these frequencies between these
13:40 frequencies of time then you are merely
13:42 viewing into someone else's time and it
13:44 has nothing to do with your own it would
13:47 be like waking up from a dream and
13:49 holding an object that you dreamed about
13:51 your dream is its own time frame you
13:55 know that you can't take something out
13:57 of a dream and pull it into this world
13:59 because it only exists in that time so I
14:03 find these conversations about time and
14:05 the project Looking Glass to be
14:06 absolutely infinitely hilarious and
14:09 wholly inaccurate as to what comes out
14:12 of their mouth next because their theory
14:15 is that you can go look at another time
14:16 find a prediction come back into your
14:18 time and it applies well maybe you know
14:22 if you were to do an infinitely tiny
14:23 slice of the time difference then that
14:27 time frame is almost identical to yours
14:29 maybe my hair you know number 27 is a
14:32 little bit over here well if there's if
14:34 at a time my hair is in every particular
14:37 state it could possibly be and yet
14:39 everything else was the same all those
14:42 universes would exist
14:44 hmm but now when I write a program today
14:49 regardless of where the program is
14:51 located in the world in your telephone
14:54 in your toaster and your TV or on the
14:56 internet and your computer is a video
14:58 game or whatever what it's really doing
15:01 is it's merely managing electrons
15:04 through transistors it is loading up
15:08 memory in particular States
15:10 it is also transposing the more fluid
15:14 electricity as goes through the
15:15 circuitry in your computer sometimes
15:18 down to a hard drive down to flash
15:21 memory and it stores it it stores a
15:24 previous state I wrote a letter to my
15:26 mom oh there it is I wrote her that
15:29 letter in 1987 and I saved it on a
15:31 floppy then when floppies were going out
15:34 of style I transferred it onto my hard
15:36 drive there for backup reasons I put it
15:38 on a disk the hard drive went away I
15:40 resurrected the disk out of my garage
15:41 when I just were going out I put it into
15:45 the cloud and now I still have
15:47 documents from 1987 with all their
15:50 misspellings okay but what if I said to
15:56 a programmer today especially a young
15:58 kid let's say he's like he or she is
16:01 like will do she today I say to her hey
16:04 do you just write a program yep
16:08 what does it do she shows me a little
16:10 games that she made I said man that is
16:12 amazing you are one incredible kid and
16:15 your future is gonna be as bright as you
16:16 could possibly imagine it so think big
16:19 dream big because you can get everything
16:21 that you can conceive of that can happen
16:24 in this universe and she smiles and
16:27 thinks about herself you know it's good
16:30 but now what if I said to her you know
16:33 what you should do for your next program
16:34 and she says what I said well you should
16:38 write a program that changes the color
16:41 of your laptop and she goes what yeah
16:45 you know your laptops like this aluminum
16:48 color right yeah well once you make it
16:51 like purple why don't you write a
16:53 program the change is the outside of the
16:54 metal to have like your favorite movie
16:56 poster on it she's like what are you
16:59 talking about you can't do that I said
17:03 why not the Z's it's not part of you
17:06 know the programming world it's it's the
17:09 computer body on the outside has nothing
17:12 to do with what the program can control
17:16 now we've opened up where I need our
17:19 brains to be in order to have this
17:22 conversation about a matrix programmer
17:25 someone asked me recently do you think
17:28 we've discovered mathematics or did we
17:31 create mathematics well I think the
17:35 answer is pretty clear but I appreciate
17:37 the question which is we do discover it
17:42 but what's interesting about mathematics
17:44 is it's sort of like our time argument
17:48 someone might say well I discovered
17:50 addition I discover subtraction
17:52 multiplication and division okay so you
17:55 have the building blocks for mathematics
17:58 there are plenty of other up
18:00 Raiders that exist in mathematics
18:02 especially when you get into coding that
18:04 do interesting things to numbers
18:08 converts them from base-10 to base-2 to
18:12 base 16 all these different things but
18:18 now if you're gonna build a universe I
18:21 mean let's just face it even if you
18:25 believe the place is flat inside of a
18:27 snow globe or you think it's a
18:29 heliocentric ball flying in space it's a
18:32 big place there's a whole lot of stuff
18:36 moving around right there's a whole lot
18:38 of this math stuff that we talked about
18:40 which slow-moving
18:42 ether and so I don't know how do you
18:47 just write a program that would change
18:50 things that seem to be set in motion
18:53 right when you learn about electronics
18:57 they usually teach you very quickly in
18:59 electronics that electrons move a lot
19:01 like water and you know why because it's
19:05 ether and ether moves exactly like water
19:08 ether is the ogee water just so that you
19:11 know and everything that's built from it
19:13 operates just like it the blood moving
19:15 through the vessels in your body the
19:18 reason why the arteries in your lungs
19:19 look exactly the branches on a tree it's
19:24 because it's the same mathematics but
19:27 now let's think about it if you wanted
19:32 to write some security software whereby
19:35 if you leave your computer for a certain
19:38 amount of time maybe even some super
19:40 advanced software and if you literally
19:41 walk away from your computer certain
19:43 number of feet that's an indicator
19:45 you're no longer paying attention to
19:47 your computer and it just takes whatever
19:49 is on the screen and puts up the padlock
19:52 interface in case some other human being
19:54 comes up to the computer and it says I
19:56 who the hell are you or it senses you
19:58 were entering the room from the bathroom
20:00 or wherever you went and it reads your
20:02 bio signature and it opens your computer
20:04 back up so at all times your computer
20:06 safe as long as you're in proximity of
20:08 it perhaps is reading your face and
20:10 saying he or she is looking at the
20:12 computer now let's let him see the
20:14 monitor
20:15 mm-hmm well as an engineer you could
20:20 pretty much even not even be in a coder
20:22 you could probably conceive of at least
20:24 theoretically how that would work
20:26 something in the room is sensing where
20:28 you are how you're orientated towards
20:30 the computer or away from the computer
20:32 what if when you looked away from the
20:34 computer to grab a piece of paper off
20:35 the printer it sensed your face it
20:39 wasn't looking at the monitor and it
20:40 just blocked it off and as soon as your
20:43 face comes back around with uh
20:44 split-second it comes back
20:46 well something would be running on the
20:48 side you'd be running your favorite
20:50 applications on your operating system of
20:53 choice and this other product is taking
20:56 in data and then scraping the screen and
20:59 protecting you something is intervening
21:02 in the natural flow of your computer's
21:05 operation hmm matrix programmer there
21:10 becomes this sort of chicken and egg
21:12 thing with the matrix concept as it
21:15 applies to engineering now what I'm
21:19 gonna say is almost well it is
21:22 inconceivable and it's totality but it's
21:26 not inconceivable and a very basic
21:27 theory which would be this it's pretty
21:31 of you've played normal pool you have 15
21:37 balls you rack them up into a triangle
21:42 shape you put the cue ball on one side
21:44 you hit it and that sets the game in
21:47 motion that really sets up all the moves
21:49 let's see maybe a ball goes in you have
21:51 a color you somehow can get the eight
21:54 ball to go in you win the game play nine
21:56 ball it's a lot easier but there's this
21:59 set it up and punch it thing you don't
22:04 interact with the balls during the break
22:06 I mean you hit it and then after the cue
22:09 ball transfers its potential energy
22:11 directly into the first ball and then it
22:13 starts distributing all this energy
22:16 something's occuring now you could be a
22:19 jerk and reach over and touch the balls
22:21 but we don't do that do we you let it do
22:23 its thing and it creates a state when
22:27 it's all over
22:28 balls are done moving around well we're
22:32 in a universe where there appears to be
22:35 a fundamental particle called an ether a
22:39 particle it is just as nothing as you
22:44 could possibly imagine meaning it has no
22:46 electrical charge to it it has no color
22:48 necessarily it is just this particle it
22:51 moves very very quickly
22:52 not infinite as far as we know maybe we
22:55 have been able to sense it moving
22:56 anytime any faster than 50 times the
22:58 speed of light but it is everywhere
23:01 there are gobs and gobs these little
23:04 guys everywhere and it's moving
23:11 everything it's renewing everything like
23:13 I've said you are a being that is being
23:15 renewed every nanosecond probably even
23:19 however we could parse time down to the
23:22 smallest increment that's how fast
23:24 you're being fully renewed as a human
23:26 being everything that you see is being
23:29 renewed because all you're seeing is
23:32 trapped ether creating that thing this
23:35 cigar is trapping the currents of ether
23:39 to create it but since they've agreed on
23:42 the pattern of trapping its remains this
23:46 fermented tobacco in my hand now the tip
23:49 is a little more excited because it's
23:52 thermal izing and burning and turning
23:54 into its fundamental particle carbon so
23:58 we like to think about the matrix and we
24:01 like to think about it being something
24:03 where perhaps like in the movie The
24:05 Matrix where this character mr. Smith
24:07 kept pushing himself all around the
24:10 matrix and taking over bodies and things
24:12 that there would be some form of code
24:13 that's operating which allows the fabric
24:16 of this matrix to be intervened changed
24:20 on demand by either an engineer or sub
24:25 program that's running just like the
24:27 security software but now let's think
24:31 about it we just had a problem
24:34 conceiving of a few things because it
24:36 has the little word infinity associated
24:38 with it
24:39 Infinity's really tough for man to
24:41 conceive of in fact I would wager that
24:43 no one has ever conceived of infinity in
24:45 its true sense I want you to think of
24:48 every number that exists though that
24:50 can't be done we just don't have it
24:54 which I describe as limited by design
24:59 you can only fit so many gallons of gas
25:02 in your gas tank and then it can accept
25:04 any more without some serious distortion
25:08 of time and space inside the tank right
25:11 is the universe made out of infinite
25:14 particles mmm we don't know we don't
25:17 know it would seem it would be it would
25:20 be limited but if it's infinite then the
25:21 whole thing is infinite and therefore
25:23 then the matrix itself becomes
25:25 inconceivable but conceptually something
25:30 we can talk about if we were to be a
25:33 matrix coder then our program language
25:38 in the devices by which we save our
25:40 instructions which may be a primitive
25:42 way of even thinking about it because we
25:45 are humans we are dogs and you're cats
25:48 we're dolphins we are planets we are
25:50 mountains these things are finite
25:54 creations which come with their very
25:56 designs which instill limitations we
26:02 don't think about programs like that at
26:04 least most people don't I don't think we
26:07 have really until we get quantum
26:09 computing up and 100 percent accurate on
26:11 a daily basis would say perhaps 300
26:13 cubits per computer we're not really
26:15 capable of doing that ourselves but we
26:19 create facts similes all the time don't
26:21 we they're called video games what's
26:24 funny is I think that there are
26:25 obviously tens of millions of kids
26:27 playing video games every single day I
26:30 think that probably less than a fraction
26:33 of a percent of them ever conceived of
26:35 that game as being a duplicate of their
26:37 universe they actually live in because
26:41 of my heritage with computers of video
26:42 games in general having 25 years total
26:46 in the business I can conceive of the
26:48 whole thing when I play World of
26:51 Warcraft I can't conceive of
26:54 every single step that Blizzard
26:56 Entertainment went through to create the
26:58 game from the network package design to
27:02 the blade server designs to the overall
27:05 narrative of the story the NPCs the the
27:09 real player characters like me in there
27:11 as I move around the world flying on a
27:14 disk or something I see it in memory
27:16 moving around and I still know that
27:22 there's a massive difference between
27:24 that and what we're doing but if you
27:27 think about it metaphorically speaking
27:29 maybe even technically speaking you
27:31 can't do everything you want in a video
27:33 game you characters simply can't do it
27:35 it's been limited by design
27:37 I think mathematics is nothing more than
27:42 the rule set that is essentially the
27:45 transistors inside your computer the
27:47 logic gates which decide on a yes/no
27:50 argument what to do next but imagine now
27:54 trying to be a programmer for the matrix
27:58 some people might call that God I don't
28:02 disagree but now imagine taking the the
28:08 input that a human does to write a
28:10 program which are essentially some
28:12 commands that we've all decided on the
28:16 data that we're creating which is
28:19 usually unique to our product
28:21 you know there's counting software and
28:24 we're pressing software press software
28:25 we're pressing software etc etc no
28:30 matter how fancy our program gets it's
28:31 still using the same basic commands to
28:35 create that experience as the hardware
28:38 enhances so does the interaction with
28:40 the user we might gain a few more inputs
28:42 think about a smart phone we now use our
28:44 fingers all the time to talk to the
28:46 screen which think it's interpreted to
28:49 the traditional keyboard inputs or the
28:50 mouse device inputs but now you're a
28:54 matrix programmer and you're having to
28:57 create something that's gonna make sense
28:59 out of this massive massive soup which
29:03 are all the things that we've talked
29:05 about on this episode so far
29:07 and out of it matter of all different
29:09 states it's one simple basic thing at
29:11 the beginning but boy howdy does they
29:14 create a bunch of different stuff
29:15 doesn't it Wow
29:18 well how do they create a level and a
29:20 video game someone designs the whole
29:22 experience and it's an emotional
29:24 experience that's what it's supposed to
29:26 be the most simple video game had an
29:28 emotional experience in pong it was you
29:33 lost track of the ball it went off on
29:34 your side or you made your opponent lose
29:36 the ball a little pong thingy and you
29:40 felt either a state of euphoria because
29:42 you won or you felt bad because you lost
29:45 it then it advanced up to arcade games
29:49 and you know space invaders you were
29:52 killing an enemy that was the metaphor
29:55 there well then you would get killed
29:57 yourself if you didn't play it right on
29:59 and on and on miss pac-man got a little
30:01 bit of a story with some animations
30:03 pac-man had it too then it got into real
30:07 stories and now they're movies they're
30:09 better than movies half the time I have
30:12 played World of Warcraft since 2005
30:14 that's 15 years man all right but now
30:20 you are responsible for all the minutiae
30:23 of life I want you to think for one
30:25 second about the the amount of
30:28 experiences that you've had that you
30:30 could probably well you would have a
30:34 very hard time describing your entire
30:36 life because how much time would it take
30:38 you it would take you more years than
30:41 you're alive to describe the life that
30:42 you've lived because any one second is
30:44 worth days and days and days of
30:48 description and you know you're still
30:49 gonna miss it if I had to describe right
30:50 now what's in my back yard to you with
30:53 the microphone and a video camera
30:55 recording and infinitely I'd be here for
30:58 a month and I'd still be oh oh and then
31:01 there's this one you know all the Leafs
31:03 on the Sun the IV that's on my back
31:06 fence how do I describe all those and
31:09 then there's what it's going left and
31:11 then there's one that's going right
31:13 what's interesting about the matrix as I
31:17 think there's an imperative that comes
31:19 with it
31:20 and it's a definite paradox of just the
31:29 sheer concept of existence let's say the
31:33 matrix didn't exist the universe but
31:37 there's some party out there that wants
31:39 to make it it could be a single life
31:43 force it could be some alien somewhere
31:46 where the hell are they what's keeping
31:49 them alive are they made of one of the
31:52 things and not all the things maybe
31:53 they're the pure emotional love energy
31:55 that goes around that we don't talk
31:57 about because we can't touch it and put
31:58 it in a jar but at some point that being
32:02 that entity is going to have to conceive
32:04 of what hasn't been created yet and
32:08 because we know we live in a fairly
32:10 solid universe right outside of things
32:13 like Mandela effects or weird things
32:15 that happened to us this place is solid
32:18 man
32:19 you know I haven't turned in anyone else
32:22 my whole lifetime that I know of the the
32:25 chairs and the table that I put in the
32:27 intro a long time ago they're still
32:28 right in front of me and they've never
32:30 been anything else but that chair in
32:31 that table I've painted in white a
32:32 couple times to get rid of the rust
32:34 clean them off every once a while it's
32:38 solid but that's hardly an example of
32:42 what's actually going on in this
32:43 universe how many people have lived on
32:46 this planet
32:47 supposedly we have about 7.5 billion
32:51 people well it's probably safe to say
32:54 we've had at least double that in the
32:55 past probably okay how many little tiny
33:02 experiences and huge experiences have
33:04 all those human beings had by themselves
33:06 and then with all their family and
33:09 friends and people that don't even know
33:13 it starts to get to that infinite word
33:16 again putting on your beliefs of how the
33:19 planet was created or the universe was
33:21 created how many experiences happened
33:23 before us how many gonna happen
33:25 afterwards
33:27 so was there a moment when this actually
33:34 started because that's what the matrix
33:36 implies it wasn't here someone wrote the
33:40 program and they hit run well if you
33:44 study quantum computers and their
33:47 targeted capabilities by the end of this
33:51 century remember that three hundred
33:54 qubits can conceive of all the grains of
33:58 sand and probably all the atoms not not
34:01 ether particles because they don't
34:03 acknowledge that exist because that
34:04 explains everything you can know that
34:06 but all the subatomic particles that
34:09 we've identified - the quarks for the
34:12 entire universe which is three hundred
34:14 qubits now it's not stable yet so it's
34:18 got a lot of errors when they try to do
34:19 calculations even a fraction of a
34:22 percent of an error is going to kill the
34:24 whole system we could unreliable but
34:27 let's say you that by the end of this
34:29 century we have a thousand qubits that
34:31 can fit in your hand
34:33 it's your new cell phone that means in
34:36 your hand you could hold something that
34:38 might get to the point where they could
34:40 conceive of all of the ether particles
34:42 in the universe all at once hmm wouldn't
34:48 that be something there's the theory of
34:52 the Big Bang and as it's been explained
34:55 it never happened for sure it defies all
35:02 real theories of gravity it defies
35:05 physics as it exists today it just never
35:07 happened however you go back to the
35:11 break in the pool hall the cue ball hits
35:15 the other balls and sends them into
35:17 motion because we're pretty certain that
35:22 what you know Tesla - Faraday and then
35:24 Eric Dollard tracked with ether
35:26 particles there's a fundamental particle
35:28 hey maybe there's something underneath
35:30 that maybe it's made out of a few little
35:31 things who knows maybe was a couple
35:33 different sizes who knows
35:36 this place is moving this place is
35:39 constantly fluid and yet we do have
35:42 things in this universe we have emotions
35:45 in this universe when I saw Walt Disney
35:48 at Disneyland walk up to me and tell me
35:51 that Bob ger the Imagineer was over
35:54 there in Tomorrowland said so that I
35:56 should go say hi to him well I don't
35:59 think I need to tell you that Walt died
36:01 quite a few years ago about 55 years ago
36:04 when I saw him he was probably gone for
36:07 at least 48 years Lee sir Amy who around
36:13 50 no no it'd be about 45 years and so
36:17 how did that happen
36:18 how did that happen for any of you've
36:20 seen relatives that have passed you've
36:22 met them wherever you met them but it
36:24 was while you were awake how did that
36:27 happen mm-hmm I was in a park that Walt
36:31 designed and built and launched hmm so
36:37 him being there is kind of interesting
36:39 that really shows you there's a lot of
36:41 options in the universe and for those
36:45 who've never seen the show Bob was
36:46 standing exactly where Walt took me and
36:49 I do not go to that part of the park
36:51 because I don't like any of the rides
36:52 over there and it's for the kiddies and
36:54 I'm not a kiddie I was hungry I was
36:57 angry I was supposed to get food and a
36:58 whole different area of the park but he
37:00 interrupted me and I was like ooh hurts
37:02 you know okay you have to acknowledge
37:06 those things when you're thinking about
37:07 how this whole thing works so now
37:11 imagine that you're on board with my
37:14 previous episodes where I say that the
37:16 soul doesn't its whole different plane
37:18 of existence is what I like to maybe
37:21 call your organized energy it's a really
37:24 bad description of something very
37:25 glorious and amazing but it obviously
37:28 interacts in a symbiotic way with our
37:31 vessel that is why when someone passes
37:34 away those that are in the room with
37:36 them instantaneously realize that body
37:39 isn't the magical thing it was when it
37:43 was alive because the soul is gone when
37:46 regardless if we acknowledge it or not
37:48 we are feeling the soul of each other
37:50 when we're together
37:53 just remember the test I always give you
37:55 folks hopefully you've done it get with
37:58 a loved one preferably a partner but you
38:02 know anyone that you just have a really
38:03 good connection with you're having a
38:04 really good day with can stare them in
38:07 the face
38:07 sit on a sofa sit in a couple chairs at
38:09 a restaurant whatever and lock eyes and
38:12 tell them look me in the eyes you feel
38:15 our connection like yep I feel our
38:17 connection okay you just take your
38:20 finger your index finger and you hold it
38:22 up and you block the eyeballs and just
38:24 hold it and you ask your friend how do
38:27 you feel now how connected are we are
38:29 now or are we now and they immediately
38:31 feel the disconnect and that is why the
38:36 eyes have always had the definition of
38:38 the gateways to the soul there is
38:41 something about our eyes they're not
38:44 just these apertures that let in you
38:48 know wiggling verbal photons this verbal
38:53 reaction off other things to excite our
38:55 rods and our cones to give ourselves the
38:58 image in the back of our brains lifts
38:59 upside down backwards it's not just that
39:02 that's a mechanism to add a little bit
39:04 more information to the otherwise purely
39:07 spiritual experience that we're having
39:10 why can we sense people staring at us
39:14 it's because of the soul not because of
39:16 the body the body me assists the process
39:20 but it's not the reason why definitively
39:24 so you're trying to put this place
39:26 together now there's really the chicken
39:29 and the egg thing for me with the
39:31 universe goes something like this we
39:35 either have a big giant break just like
39:39 pool where all these ether particles
39:42 were thrown into this area which is
39:45 finite with the finite amount of stuff
39:48 although way bigger than us so we don't
39:51 sense it we don't sense the container
39:53 and we're somehow
39:58 from the very very beginning we are
40:02 embedded in the information which is the
40:05 ether all movements our designs who
40:09 almost Sapien cats insects planets the
40:14 whole ecosystem of how we might be
40:16 finding ourselves in this plane of
40:18 existence breathing oxygen needing water
40:21 needing food of a certain kind being
40:23 able to heal ourselves with things that
40:25 grow out of the ground instead of taking
40:26 medicines the way we did it for
40:28 centuries and millennia before
40:30 pharmaceutical companies or so that's
40:34 the chicken let's just say the egg idea
40:37 might be that this is an infinite
40:40 container with infinite stuff and if
40:44 that's the case where is the programmer
40:46 live and how did all this stuff come
40:49 come about hmm it would seem that you if
40:58 you had the egg which is full infinite
41:01 infinite if an it's stuff an infinite
41:04 container always it would have to be
41:07 always have been here right there's no
41:09 beginning and there's no end even though
41:10 we as human beings in this vessel have a
41:14 beginning a middle and an end our soul
41:16 doesn't and so it understands infinity
41:20 but doesn't need to really conceive of
41:22 it it's just where it is if we are a
41:25 finite amount of stuff in a finite
41:27 container aha well it still doesn't
41:31 negate the egg existing around the
41:33 chicken there's an infinite something
41:36 around us and perhaps we are merely an
41:38 instance of the outer infinite infinity
41:42 so we're in a container and that's
41:44 really where we have a Russian doll
41:46 sequence going on let's say the outside
41:49 is infinite infinite stuff in an
41:51 infinite container always has been and
41:54 maybe it's different out there and maybe
41:57 some ether running around but it doesn't
41:58 control anything because we're mainly
42:00 soul beings out there and that stuff
42:03 cute that's cool you know we could do
42:04 what I'm bored as hell me too man being
42:07 a cute really sucks sometimes yeah I
42:09 thought we could get some of this ether
42:11 [ __ ] right
42:11 you know Gary and I got that old box
42:14 Mary gave me the gift but that's for
42:17 your thing you gave me okay yeah well
42:19 I'll get the crap out of the sphere I've
42:22 been playing with this stuff I got these
42:24 kind of like these rules of which things
42:27 kind of operate right I caught
42:29 mathematics oh that's a great name a lot
42:31 of syllables and that maybe you should
42:33 try to turn that off one day we'll get
42:35 to that later
42:35 it's called math how about that one
42:37 syllable boom good but if we create a
42:40 little opening in this thing
42:41 we can throw a bunch of stuff in it
42:45 pre-programmed to have this really cool
42:47 scenario and then we'll cap it off and
42:50 it'll just happen and we can just sit
42:51 there and watch it we could even go down
42:53 in it oh dude that sounds awesome
42:56 what other thing happens in our world
42:59 it's exactly like that within this
43:01 paradigm
43:02 it's a massive multiplayer online game
43:07 we've done it you can crawl into World
43:11 of Warcraft it's not infinite but by god
43:14 it'll keep you going for years and years
43:16 man and you won't have remotely
43:17 experienced at all hell fallout 4 is so
43:19 big I haven't experienced at all all
43:23 right there you go you've seen a doll
43:26 inside of the doll do you really need an
43:28 infinite amount of them going down
43:29 because guess what the last version of
43:33 most games have these they have little
43:36 parlor games inside the game and so
43:39 there's like a match a memory game now
43:43 embedded in the latest expansion of
43:45 World of Warcraft
43:47 there's games where you untangle strings
43:50 between nodes there's your little
43:54 Russian doll inside that game you can
43:58 bring up a little hearthstone you know
44:01 game on the on the ground which is
44:03 another game Blizzard makes on the
44:04 outside and you can fake like you're
44:05 playing it mm-hmm
44:09 so then we get to this idea of is there
44:12 interaction how many of you have ever
44:15 wanted to see a ghost like a real one
44:18 like when I saw Walt he was in my brain
44:20 he wasn't
44:21 let me just kinda
44:22 an apparition in front of me but it
44:24 wasn't anything I thought anyone else
44:25 could see you know obviously nobody did
44:27 but how many times you really wanted to
44:29 see one and you're in your bedroom real
44:31 late at night and you call on someone
44:34 maybe someone recently passed maybe just
44:36 someone and you just beg them you know
44:39 God you just could you just show up
44:41 could you just make something happen in
44:43 the room and then you start to think
44:45 about it as an engineer like I do and
44:47 you go oh crap maybe that's not even
44:50 possible maybe the system isn't hooked
44:53 up to do that how would I actually see a
44:55 ghost I mean in standard physics how
44:57 would I see a ghost well some entity on
45:01 a different non mass plane a spiritual
45:06 plane meaning they can be in the room
45:08 with you and the ether goes through them
45:09 it doesn't even bother moving a little
45:11 bit because it's just they don't
45:13 interact with each other they can't
45:14 touch each other necessarily but that
45:17 spiritual being could maybe wave their
45:22 little magic hands and start to create
45:24 verbal reactions to the ether and thus
45:28 create photons and they could make some
45:31 sort of cloud in your room it's an
45:34 apparition it could be just a little
45:36 cloudy thing they're just waving their
45:37 hand in a circle just like some like
45:39 sparklers or a knight you know or they
45:42 could maybe push themselves into a form
45:45 that you remember them by and move
45:48 through it and it's such a way or
45:49 because just just I don't know just
45:50 vibrate in a way that you can see them
45:53 they glow and your room Michael
45:54 Jackson's in your room right but it
45:57 never happens it never happens because
46:01 it would be silly to say that they would
46:03 do it for one person and not for all of
46:04 us I mean what would be the sense in
46:06 that
46:06 does your loved one not love you enough
46:08 to come back and show you especially if
46:10 you're a scientist and you make a pact
46:12 you go dude come back and show me will
46:14 you do that oh yeah totally never
46:16 happens so if it was allowed impossible
46:20 then it would be a certainty and that's
46:23 not what we see is it well then you get
46:26 to the old theory of the butterfly
46:28 effect the butterfly effect effect is in
46:32 part sort of the programming mechanism
46:35 I'm talking about a butterfly flies a
46:38 certain way in Peru and eventually it
46:42 affects the price of tea in China it's
46:46 an absurd analogy to show you how that
46:49 is actually possible it is actually
46:53 possible
46:54 it causes change change reverberates now
46:58 it might take you know a thousand years
47:01 for that to actually occur through some
47:03 weird bunch of connections that loss
47:05 items had a really funny thing where he
47:07 said that you could extrapolate the
47:09 entire universe out of a slice of fairy
47:11 cake just brilliant he was right on it
47:14 man the seventies so if they're going to
47:17 effect change then is it something that
47:22 is a part of the initial program that
47:26 the program says well if someone
47:27 requests this thing then there's gonna
47:29 be this opening that will have a little
47:31 you know red light that comes on the
47:33 outside okay Joey's in his bedroom wants
47:35 to see his uncle again so uncle you're
47:38 dead right yeah okay so your souls out
47:40 here good now this is the XYZ that you
47:45 need to go to this this bubble here is
47:47 the tea time and you need to go right
47:50 there to his bedroom because earth is
47:51 flight flying through the universe okay
47:53 so you need to get right there and hold
47:55 yourself into that realm and then wiggle
47:57 and then you can see okay great doesn't
48:00 happen in the movie The Matrix was very
48:07 powerful because there was the outside
48:11 organic world which was very arbitrary
48:13 and random as the world truly exists and
48:16 then you had this very intentional
48:19 mimicry of a previous state of the
48:22 outside world which was society in this
48:24 sort of normal grind and not on route
48:28 City was New York or wherever it was set
48:30 right and so the code which flowed on
48:35 the screens which you know if you don't
48:37 remember the the folks that were looking
48:40 at the code didn't see code they saw the
48:43 world they saw people in the code
48:45 because their brain started to translate
48:47 it
48:48 that was one of the coolest things they
48:49 did in that movie but that would be sort
48:52 of the intellect of our matrix code
48:55 programmers as well they could simply
48:56 look at an ether away and say oh wow
48:59 there's gonna be a baby here and anytime
49:01 now someone must be having sex somewhere
49:03 you know poof oh yeah there it is right
49:04 there I knew it that's that's the way
49:06 that makes before it you know crates the
49:10 fetus or whatever someone's in love in
49:13 this room you smell the ether oh yeah
49:15 totally smell yeah but it's not most
49:17 likely the ether that's controlling all
49:20 elements it's a bunch of stuff on top of
49:22 itself okay let's go a little bit deeper
49:26 as if we can does one control the other
49:32 does the ether that makes up this
49:35 universe obey the soul energy does the
49:41 soul energy obey the e throw energy do
49:45 they have their own proprietary
49:46 universes and they can interact if
49:49 someone wills it to exist mm-hmm deep
49:55 right well let me give you one at the
49:58 moment of conception once the sperm
50:03 penetrates the egg obviously magic is
50:06 happening inside the egg it is like on a
50:09 protein level it is mind-blowing what's
50:12 going on inside that thing and then
50:13 eventually DNA starts to behave as the
50:16 protein patterns tell it to behave but
50:20 the first moment of tangible magic that
50:24 humans can see is a heartbeat and what
50:29 is a heartbeat it's some fluid going
50:33 from point A to point B with a moment of
50:36 compression and the moment of
50:38 compression builds up but then poop you
50:41 get a little B it's sort of like if you
50:44 had your hose kinked in your backyard
50:47 and it's got pressure now we know how
50:49 that really works doesn't unkink ER
50:51 because the rubber is always stronger
50:52 than the water and so we don't get that
50:54 kink but if it was a weak rubber which
50:57 we never make hoses out of
50:58 it might build up on the kink burst
51:02 through the kink within the kink
51:04 reconstitutes itself and compresses
51:06 again and then there's a burst and
51:08 there's a rhythm to it because the flow
51:10 of water has a consonant amplification
51:13 right the flow boom pop pop pop okay
51:19 well let me just throw you as an example
51:23 that the soul energy that shows up to
51:26 give this being it's sentient form
51:30 having lived a previous life it does
51:34 this little magic thing and the magic
51:35 thing is it creates the kink the kink is
51:41 created by the soul the ether obeys
51:44 because it has it doesn't care it's just
51:47 inert stuff it doesn't have a
51:48 consciousness itself the soul has a
51:51 consciousness and the soul is there as
51:54 sort of the hands of God to mulch the
51:58 proteins to make sure it grows into
52:01 whatever the heck is supposed to be the
52:03 hamster a human
52:04 whatever hominid Bigfoot whatever and
52:07 it's doing this thing and it's sitting
52:10 there nurturing for nine months but
52:12 eventually the beam gets to a point
52:15 where it starts to take over well well
52:18 before the nine-month period occurs soul
52:20 just moves in moves into this sort of
52:24 brain stem piney ole gland thing by the
52:27 way I watch this episode as absolute
52:29 idiot but still a little rendition here
52:32 you don't speak English specifically I
52:34 don't know about your language but in
52:35 English there's some very basic rules
52:38 about how to pronounce vowels because I
52:39 heard this guy see it's pineal okay
52:44 let's go back to grade school here ready
52:46 real simple simple thing here two valves
52:51 separated by a consonant a single
52:53 consonant makes the first vowel long
52:56 what's long mean long means you
52:58 pronounce it as you say it in the
53:00 alphabet a B C well you only have a e i
53:04 o and you right sometimes why
53:08 but I you know so because pineal gland
53:13 only has an in between the eye and
53:16 following vowel it's pineal it's de-sect
53:20 two S's make the eye short the vote
53:24 becomes ya na I because we have so much
53:27 [ __ ] literacy in the United States of
53:29 America these dictionaries are caving in
53:32 to these these people that can't speak
53:34 English it's crazy and we say a bunch of
53:36 [ __ ] wrong that they British still say
53:38 correct
53:39 it's cement really sorry it's not cement
53:43 its cement there's only one in between
53:46 the two vowels hmm anyway but I think
53:50 the soul attaches to the brainstem right
53:53 the tippy-top art is a junctions into
53:56 the brain itself but I think that the
53:58 overall soul area that it might occupy
54:02 is quite frankly bigger than your brain
54:05 cavity it's sort of in a different well
54:09 it doesn't worry about mass it doesn't
54:11 have like this ooh there's a there's a
54:13 skull here I got to stay within the
54:14 skull there's no need for that
54:17 far as we know our souls are as big as
54:20 the universe who knows right that's why
54:23 when they feed you a bunch of poisons
54:25 and they rot your pineal gland you start
54:29 to lose your access to your soul you
54:32 start to lose this consciousness that
54:34 you've developed what the Buddhists call
54:37 your mind right between your body and
54:39 your soul is your consciousness if you
54:42 impair your vessel you impair your
54:45 liaison relationship with your soul your
54:47 true being but because we adopt our
54:51 consciousness as our reality that's why
54:54 scientists don't believe in Souls
54:56 because they will open up a brain cavity
54:57 push all over the brain and people get
54:59 all these memories and do all these
55:01 weird things I can taste strawberries
55:03 they're just short circuiting the
55:06 overall previously accurate matrix which
55:09 is your brain but has a great
55:11 relationship with your soul meaning for
55:14 every red wire there's a red contact
55:16 every blue wire there's a blue contact
55:18 well the scientists are in there you are
55:21 looking up all you know
55:22 garbling of all the wire connections and
55:23 so yeah bunch of weird shits gonna
55:24 happen that's not proof you live inside
55:26 your brain you know you're just damaging
55:29 the connection what's so funny about it
55:32 is
55:33 I'll give you an analogy you can use
55:35 which is very simple for everyone to
55:37 understand back in the day TVs had
55:41 antennas on the top of them radios just
55:44 add antennas somewhere in the car
55:46 somewhere above them somewhere embedded
55:48 inside the case and you have to tune
55:51 your frequencies and to know your
55:53 oscillators and all that good stuff to
55:55 get it to to do a decent job but you
55:57 remember if you were old that you know
56:01 hey if the antenna was in the wrong
56:03 place the antenna was damaged or the
56:05 broadcast wasn't strong enough to get to
56:07 wherever the hell you lived you had a
56:08 crappy picture in fact you could lose
56:11 the entire channel so you would hold
56:14 onto the antenna and we're here our body
56:15 use your bodies in antenna you'd put a
56:17 bunch of extra wire and run it off the
56:18 back door and up the roof then you get a
56:21 better picture yeah better radio station
56:23 but according to scientists the radio
56:28 station lives inside your TV at the at
56:32 the best scientists would suggest that
56:34 if the picture ceases to exist on your
56:36 TV so too does the studio cease to exist
56:39 on the other side because it doesn't
56:41 work banking kiddie games like so and
56:44 you eat a bunch of toxins bunch of
56:46 aluminum mercury from flu shots and all
56:49 that crap you brush your teeth with
56:51 fluoride which watch your pineal gland
56:52 gives you osteoporotic
56:53 you microwave your food which completely
56:56 screws up all of your electrical
56:57 communications in your body you need all
56:59 these process dead meats you are going
57:03 to damage your vessel you no need to
57:08 lecture you but you know we were made
57:09 perfect and the earth was made perfect
57:11 to to sustain us and heal us otherwise
57:15 we wouldn't exist if we keep on the
57:18 warpath or on today the extinct before
57:21 you know it cancer is pretty much the
57:27 fingerprint of the globalists screwing
57:30 with us beauty cancer or so most gets
57:34 cancer that
57:35 a fingerprint of a toxin that you were
57:37 exposed to whether it be electromagnetic
57:39 chemical or through malnutrition that is
57:43 why cancer exists
57:45 your body's being starved at what needs
57:47 to recreate itself and so it creates bad
57:51 information which turns into corrupted
57:54 cells you can't heal from it go see my
57:57 episode on cancer but you could get
58:00 yourself reinfected you get totally
58:01 different types of cancer depending on
58:02 how you expose yourself so be good to
58:05 yourself go back to basics what I always
58:08 say
58:09 and just remember all dominant species
58:12 on this planet eat meat so just bear
58:15 that in mind okay you might be able to
58:19 coexist with human beings not eating it
58:21 but you will not be the dominant species
58:23 on this planet I guarantee you so the
58:27 very conception of being a matrix
58:29 programmer starts to just hurt the brain
58:32 when you just start to think about just
58:35 the few things that we've mentioned a
58:36 few paradigms of existence that we've
58:38 mentioned and we really haven't talked
58:40 about how or even why there would be
58:45 another timetable that would be a
58:47 duplicate of us if nonlinear time exists
58:51 what I would suggest is this it wouldn't
58:54 be anything intentional from a
58:57 programmer unless they're trying to
58:59 create drastic differences for
59:02 experimental reasons only and we see
59:05 this in our own software right we don't
59:07 why we don't write every conceivable
59:09 version of Microsoft Word that could
59:11 exist just to see if we could do it you
59:13 know it's like imagine like there's a
59:15 print button somewhere on the screen and
59:17 you just move it want to pixel over
59:19 every version until it's to the other
59:21 side of the screen or it's everywhere
59:22 all over the screen I mean that's just
59:23 pointless exercise and a waste of energy
59:25 and time if that exists then maybe
59:32 there's no God maybe they were just here
59:34 seems sort of weird we seem to be so
59:37 intelligently designed and the earth I
59:40 think that one of the I've said this
59:44 several times but I think I'm gonna say
59:46 a little clearer and a little shorter
59:47 this time
59:48 earth for me personally is a thousand
59:53 percent designed meaning we don't have a
59:58 bunch of weird life in this world we
60:01 don't all things in fact in my opinion
60:03 if you have style if you understand
60:06 design if you look at Syd Mead stuff and
60:08 you go damn that's just [ __ ] cool
60:11 then you will have no problem looking at
60:13 every fish every insect every human and
60:16 go WOW aren't we amazing I mean yeah
60:20 that chick with the gigantic brow across
60:23 her face is a little different than my
60:25 community but in her world she is
60:27 gorgeous you know and so when you look
60:30 at the fact that we don't have you know
60:32 apparitional beings you know we don't
60:36 have like I don't know like just take
60:38 taffy when it's really hot and throw it
60:40 in here and then just see it float there
60:41 and it's just got like an eyeball on one
60:43 side and teeth on the other side we
60:45 don't see any of that crap we see utter
60:47 and complete perfection I was watching a
60:51 documentary well whatever this dude has
60:54 a channel on I don't know what the hell
60:56 they call that [ __ ] a video on YouTube
60:57 okay have a dude chasing around and I
61:00 strongly recommend you go and look at
61:03 this cause it'll just if it has any
61:05 effect on you like it does on me it just
61:08 so proves the experience but he was
61:10 running around the world finding the
61:12 largest flowers that exists on planet
61:15 Earth and there's this weird common
61:19 denominator of the biggest flowers in
61:21 the world and I mean not a flower is
61:23 made of a bunch of little ones
61:24 necessarily because those exist as well
61:26 and technically speaking some of these
61:28 big ones have that sort of molecular
61:32 definition but it's whatever
61:34 one of the biggest flowers and I can't
61:36 say the name because there's some hugely
61:37 scientific name but there's a flower
61:39 that looks like your standard flower a
61:42 little bit the thing is like three
61:46 meters first like a meter across scuse
61:48 me like a three-foot wide thing and it's
61:51 it looks like flesh it looks like
61:54 rotting flesh kinda like rotting inside
61:57 of muscle tissue the sinner is this
62:01 just hell hole thing man it's like it
62:05 just has like the spikes all over it and
62:07 it's just it looks like like The Devil's
62:11 hemorrhoid or something man it is really
62:13 gross but at the same time you look at
62:16 it and you think this could be my first
62:18 year in 3d class creating a sculpted 3d
62:21 thing the thing okay so all these flower
62:24 and one of them this whole species of
62:26 flowers that grow really really tall
62:28 they're like you know three to four
62:29 meters tall and they look like it's just
62:31 a big orchid look a giant orchid but
62:36 they all have the same trait they stink
62:40 like rotting flesh like rotting meat
62:43 maybe not flesh I don't know what that
62:45 it's like but and the guy you know puts
62:48 his face in these dicks his huge breath
62:50 he's like oh my god it is just Mel's
62:52 like routing you know meat but he goes
62:54 that's how this thing pollinates itself
62:56 is it creates this huge stink cloud that
63:00 you can't see but it draws all these
63:02 flies to it jungle flies and just
63:06 roaming around on the surface of this
63:07 fly or sorry this flower it pollinates
63:11 the flower the big tall orchid looking
63:14 ones actually have the male and female
63:17 equipment inside but they still need
63:20 something to crawl in there and move it
63:21 from one side to the other and I think
63:23 the male organ dies first
63:24 and releases its sperm and then it you
63:27 know pollinates over to the few mean
63:29 it's just it's just insane for me and
63:34 whatever's going on I can reduce a
63:35 little bit of the burden of the
63:37 programming of infinite randomness
63:39 because I think I'm seeing quite
63:41 definitively the beauty in all things
63:45 it's just crazy
63:47 if anything if anyone creates anything
63:50 unattractive in this world's mankind by
63:53 just experimenting with stuff right
63:55 anyway I wanted to take us down this
63:58 path to kind of you know move the
63:59 football maybe like half a yard in the
64:02 conversation like I've said several
64:05 times I think that for those of us that
64:07 fantasize about being matrix the the
64:10 other fantasy that a that arrives fairly
64:14 quickly in the mind
64:15 is one that might see just well if you
64:18 figure out how this place is made we can
64:21 control it you know we could time travel
64:23 we could at least even in linear time
64:27 move from one place to another very
64:29 quickly and back you know you want to go
64:32 the moon surface well just do this flip
64:35 flop flip thing and then boom you're on
64:37 the moon's surface I'm gonna bring
64:38 yourself some oxygen and a nice space
64:41 suit that NASA didn't make but I think
64:44 it's valuable because you know a lot of
64:47 people caught up in you know man-made
64:49 religions about how the world works
64:50 which if at best if accurate is merely
64:53 describing the soul layer you know how
64:56 its realized who cares could a Christ
65:00 come down to a world that is made of
65:01 applesauce and no ether sure you still
65:05 need to get along so you got to figure
65:07 out something how to some methodology
65:08 pulling it up so there's value to that
65:10 too
65:11 anyway let me know what you think in the
65:13 comments this is gonna be a really
65:15 bizarre episode but I just sit around
65:17 thinking I was thinking you know these
65:19 things have been floating around on my
65:21 mind this infinite gobbledygook and I
65:23 just keep thinking how would this all
65:26 come together and this is sort of my
65:28 first wave of explaining that I probably
65:32 won't get to another episode in quite a
65:33 while on this subject unless you guys
65:35 can trigger something in my brain but
65:37 anyway from and at the end thank you
65:38 very much if you haven't been at deep
65:39 thoughts radio calm I'm gonna give you
65:41 this short pitch tonight there's two
65:43 video plenty audio there's three social
65:46 medias there's two ways to donate
65:48 there's a store and there is season one
65:52 on its own channel because it's all been
65:55 made more better take care of yourself
65:59 in someone else and I'll see you in the
66:00 next deep thoughts over now
