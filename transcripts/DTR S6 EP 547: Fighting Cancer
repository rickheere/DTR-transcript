00:11 [Music]
00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen on our
00:37 i guess fourth redo of the cancer
00:39 treatment episode
00:41 which i was calling uh fighting cancer
00:43 before
00:45 just very ironic because i had someone
00:49 comment this morning about why they
00:50 couldn't see the
00:52 episode 376 and i thought i had redone
00:54 it much more recently
00:57 won't matter because this is going to
00:58 replace it now for those newcomers to
01:01 the show uh yeah you're going to be like
01:02 what the hell
01:03 guy smoking a cigar is going to teach me
01:06 alternatives to the formal death serums
01:11 yeah yeah we don't inhale cigars
01:16 just a taste thing but this is going to
01:19 be about
01:20 treatments we can't use the word cure
01:25 and the reason why we can't use the word
01:26 cure is there is no cure for
01:28 pretty much any illness in the world
01:30 because you can go off and get it again
01:32 or it can come back like chickenpox and
01:34 come back as shingles
01:36 same species of microbe in your body
01:39 just causes a different effect as you
01:40 get older
01:42 but we're going to talk about treatments
01:43 right off the bat
01:46 then we're going to get into causes but
01:49 we're also going to sprinkle in
01:50 throughout this episode the
01:52 huge psychological problems with dealing
01:55 with
01:56 treatments that virtually cost you
01:58 nothing compared to formal treatments
02:01 and having to fight in your head whether
02:04 or not you're
02:06 crazy for trying these other things i'll
02:09 just be
02:11 very honest with you this is not a
02:14 boasting situation whatsoever everyone
02:17 has ever told me they had cancer
02:18 and i said look we can get rid of this
02:20 very quickly
02:23 for the ones that came on board
02:26 and pretty much used one technique out
02:28 of everything i'm going to tell you and
02:29 i'm going to tell you here in just a few
02:31 seconds
02:32 they're still alive if they followed my
02:34 advice
02:37 the ones that said oh oh you know i got
02:39 ecologists
02:41 i know you you know i can't you know
02:43 they're they have phds you don't
02:46 they're all dead including very good
02:48 friends of mine
02:49 like idols of mine oncologists are so
02:53 awful that they don't have any problem
02:57 giving you the cancer to begin with and
03:00 then
03:01 turning you into an atm machine for
03:03 whatever reason
03:04 there's a kickback program allowed with
03:07 chemotherapy
03:09 the last statistic i read was that it
03:12 kills 93 to 97
03:14 of its patients and then they just say
03:16 well you know you had cancer
03:18 not my fault i've lost count i've
03:21 literally lost count of the people that
03:22 have done this treatment
03:24 and survived lost count that are in my
03:27 personal circle
03:29 and the treatment is a vitamin it's
03:31 really two vitamins put together
03:33 vitamin b17 which you probably never
03:36 heard of i had never heard of it either
03:38 comes out of the pit of an apricot
03:41 there's a company that i use called
03:43 apricot power
03:45 it was taken off of amazon but now it's
03:48 back on
03:49 but then it's catalyzed meaning
03:52 supercharged
03:53 with time release vitamin c now i know
03:56 that
03:57 probably you hear that and you're like
03:58 what i just take two vitamins i mean i
04:00 was ready to get inside of a jet engine
04:02 and have it turned on full blast because
04:03 that's what my oncologist said
04:06 chemotherapy for me will be in a couple
04:08 hundred years
04:09 hopefully a couple decades
04:12 will be likened to leeches from the past
04:16 a chaotic crazy regiment
04:20 of brute force destruction of the human
04:24 body in hopes that
04:25 at the same time it gets rid of your
04:27 cancer
04:29 the cool thing about b17 and vitamin c
04:33 is it is nature's chemo it's doing the
04:36 exact same thing but doing it at a level
04:38 where your body is not harmed in the
04:40 process
04:41 whereas chemo harms your body chemo
04:43 stores in your body
04:45 up to 10 15 20 years technically
04:48 speaking it may not be any
04:50 volatile after 10 years in your body but
04:51 you'll still have an isotope
04:53 somewhere in a nook and cranny in your
04:55 body just releasing a little electron
04:58 that shouldn't be releasing hurting
05:01 part of your body that it shouldn't be
05:03 hurting
05:05 causing ache or pain
05:08 so how does this work i just told you to
05:10 take two vitamins
05:12 a day what are the dosages well dosages
05:15 are definitely
05:16 unique but since this regiment is
05:19 water-soluble
05:21 you can pass it out of your system if
05:24 you happen to take a little too much
05:26 that's the nice thing first we have to
05:30 get rid of two things out of your diet
05:33 for probably the next six months to a
05:36 year regardless if you heal
05:38 up in three months which in my
05:40 experience
05:42 it's been three to four months with the
05:44 stage four person
05:46 who's been given six months to live was
05:48 in full
05:51 i want to say remission but they were
05:52 fully restored in four months
05:54 to the degree that the oncologist said
05:56 oh my gosh that chemo seems to really be
05:58 working
05:59 and she never took it and she just
06:00 looked at the guy and said yo yeah
06:04 because she knows that if it was
06:06 revealed that she didn't take the chemo
06:08 the doctor could
06:11 could and this is absolutely absurd
06:13 because you have a legal right
06:14 roe versus wade protects you against
06:18 anyone sticking things in your body but
06:19 there's an international law that also
06:21 prevents anyone from sticking anything
06:22 in your body without your permission
06:24 but there have been cases all across the
06:26 world where oncology departments
06:28 will capture children using police
06:31 officers out of your home
06:32 inject chemo in them and the child dies
06:36 everyone involved gets their kickback
06:38 checked so if you want to know why this
06:40 is such a conspiratorial area
06:42 of medicine that's one of the reasons
06:46 in my opinion but you have to get rid of
06:49 sugar
06:49 and meat out of your diet almost as
06:52 absolute as you possibly can now you
06:54 have to understand a carbohydrate is a
06:56 complex sugar
06:57 so you might want to just be a little
06:59 bit careful with that
07:01 and the reason why is that cancer loves
07:03 those two elements
07:04 those two food sources and so while you
07:08 are killing off
07:09 this inordinate amount of cancer you
07:12 have in your body at this particular
07:13 time because you always have cancer in
07:14 your body there's nothing wrong with
07:16 that it's just a little mutated cell
07:18 that your immune system will
07:19 get rid of but when you get into causes
07:23 you might find something that you're
07:24 doing that you also need to stop
07:26 outside of just eating sugar and meat
07:30 it'll be a lot it'll be tough initially
07:32 to get rid of
07:35 meat and sugar and you may not have the
07:37 energy levels that you normally have but
07:40 you can replace your sugar with carrot
07:42 juice
07:43 which is extremely sweet you get a lot
07:46 of your savory
07:48 items from cruciferous vegetables like
07:51 cauliflower broccoli and carrots
07:55 you prepare them with a salt
07:58 don't overdo anything right you don't
07:59 want high blood pressure while you're
08:00 trying to do this
08:02 but after those two things are removed
08:06 meat and sugars now you're starving this
08:07 stuff
08:10 it's gonna have a hard time multiplying
08:12 which means we're gonna slow it down
08:14 the regiment that i have seen people do
08:18 for a five foot seven
08:21 female of an average weight is to take
08:26 two 500 milligram b17 pills
08:29 again i use apricot power but i don't
08:32 have
08:32 cancer so i'm just taking a 100
08:35 milligram pill
08:36 the difference is the 100 milligram
08:38 pills bottles about 30
08:41 and the 500 is between 90 and 100 bucks
08:45 go price at any regiment of cancer and
08:48 you'll find out you're getting a deal
08:50 now before we get into what this does
08:52 which is extremely simple we have to
08:54 talk about the vitamin c
08:56 vitamin c is something you should take
08:57 every single day time release especially
09:01 the brand i love is solar ray
09:05 it's a kind of a milky white
09:06 semi-transparent bottle with a little
09:09 stripe of a rainbow across the top so
09:12 keep that really easy for you
09:14 the whole food sells it mothers market
09:16 here in southern california sells it
09:19 but it's a powder pill knitty capsule i
09:21 prefer powdery
09:22 pills versus hard tombstone pills
09:26 the vitamin b17 will also be a powder
09:29 pill and you'll get it automatically
09:31 what a time release pill does and i take
09:33 a thousand milligram units
09:35 is it gives you 500 milligrams right
09:38 away
09:38 and then 500 over the course of eight
09:40 hours at least that's how it's described
09:43 again it's water soluble so that what
09:46 that means is
09:46 you'll you can pass that excess
09:50 it can't toxify if something you're
09:53 ingesting isn't water-soluble
09:55 then there's not a natural means to get
09:57 it out of your system
09:58 uh it could be a much more intense
10:00 metabolized
10:02 like you're eating a meal through your
10:03 intestines right
10:06 now the c varies because of your body
10:08 size and weight but again you can't
10:10 really hurt yourself
10:12 i have heard multiple techniques of the
10:15 sea
10:16 now if you just took a thousand
10:17 milligrams
10:19 once an hour that'd be 24 000 milligrams
10:24 might be a little excessive but i have
10:26 heard
10:28 an initiation to this program which is
10:30 to do a shock and awe
10:32 strike on the cancer and the nice thing
10:34 about this
10:35 vitamin technique of getting rid of
10:37 cancer is that it can go after
10:39 inoperable spine cancers brain cancers
10:42 things that you can't get to quite you
10:44 know easily because you'll destroy the
10:45 human
10:46 body in the process but man i'll i'll
10:49 have
10:50 the friends of friends is typically
10:51 where i get the bad advice
10:53 or not bad advice but the bad response
10:55 to some of this stuff like
10:57 just to give you an example early 2019
11:01 somebody i knew uh they had a family
11:04 that's their family friends little girl
11:07 had inoperable spine cancer
11:11 i told her about this technique and
11:16 she's your typical person who trusts
11:18 those sources
11:20 no medical knowledge whatsoever
11:22 absolutely pretty low brow iq
11:24 and just argue with me that these
11:26 individuals know best and little girls
11:28 dead know
11:30 technically speaking you could do these
11:31 at the same exact time as chemo
11:33 but the residual problems of chemo will
11:36 mean that you should probably take b17
11:38 for about 10 years after your
11:41 you're cured of the particular instance
11:43 of cancer that you have
11:46 and again cure is definitely not a word
11:48 i want to use
11:49 because you could always have a little
11:51 bit in your system right where
11:53 this occurred for you and we need to
11:55 keep on top of it
11:57 cured would mean you take this one
11:59 regiment this magic pill
12:01 and you could never get cancer again
12:03 that's what a cure would mean
12:04 and i'm unaware of anything that can do
12:07 that
12:09 but i've heard people do what's called
12:11 stacking with the vitamin c
12:14 because of this time release technique
12:16 you realize you get 500
12:17 right away 500 over 8 hours
12:20 now if you take a fistful of vitamin c
12:23 say
12:24 for 3 000 to 5 000 milligrams and you
12:26 haven't eaten a meal
12:28 you'll get a typically you'll get a
12:30 little bit of a
12:31 upset stomach for about 10 minutes 10-15
12:34 minutes
12:34 it goes it goes away but we don't want
12:36 you to experience that
12:39 so it would be best if you were to take
12:41 five over five hours
12:44 uh building it up or eat a gigantic meal
12:46 and take perhaps three thousand
12:48 you can just play with it again the
12:50 nausea that you'll get will be
12:52 very quick so you can kind of laugh at
12:53 yourself if you happen to get over
12:56 over the uh your particular threshold
13:00 but i've heard and read techniques from
13:02 people who use these two vitamins and
13:04 they
13:05 are fully alive today given death
13:08 sentences
13:09 that they would stack up to 32 000
13:12 milligrams in the first
13:13 78 or 48 hours excuse me about 72 hours
13:17 and then they would calm down to
13:20 anywhere between
13:21 five and ten thousand milligrams
13:22 throughout the day just one every couple
13:24 hours
13:25 for about uh the firm the moment you
13:28 wake up to the moment you go to bed
13:31 so what is this stuff doing i know
13:33 you're like how the hell is this seed
13:34 possible
13:36 please understand the cancer has been
13:38 built up in your brain as this
13:40 mysterious magical stuff that you can't
13:43 stop it's like an alien death
13:46 death uh attack inside your body and
13:49 it's simply not true something is
13:52 causing your body to create
13:53 cells in a particular area of your body
13:56 poorly
13:57 and it it's just stupid it just sits
13:59 there and grows into a clot it grows
14:01 into
14:02 a fibrous sort of like it's like a
14:05 neuron like a
14:06 muscle evasive web that goes in
14:10 different directions
14:12 this stuff is going to kick it in the
14:14 nuts at a level that is
14:17 quite astonishing what does chemotherapy
14:21 do
14:21 chemotherapy has all kinds of different
14:23 flavors today
14:24 but it is a radioactive isotope it is an
14:28 atom that is so complex that it throws
14:31 electrons
14:32 more so than other substances
14:37 you all know about nuclear bombs how the
14:40 radiation
14:41 kills human beings well same thing
14:44 same exact thing except they're giving
14:46 it to you in these serums
14:49 there's all kinds of ways they can give
14:50 it to you i've seen in the last
14:54 two years quite a few elaborate means
14:57 of giving this to you they have softer
15:01 versions i guess for older people and
15:03 then i guess they punch you in the gut
15:05 if you're younger the problem with
15:08 all chemotherapy is that it's too
15:10 powerful
15:12 when it sheds an electron it's not only
15:14 going through the cancer
15:16 but it's going through all the muscle
15:17 tissue all the organs in your body
15:20 that's why you lose your hair that's why
15:22 you puke that's why you're not
15:25 hungry your body is being destroyed
15:28 head to toe with chemotherapy and that's
15:31 not news they'll tell you that they'll
15:32 say yeah this is what happens and we're
15:34 trying to make sure
15:35 what we're trying to do is kill the
15:36 cancer in your body
15:38 before your body dies the problem is
15:42 is the depending on what kind of cancer
15:44 you have
15:46 you could be in the 90 plus percentile
15:48 rating of fate
15:49 of probable fatality due to chemotherapy
15:53 so what is b17 and c doing
15:56 the same exact thing the same exact
15:59 thing
16:00 with one exception one of the analogies
16:03 i
16:04 have experimented with and it seems to
16:06 work pretty well
16:08 is imagine you're at a shooting range
16:11 the gun
16:11 and the bullet is going to be b17 or
16:15 chemotherapy down the target range
16:18 you've got a paper target
16:20 and you've got a wall so you know how
16:23 target ranges work
16:25 you shoot the target the bullet goes
16:27 through the paper
16:28 does not go through the wall the paper
16:32 is cancer the wall is your body
16:35 chemotherapy
16:37 is like shooting a target with some
16:41 20 cal gun that would normally be
16:43 attached to the side of
16:46 a tank and it is designed to go through
16:49 walls
16:50 so not only does it go through the
16:51 target and leave a gaping hole but it
16:53 goes through the wall as well and that's
16:54 your body
16:56 now i'm willing to bet you understand
16:59 that we don't want to go through the
17:00 wall because that's you
17:03 b17 and c go through the target
17:08 b17 puts a slightly bigger hole in the
17:10 target
17:11 neither go through the wall so you can
17:14 shoot all day long just like a normal
17:16 target range
17:17 and you're not going to hurt your body
17:20 now of course
17:21 don't be silly and run off and say well
17:24 hey if a thousand milligrams is good and
17:26 he says it's water soluble and it's
17:28 non-toxic i'll just take 50 000
17:30 milligrams
17:31 no don't take any more than you need
17:36 everyone can od on everything you get od
17:39 on water
17:40 so that technique has saved the lives of
17:44 every single person i know
17:46 who has used it
17:50 i mean repeat that it has saved the
17:52 lives of every single person
17:54 that i know who's used it and not argued
17:58 and it takes a little bit of
17:59 constitution in your mind to go my god
18:01 i'm looking at people
18:03 with phds who are wearing white jackets
18:07 and then some dude on the internet
18:09 smoking a cigar of all things he's
18:11 smoking a cancer-causing device
18:13 supposedly
18:14 there's nothing i would do in this world
18:16 to harm any other human being
18:20 any way shape or form and
18:23 talking someone out of a cure to cancer
18:25 or treatment to cancer is going to work
18:27 for them for some other idea
18:29 it would be something i would never do
18:31 what other options do we have
18:34 well there's a few remember i told you
18:36 that if you're going to get rid of sugar
18:40 that you can use carrot juice as a
18:42 technique to supplement that sugary
18:44 flavor because boy carrot juice made
18:46 right is the most
18:48 decadent sugary drink in
18:52 in the vegetable kingdom but the other
18:55 cool thing is it helps
18:56 fight cancer as well in 1905
19:00 a german doctor dr gersham
19:04 g-e-r-s-o-n you can go look him up he
19:07 created a treatment for cancer that is
19:09 also
19:11 one of the more amazing treatments
19:13 however it has a complexity that i don't
19:15 push people into this realm because it's
19:18 a little awkward for
19:19 western culture to do i have no idea
19:21 about eastern culture
19:24 but you get rid of your sugars you get
19:26 rid of your meats and you go to a
19:28 carcivous vegetable diet
19:30 again broccoli cauliflower carrots
19:33 prepared
19:34 in a savory manner will take care of
19:36 your savory desires
19:38 and a blended sweet
19:42 no sugar added organic
19:45 everything by the way carrot juice is
19:48 the sweet the carrot juice is so
19:51 delicious that most the treatment
19:52 clinics that i have seen
19:53 in europe and in mexico just give you
19:56 carrot juice because nobody complains
19:58 it's that delicious
19:59 i mean it's incredible
20:02 now if you're going to get gershwin
20:03 technique you need to seek a gershwin
20:05 clinic
20:07 but these clinics have 83 plus
20:11 cure rates or at least for the you know
20:13 particular instance these people have
20:17 the month that they open meaning they're
20:19 getting a bunch of overflow
20:21 of stage four folks that are just on the
20:23 brink of death and that's
20:25 constituting the 17 percent but
20:28 once they get rid of their local region
20:31 folks either carrying them or they
20:33 happen to pass away because they came in
20:34 very very late
20:36 it goes higher than 83 percent in most
20:38 clinics it's it's incredible
20:41 but the reason why you need to seek a
20:42 professional is that there's a second
20:44 stage to this
20:46 once you get done ingesting a certain
20:48 amount of cruciferous vegetables they
20:50 want you to
20:52 stimulate your bowels to your entire
20:55 intestinal line because your upper
20:56 intestines are the
20:58 real absorption region of your
20:59 intestines they want to stimulate that
21:01 and the way that they do it is they give
21:04 you a room temperature
21:06 coffee enema i've never done this
21:09 but i've heard that it's kind of
21:11 euphoric
21:13 and people actually get addicted to the
21:15 coffee enema so after their
21:18 particular case of cancer is gone they
21:20 continue the other therapy
21:22 because it's just a positive thing that
21:24 happens to them sounds very complex
21:26 but i've watched videos of nothing
21:28 revealing but i've seen videos of this
21:30 online
21:31 fukushima japan was actually a gershom
21:34 headquarters
21:35 for curing cancer in japan
21:39 but due to the iron ironic
21:42 nuclear power plant problem there it is
21:45 now
21:47 turned off but there was a documentary
21:48 on netflix about the fukushima
21:50 gersham clinic and
21:53 the guy the head of ministry of the
21:55 hospital used it to cure his cancer
21:58 and then went and sought
22:02 permission to turn his entire hospital
22:04 into a gershwin clinic
22:05 and they get their permission and that's
22:08 where he reported i believe 83 percent
22:11 restoration percentage on the first
22:15 month and then it just got better from
22:18 there
22:19 now my personal thing just based on what
22:23 kind of
22:24 situation that i might get myself into
22:26 my family has no cancer except for
22:29 one person that got addicted to
22:30 saccharin when it first came out
22:33 but i would probably use b17c and then
22:37 use carrot juice and then i'd have to
22:40 look up the other thing
22:42 again everyone i've ever heard of which
22:45 is how i learned about this and then
22:48 passed it onto was just using b17
22:51 and c time release probably about 10 000
22:55 c a day time release not all at once
22:58 and then two 500 milligram b17s
23:02 twice a day not too bad
23:05 if you woke up at uh you know
23:08 nine o'clock in the morning you pop one
23:10 in your mouth and just pop another one
23:11 at nine o'clock at night and go to bed
23:13 you're gonna be good
23:15 and there's nothing wrong with taking
23:16 some of this stuff throughout the year
23:18 why not fight it before it ever gets too
23:20 crazy in your system
23:22 what are some of the other techniques
23:24 well there's one called thermal
23:27 and thermal treatments are actually
23:30 super duper simple
23:31 and i have seen them done in india
23:34 using a car in the summertime believe it
23:36 or not
23:38 what you do well what you must
23:40 understand first
23:41 is that cancer absolutely loathes heat
23:45 in the blood especially blood
23:48 that is of the temperature of 106.
23:52 now why does hot blood
23:55 fight cancer the answer is is that
23:58 when something is hot it's moving really
24:01 quickly you've seen a pot of
24:03 water boil and hey man when it's not
24:05 boiling it's
24:06 flat and when it's boiling it's shaking
24:08 like crazy making all those bubbles
24:12 i'm assuming that super agitated blood
24:14 which again is only going to be about
24:15 seven degrees over normal
24:18 somehow just utterly shatters the cancer
24:23 but this was used apparently on ronald
24:25 reagan who died of alzheimer's
24:28 for his bout of colon cancer
24:31 the way it works is that you lay a
24:33 patient down on a bed
24:35 for the layman it would probably be a
24:37 heating blanket
24:39 which is sort of one of these situations
24:43 where
24:45 we don't really want to be laying on
24:46 electronic wires regardless of what they
24:48 tell you
24:50 but for this particular treatment you
24:52 could do it
24:55 but you lay them down on a bedding
24:57 that's going to get warm
24:57 [Music]
24:59 and then you put a bunch of bedding on
25:00 top of them from the neck down
25:03 now i know what you're thinking you've
25:05 been warned your whole life that a
25:06 temperature of 106
25:08 could kill a human being start creating
25:10 you know necrosis in the brain cells
25:12 killing you off that's a runaway fever
25:16 slash infection slash virus that's what
25:19 you don't want because you can't control
25:20 it as easily
25:21 what we're talking about is inducingness
25:24 you raise the body temperature up to 106
25:27 for 15 minutes
25:29 just use a you know thermometer in their
25:30 mouth to gauge whether or not they're
25:32 there or not
25:33 i've never done this personally but i
25:35 imagine it would take a little while to
25:37 get going
25:38 i watched a video where a clinic in
25:41 india
25:42 it was putting guys in the back of a car
25:45 you know one at a time
25:46 and they've got all the water around
25:48 them and everything so they're going to
25:49 be
25:50 rehabilitated very very quickly after
25:52 this little 15 minutes
25:55 they just put a thermometer in their
25:56 mouth and waited and then looked at
25:58 their watch
25:59 they kept the windows rolled down in
26:01 this technique
26:02 to regulate their heat if they pass out
26:06 well the doctors are right there they
26:07 just open the doors and
26:09 cool them off never saw that
26:13 but it's destroying the cancer through
26:15 just pure agitation
26:18 now personally i'd mix it all together
26:20 i'd put b17c in my body and then maybe
26:22 do the thermal thing
26:24 just just to hit it from all sides it
26:26 would have no clue what hit it
26:29 now one of the techniques that i have
26:30 not seen
26:32 ever work but i haven't seen it not work
26:35 either
26:35 so i'm just a neophyte when it comes to
26:37 this
26:38 are the huge claims that thc when mixed
26:42 down to the concentrate of hemp oil
26:44 which is a
26:44 black oil
26:47 usually comes in little syringe tubes
26:50 with no needle
26:51 and you get about a pack of five what's
26:54 strange is this
26:56 even though colorado allows marijuana to
26:59 be sold
27:01 if you get caught making hemp oil you
27:02 can go to jail for 20 years
27:05 the oncology divisions of the world are
27:08 trying to get b17 banned they already
27:10 got it done in australia
27:12 and i'll tell you why that happened but
27:15 they're also trying to keep him oil
27:17 from being created and it's like who
27:20 cares man
27:21 what is oregon decriminalized heroin
27:24 guarantee a heroin is going to rack your
27:26 system way worse than any
27:29 any regiment of thc
27:33 remember cocaine and heroin are the
27:35 number two and number three techniques
27:36 for destroying the t cells in your body
27:38 thus giving you the illusion
27:40 that you've got some mysterious thing
27:42 called aids
27:45 as those two industries blew up in the
27:47 80s and 90s so too did
27:49 this regiment of individuals that died
27:51 with no t cells
27:53 as reported by virologist experts
27:57 the number one reason why t cells get
27:59 destroyed in america are these whippet
28:02 things called puppets
28:05 worse than heroin worse than cocaine
28:08 and almost exclusively used by gay males
28:12 so if you know anybody who's talking
28:14 about that stuff
28:16 pass it on man i do not know
28:19 scientifically
28:20 how thc would fight cancer i have no
28:23 clue
28:23 how that would ever fight cancer and nor
28:25 has any video that i've ever seen
28:28 explain the connection
28:31 with b17 and c it's pure physics
28:35 and it's identical to
28:38 in principle chemotherapy now how does
28:41 cancer work because there's different
28:43 types of cancers right
28:44 the two most common
28:48 physical forms of cancer is
28:51 a cancer that is turning into more of a
28:54 cystic circle like a ball
28:58 it does have a fibrous like outer edges
29:00 but for the most part 99 of it's a ball
29:04 the other cancer is more nebulous it's
29:07 more
29:08 muscle invasive it looks like a spider
29:10 web
29:12 matter what shape this stuff is or where
29:13 it is in your body
29:15 these techniques that i have success
29:18 with
29:20 will destroy it but imagine now you've
29:22 got thermal treatments and you're trying
29:23 to
29:24 treat brain cancer you don't want to
29:27 probably use that necessarily i mean
29:29 your blood is your blood it's all over
29:30 your body
29:32 it might help but i would just use b17
29:35 and c
29:35 and on everything quite frankly that's
29:38 just my
29:39 experience just got a brand new
29:43 case about about two years ago
29:46 a friend of mine her best girlfriend
29:50 came down with stage four
29:52 i threw this at her she got again
29:55 the same regiment from somebody else and
29:57 so she had it from two sources
29:58 one that was i guess closer to her and
30:00 then my regimen in there
30:02 she beautifully got rid of sugar and
30:04 meat took this regiment
30:07 she's in full remission she is not going
30:09 to die
30:10 she has no traceable cancer and now
30:12 she's writing a book about it
30:14 i mean you tell me if you want that
30:16 success story for your relatives or
30:18 yourself
30:20 we've had listeners when i first did my
30:22 first episode which is 17
30:24 way back in the day in 2015
30:27 within a year i had two people come into
30:29 the comments and say man i did this
30:31 i had lymph no cancer they were starting
30:34 to tell me i was going to die and he and
30:36 they said
30:36 i'm completely fine now this stuff's a
30:39 miracle
30:40 thank you i'm like hey i still love off
30:42 other people
30:44 but here's why cancer nails you it's
30:47 really simple
30:48 when cancer starts being a bully in your
30:50 body
30:51 everywhere it is your body is complicit
30:54 to it
30:55 meaning it just wants to get bigger and
30:57 bigger and bigger and your body just
30:58 keeps going oh
30:59 okay okay oh yeah sure okay and it gets
31:02 to the point where
31:03 it tries to occupy space in your body
31:06 where you have vital organs like bones
31:10 and pancreases and
31:13 everything and so just gets out of the
31:16 way and it gets out of the way to the
31:18 degree
31:18 it can just move over and then
31:20 eventually it starts to lose
31:23 it starts to invade the actual organ
31:25 itself whether it be a bone or not
31:27 and starts replacing the organ
31:32 with the cancer now the more complex
31:34 your organ
31:35 you have a higher chance of
31:38 dying of cancer because like your
31:40 pancreas is
31:41 probably your your transmission of your
31:45 body it's
31:45 it's regulating your insulin very
31:48 complex
31:50 so you want to get in there and nail it
31:51 as fast as you can
31:54 now the the only proprietary thing that
31:56 you have to
31:58 check out for your situation or your
32:00 friend's situation would be
32:03 if there's already been a lot of damage
32:04 to a very important organ
32:06 we have to look at okay what's the odds
32:09 of this organ
32:11 buttoning up the damage and continuing
32:13 to work at least enough so that you have
32:15 a good life you know
32:17 but now b17 was as far as i understand i
32:20 read an article
32:21 within the last year that they had
32:23 successfully banded in australia
32:28 citing a cyanide effect the b17 has
32:32 to keep things simple the cyanide effect
32:34 is their
32:36 definition of
32:39 what these electron sheds do
32:42 but now you can create apparently a
32:44 version of cyanide using
32:46 the internals of the apricot seed but
32:49 you can also
32:51 create things like rice and a bunch of
32:53 other things
32:54 with these seeds out of plants
32:57 almost all plants surround their seeds
33:00 with a a gelatin coating
33:04 that if you don't boil that stuff off or
33:06 or
33:08 roast it off and you eat it you can die
33:13 with various techniques you can take
33:15 that
33:16 poison that may not kill you but it may
33:18 make you feel horrible
33:20 i was always told that peanuts just
33:22 regular old planters peanuts if you were
33:24 to dig them out of the ground open the
33:25 shell and
33:26 eat it you can die pretty quickly that's
33:28 why they're roasted peanuts
33:30 in almost every situation right but a
33:33 chemist
33:33 can take that poison and consolidate it
33:36 down
33:37 i guess and reduce it to the point its
33:38 power gets to the point of cyanide
33:42 it's an absurd ban to make sure that
33:44 australians
33:46 die of cancer and fund oncology
33:49 departments which are
33:51 you know billion dollar multi-billion
33:53 dollar organizations yearly and trillion
33:55 dollar organizations over a decade
33:57 it's it's an atrocious thing
34:00 they have infiltrated the law
34:02 enforcement the laws
34:05 it is uh definitely sort of an indirect
34:08 method of
34:09 milking your family of all their wealth
34:12 because think about it if someone said i
34:15 can cure your mom but you're gonna have
34:17 to give me
34:17 how much money you have in your bank
34:19 account oh how much money is your house
34:20 worth
34:21 okay it's that that's the amount of
34:22 money they'll take it in two seconds
34:25 there's no
34:26 moral layer there nobody wants to help
34:29 anybody
34:31 just cause they just don't want to do it
34:33 when most the chemotherapy treatments
34:35 are
34:36 brainless absolutely brainless
34:38 applications
34:40 now let's talk about things that can
34:41 give you
34:44 all kinds of illnesses but in particular
34:46 various forms of cancer
34:49 because there's a tremendous number
34:54 of mutated cells that we track
34:58 and so that's why you have so many
35:01 different names
35:02 for it now you might be asking yourself
35:05 if you've never heard about me before
35:06 what the who the hell are you to be
35:07 saying these things well one
35:09 i have witnessed due to my own
35:11 recommendations at least four people
35:15 get restored out of cancer
35:20 i first learned about this because i
35:22 used to have a show before this one
35:24 and my co-host was telling me about a
35:25 friend of his that had b17
35:27 injections he was giving himself from a
35:29 doctor in los angeles who believed in it
35:32 he had stage three and a half he's a
35:33 special effects guy he gave it to
35:35 himself
35:36 fully cured then his cat came down with
35:38 cancer at age of eight
35:40 he said what the hell they told me my
35:42 cat's gonna die so he started injecting
35:44 in the gums of the cat
35:46 and the cat lived up to the point we did
35:48 the show which was four years
35:50 after that diagnosis that it was going
35:52 to die soon
35:54 when i learned physics in high school
35:57 initially and i was already sort of a
35:59 physicist
36:00 uh you know whatever you can do
36:03 studying on your own but i was
36:05 exhaustively uh addicted
36:07 some kids are addicted to video games i
36:09 was addicted to physics of all kinds
36:11 from
36:12 newtonian physics all the way up through
36:14 to quantum physics
36:16 i'm not saying these things to sound
36:17 smart it's just the truth
36:19 my physics teacher's wife died of cancer
36:21 about a year and a half before i took
36:23 him
36:24 so immediately he starts teaching us
36:27 essentially the principles of virology
36:28 at the same time he's teaching as
36:30 physics
36:31 he's teaching us every conceivable
36:33 technique that
36:35 your body can get damaged from natural
36:37 causes
36:39 such as sunlight which he dispelled a
36:42 tremendous amount of that problem
36:45 eating carcinogens
36:48 robbing your body of what it's made out
36:50 of
36:52 as well as starving it off so that you
36:55 can kill it
36:56 he didn't know anything about b17 he
36:57 didn't know anything about c
36:59 i didn't know b17 existed until i was in
37:01 my late 30s
37:03 and i worked in the pharma business for
37:05 three years
37:06 i don't think it would be a mystery to
37:08 you if i told you that
37:10 the way to stay healthy is to keep your
37:11 body at its natural
37:14 god-given design on a second-to-second
37:18 basis you should be as
37:19 balanced as possible with the way that
37:22 your body is supposed to
37:24 ingest nutrients any type of
37:28 fluids it should be as natural as
37:30 possible which means
37:33 again we may pat ourselves on the back
37:36 for being a super civilized society and
37:38 we definitely have made
37:40 amazing strides in that area but we've
37:42 also replaced our
37:43 food supply with genetically modified
37:46 food supplies
37:47 selling ourselves problems that have
37:49 nothing to do with your health regimen
37:52 they're selling you gmos for instance
37:54 genetically modified organisms
37:57 to fix a production problem and not to
37:59 fix a health problem
38:01 there's not a single health regiment or
38:03 health goal of gmos
38:06 in existence it's all to feed a bunch of
38:09 people
38:10 as they procreate too much their
38:14 governments do nothing to help educate
38:15 them that procreating too much is a huge
38:17 problem
38:19 for our food supplies for society in
38:22 general
38:24 we now are surrounded by electromagnetic
38:26 waves that are
38:28 so far beyond
38:31 nature and we're ignoring it
38:34 it's insane
38:37 the human body has a natural
38:41 frequency of five to nine hertz
38:45 that means under 10. during electrical
38:48 storm
38:49 nature can produce almost 30 hertz
38:53 during an electrical a very very bad
38:56 electrical storm
38:57 30 okay that's 3-0
39:01 the reason why i'm stressing these
39:03 numbers is that we now have 5g towers
39:06 everywhere
39:08 and it's just going to get worse 5g's
39:11 original design
39:12 is to have low medium high bands
39:14 available in two years
39:15 today they have low and medium low is
39:18 about 20
39:19 billion hertz medium is about 40 to 50
39:23 billion hertz and high is going to be a
39:26 hundred
39:27 billion hertz and that's just 5g
39:30 6g is already being deployed i believe
39:33 in china in a couple experimental
39:35 locations
39:37 it's causing diabetes your pancreas
39:40 releases
39:41 something called insulin because if you
39:44 eat a bunch of sugar
39:46 sugar can't go anywhere in your body in
39:48 its raw form it must be encapsulated
39:50 inside of the insulin
39:52 wrapper so that your cells will allow
39:55 the sugar to come inside
39:57 they know mr insulin they don't know mr
39:59 sugar
40:01 if you think about it an easy way to
40:03 think about this is sugars from the
40:04 outside
40:06 insulins from the inside who would be
40:08 friend and who would be fo
40:09 the one inside is your friend the one
40:11 outside is foe
40:13 so insulin says hey no he's with me
40:16 and you get it put together
40:20 the problem is is that because our
40:22 bodies are being so
40:24 infiltrated by high frequency television
40:27 radio and cell phone not to mention
40:32 really intense electrical towers
40:35 that as this insulin is trying to go for
40:37 the sugar it's literally being vibrated
40:39 like someone's shaking your elbow when
40:41 you're trying to type on your phone
40:44 it's exactly that now in terms of
40:46 radiation
40:48 again the
40:52 the amount of skin problems we incurred
40:54 once dermatology
40:55 existed is utterly laughable these folks
41:00 don't make any money unless they prove
41:01 to you that you have some skin problem
41:03 and therefore
41:05 they created these blurry indexes to say
41:07 well we got this index on a ruler which
41:09 is
41:10 you know how bad you know how cancerous
41:12 a particular cell is in your body
41:14 and they're trying to make money so no
41:16 one in my hometown
41:18 was dropping dead of cancer or having
41:20 cancer cells removed from their face
41:22 until dermatology became a thing
41:24 and the pamphlets came into the old
41:25 people freaking them out and then
41:26 everybody was bragging at coffee
41:28 about how many cells they had taken off
41:30 their face
41:32 i think a dermatologist just killed one
41:34 of my
41:35 closest friends in the entire world i
41:38 don't trust him
41:40 and when they sta they found basically a
41:43 cell on his body
41:44 that was cancerous as what they said and
41:46 they started radiology on his body
41:49 well right where they started radiology
41:50 he started getting billions of cancerous
41:52 cells and then they just kept doing it
41:54 all over his leg
41:55 until they stopped and once they stopped
41:58 doing this
41:59 draconian thing having milked him for
42:01 hundreds of thousands of dollars
42:03 oh my gosh all the cancer went away
42:05 problem is the chemo was in his body
42:07 and he killed him didn't trust me
42:11 what are other things that can get you
42:14 anything unnatural will get you
42:17 sugar substitutes are notorious
42:20 for creating horrible states inside your
42:22 body one of the biggest ones is
42:24 aspartame
42:26 which you find in all your diet soft
42:27 drinks and all your diet gums and diet
42:30 candies
42:31 hey man you can lose weight you can
42:34 brush your teeth
42:35 by eating pure sugar you shouldn't
42:38 you shouldn't need too much craziness
42:40 but you could solve those problems
42:42 just by cutting down if you think you're
42:46 solving a problem by
42:47 ingesting a bunch of artificial
42:49 sweeteners
42:51 now stevia is i think a natural thing
42:53 but you have to be careful if you're
42:54 diabetic i think with that particular
42:56 regimen if you have blood pressure
42:57 problems
42:58 again just eat the normal stuff folks
43:02 but aspartame was and is and will remain
43:06 one of the pivotal moments when the fda
43:08 was absolutely
43:10 100 destroyed and co-opted out of
43:13 anyone's favor
43:15 a guy named donald rumsfeld was the ceo
43:17 of a company named searle
43:19 s-e-a-r-l i believe and cyril had
43:22 created a heart medication that was
43:24 coincidentally 22 times more sugary
43:27 tasting than sugar
43:29 and so they wanted to make a sugar
43:31 substitute the only problem was is that
43:33 it
43:33 actually metabolizes in your body to
43:36 formaldehyde
43:37 and methyl ester which is rubbing
43:39 alcohol that you use to clean your hands
43:42 now methyl ester is found in nature
43:45 but it's always found in a compound
43:48 technique and not an element technique
43:49 and what's that mean
43:51 the skin of an apple has
43:55 pectin bound to methyl ester
43:58 you eat an apple and you don't get
44:00 cancer because it's bound
44:02 to the pectin pectin is just an awesome
44:05 fiber for your body
44:06 so you eat it and it goes through your
44:07 body
44:09 however if you microwave that apple
44:12 which i don't know you might do that to
44:14 prepare a pie or something
44:16 some sort of delicacy
44:20 the microwave which is going to be
44:21 flipping water molecules
44:23 a billion times per second from its
44:26 north pole to its south pole back to its
44:27 north pole
44:29 can shatter food elements apart
44:32 or fruit compounds into food elements
44:34 meaning an individual
44:35 chemical now the pectin and the methyl
44:38 ester will be separated
44:40 and when you eat that apple in the
44:41 microwave out of the microwave
44:44 that's reason why it tastes different
44:46 microwave food tastes different because
44:48 it's had its
44:49 compounds destroyed that which tricks
44:52 your
44:53 tongue and your nose into creating what
44:55 we call a flavor
44:57 so i don't use any sugar substitutes of
44:59 any kind
45:00 i keep my sugar down to a minimum i
45:02 enjoy sugary things but i just do it as
45:03 a regiment
45:05 you know once once a weekend i might go
45:08 to dairy queen down on the beach because
45:10 it's gorgeous
45:11 and i'll eat a normal meal which is made
45:13 of a bunch of production or processed
45:14 foods which we're getting into
45:17 but it's just my entire cheat meal and
45:20 then i might do a tiny blizzard or
45:21 something
45:22 and i'm out my friends that ingest
45:25 bags of sugar are all the most unhealthy
45:29 people
45:30 with mysterious pains in their torso
45:33 they will most likely shave 10 20 30
45:37 years off their life
45:38 and spontaneously die on me
45:41 there's a choice there and they can do
45:43 that
45:44 let's talk about processed foods have
45:47 you ever heard that
45:48 several animals don't eat dead food dead
45:52 kill like if a bear comes up on a uh
45:56 a dead animal and it's been dead for you
46:00 know
46:00 two or three hours they won't eat it the
46:03 reason why is that mother nature
46:05 figured it out a long time ago
46:08 as something dies it starts to ionize
46:12 i mean the negative electron
46:16 coating over all the matter starts to
46:19 increase ice cream that you leave in the
46:21 freezer for a long time tastes real
46:22 irony and weird
46:24 same sort of thing we want to eat food
46:27 as
46:28 fresh as we possibly can every single
46:30 day the freshest vegetables the freshest
46:32 meats
46:33 but just understand that we are hooked
46:35 on grainy foods like
46:37 cheez-its and crackers
46:40 and that wheat was harvested a year ago
46:42 in a box for six months
46:44 it's just nasty there's no nutrients in
46:48 that stuff
46:48 as a matter of fact you're supplementing
46:50 yourself with no nutri nutrients making
46:52 your gut
46:54 stop arguing with you whether or not
46:55 you're hungry
46:57 but you're dying inside because what
46:59 your body needs to procreate
47:01 is not there the other one is just sheer
47:04 toxins
47:06 that we apply to our body i've
47:10 used to use aluminum based underarm
47:14 deodorants or antiperspirants excuse me
47:16 i now just use deodorants just a little
47:19 gel
47:20 it's got a scent to it now i'm fortunate
47:22 i don't sweat that much
47:23 you might be dealing with a much bigger
47:26 situation but aluminum
47:28 in your body is just nasty it's a metal
47:31 should not be inside your body under any
47:33 circumstance
47:36 so there are other techniques there's
47:38 actually some really good alternatives
47:40 now but you might have to go through two
47:41 or three brands to find one that really
47:43 reacts with your chemistry
47:45 but why is there aluminum in
47:46 antiperspirant
47:48 well you have these sweat glands
47:53 under your arms and what they're trying
47:54 to do is block with a metal
47:57 dust those output
48:01 holes and it works
48:04 problem is it can continue to absorb
48:06 into to your body
48:08 and so there are alternatives that use
48:10 crystals
48:12 and i don't mean the kind you hang
48:13 around your neck and uh
48:15 kumbaya too but they're just it looks
48:17 like a normal antiperspirant thing but
48:19 if you
48:19 zoom into it it's a natural crystal
48:22 that's also
48:23 water solvent so that will disappear
48:26 over time and never absorb into your
48:28 system and even if it did it's inert
48:30 doesn't have any metal properties in
48:32 your body
48:34 i don't use microwaves based on what i
48:36 told you
48:38 it was uh 2005 and i got rid of
48:43 aspartame and you have to understand i'm
48:46 not trying to be
48:47 holier now i had a 12 pack of dr pepper
48:49 in my fridge
48:50 threw it out didn't drink it i had the
48:52 most beautiful microwave
48:54 that i've ever seen in my entire life
48:57 gave it away
48:59 stopped using antiperspirant went to
49:01 deodorant found out geez i've been over
49:03 achieving
49:04 because i don't sweat that much
49:07 as far as processed foods i'm very aware
49:10 of my processed foods now
49:12 as far as eating pure sugar in a candy
49:14 form or something
49:16 very aware of what i'm doing i regiment
49:18 the whole thing
49:20 now the last major thing
49:24 is a controversial one for some of you
49:27 i think there are several stages to the
49:29 controversy
49:30 and i think over time the controversy
49:32 solves itself
49:34 but when you're in the middle of the
49:35 controversy you will be angry that i'm
49:38 going to
49:38 suggest this last thing
49:42 which is that when you're healthy when
49:45 you're
49:46 not suffering from any type of
49:50 significant cancer of any kind because
49:51 we always have a little bit in our
49:52 system
49:54 i've talked to the most brilliant
49:57 nutritionists
49:58 people in their 70s who are doctors who
50:01 have seen the entire
50:02 cycle of life with 40 years experience
50:05 recommending things and not recommending
50:07 things
50:09 they themselves were thin and healthy
50:11 they looked 20 years younger than what
50:13 they were
50:15 and it's the subject of vegetarianism
50:18 versus
50:19 eating meat now there's kind of a
50:22 win-win for both of us
50:25 when you have a
50:28 a lump of cancer that you need to get
50:31 rid of
50:32 you need to be a vegetarian right away
50:35 if you're healthy you need some red meat
50:40 but you don't need much so
50:43 the reason why a lot of folks pull out
50:45 of
50:46 eating meat uh is one they were most
50:49 likely ingesting
50:50 way too much and we all have just way
50:53 too much especially with the five food
50:55 groups that the united states teaches
50:56 their citizens
50:58 the amount of red meat that i have been
50:59 told that you need to ingest on a weekly
51:01 basis
51:02 is a piece of meat the size of a deck of
51:04 cards
51:06 or honestly a fairly large cell phone
51:10 you're to get the most fresh amazing
51:12 meat you can get
51:13 obviously corn fed where the cow isn't
51:16 abused
51:18 but a deck of cards a week how many
51:20 times have you ever just ingested
51:22 a deck of cards in a week if you're a
51:25 meat eater and you've never heard this
51:26 theory before
51:27 usually you're eating meat four or five
51:29 times a week
51:31 you don't need to so far
51:35 six days a week you can be a vegetarian
51:37 like when i i want people to know that
51:38 are angry at me
51:39 for suggesting this i'm a vegetarian
51:43 honestly five to six days a week i love
51:47 vegetarian pizzas and
51:49 and just big salads and that kind of
51:51 stuff a little bit of chicken here and
51:52 there
51:53 but chicken and pork are not part of
51:54 this mechanism
51:56 they do not have what you need the most
51:59 intense conversation i had at a very
52:02 intellectual
52:03 party was with this gentleman who was in
52:05 his 70s he was a nutritionist's
52:07 nutritionist phd and i brought it up to
52:11 him i said hey man what's the deal you
52:12 know i mean
52:12 this whole red meat thing right and he
52:15 said to me he goes um
52:17 he goes well your dna your nucleic acid
52:21 chain
52:22 when it replicates and turns into an rna
52:24 strand and tries to build its component
52:26 on the other side because if you don't
52:27 eat red meat
52:29 then it has to cannibalize the rest of
52:31 your body to build that other chain
52:33 he says there's eight amino acids that
52:36 you
52:37 use to live and he goes five of them
52:40 only exist in red meat
52:42 i would definitely consider my life a
52:45 complete success if i look like this guy
52:47 at the age i met him but now why do
52:49 people
52:51 dive off into vegetarianism
52:54 one there's a bunch of crap science out
52:56 there
52:57 cows eat grass we eat cows why not just
53:01 eat the grass and become the cow
53:03 well there's protein recombinations that
53:05 happen within the cow
53:06 to build the muscle mass that we eat
53:10 the elite of the world who have the best
53:13 health care
53:14 in the world they have the best doctors
53:17 in the world all of the five-star
53:21 michelin star restaurants
53:24 all serve red meat the queen
53:28 and her family live to be a hundred
53:30 almost as a matter of a of an imperative
53:33 they're eating red meat they're just not
53:35 eating a 16-ounce steak
53:37 like somebody who feels like they have
53:38 to uphold a regiment of
53:40 texas perception but now a lot of folks
53:44 get
53:44 obese while eating red meat
53:47 and so they switch over to vegetarianism
53:49 obviously massively reducing their
53:52 overall calorie intake and they lose a
53:54 lot of weight and they feel wonderful
53:56 some of these people can run for the
53:57 very first time and they haven't run
53:59 perhaps since they were teenagers and so
54:02 they're like this is this was the best
54:03 decision of my life and i wouldn't
54:05 disagree with you
54:07 but i would just sneak in a deck of
54:08 cards once a week
54:10 of prime meat i did the uh
54:14 the chickatarian thing for 11 months
54:16 once ended up in the hospital
54:19 this nurse thought i had aids because i
54:22 told her that i was super tired she
54:23 didn't do any blood work or anything
54:24 she's just
54:25 it was just a popular thing it's
54:27 probably 93 92
54:30 it was 93 actually sorry 93
54:33 when they did my blood work the doctor
54:36 looks at my file and says
54:38 um when's the he likes look at my iron
54:41 levels and he goes damn he goes when's
54:43 the last time he had
54:44 eight red meat and i go oh my god i
54:45 haven't eaten red meat for 11 months he
54:47 threw my file on the
54:48 table said go get a steak would you i
54:51 and ate a big steak that night
54:52 and my god all my energy levels came
54:54 back and it's amazing
54:55 so you can have this
54:59 you know nordic european gene pool that
55:01 i have
55:03 and you need red meat but you could also
55:05 be
55:07 3 000 years into nothing but a
55:08 vegetarian diet maybe southern india
55:11 or china or something and you're fine
55:14 you don't have a memory of a lot of
55:17 energy
55:17 and so it's you're okay
55:20 so it just depends on where your your
55:22 genes come from what your
55:24 culture has been eating in a particular
55:26 indigenous area
55:28 you may want to just go ahead and mock
55:30 that
55:31 for me i can i can
55:35 so easily tell a vegetarian just by
55:38 visually looking at them for
55:39 about five minutes of conversation what
55:42 i've noticed is
55:44 like my thin my skin is very thick and
55:46 very smooth
55:47 very few wrinkles a vegetarian no matter
55:51 how old but if they had to be about five
55:52 years into it they start getting this
55:54 plasticky skin
55:55 super thin wrinkles are everywhere
55:58 because they're
56:00 essentially a bag from radio shack i
56:02 mean
56:03 it's it's crazy but they'll think
56:04 they're so healthy and it's so strange
56:07 that's just been my personal experience
56:10 over time
56:11 what i was told and steve jobs was
56:14 a person i was privileged enough to work
56:17 with at one point in time
56:18 was kind of my hero on one level
56:22 he ended up dying of not being able to
56:24 ingest meat proteins
56:27 i think what is he 57 years old but he
56:29 had been a vegetarian since he was 17.
56:33 his pancreas blew out and you know we
56:36 can have a bunch of conspiracies about
56:38 who might want
56:39 him to exit the world early
56:42 but when they started injecting him with
56:44 meat proteins and he was unable to
56:46 absorb them
56:48 that's way beyond any conspiracy that's
56:50 just his body
56:52 finally saying look you haven't eaten
56:54 this in a really long time
56:56 we're going to continue cannibalizing
56:57 the organs in your body
56:59 to my complete mitosis phases
57:03 and it just so happened that the
57:04 pancreas can't
57:06 can't loan too much out before it starts
57:08 to die
57:09 and that's why pancreatic cancer
57:13 has a four percent chance of survival if
57:15 you get it it's just a complex organ you
57:17 can't damage that thing
57:20 so moderation of all things is always
57:22 been one of the greatest pieces of
57:24 advice
57:26 if you look at the wild kingdom
57:29 animals that ingest meat are the number
57:32 one animals that rule their
57:34 respective areas it doesn't mean a
57:36 gorilla
57:37 or elephant isn't gigantic and can stomp
57:39 your ass
57:40 but a tiger right
57:44 even the fabled dinosaurs you have
57:46 tyrannosaurus rex are the
57:48 the carnivores they're the ones that
57:49 rule the land
57:51 and that's based on practical science it
57:53 really is
57:55 and the notion that uh and just to put
57:57 this in there because i know some folks
57:59 and this isn't one i hear a lot anymore
58:01 but
58:01 some folks have a moral problem with
58:03 hurting animals
58:05 they'll say things like things with eyes
58:09 shouldn't be eaten and that sort of
58:10 thing and that's really up to you
58:12 i would say that if you think plants
58:14 aren't alive you're nuts
58:16 we've absolutely proven their
58:18 neurological capability of
58:20 almost reading the mind of a human being
58:23 because they put electrodes up to plants
58:25 and they'll think
58:26 thoughts at them that they're going to
58:28 hurt them and the plant goes crazy
58:30 and then when you come back and you
58:31 think nice thoughts toward the plants
58:33 they totally get mellow and chill
58:35 they also remember human beings quite
58:38 specifically almost as if they have eyes
58:39 but they must be
58:40 tracking something else and i'm not i'm
58:42 not trying to be funny here this is a
58:44 real deal it's been going on for
58:45 40 years of of studies
58:48 just go look it up you'll see these
58:50 experiments it's mind-blowing
58:52 moderation now you'll also hear about
58:55 carcinogens
58:58 the best way to describe this is
59:01 i would say a marshmallow over a fire
59:07 if you burn it down to its blackness
59:09 which some people love it that way
59:11 and you ingest it you're ingesting a
59:12 pure carcinogen
59:14 i mean there's marshmallow in the middle
59:16 of course this is not that way
59:18 but you're a carbon-based life form
59:19 aren't you
59:21 which means you have an inordinate
59:22 amount of carbon in your system
59:25 all living things have carbon in them
59:27 carbon and hydrogen are the two
59:29 most common atoms in the universe
59:32 hydrogen being the number one
59:35 when you burn anything it turns into a
59:37 black
59:38 version of itself a log a plant a human
59:41 body
59:42 it turns black goes back to its pure
59:44 form and what's going on is everything
59:46 that could combust inside a living thing
59:49 thermalizes and turns into fire and that
59:51 stuff that can't burn
59:52 is your carbon which is why you got
59:54 black when it's left
59:56 if you eat that stuff purely eat it and
60:00 there's all kinds of toxins and all
60:01 kinds of things
60:03 and all kinds of foods but you're
60:06 essentially eating a chemical
60:08 that can get in the way of the nuclear
60:11 bonds that make you as a human being
60:14 if you know how mudslides work how does
60:17 it work
60:18 you got a mountain and if it's dry it's
60:21 fine
60:21 but torrentially rains on that mountain
60:24 the water gets inside
60:27 the the soil and acts like a ball
60:29 bearing
60:30 and eventually too many ball bearings
60:31 inside all the soil
60:33 it lets loose because it can't hang onto
60:35 itself anymore and it slides down the
60:36 hill
60:37 and they're miraculous things to watch
60:39 and they're horrifying when they
60:40 hit communities right
60:44 there's an analogy there for you eating
60:47 essentially a chemical quicksand such
60:50 that when your body's trying to hang on
60:51 to its form
60:52 it's got essentially a lubricant in
60:55 there that will
60:57 cause your cellular nucleic acids and
61:01 all kinds of things to have issues
61:02 replicating properly it starts to create
61:06 defects
61:08 now what about the sun or any type of
61:10 radiation
61:12 any type of shedding electron that's
61:14 super duper strong
61:15 like chemo chemotherapy
61:18 well most of you have seen the double
61:21 helix
61:22 which is your your code your actg
61:26 code of nucleic acid combinations that
61:28 make you a human being
61:30 those are actually told what to do by
61:32 your proteins which are about 50
61:34 of your chromosome but every time you
61:36 watch a marvel movie
61:38 they don't portray any proteins in your
61:39 chromosomes especially like prometheus
61:42 act one scene one where the guy eats the
61:45 thing and then he dives into the water
61:46 and he turns into a bunch of dna that
61:48 then
61:49 proliferates planet earth they always
61:52 skip the proteins
61:53 when you have a
61:58 strip of double helix
62:01 and an electron goes through that double
62:03 helix then you get two pieces
62:05 of the rope nine times out of ten
62:08 because the actg
62:10 combinations have disciplines of who can
62:12 attach to which letter
62:14 they will reattach and be just fine
62:17 however if you take that rope and you
62:19 slice it twice how many pieces do you
62:21 have
62:21 you have three pieces well under certain
62:24 rare cases which is why cancer is rare
62:26 that center section can rotate and if
62:29 the combinations are correct
62:31 to leak latch back up with the lego
62:35 then you get a mutated double helix
62:38 which will start growing in weird ways
62:40 ball tumor invasive spider webby
62:44 stuff the reason why they want you to be
62:47 careful getting extreme
62:48 sun that's because photons
62:52 will come through and nail your
62:54 epidermis your skin
62:56 the catch-22 is you need vitamin d to
62:59 stay healthy
63:00 and the sun on your body all of your
63:04 skin creates vitamin d so you want as
63:07 much sun on your body as you possibly
63:08 can
63:09 at least once a day and the regimen's
63:11 usually an hour to two hours of
63:13 sort of medium sun you might not want to
63:14 go out during high noon if you have
63:17 if you're a redhead you have to be a
63:19 little bit careful if you're albino you
63:20 got to be super careful
63:22 so you're going to have to regiment your
63:24 sun exposure
63:25 based on what kind of genome you have in
63:28 your family line
63:30 obviously the darker your skin you could
63:33 probably stay out
63:34 a lot longer because you're built to
63:36 withstand that
63:39 but as soon as dermatologists came into
63:40 the business what did they say they said
63:42 start putting sunscreen all over your
63:43 body
63:45 it has now been proven that sunscreen
63:47 when
63:48 applied to your body can be non-toxic
63:51 but the second it gets hit by photons
63:53 it goes toxic on your system smearing a
63:56 chemical all over your body to solve a
63:58 problem
64:00 is probably a bad idea the best idea
64:02 would be to not get involved
64:04 with why you have to put the stuff on
64:06 yourself to begin with
64:08 the one thing that benefited me by being
64:12 raised in kansas
64:14 which is a farm culture here in america
64:17 it's the center of america
64:18 literally is that we are called rednecks
64:22 we're called rednecks because farmers go
64:24 out and it's a little bit easier today
64:26 because they have nice air-conditioned
64:28 combines and things but there used to be
64:30 a time not so long ago
64:32 that farmers had to be outside from dusk
64:35 till dawn
64:38 i mean down till dusk excuse me and they
64:41 were just red
64:42 and we did not have a tremendous amount
64:44 of people dying of skin cancer
64:47 but it might be because we have a
64:50 european tradition of farming
64:52 and anyone that was going to die of sun
64:54 exposure died a long time ago
64:56 and what we have left are folks that can
64:57 handle it farmers wore hats
65:00 farmers stay in the shade again now most
65:02 of the equipment allows you to be
65:04 in a very protective environment with
65:06 glass that'll protect you from harmful
65:08 uv
65:08 rays the classic thing is that as men
65:12 came up with new regiments to keep you
65:14 healthy almost every single one of them
65:16 turns into
65:19 something that kills you now i have an
65:22 episode out there
65:23 that is a great compliment to this and
65:24 it will shock your system
65:28 it's got a very strange name but it's
65:30 called codex alimentarius
65:33 just look up cod ex on this channel or
65:36 go to deepthoughtsradio.com and type
65:38 that in there
65:40 there was an evil organization created
65:42 called the world trade organization
65:45 it was literally formed by a
65:47 pharmaceutical ceo who built
65:49 the concentration camp known as
65:51 auschwitz
65:52 after world war ii he was able to
65:55 sidestep the nuremberg trials where he
65:57 should have been put to death
65:58 because he sold the new world order i
66:00 hate to say it
66:02 but he sold the controlling factions of
66:04 this world
66:06 a napoleon law system for regulating
66:08 health
66:10 he was very pro-vaccination he said
66:13 we're going to control
66:14 the genome of man through vaccines and
66:16 you just look this up
66:19 by 1994 the americas were pulled into
66:23 this
66:23 wto through bill clinton signing a
66:27 treaty without any additional oversight
66:29 from the senate or the congress which is
66:31 illegal
66:32 so america is actually in this but what
66:34 the world trade organization
66:35 does in a nutshell is they have a
66:38 regiment to toxify all food on planet
66:41 earth before we're allowed
66:42 to ingest it if your country is signed
66:45 up to the wto
66:47 then you can trade with other wto
66:50 countries
66:51 again they irradiate your food they have
66:53 over 76 pesticides which are rated good
66:55 for you
66:56 and every single vitamin and mineral is
66:59 deemed a toxin
67:00 so what keeps you healthy is deemed bad
67:03 and what kills you is deemed good
67:06 go see my episode because it's very very
67:08 deep and easy to understand
67:10 but it will blow your mind now say
67:12 you're a country that doesn't want to
67:14 sign up to the wto because you have a
67:16 brain
67:17 you no longer can buy anything from a
67:19 country
67:20 that is connected to the wto because you
67:22 haven't signed up to the club
67:24 to kill all of your citizens now i
67:26 mentioned gmos and i have a whole
67:27 episode
67:28 on that as well gmos
67:31 are extremely complex and extremely bad
67:33 for you
67:36 gmos were snuck into the food supply in
67:38 americas without telling a single soul
67:41 and then we started having to use
67:43 something called probiotics in the 21st
67:45 century because everyone's guts are
67:46 getting destroyed by this gmo stuff
67:48 which in some cases can electrically
67:50 destroy your upper intestines
67:52 for up to two weeks per meal continue
67:55 eating
67:56 it and your upper intestine will never
67:57 heal and that's where you ingest
68:00 and absorb all of your nutrients that
68:01 keeps you healthy
68:04 we're buying organic food and paying
68:05 more money for it now when
68:07 40 years ago everyone was eating organic
68:09 food
68:11 now it's genetically modified
68:15 the clinical studies on
68:18 gmo are only second the only second
68:22 to the clinical studies of aspartame
68:26 which killed every single animal
68:28 including the monkeys
68:30 that they gave it to aspartame i should
68:32 say too is also
68:35 very linked to brain tumors
68:39 ted kennedy who died of spontaneous
68:41 brain cancer
68:42 always had a diet coke next to him in
68:44 the senate
68:47 go figure man stay natural
68:50 that's the easiest way to stay healthy
68:52 in moderation moderation moderation
68:56 the other big one is if you've heard it
68:59 before
69:00 you'll go oh yeah but if you haven't
69:01 heard this it'll be shocking to your
69:02 system
69:04 i don't brush with any fluoride
69:08 fluoride is a metal dust known as
69:10 fluorine before it is
69:11 just renamed and given to you in your
69:14 toothpaste
69:16 now fluoride can exist in mother nature
69:19 and black teas and what have you but the
69:21 parts per billion
69:23 is negligible compared to what they do
69:26 with your
69:26 average water supply in your hometown
69:28 where they're bringing you
69:30 fluoride and putting it in your water
69:33 fluoride
69:34 promotes osteoporosis tooth decay
69:37 and rot your pineal gland like a cancer
69:42 fluoride will crystallize inside your
69:44 pineal gland
69:45 and because your pineal glands just like
69:46 every other organ in your body gets out
69:48 of the way of invaders
69:49 this crystallization starts to knock
69:52 down
69:53 the function of your pineal gland which
69:56 is your empathy
69:57 it is your connection to the universe as
69:59 a whole
70:00 don't believe me stop rushing with it
70:02 and check yourself every six months to
70:04 see how much your brain has enhanced
70:07 i when i got off fluoride and aspartame
70:11 especially i experienced
70:14 within a year i experienced a super
70:16 augmentation of my brain
70:18 it was really shocking i had to get used
70:20 to having
70:22 more processor power it was that
70:25 dramatic
70:26 but the way it works is that this theory
70:29 is that you put this
70:30 stuff in your mouth called fluoride and
70:32 most dentists now are actually at least
70:34 in southern california telling you don't
70:36 even need toothpaste just brush your
70:37 teeth every day and floss
70:39 you can use baking soda but there's a
70:40 tremendous amount of alternative
70:42 toothpastes in america
70:43 it tastes wonderful i've not had stuff
70:45 in it
70:46 but the theory is that this dust gets
70:48 into the pores of your enamel and your
70:50 teeth
70:51 thus preventing bacteria from getting
70:54 into those holes thus eating your teeth
70:56 well one maybe relax on the sugar a
70:58 little bit
70:59 maybe brush your teeth more often
71:02 problem is metals expand and contract
71:04 with heat and coal
71:06 this over time will break the enamel in
71:09 your teeth which is why in my own family
71:13 i think it was my cousin he hit 40 he
71:15 had sheets of the back of his teeth
71:18 pop off terrifying
71:21 now he and i have different teeth i've
71:23 got my mom's teeth which is
71:25 pretty pretty rough and pretty rugged my
71:28 dentist told me he goes if everyone had
71:29 teeth like you i would have no patience
71:32 osteoporosis well same same situation
71:35 your bones are porous
71:37 just like your teeth here comes the
71:38 metal dust starts filling all those
71:40 little holes
71:41 and then your bones start getting out of
71:43 the way thus your bone density goes down
71:46 just don't put toxins in your body and
71:49 watch what happens to
71:51 the true you but now the one that is
71:54 sort of the hidden killer
71:56 and you all know about this but we don't
71:59 liken this to cancer
72:03 which is stress stress is
72:07 just not worth it i mean whatever's
72:09 stressing you
72:10 the way i say it and it sounds a little
72:12 absurd until you have a little bit of
72:14 success with this theory
72:16 is stop worrying about things so much
72:19 that you get stressed now if you're
72:23 unemployed and you're sitting around
72:25 smoking dope and
72:26 playing video games yeah there should be
72:28 something in you hopefully an
72:30 inspirational
72:30 feeling that hey maybe i should not just
72:33 take this so easily because i'm losing
72:35 time and time is something you don't get
72:36 back you don't get back your youth
72:38 so get out there and get something done
72:40 but do it as an inspirational thing and
72:42 hopefully not as a stressful thing
72:45 but the way i like to describe this and
72:47 this is
72:48 purely metaphor for your brain is that
72:51 imagine that the insides of your body
72:52 don't really know what's going on
72:54 consciously on the outside of your body
72:55 but you're stressing
72:57 stressing feels like death doesn't it
73:01 it's little shocks of death which is why
73:04 you can't afford to have that emotion
73:06 you got to find a different way to
73:07 inspire yourself to respond to whatever
73:10 is stressful
73:12 easier said than done i realize but this
73:15 is your happiness and yes there are
73:19 situations which are almost
73:20 impossible to shake but if you had to
73:24 deal with a little bit of stress let's
73:25 keep let's keep the little stuff out of
73:28 the way
73:29 and let the big stuff be the only thing
73:31 we actually are concerned about
73:33 and that'll at least reduce probably 80
73:35 percent of the things that you're
73:36 feeling that make you feel stressful
73:38 now i know some of you are wired to be a
73:40 little stressed it just happens
73:43 i think that you're only wired to what
73:45 you practice the most
73:47 and so trying to fight that will
73:51 return back some peace to your soul
73:55 now let's talk about helping people who
73:56 have cancer and let's just say
73:59 you're like me you either use this
74:02 technique to cure your own
74:03 instance of cancer or you help a friend
74:06 and they get out of their instance of
74:08 cancer
74:09 so you see it work you're like oh my god
74:12 this is crazy
74:13 again this is none of my none of my
74:15 invention i just harvested this
74:18 from good places there's a catch-22 to
74:21 this whole thing
74:23 with the minds of folks that are
74:24 suffering from cancer
74:27 now the one i've already talked about
74:29 it's probably the most deadly
74:31 psychological enemy of curing this stuff
74:35 in a particular instance of course is
74:39 the overwhelming trust for the medical
74:40 community in this particular area
74:43 again there's financial incentives
74:46 at least in america for prescribing
74:49 chemotherapy treatment the doctor gets a
74:50 kickback
74:51 meaning a summer home a bentley
74:54 kids going to harvard versus community
74:56 college
74:57 there's a huge incentive for them to
75:00 recommend this deadly
75:02 technique of potentially curing your
75:04 cancer
75:06 so keep that in mind you're an atm
75:10 above the doctors is a corporation
75:13 that absolutely is ruthless when it
75:16 comes to your savings
75:18 they want to milk the insurance
75:19 companies until the insurance companies
75:21 won't pay
75:22 and then they go after your personal
75:24 savings and all your assets
75:27 it's vicious when i worked in the
75:29 pharmaceutical industry at a
75:31 very high clearance level they i never
75:35 met a pharmacist
75:36 or a say chemist that cared the
75:39 slightest
75:40 about humanity i know they're out there
75:44 there's probably some my family that are
75:45 past now that did care but
75:48 it's all business man it's all a
75:50 business
75:52 but the most disturbing strange thing
75:54 you're going to run into
75:57 is depending on how much a person's been
75:59 suffering from this particular ailment
76:01 and
76:01 depending on how they've reached out to
76:03 social media to gain a
76:05 collection of friends that will support
76:06 them
76:08 i've run into this at least twice and
76:10 it's heartbreaking
76:12 the individuals have grown so addicted
76:14 to the attention that they're getting
76:16 from having cancer
76:18 that contrary to logic they don't want
76:22 to get cured anymore
76:24 and what's strange is they don't really
76:25 process their fatality
76:27 as a consequence of this addiction
76:30 they just simply want to keep in the
76:32 attention span because they've never had
76:34 so much attention and so much love
76:36 than when they told the world they had
76:37 cancer if they come up cured
76:40 then it's like okay whatever and people
76:42 go off to something else
76:43 they don't want to lose that attention
76:46 it is a very bizarre
76:50 mental problem with individuals who are
76:52 sick of anything
76:54 you know we all think that if we can get
76:55 in these people's faces that we could
76:56 talk them into
76:59 better eventualities we could say okay
77:02 you're getting a lot of attention from
77:03 this
77:04 from this illness and that's awesome
77:06 people love you you feel it
77:08 but now the goal is to be with these
77:10 people for as long as you possibly can
77:13 so let's get you cured so you can go
77:15 have experiences with them
77:16 at the beach or whatever your favorite
77:19 pastime
77:22 there's no solution to that that's easy
77:25 you're going to have to know this
77:26 individual intimately they're going to
77:27 have to trust you
77:29 in order to get them over that hump
77:32 and it's almost as bad as trying to
77:34 convince someone to
77:35 second-guess an oncology department to
77:38 second-guess
77:39 their solutions because folks will be
77:41 folks
77:43 it's it's a strange thing you know when
77:45 you get really regimented in various
77:47 sciences
77:48 you'll start to understand that most
77:51 areas of science have
77:53 tons of dead ends things where they
77:55 really don't know
77:56 why a particular thing is occurring but
77:58 they don't want to admit it
78:00 because it would impact that industry
78:01 physics is riddled with it
78:04 cosmology is riddled with it there's all
78:06 these
78:07 dead ends with physics and how planets
78:10 and universes put together and all this
78:12 other stuff but they don't admit it
78:14 it's a hubris well with that particular
78:17 thing okay whether or not you believe in
78:19 the big bang or not it's up to you
78:21 when it comes to your health and staying
78:22 alive well every single atom
78:26 of what you're believing is very very
78:29 important
78:31 if you do some deep dives into the
78:32 medical industry and i did mine through
78:34 bruce lipton
78:36 you'll find out that the medical
78:37 industry is teaching incorrect science
78:41 which is what he discovered he got
78:43 thrown out of his medical
78:46 school after i believe graduating around
78:48 25 from med school
78:50 he had to go to guam so he could one
78:52 treat patients
78:54 according to what he discovered in the
78:55 laboratory because he was taking his
78:57 book smarts taken to a laboratory
78:59 finding out which
79:00 which theories actually worked and which
79:02 ones were just hogwash
79:05 so he moves to guam he teaches there and
79:09 then he
79:10 also helps patients in ways that they
79:12 wouldn't allow it
79:13 in the western world where corporations
79:15 are controlling
79:16 what you have access to but once you do
79:19 those deep dives then you start looking
79:20 at doctors a little different
79:22 and i have to tell you that i have known
79:24 folks that have passed away
79:26 way too soon because they they did half
79:29 of the equation
79:30 but not the other half which is that
79:32 they grew very skeptical of doctors
79:35 but they didn't go off and find any
79:37 alternatives to solve the problems that
79:38 they were dealing with
79:41 and there are areas of medicine that are
79:43 iron clad
79:45 you know eat too much sugar you'll
79:47 become a diabetic
79:49 become a diabetic and you continue
79:50 eating sugar then you start losing your
79:53 limbs you start losing your toes and
79:55 you start being numb in your feet you'll
79:57 start crashing really hard maybe while
79:59 driving your car and you'll die that way
80:02 so there's some areas that are wonderful
80:04 and there are
80:05 brilliant doctors out there the most
80:07 brilliant doctors i've ever found are
80:09 the doctors that pioneer
80:11 surgery those are the most brilliant
80:13 doctors on planet earth
80:14 and just my personal estimation they not
80:17 only understand the human body
80:19 better than most folks with their area
80:21 of specialty a specialty
80:23 whether it be a brain surgeon or a liver
80:25 specialist
80:26 but they're the ones that are designing
80:28 equipment to get in there and
80:30 solve problems a great series
80:33 on cinemax is called the nick and it's
80:36 dramatizing the first doctors in the
80:38 late 1800s early 1900s
80:41 who were these individuals that did
80:43 create
80:44 equipment that'll help them for instance
80:47 take a bowel
80:48 or an artery and cut it and then
80:50 reattach it
80:52 and there's special instruments that
80:53 they created they were trying to perfect
80:55 cesarean birth it's interesting cancer
81:00 is a man-made
81:02 problem 100 if
81:05 man were getting the level of cancer say
81:08 naturally by eating healthy foods then
81:11 man would have been extinct a long time
81:13 ago
81:15 it's only as we have modernized food
81:17 modernized and flying quotes
81:19 that we started introducing death at a
81:23 whole new
81:23 level the 19th century slash the 20th
81:26 century
81:28 was pretty much the kickoff of the game
81:31 of killing off the population
81:33 using all kinds of different techniques
81:35 and some of it's
81:36 accidental and some of it's intentional
81:41 if you're worried about you know being
81:45 being pressured into medical procedures
81:48 such as perhaps faction
81:49 vaccination regimens your best bet
81:52 is to eat healthy never get sick in the
81:55 first
81:56 place such that you would ever be in
81:58 front of a doctor that's saying
81:59 you need this vaccine you need this shot
82:02 to cure your system
82:05 so there's a million reasons why you
82:07 need to invest in yourself i know that
82:10 children
82:11 if you have kids even grandkids
82:15 the biggest trouble is is that they are
82:17 brainwashed by all their friends
82:19 by commercials on tv that if they don't
82:21 have this
82:22 certain regiment of food being usually
82:24 processed food
82:25 candy all that stuff then you're a mean
82:28 parent
82:30 my neighbors across the street
82:33 they have a big family and a big irish
82:36 family and when she raised her kids
82:39 she repeated this but she and i know her
82:41 cousin as well
82:42 they told me that when they were young
82:46 sugar was almost non-existent in the
82:49 house
82:49 soda was not allowed all kinds of this
82:52 processed horrible food was not allowed
82:54 because their father
82:55 was just he was hip to the game a long
82:58 time ago
82:59 like 30 40 years ago actually sorry i
83:02 would say
83:02 50 50 years ago so now today
83:06 they're very healthy but they also raise
83:09 their kids
83:10 with the same exact regimen because they
83:13 watch themselves
83:14 navigate around a bunch of problems that
83:16 their friends
83:18 ran head on into the toughest thing with
83:21 changing your eating habits is to
83:22 recondition your brain not to be
83:24 addicted
83:25 to the triggers you eat some salt then
83:27 you want some sugar
83:28 now your body needs salt sugar and fat
83:31 it does
83:32 but you can get to a point where you
83:34 listen to your body and you'll feel it
83:37 i have probably about once every
83:41 six months somewhere in that region six
83:44 months or shorter
83:45 but not not more than maybe three months
83:48 i'll have a day where my body i get up
83:50 and i'm really really hungry
83:52 and everything savory sounds horrible to
83:55 me everything's salty
83:57 and i just had this happen to me
83:59 saturday as a matter of fact i haven't
84:01 had this app for probably
84:02 a year to be honest and
84:05 i will just go out and eat
84:09 i went and got some ice cream a pretty
84:11 big dose
84:12 and i would never ever do that normally
84:15 but for the rest of that day
84:17 i had a really sensible meal at night
84:19 that was savory and
84:20 kind of meat based and it's just
84:23 something that
84:25 kind of balances me out i don't know i
84:27 think i got to a point where i was just
84:28 being so anti-sugar that my system
84:32 finally said yeah we need some energy
84:34 on that pure level let's go that could
84:36 be a bad
84:37 thing for me to do that but again it's
84:39 only about once every
84:41 maybe once every six months or so but
84:44 try
84:44 you know there's some things you can
84:46 cold turkey real easily and there's
84:48 other things that if it's something that
84:49 you know that you
84:50 are very very used to just be sensible
84:52 with yourself
84:54 just slow it down slowly over time
84:57 something that's unrelated but important
84:59 to know
85:01 as an example of moderating out of a bad
85:04 regiment
85:06 is alcohol
85:09 one of my married in family members
85:12 passed away at 53 years old
85:15 and she had been apparently an alcoholic
85:17 since her late 20s she had lost her
85:18 father and her
85:19 brother like in a year and that just
85:22 wracked her brain
85:23 so she was dealing with life's normal
85:28 stresses but she took the alcohol
85:31 should shouldn't have done it she seemed
85:32 to have that gene where
85:34 you know the hangover never happens sort
85:36 of thing
85:38 and so she was an alcoholic until about
85:41 the age of 51.
85:43 everyone knew it it was destroying the
85:45 family she went through all kinds of
85:47 weird
85:48 mental anguish and stuff she was a sweet
85:51 woman
85:53 her husband i don't know how they did
85:55 this but around 52
85:58 he said look she's finally got tired of
86:00 it she was
86:01 starting to see the train crash that was
86:03 her life which was good
86:05 nice early age to get that figured out
86:07 but she cold turkeyed
86:09 out of alcohol her husband was a great
86:12 chef so he was fixing her just
86:14 all beautiful meals i don't know if they
86:17 were organic
86:18 but it was around the time that this was
86:19 transitioning
86:21 late 90s she lost a tremendous amount of
86:25 weight
86:25 she was only about 5-1 but i mean this
86:28 woman probably lost 60 pounds
86:30 plus at 5-1 she looked great she was
86:33 happy
86:35 she had a recent granddaughter born so
86:37 she was
86:38 very excited to be a part of her life
86:41 problem she hadn't had thick blood in
86:44 her body
86:46 for 30 years roughly
86:49 25 years so what happens when you
86:52 stop drinking alcohol every single day
86:54 and this woman would wake up with a
86:55 screwdriver for breakfast okay
86:58 her arteries were so thin and her body
87:01 was so used to them
87:05 she had catastrophic organ failure
87:08 as a result of doing this cold turkey
87:09 technique and i've since
87:11 talked to professionals and they said oh
87:13 yeah it's a real thing
87:14 but how do you tell someone you've been
87:16 an alcoholic for 30 years
87:19 now if you want to get out of it you
87:20 need to probably spend the next
87:22 five to 10 years slowing down your
87:25 intake you've got to continue drinking
87:27 this stuff
87:28 to slow down to give your body a chance
87:30 to stretch again
87:31 inside it's still a risky situation
87:36 now for those who want to hang onto your
87:37 alcoholism i understand that might be a
87:40 some sort of boon you're like look i
87:42 must drink chances are you're a pretty
87:44 interesting person
87:46 you have much more to contribute to
87:48 society so or your loved one does
87:51 but this is an episode again i've done
87:53 this now i think this will be the fourth
87:54 time
87:56 part of it's the arrangement of the con
87:59 content so you get the stuff you need
88:00 right away
88:01 part of its things update i don't think
88:04 anything is tremendously updated since
88:06 the last one i just think the
88:07 the organization of the last 340 376
88:10 episode i was not happy with it when i
88:13 went back and listened to it about a
88:14 year
88:14 year ago so sorry it took so long to get
88:17 this reupdated
88:20 but anyway let me know what you think in
88:22 the comments
88:24 again i've had nothing but success with
88:26 this b17c thing
88:29 i'm not a doctor so you should probably
88:31 reach out to folks that
88:33 believe in this technique and have had
88:35 great success that are part of a medical
88:37 industry
88:37 they exist in los angeles but they
88:40 definitely exist south of the border in
88:41 america
88:42 gershwin technique is gigantic down
88:45 south
88:46 i will tell you that one of the real
88:48 life stories
88:50 with the gershom technique that i've
88:51 heard of
88:53 was that one of the facebook founders
88:56 right after he they went public he
88:59 became a billionaire
89:00 very quickly a friend of mine was
89:03 a uh he was one of her clients
89:08 his daughter at the age of i think 27
89:12 came down with colon cancer i believe
89:15 that's what it was
89:17 he picked her up flew her to mexico
89:20 they put her in a gershwin clinic six
89:22 months later she came back
89:24 fully restored full remission
89:27 now again she could come back to this
89:29 world sit right next to a cell tower
89:31 uh eat a bunch of toxic food and get
89:33 right back in that situation
89:35 and you could go back down and get it
89:37 taken care of again
89:39 obviously the way to live life is to
89:43 live life simple and and not get
89:46 this stuff in the first place and one
89:48 little story i forgot to tell
89:50 that's just kind of a fun little
89:51 anecdote when it comes to
89:53 what we eat today versus what we used to
89:55 eat in the past
89:57 being raised in the midwest one of the
90:00 things they used to read us when we were
90:01 kids are little prairie
90:02 books stories of the settlers and how
90:05 they
90:06 lived how their day-to-day regiment and
90:08 these were meticulous
90:11 stories of a daily regimen of a
90:14 average midwest family and i remember
90:19 hearing this story about um
90:22 a father who had a number of kids
90:27 and there was a birthday coming up for
90:28 one of his kids
90:31 it was a daughter and so he would ride
90:34 into town
90:35 to get just enough sugar to make a cake
90:39 because they already had wheat and stuff
90:40 back at the flower back at the house you
90:42 know
90:42 but he'd bring back just enough sugar to
90:45 make a cake and this cake
90:46 was described as being about a six inch
90:48 in diameter cake
90:49 probably two layers maybe three or four
90:52 inches tall
90:53 for the whole family and you would get
90:55 like a slice of cake
90:56 maybe the birthday kid would get two or
90:58 something that's how rare sugar was
91:01 for the settlers of america as they were
91:03 putting this place together
91:05 and now the amount that he got would be
91:08 what an average child would probably
91:10 consume in a day
91:12 in modern society so what a whole family
91:16 would ingest a kid would adjust in a day
91:19 i know guys in their 50s who are still
91:22 buying bags of candy from drugstores and
91:24 just sitting there and pounding half the
91:25 bag
91:26 wondering why their teeth are falling
91:27 out and while they're got lump pains in
91:30 their chest and stuff right in their
91:31 guts
91:33 if you don't mind that kind of lifestyle
91:35 and you don't mind punching out early
91:36 well
91:37 and then you got your regimen figured
91:38 out anyway
91:40 if you haven't been to
91:41 deepthoughtsradio.com that's where you
91:43 can find a bunch of different subjects
91:45 than this one this is the only one i put
91:47 out that's really
91:48 aimed directly at your health but there
91:50 are gmo episodes
91:52 codex alimentarius learn about the world
91:54 trade organization
91:55 it will shock you you'll be furious when
91:58 you hear about the wto and the fact that
92:00 we are
92:01 as americans illegally entered into that
92:03 agreement via a
92:04 treaty that wasn't ratified by anybody
92:08 the idea that they replace our food
92:09 supplies and don't tell us
92:11 is reprehensible i don't think anyone
92:14 argues that
92:14 everything natural is good for you
92:18 most pharmaceutical products if not all
92:20 of them are
92:21 generated out of synthesizing meaning
92:23 destroying natural herbs
92:26 that automatically heal you in two
92:27 seconds but are unpatentable because
92:28 they grow out of the ground
92:31 pharmaceutical companies like the one i
92:32 work for bought up all
92:34 of a particular crop in the world
92:38 and and then forced the governments paid
92:40 them off
92:42 hundreds of millions of dollars not to
92:43 allow anyone else to grow it
92:45 under a penalty then they take that
92:48 god-given natural thing that you could
92:49 ingest
92:50 that will cure you cure you whatever
92:52 you're dealing with hair loss
92:55 ed all this other stuff
92:58 and they break it down and break it thus
93:01 causing
93:02 adverse reactions thus killing off
93:04 people in clinical studies
93:06 and believe me they don't care the
93:08 biggest joke in the place i worked was
93:09 let's create a cure and everybody would
93:11 laugh
93:13 awful these are the people that you
93:15 trust if you don't trust mcdonald's with
93:17 your health
93:18 then you shouldn't trust any corporation
93:20 anywhere with your health
93:22 you are in charge of you never forget
93:24 that
93:25 there's legislation at the international
93:27 level that prevents anyone from putting
93:29 something in your body
93:30 without your permission signed
93:32 permission united states we also have
93:34 roe versus way which is you have the
93:35 right
93:36 to choose how you handle your body it's
93:39 used for other specific things
93:41 but it's not about what people think
93:43 it's about it's about the right to your
93:44 body
