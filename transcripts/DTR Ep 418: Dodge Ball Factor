00:28 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:30 deep thoughts another evening episode as
00:34 I continually crank out the season 5
00:38 intro my computer's been rendering for
00:41 like two days now it'll be worth it
00:47 hopefully today I want to bring up a
00:50 subject that's been on my list for a
00:51 really long time on my list all it said
00:55 was dodgeball and I think I'm gonna call
00:59 it the dodgeball factor and it's pretty
01:04 simple the notion is for any of you
01:08 probably 40 and up you grew up with this
01:12 game that was either totally dreaded or
01:16 totally sought after dodgeball it's
01:21 taught in physical education PE and I
01:25 can't remember the first time I ever
01:26 played it but there used to be fairly
01:30 big gymnasiums I remember playing it in
01:32 junior high when I got back to Kansas
01:34 from Massachusetts and we had just a big
01:36 gym you know and so you had quite a bit
01:40 of space to throw this ball meaning
01:45 someone had to hurl this thing like a
01:47 good 15 if you were 15 feet if you were
01:51 on the line unless someone's all else is
01:52 on the line but you know you could throw
01:55 it 30 feet easy okay so by the time it
01:58 hits you if for those of you I should
02:00 explain in case anyone hasn't played
02:02 this game in their entire lifetime
02:03 there's a whole movie about it that's a
02:05 this comedy with Ben Stiller bunch
02:08 people on one side of the of the gym
02:11 there's no net there's no nothing
02:13 there's just that Center painted line
02:14 and a bunch of people on the other side
02:15 equal teams you get these red balls
02:18 usually it's the softer red kind and
02:21 that little fake texture on them you
02:22 know and you pick them up and you throw
02:25 them and if you can hit the other person
02:26 without them catching the ball you can
02:29 just tick their arm hit him really hard
02:31 whatever they're out and then it just
02:34 goes that's like paintball except it
02:36 throwing these balls
02:37 now when I got to high school the gym
02:42 shrunk I mean it must have been without
02:45 exaggeration half of the size of the one
02:48 at junior high and it had they allowed
02:53 volleyballs in this thing and now the
02:56 kids are a lot bigger a lot bigger and
02:59 you know I don't know where you went to
03:01 school I assume you always have some
03:03 giant human beings to participate in
03:06 these games we had farm boys and I was
03:09 not a farm boy even though my gene pool
03:11 comes from that these kids eat all raw
03:14 organic food raw milk and they get
03:17 gigantic you know six feet at sixth
03:20 grade is pretty common but these I mean
03:24 they can bale hay you know they're on a
03:27 tractor they got these big hooks like
03:30 the ones in Red Hook Brooklyn right you
03:32 can just grab these bales of hay and
03:34 hang them up 75 pounds of pop plus
03:36 you're moving and you do like hundreds
03:37 of these things in one day
03:39 these guys are ripped beyond your
03:41 wildest dream it's like a bunch of
03:42 Heymann everywhere I do that are some
03:45 big giant six-foot-five you know olfi
03:48 looking guy that will you know he's like
03:51 um like a six foot five [ __ ] out of
03:55 Blazing Saddles right just could tear
03:57 you in half and just not even realize he
03:59 did it and so I remember it went from
04:04 fun to like oh my god this is [ __ ]
04:06 crazy what are we doing here
04:08 this isn't fair I'm a sophomore and
04:12 these kids are seniors because the the
04:14 PE was like across three different
04:15 grades
04:16 I got Golden Glove boxers on the other
04:19 side and they always loved to put the
04:21 little kids on one side and all the
04:22 seniors on another side you know they
04:24 pick teams really funny rate and when
04:28 you're kid you think this is some
04:29 draconian punishment for existence it's
04:32 like enforcing class structure if you
04:35 will based on physique and age and that
04:37 sort of thing you may end up bigger than
04:39 the kids on the other side in three
04:40 years but right now you're maybe five
04:43 foot one two you know you're getting
04:45 there it just depends on now when they
04:49 throw in ninth grade into high school
04:51 I think that's insane insane you can put
04:55 six in middle middle school six seven
04:57 eight nine ten eleven twelve
04:59 there's just body differences between
05:01 these two let me just think about it you
05:04 put your daughter in there she's in
05:05 ninth grade and she starts dating a
05:07 senior I mean it's like she ain't fully
05:10 grown and he is right potentially what
05:13 this episode is gonna be about is the I
05:16 think you know no one ever explained to
05:18 me why this game exists and when you
05:22 have a PE teacher who's fairly
05:24 physically apt I mean I had an Olympic
05:29 tug-of-war competitor I guess who went
05:33 to the Olympics I think that's the case
05:35 for my junior high PE teacher very
05:38 handsome dude just you know just
05:40 straight out of sone GQ magazine he's
05:44 ripped it wasn't a big guy but you know
05:46 he he was kind of young now look back I
05:49 can see his immaturity at the time he
05:53 ended up getting throat cancer from Chu
05:55 unfortunately but I think he pulled
05:57 through it in the high school I had this
06:02 this short stocky almost almost like a
06:10 figment of a human beings body and he is
06:13 one of the sweetest guys on planet Earth
06:15 my cousin went before me he was a
06:18 complete dick but in it has no physical
06:21 capabilities whatsoever so when I got
06:24 there he was a little confused he's like
06:26 oh you're from the same family I'm like
06:27 yeah ok but here's what's cool about the
06:33 little town thing right the little town
06:34 thing is that we hang on to traditions
06:36 way way longer than the cities do and I
06:39 don't mean City traditions are just mean
06:41 educational traditions and kind of way
06:43 of raising your boys to be boys and your
06:45 girls to be girls what a [ __ ] sin
06:47 that is right but part of it was to get
06:50 your ass to man up that's what I really
06:53 think this class was all about this
06:55 little just a little gain is it fair no
07:01 is it fun mm-hmm it's eventually fun if
07:05 you man up and get in there and start
07:06 catching the damn ball
07:08 and once you catch someone's throw it's
07:11 phenomenal you feel amazing and you
07:14 start to have a different perception of
07:15 yourself which is extremely important
07:19 which is why I think the game was
07:20 invented or at least pushed into the
07:23 educational system now yeah when you get
07:26 hit by a farm boy with the [ __ ] tight
07:29 volleyball yeah it's gonna leave a mark
07:33 you know but guess what for anyone over
07:37 40 I mean this is just me aiming at a
07:41 almost assured thing now some of you
07:45 have escaped reality but life has kicked
07:49 your ass at least once if not twice if
07:51 not a dozen times right and it doesn't
07:54 care who you are it has no consciousness
07:55 really and people if you're not
07:59 competitive will kick your ass you know
08:01 I don't mean physically maybe if you
08:04 just keep traveling in the wrong circles
08:05 and you don't know how to safeguard
08:08 yourself but we're really not exactly
08:09 talking about a physical thing I don't
08:12 think most adults get into fights in
08:15 their lifetime you do all that stuff in
08:16 junior high high school maybe some
08:18 college and maybe a couple little scraps
08:20 here and there but you're done I mean
08:22 you know how to stay away from trouble a
08:24 diffuse life those that are constantly
08:26 getting in brawls well they're not
08:28 managing their life properly unless
08:30 they're in war or in some super bad
08:34 country where this stuff is happening
08:36 constantly there's countries out there
08:38 like Brazil which are going nuts okay
08:43 we're not talking about that now what I
08:47 don't know is I know that in junior high
08:50 we had co-ed PE meaning we had boys and
08:54 girls in the same class I can't remember
08:59 if my memory serves me right I think we
09:02 did have at least one dodgeball game
09:05 with boys and girls because the the the
09:09 gym was so gigantic you know you simply
09:11 the girls just needed to stay in the
09:12 back and then if they got hit it
09:15 it's just a little bump you no big deal
09:17 but some girls you know we got we got
09:19 Tom Tom boys man farm girls will knock
09:23 you out one punch
09:24 and that's not even a joke and so you
09:26 had some women in we're like perfectly
09:28 feminine gonna have babies gonna get
09:30 married to men but they'll own you you
09:34 know but it's one of these things you
09:37 know people people will do things in
09:44 their lives that are extraordinary such
09:46 that when they come back to their normal
09:48 lives they feel absolutely empowered to
09:50 do anything examples people skydive
09:53 people walk on coals people swim with
10:00 sharks you know I mean just things that
10:02 they have had an anxiety about for their
10:04 entire life it doesn't have to be
10:06 anything that miraculous as long as
10:08 you've had an anxiety about it and you
10:10 did it and you survived you'll have this
10:12 amazing gift that keeps giving it's like
10:14 a college degree that never goes away or
10:16 an accomplishment that never goes away
10:17 you know you're that powerful and power
10:22 comes from two different sides of your
10:25 existence I had a fantastic I think it
10:30 was my sociology teacher mr. Carl great
10:35 man he once said he would just say these
10:40 things in the middle of class that was
10:41 just phenomenal other weird things do
10:43 sometimes but he was just speaking the
10:45 truth man but he told us once he goes if
10:49 I had to bet on a fight between two
10:52 people two guys and he goes there was an
10:54 18 year old who was 6 foot 4 could
10:57 benchpress 300 pounds and and maybe had
11:01 been in a couple scraps in his lifetime
11:02 and a 45 year old guy who had been to
11:08 war back and it was 5 foot 10 or 5 foot
11:12 8 you guys I'd bet on the 45 year old
11:15 guy all day long and we're looking you
11:18 know to a young guy I was like 15 16
11:21 years old here in this and I'm going
11:22 that doesn't make any sense I've seen
11:24 Rocky 4 or whatever it is right and
11:28 he said look it's the confidence in the
11:30 human being that gives them all the
11:32 comprehension and perception to be able
11:36 to to battle to go in not with one
11:42 technique but every technique to go in
11:44 not in some fight or flight thing and
11:48 even if a kid comes out whaling that
11:51 means he's fully committed to this one
11:53 dimensional linear whaling on you and
11:56 you can just step aside and start
11:58 looking for weak spots start looking for
12:00 chins and you know rib cages and all
12:03 kinds of good stuff right and if you
12:04 kick boxing you can kick out his tires
12:06 whatever right and that stuck with me my
12:10 entire life just a little weird
12:12 statement I mean so many things Carl
12:13 said was crazy he's the guy that told me
12:15 you know no one should move more than
12:18 200 miles away from their hometown
12:21 didn't really explain it if he did I
12:23 missed it I was not capable of
12:26 understanding because I definitely pay
12:27 attention to the dude I used to draw his
12:28 face all the time in the yearbook I've
12:31 got it there's someone took a photograph
12:33 of him sitting at his desk leaning back
12:35 in the photograph well I drew a
12:37 photograph of his face drew his face and
12:40 that was on the wall behind him was
12:41 pretty cool so my yearbook anyway what
12:44 do you meant by the 200 mile thing was
12:46 that you move away from all your family
12:48 and if you start having kids he's gonna
12:50 watch your kids and it's gonna cost a
12:51 lot of money to to travel to your family
12:54 and as soon as you get to a 300 mile
12:57 mark you're talking about six hours of
12:59 driving now just to get home or gonna
13:03 take a flight if you get to a foul I
13:04 lived 1,800 miles away from my home and
13:07 as soon as I started feeling that
13:09 distance from people I loved you know it
13:13 was fun to visit back and you think
13:14 everyone was gonna stay alive but then
13:16 eventually people start dying you're
13:17 like holy [ __ ] I only saw them once a
13:20 year another dead I could never go back
13:23 and rekindle that as much as you make
13:26 phone calls and stuff it does help but
13:28 there's nothing like the hug nothing
13:30 like the face-to-face conversation as we
13:32 always talked about on the show right
13:34 but dodge ball which I don't even know
13:38 if it's if it's allowed to be played in
13:40 American schools anymore
13:42 I'm sure it is but I'm sure some liberal
13:45 somewhere trying to shut it down
13:47 the problem is is that like one of the
13:51 bummers of piece of trying to seek peace
13:54 in the world right everyone's like world
13:56 peace world peace a man who's enough for
13:58 world peace but as long as you have a
14:01 bunch of Neanderthals somewhere on
14:02 planet Earth
14:03 with some religion that's two three
14:05 thousand years old based on ten thousand
14:08 year old concepts of what is human
14:10 rights and somehow they have an artery
14:13 of money be it oil be it some mineral be
14:16 it something and they're able to sell
14:18 that and someone's ignorant enough to
14:20 sign it deal with them and pay them
14:22 money so if they have all this goddamn
14:23 inexhaustible money they can buy a bunch
14:25 of guns a bunch of missiles much planes
14:27 they can train people whatever but
14:29 they're still hanging on to their
14:31 outdated dogma of how to exist on this
14:34 planet unfortunately the rest of the
14:38 modern world can't just put down all
14:40 their weapons and go a piece man you
14:42 know cuz that country or those group of
14:44 people will rise up bring their full-on
14:48 war to you and you will cease to exist
14:50 and the world will go backwards just
14:52 like it did when Egypt got taken over we
14:54 had utopia on earth and then poof it's
14:56 gone well we haven't been able to
14:58 recreate Egypt and it's documented way
15:02 of life since Egypt
15:05 there hasn't been any thousand years of
15:08 Awesomeness or five thousand years of
15:10 Awesomeness even Babylonian history
15:13 pretty much dictates a really
15:16 well-balanced well-oiled functioning
15:19 peaceful society yeah they had
15:21 corruption and then every two or three
15:22 hundred years people would come down
15:25 from the hills according to their fables
15:26 and reset society and take away all the
15:30 bad people and put new people in power
15:31 boy we could use some of that magic
15:34 nowadays couldn't we but dodgeball for
15:37 me is this psychological thing where you
15:41 never want to play the game once the
15:44 well when I got to high school and
15:46 everyone play the game once I heard the
15:49 sound of a volleyball that had been
15:52 thrown at me
15:53 that missed me that hit the wall it's
15:55 like ten
15:56 behind me or more and it's blowing up I
15:59 mean it's cut by hem on the back wall
16:00 and I'm sitting there going cheese's if
16:02 I had caught that on my body 10 feet
16:04 earlier that would be me
16:07 could be my face could be you know
16:09 whatever like you feel like you can
16:11 knock your ID out of its socket right I
16:13 don't know how kids with glasses play
16:15 that game because there's no way you
16:18 could play the game if you had to have
16:19 glasses because you would just blow up
16:21 your glasses in your face I just dig all
16:23 the frame into your skin right I can't
16:26 remember what we did I don't think a lot
16:28 of us wore glasses when you're young
16:29 you'd have to have pretty chronic
16:31 chronically bad eyesight at an early age
16:33 where some kids do now the the one thing
16:38 that's interesting about dodgeball is
16:40 that in the real world you know someone
16:42 we're doing that to you just randomly
16:44 you're trying to walk down the sidewalk
16:45 and someone starts throwing [ __ ] at you
16:47 you have a lot more options that you do
16:50 in in dodgeball right dodgeball you got
16:52 rules you can't just go over and kill
16:54 the guy you can't just go over and
16:55 attack the person you can't you can't
16:57 use all of your fighting experience and
17:00 or just maybe you don't even have any
17:02 experience but you know you've seen
17:04 enough things you feel comfortable with
17:05 your body you can't do that you got to
17:08 take it and you got to get good at the
17:10 rules and that's interesting because we
17:14 don't do that in real life you know most
17:15 of time well we don't screw with other
17:19 people but I've seen some people
17:21 especially on the internet you know
17:23 there's obviously massive fighting
17:25 videos out there too in like
17:27 neighborhoods the good Denny's in the
17:30 ghetto well that's that's a fun fun
17:32 watch in there but I have seen some
17:34 amazing human beings who are getting you
17:39 know attacked by people who are drunk
17:42 people who are mentally insane people
17:44 are underage people are over you know
17:46 it's just all different configurations
17:48 where the individual being attacked
17:50 knows that this is not something that
17:53 that person would do when they were in
17:54 the right state of mind and luckily in
17:57 some cases I've even seen Joe Rogan have
18:00 a situation he was at some weird party
18:03 and not a weird party a party and
18:05 somebody was flipping off and getting
18:08 out of control I think
18:09 because they drink too much and Jose I
18:12 love Joe cuz he's just so intense you
18:16 know when he mean he's super what wise
18:18 with what he knows and he's got a
18:21 physique that like a couple friends of
18:23 mine they just don't fear physical
18:26 attacks I mean maybe a weapon because
18:28 that's the equalizer right take
18:30 everybody's life for certain but this
18:32 dude was sitting there and he was
18:33 getting out of control and somehow Joe
18:36 was in the shot it's maybe some of you
18:38 have seen this and you can look on the
18:40 face of Joe and he's like hey man you
18:44 know I think he's saying like calm down
18:45 man just relax everything's cool and you
18:48 could see it on his face it's not a
18:49 single molecule of fear on Joe's face
18:53 cuz he's in sort of a UFC MMA kind of
18:56 guy right oh he's extremely buff
19:00 something happened this dude push
19:03 somebody he just he crossed the line for
19:06 Joe Joe walks up buying this dude and I
19:09 mean in a split second had this kind of
19:11 chokehold putting him out in seconds
19:14 then Joe laid him down you know starts
19:17 doing the sort of the you know the
19:18 massage of like waking the guy back up
19:20 again and you know he's he couldn't be
19:24 in better hands than Joe Rogan's hands
19:26 the calm is asked down and make sure
19:28 that tomorrow the guy doesn't have as
19:31 many regrets as he would had even
19:33 allowed to go do whatever the hell he
19:34 was gonna do that's interesting think
19:38 about a guy like Joe Rogan I don't know
19:39 if the guy was buff when he was young
19:41 pretty sure he's Italian I assume he
19:46 could always handle his own and you
19:49 carry that into the world you carry
19:51 these lessons that you learned from
19:52 things like dodgeball into the real
19:55 world you know things are gonna be
19:58 unfair sometimes and it sucks but that's
20:01 just the way it happens now hopefully
20:03 it's not a literal translation between
20:05 you being physically brutalized and
20:07 dodgeball hopefully don't get totally
20:09 destroyed in the game when you're in
20:10 school but then you come out you engage
20:14 life and life is like you know it just
20:17 demands things of you and we we have
20:20 adopted so
20:22 demands on ourselves taxes and a bunch
20:26 of laws that are [ __ ] and you know
20:28 most laws are probably pretty damn good
20:30 but who knows we'd have to subjectively
20:33 go through all that stuff but then we
20:36 have situations that you know people get
20:39 bankrupt too easily they get homeless
20:41 too easy they don't get education too
20:45 easily I mean it's it's easy for them
20:48 not to get an education as when I'm
20:50 trying to say it's too easy for human
20:52 beings to lose everything that they own
20:54 and there's nothing more dangerous in
20:56 this world then taking away a person's
21:01 purpose to live because then you know
21:05 you know you're you're fighting your
21:07 whole life to have the things that you
21:08 want if you're not married yet and you
21:12 want to get married well you're gonna
21:13 have to keep your life totally cool
21:14 until you get that taken care if you
21:16 wanna have kids you got to keep your
21:17 life totally cool until your kids over a
21:19 certain age and there's this interesting
21:21 moment of release when you kind of have
21:26 it all behind you and then you're like
21:28 jeez I can make myself who I really am
21:31 and go for it it happened to me quite a
21:33 quite a few years ago and you start to
21:36 strategically design who you are you
21:38 start to realize for one you just became
21:40 this random human being like I always
21:42 say on episodes and so it's fascinating
21:44 to get in there and start to engineer
21:46 who you are make all the choices take
21:48 out all this crap that you bought into
21:50 and just throw it out the window and
21:52 bring it all back in there's that old
21:55 video it's a movie sorry it's a little
21:58 video on YouTube where John Wayne finds
22:01 out that the little boy doesn't know how
22:03 to swim because something I don't know I
22:07 think maybe John Wayne threw his fishing
22:09 pole into the into the lake or something
22:12 and the pond or whatever and you get
22:13 goes a man it's not fair because thing
22:16 is why won't you go out and get it and
22:17 he goes I can use well you don't know
22:20 how to swim and he's like no yeah so
22:23 John Wayne just picks this kid up and
22:25 throws him into the pond you're gonna
22:27 learn today you can't drown because I'm
22:29 here I'll save your ass if you don't
22:31 come back up and then his mother runs
22:34 out and says
22:35 you can't throw him in the pond he
22:37 doesn't know how to swim and he says
22:39 well why the hell does he know how to
22:40 swim
22:41 they look at each other every watch this
22:44 the other day look at each other I
22:45 thought he threw her in the pond too but
22:46 I think they just chased each other but
22:48 he realizes you don't know how to swim
22:50 either do you and you pass that lack of
22:53 knowledge down to your kid it's pretty
22:55 funny but that kid would learn how to
22:58 swim
22:59 but now let's slow down dodgeball for a
23:02 second I know it sounds a little strange
23:04 but let's psychologically slow down the
23:07 moment you're in school and you have no
23:10 idea this game is gonna be played today
23:12 you're gonna go to PE there's a million
23:14 things you do in PE running around the
23:15 school play touch football outside or
23:18 whatever which has its own anxiety for
23:20 some folks because there wasn't that
23:23 much touch him was it and I was touching
23:26 with ya I got knocked clean out playing
23:30 touch football once because this Golden
23:34 Glove boxer just stood in front of me
23:37 and just shouldered me down I was
23:39 returning the ball and he just shoulder
23:40 me right into the sidewalk and my head
23:42 went BAM I was out cold I literally woke
23:45 up this is so far this is Kansas it's
23:48 just the way boys were raised I woke up
23:51 next to the school on the steps and then
23:54 he continued playing I was knocked the
23:56 [ __ ] out over there next to the school
23:58 and I woke up and then there's one rule
24:00 you're not supposed to get tackled on
24:02 the sidewalk well it's touchable and
24:04 absolutely tackled it alright it's just
24:07 [ __ ] the teacher was like yeah it's
24:09 touch football because the state's a
24:10 bunch of you know [ __ ] and I know
24:13 that you guys need to learn how to
24:14 physically get beat up and moved around
24:17 and pushed around you need to know how
24:19 your body works you need to feel a guy
24:21 grabbed you and you got nothing you can
24:23 do like like um what is it Deadwood when
24:27 the the big white guy who worked for
24:30 Hearst pushes down virgins hand and I
24:34 think they they do something to him I
24:36 won't totally run it for you but he just
24:38 said no you pushed on his shoulders and
24:39 swore Jen was recalling this and he goes
24:42 it's that feeling when you've been
24:44 pushed down even you're gonna you're
24:45 being manhandled by another dude and
24:47 there's nothing you can
24:48 do everyone's got somebody you can do
24:50 that to them and that happened to him
24:54 right so you go to school
24:57 it's PE maybe even dread PE because you
25:00 know you're not that kind of kid I was
25:03 kind of in middle you know I didn't
25:05 worry about fighting as much because
25:06 I've been through a bunch of [ __ ]
25:07 before I got to high school but you know
25:11 Fighting's a little bit easier because
25:13 you could do something but in a [ __ ]
25:15 game you got to do exactly what they say
25:16 right and so they say we're gonna play
25:21 dodgeball you know switch into your
25:23 shorts or whatever [ __ ] in the gym
25:25 you're switching out everything and you
25:26 go into the the gymnasium and there is
25:31 the other team that's yet
25:33 disproportionately the bigger dudes cuz
25:35 they're gonna have some fun with this
25:36 little guys luckily I was I was fairly
25:40 tall I was about my size in high school
25:44 so that was cool anyway the door shuts
25:48 we're kind of in a pit so those of you
25:51 play World of Warcraft it's like of that
25:52 dungeon where you're like it's the high
25:54 walls and that's the only way you had to
25:56 jump down to get in this thing and all
25:57 the doors are locked and you have to
25:58 finish the boss off before you can or
26:00 the door unlocks it's exactly like that
26:02 can't go anywhere and these guys you
26:06 know they're emotionally drooling over
26:09 what they're gonna do to you because
26:11 even if they miss you every single time
26:13 or most the time or you know how to
26:14 catch the ball to get them out I'm just
26:17 gonna pick on the nerd next to you right
26:20 I believe that the ball hits someone
26:23 else and then hit you it didn't count on
26:25 a second bounce you know anything beyond
26:28 the first bounce it was just collateral
26:31 damage I thought that ever got hit in
26:34 the face on that particular game soccer
26:38 different different experience right
26:40 football but this thing shuts the game
26:43 hasn't even started yet and your anxiety
26:45 if you don't like this and you're
26:47 younger it goes through the roof you're
26:50 in massive fighter flight your right
26:52 brain is shut down your left brain is
26:54 now going tip tip tip tip tip tip to me
26:56 it's just trying to figure out how do I
26:58 survive how does this work
27:00 if you have the red balls there
27:02 so gigantic you can't really get any
27:04 good spin off of them and it's even
27:06 though you're throwing them you start
27:07 throwing like a girl who's not a tomboy
27:10 the ends the balls aren't really going
27:12 anywhere and they're so soft peddled
27:14 from being big that these guys can just
27:17 grab them two seconds in you're out boom
27:20 so you either fail intellectually
27:22 because someone grab the ball which
27:23 means you kind of take yourself down a
27:26 few notches in the physical prowess of
27:28 the world which is a young man it's not
27:31 something you want to do or you know
27:35 here comes the missiles these tight
27:39 leather balls make it these tight
27:40 leather and volleyballs me and just Wham
27:42 I don't think anyone ever does soccer
27:43 ball that's that's a different game then
27:47 you you see a person of authority like
27:52 our guy would sit in the bleachers up
27:54 above this was like a sunken pit it's
27:56 where all of our wrestling matches went
27:58 and all this other stuff so you know
27:59 you're seeing someone in the up in the
28:02 bleachers area and you're thinking to
28:06 themselves to yourself how is this being
28:08 allowed to happen great how are a bunch
28:11 of young guys being put in there just
28:13 like a [ __ ] Russian Coliseum man it's
28:16 like here comes the big gladiators and
28:18 we're just a bunch of slaves you know
28:19 who are malnutritioned and teeny-tiny
28:21 and these kids are gonna tear us to
28:24 pieces
28:24 so part of it this thing's naughty this
28:27 way you're like wouldn't you with half a
28:29 brain not let this particular thing
28:31 happen wouldn't you make the team's
28:32 distribute evenly and it's a Captain
28:36 Kirk test is what the whole thing is
28:37 life ain't fair sometimes
28:39 deal with it figure out how you're gonna
28:42 deal with it okay well one you got two
28:48 maybe three options I guess you have
28:50 three options in this game to survive be
28:54 really evasive get the hell out of the
28:56 way of the ball you could just get the
28:59 hell out of the way the entire time and
29:00 never throw the ball and the guy might
29:02 yell at you up in the bleachers but who
29:03 cares you'll be one of the last guys
29:05 that survived now eventually one team
29:07 wins and one team loses if you're the
29:10 last guy running around and there's like
29:12 20 guys on the other side
29:14 like we had about 10 against 10 well
29:16 they're gonna have 10 balls coming at
29:18 you in two seconds and so at that point
29:20 you want to get hit as lightly as
29:21 possible if you're trying to wimp out of
29:23 the whole game no no let's let's take
29:26 each one of these techniques and apply
29:29 it back to life before we move on to the
29:30 next technique someone who's trying to
29:33 evade life constantly will take the safe
29:37 route out constantly well what does that
29:40 actually end up doing in the end well
29:43 there's a positive and there's a
29:44 negative to that I know a lot of people
29:46 that want the safe route out and in
29:48 [ __ ] themselves that what they did
29:50 for a living was something that they
29:51 wanted to do but it wasn't what they
29:53 wanted to do and so they lives kind of
29:57 an unhappy unfulfilled dreamless life
29:59 but the benefit is they got money in the
30:02 bank and they got retirement they got a
30:04 pension and all other good stuff so in
30:06 their elderly years they're watching
30:08 everyone else financially struggle they
30:11 own their house they own their car and
30:14 they got two or three hundred grand in
30:15 the bank they're gonna be fine even if
30:17 it lived to be a hundred years old plus
30:19 they got their Social Security and all
30:20 the other stuff coming in right all
30:22 right but did you live did you live did
30:26 you really play the game running around
30:28 evading the ball the answer is no and no
30:31 you didn't really challenge yourself god
30:33 made you put you on this planet and be
30:35 imbued you with all kinds of skill sets
30:37 and all you did was dodge the game hmm
30:44 I don't think that's why you're here
30:45 I've got a episode called why are you
30:48 here and it's all about that thing like
30:51 you were here because you were special
30:53 and you need to get your ass in gear and
30:55 find out what his special find out what
30:57 you love and make sacrifices to get it
31:00 depending on your age that strategy is
31:02 complete different go watch that episode
31:03 go to the website deep thoughts video
31:05 com search on that title why are you
31:08 here why'd you search on the word here
31:11 and you'll find it now second strategy
31:14 to win dodgeball you get really good at
31:18 catching the ball you neutralize them by
31:22 disabling them the coming at you they
31:25 think they got you dead to rights
31:27 and all you're doing is keeping your
31:29 eyes on that ball just like baseball
31:30 it's the trick of hitting the balls
31:32 never take your eye off the ball ever
31:33 and you'll hit it every single time it's
31:36 a natural thing your body does the
31:38 second you watch the ball all the way
31:40 down to the bat but then you look off
31:42 into the crowd because you want to see
31:43 we're gonna Bayreuth the thing swinging
31:45 in a Miss keep your eye on that ball and
31:48 if there's a physical chance of you
31:50 being able to hit it you're not in the
31:51 pro leagues or someone's gonna throw you
31:53 a slider or something like that you're
31:55 gonna hit it but you're watching that
31:57 ball come at you you're watching the
32:00 dude on the other side is so absolutely
32:04 excited that they have the ball you
32:07 don't cuz there's a limited amount of
32:08 balls your team couldn't have no balls
32:09 and other team has it all it could just
32:11 hoard them until one big giant volley on
32:13 your own there's their side to your side
32:15 right but you just keep your eyes focus
32:18 use your peripheral vision to catch the
32:21 ball because your peripheral vision
32:22 frame rate is two or three times your
32:25 normal frame rate looking straight ahead
32:28 here comes the ball without even
32:31 thinking about it do you catch it and
32:34 other duties not only are you not out
32:37 they're out and they're out of the game
32:39 you neutralize the player thus reducing
32:42 their numbers thus increasing your
32:44 numbers hopefully and you have a better
32:45 chance of winning hmm that's what we
32:49 call a technique right the other ones a
32:51 technique too but it's kind of a that's
32:53 kind of a [ __ ] technique to run away
32:54 from everything costly life will
32:57 eventually catch up with you it's called
32:58 death great it's called getting old okay
33:02 now how do we apply that to real life
33:07 well you neutralize problems you plan
33:12 ahead you actually plan your life you
33:15 plan who you're gonna be as a human
33:16 being that's this first thing that
33:18 nobody ever does until they're much much
33:21 older virtually every single person that
33:24 you have ever known as a celebrity a
33:28 musician an actor an artist of some sort
33:33 sports person typically sports this kind
33:36 of a thing
33:38 let's just take mega-popular sports
33:40 people LeBron James or a Michael Jordan
33:43 or Maggie Johnson or whatever they plan
33:47 who they're gonna be in the public so
33:50 first few interviews are all
33:52 serendipitous and then eventually they
33:54 realize they've got a personality that
33:56 everyone looks up to so they're gonna
33:57 make it happen but a rock and roller man
34:00 they're ready for that interview before
34:02 they even know to play guitar an actor
34:04 well what are they doing they're
34:05 pretending to be someone else they're
34:07 using someone else's words and then
34:09 dumbfounding Li think that there is
34:10 intelligent as the writers are right for
34:12 them that's that's the biggest problem
34:13 listening to actors for any political
34:15 advice or life advice but like you know
34:20 next thing you do is you plan what you
34:22 want to do you literally list your
34:24 dreams and you go after them and you
34:26 never stop you may have to do something
34:28 else to pay the bills but you keep that
34:30 dream going like a minimum amount of
34:34 time you spend on your dream is the
34:37 third of every day go see my episode on
34:40 time management if you have a problem
34:41 finding that third because it's in every
34:44 nook and cranny of everything that
34:46 you're doing all day long I mean it gets
34:49 down the point so you sit on it go the
34:51 restroom that's time for your career for
34:53 your dream you get in that car with that
34:55 big long commute well that's all time
34:57 for you to mastermind your dream it's
35:01 every nook and cranny of your life has
35:03 to be translated into your dreams so
35:05 that you have a third of the day maybe
35:07 you've got a great life or you can put
35:08 it all together maybe you can spend more
35:10 than third of your life going after your
35:12 dream but the ball in in dodgeball
35:17 coming at you that you're gonna catch
35:19 the metaphor there is these are the
35:21 obstacles that are coming at you to take
35:22 you out of the game it could be your
35:25 health it could be your IQ could be your
35:30 your social ability to get along with
35:32 other people
35:33 whatever your weakness is it's a ball
35:36 coming at you and you don't get it hit
35:38 one time you know I mean if you caught
35:41 the ball in dodgeball are you done no
35:44 you just got one guy out and whoever's
35:46 still stand on the other side's gonna
35:48 throw another ball at you and if you're
35:50 one of the last people on your team
35:51 because you're so good
35:52 and balls everyone's going to try to hit
35:55 you until you can catch the ball or this
35:57 last technique the first time you play
36:00 dodge ball and you throw it and you hit
36:02 somebody and they don't catch it half
36:07 the time it's a mistake like you threw
36:09 it at the person but they were looking
36:11 at somebody else and hit their shoulder
36:13 and they were like oh my god you know
36:14 you threw that thing at me happens in
36:16 paintball all the time right
36:17 you're focusing on someone all sudden
36:19 ting ting ting you get hit and you're
36:21 out so sometimes you're gonna be able to
36:26 be aggressive in the game and win by
36:29 serendipity total mistake happenstance
36:33 the next technique is you throw that
36:36 enough that you really kind of figure
36:38 out how to wrap your arm and your hand
36:40 around whatever ball you got access to
36:42 if it's one of those red ones you
36:44 squeeze it harder so you can get more
36:45 control over it if it's a volleyball if
36:48 you're in the insane world I grew up in
36:50 pretty much fits in your palm I mean if
36:54 you're a little little kid if you're
36:55 ninth grader it's not gonna work right
36:57 how does that translate to life this is
37:01 where it gets fun you strategically
37:05 intentionally develop techniques to go
37:08 get what the hell you want in life you
37:11 want to be a musician okay you're gonna
37:13 sing you know play the drums you gonna
37:15 play bass guitar the xylophone whatever
37:19 you're gonna do you need to get one of
37:21 those things and you need to live with
37:24 it right when I was learning guitar in
37:29 late 80s early 90s I slept with one and
37:32 I would finger that thing constantly it
37:35 was like my girlfriend is my little
37:36 blow-up doll right it's just getting to
37:38 nut and the lights are off right it's
37:39 very important I didn't want to look at
37:41 the frets I wanted to know the frets I
37:43 wanted to just have like a violinist it
37:44 doesn't have any frets they just know
37:46 where to go on the on the neck and E
37:47 string instrument Orchestra you just you
37:50 know it was upright bass first you just
37:52 know what to do always blows me away I
37:55 tried to play violin as a kid because
37:58 they forced me to and I just didn't know
38:02 what to play you know maybe if Devil
38:05 Went Down to Georgia
38:06 was on the music list I might into some
38:08 fiddling but never did but when you get
38:12 aggressive with life and usually it
38:14 really comes down to your knowledge of
38:17 something could be your physical
38:20 capabilities too maybe your golf or
38:22 maybe you're some physical person where
38:24 you have to do something
38:25 what's cool about golf is you can play
38:27 it to the day you die and you can get
38:29 holes in one's double birdies and blow
38:32 people's minds in your 60s and 70s
38:34 that's what's kind of cool about that
38:37 game not so much with all their sports
38:41 because all their sports require quite a
38:43 bit of stamina I had a relative of mine
38:47 in his 40s playing basketball he never
38:51 wanted to give up his his you know
38:55 perception of himself because he was
38:57 always fairly athletic unfortunately he
39:00 did some maneuver where we went up for a
39:01 layup came down and blew out both of his
39:05 Achilles heels
39:06 okay these tenants who ended up in a
39:11 body cast up to his chest because he was
39:15 not to move his legs while he healed up
39:17 and healed up just fine but you see this
39:21 this little thing this little thing that
39:24 was put in two school systems a long
39:26 time ago that can have a tremendously
39:29 profound effect subliminally but whether
39:31 or not you realize it or not it can
39:33 change your whole life give you the
39:35 courage to the point where you're like
39:39 yeah that thing you know I want to go
39:41 get that dream but it's gonna be really
39:42 hard as a lot of obstacles to get that
39:43 dream and somehow in your mind you think
39:46 back yeah well I I played dodgeball a
39:51 bunch of farm boys you know I got
39:53 knocked out personally playing touch
39:57 football I lived I think back to all the
40:03 things in my life that I would that I
40:05 hated when they were happening and it's
40:09 just one of those things that later on
40:10 in life you really relish that thing
40:14 like getting getting spankings when I
40:16 was a kid getting my ass whupped
40:17 even for some things I didn't do
40:20 hmm in the end it still kept me vigilant
40:24 to behave it was interesting and we had
40:26 a standard in my family you know at
40:28 least on my particular wing of the
40:30 family this is how you behave
40:32 this is how I behave in front of women
40:33 is how you behave in front anybody these
40:36 are words we say in the house by
40:38 ourselves these are words you say these
40:40 are words you don't say in public just
40:43 all those different things if you commit
40:44 to something you better live up to your
40:46 work as I don't want to hear anyone
40:48 coming back saying someone said he was
40:50 gonna be here and he didn't show up
40:51 she's gonna mow my lawn but he didn't
40:53 show up says in a moment Lonnie then he
40:55 did a crappy job on it those things
40:58 weren't allowed when I was a kid but
41:01 every decade we go back it was easier
41:03 and easier to live and so parents got to
41:08 spend more time with their kids the
41:09 schools when I'm sending you home with a
41:10 bunch of homework and so you got a
41:12 better upbringing in general more
41:14 hands-on training more hands-on examples
41:17 your parents had smarter parents and had
41:20 smarter parents and smarter parents
41:22 maybe not you know they didn't know how
41:24 to program a computer but they knew how
41:25 to live life like the movie the jerk you
41:29 got the old lesson the difference
41:30 between [ __ ] and shinola you got those
41:32 little lessons in life and they make all
41:36 the difference in the world one of the
41:39 things and I'm gonna start digressing a
41:41 little bit away from this dodgeball
41:42 thing because I think we've exhausted
41:43 that a little bit but the theme of this
41:45 is where you gain wisdom for life in
41:50 general dodgeball is a great example of
41:52 some of the more tumultuous stages in
41:56 life where life isn't fair but you've
41:57 got to go through the eye of the needle
41:58 if you want to get what you won I have
42:01 realized in the last couple of years of
42:04 my life that one of the reasons why I've
42:09 been able to respect women who aren't
42:12 you know huge problems you know I'm just
42:16 talking about because I'm a dude is
42:19 because I had I guess that goes on both
42:21 sides of the fence but it's a little
42:24 more quote unquote romantic romantic to
42:26 think about it on the heterosexual side
42:29 of things but I had you know I lived in
42:32 a town where we had
42:33 really strong women and it was one of
42:38 two ways that you would notice as a
42:40 child that someone was strong either
42:43 they were your relative and they were
42:44 they were participating in raising you
42:46 and you were a little [ __ ] and they had
42:48 to deal with you being a little honored
42:51 here and there you know you're pushing
42:52 all the envelopes that can be pushed and
42:55 they have to deal with you and the way
42:56 that they would work with you to get you
42:58 to behave you know sometimes you get to
43:01 a point where they have to whip your
43:02 butt but most the time it's just a mind
43:04 game that they're playing with you the
43:07 other thing is you have to see them be
43:09 very upstanding women you know my circle
43:12 of life and the women and my family and
43:15 the ones in my own town it was all about
43:18 they dressed nice they got their hair
43:20 done and they were they just were proper
43:24 they weren't necessarily Southern Belles
43:26 necessarily because that's taken it to a
43:28 whole another extreme I think that's
43:30 great as well but sort of between a
43:32 modern sort of maybe totally carefree
43:35 woman and a southern belle some are
43:37 directly in between where they sat a
43:40 certain way and they walked a certain
43:42 way and they spoke a certain way and
43:44 they also didn't then people push him
43:46 around so they also knew when they were
43:47 being treated unfairly and they would
43:49 represent themselves and because there
43:51 was chivalry where I grew up it would be
43:55 almost never that a man would ever be
43:59 impolite women were very polite to each
44:02 other because they knew they shared the
44:04 struggle it was interesting again eyecup
44:09 said a few times in my lifetime several
44:11 of the CEOs that I work for in companies
44:13 were females and so I got into their
44:17 world I was enjoying a paycheck because
44:19 of their hard work before I got there
44:21 and I thought that was cool it just was
44:24 it just kept going the theme of my life
44:26 just kept going and today they are
44:29 trying to dismantle our sexuality in
44:33 general they want the boys to be really
44:35 really soft and they want the girls to
44:37 be overly sensitive and sort of
44:39 aimlessly hard sometimes right you will
44:44 get the sense as you grow up depending
44:46 on what you know you
44:47 age that you will you'll say this phrase
44:49 of like they don't make them like that
44:50 anymore it's a super sad thing because
44:54 what that was wasn't a physical thing I
44:57 mean there are definitely genetics that
44:58 are disappearing out of the United
44:59 States because we melt together it's
45:01 fine it just happens that way sometimes
45:04 you'll see that one woman that looks
45:06 like she comes up a 1945 bomber or a
45:09 postcard or something like how wow
45:11 there's that she managed that family
45:13 just stayed together whatever in that
45:14 community and they look the same this is
45:16 a physical thing but we're we now have
45:20 loosened up our language to the point of
45:23 it's not just a few swear words to
45:24 emphasize something it is like I guess
45:28 you could say just like ghetto speak
45:29 without really meaning it to be in a
45:32 ghetto to sound relay to aiming at those
45:35 individuals who live in those deprived
45:37 areas of the world because it's
45:40 everywhere it's everywhere and yeah I do
45:45 think it's sad I do think it's sad
45:47 because I don't think it brings you
45:48 anything in life right for instance do
45:54 we get anything in life without
45:55 discipline answer usually no you know
46:01 like the lottery ticket maybe but who's
46:03 gonna manage their life buy a lottery
46:04 ticket I got a whole episode on that -
46:06 it's called a lottery ticket life or a
46:10 lot of real life or something like that
46:11 I feel like on an average day in the
46:16 United States of America you know the if
46:19 you were to sneak into everyone's house
46:21 like a little robot fly and just sit
46:23 there and look and watch the
46:25 conversations that are going on one I
46:27 think very few households eat dinner
46:30 together anymore
46:32 when I see it in public I think it's
46:34 phenomenal when I see a family that I
46:36 know does it it warms my heart you know
46:38 what's interesting about I got a friend
46:40 of mine whose family's really tight and
46:43 they are the utter Ark archetype of
46:47 families when I was a kid every single
46:49 family - a couple tiny exceptions were
46:52 like this you were supposed to be home
46:54 at dinnertime and didn't matter how old
46:55 you were it didn't even matter if you're
46:58 over 18 and you left the house you're
46:59 supposed
47:00 come over and eat dinner with your
47:01 parents more often than not if you're
47:05 married you bring your spouse if you
47:06 have kids you bring your kids everybody
47:07 gets together if nothing else when you
47:10 really start to separate with age you
47:12 have barbecues all the time or whatever
47:13 it's what church banquets were all about
47:15 bring some food go downstairs into the
47:19 banquet hall everyone chills out someone
47:23 brings the ambrosial salad here's a way
47:26 for me to say it to someone and if
47:28 you're my age you're in your 40s or
47:30 higher you'll probably feel this and for
47:34 any of you were younger that did feel
47:36 this as well then hats off to you I
47:39 think it would be fascinating to to get
47:44 a bunch of the kids who are lost in this
47:49 sort of orchestrated destruction of
47:52 society right bad education ZnO manners
47:55 you know it's not that they won't behave
47:58 it's just they have no one around them
47:59 that is behaving being drunk on cell
48:03 phones and Internet this and internet
48:05 that and social media there's the social
48:07 media that take take a bus full of those
48:10 kids instead of a de Lorean that goes 88
48:12 miles an hour it's a bus that goes 45
48:14 miles an hour and it travels back in the
48:16 past now I can only really vouch for
48:20 like the 70s and maybe the 80s right but
48:23 you take them back to nineteen I don't
48:25 know 78 journeys on the other radioman
48:29 our kids are everywhere food is all
48:33 organic every single bit of it is
48:36 organic we don't even have I don't think
48:38 at the time we don't have genetically
48:39 modified grapes yet someone crossed a
48:42 lemon and an orange to create grapefruit
48:45 in 1800s but that's not a true GMO that
48:49 it's just spicy two things together
48:52 right but drop them off and say look
48:55 here's the deal you've heard of exchange
48:58 students right travel from Germany to
49:00 America America to Germany million
49:02 combinations thereof well you're gonna
49:05 have a time-travelling exchange student
49:08 program only we're not going to torture
49:12 anyone from the 70s and take
49:13 into the future you're just gonna go
49:15 back and you're gonna spend a year in
49:18 the past and you know what doesn't exist
49:23 cell phones the internet video games are
49:28 in their infant el infantile stage
49:31 you're gonna go to school or they no
49:34 matter how old your you're gonna go to
49:35 school you didn't go back to college
49:36 you're gonna do something else and
49:37 you're gonna find out that in a really
49:39 short period of time you're gonna learn
49:41 a tremendous amount of information we're
49:44 gonna purposely put you in a small town
49:46 not a big town maximum population twelve
49:50 thousand pick it down here's a big bunch
49:53 of challenges you can pick from we
49:55 recommend these I put them in my little
49:58 town malls well they're kind of being
50:02 built they're not quite in the big boom
50:04 phase that's gonna be about you know
50:05 five or six years out from like 78 or so
50:09 maybe we take you back to early 1977 so
50:12 you can see Star Wars right when it
50:13 comes out mm-hmm but I think it would be
50:17 an amazingly profound moment for
50:20 everyone who got on the bus especially
50:23 young people older people it really
50:24 doesn't it doesn't make any sense
50:26 because they they know what it's like
50:27 they're just gonna have an amazing time
50:28 going back in time but maybe you
50:31 purposely take kids that were born in
50:34 the 90s and up take them back so when
50:38 it's all about wouldn't it be
50:40 interesting and you know Jumanji the one
50:43 with the rock and Jack Black and the
50:46 girl from I always forget her name from
50:51 Amy Pond from Doctor Who with Kevin art
50:55 and all that they went to this jungle
50:57 virtual reality video game and you know
51:00 the girl that was addicted to her cell
51:02 phone came back and realized her problem
51:04 and I think that was just a gift to
51:06 society that movie but imagine spending
51:09 a year in it hmm you call someone up and
51:14 they're on the phone and you get a busy
51:16 signal
51:16 there's no call waiting there's no
51:19 answering machine that technology does
51:21 not exist you call when they're not home
51:24 it just rings and rings and rings
51:27 but you know it's interesting you'll be
51:31 weaned off of it and you will lose this
51:35 insane obligation that we have built
51:37 sand cell phones exist and watch watch
51:39 for this one you'll have a blast that
51:41 this episode gives you anything it's
51:42 just one little one little thing to
51:44 observe watch people when their cell
51:48 phones ring how they will run to the
51:54 phone they will stop the conversation
51:56 with you they feel a thousand percent
52:00 obligated to answer that phone call as
52:03 if the other person and because this is
52:05 kind of what it is the other person has
52:07 the right to disturb your life 24/7 now
52:10 if you're waiting for a phone call from
52:12 someone important I'm not talking about
52:13 that but it's like you want to
52:15 manipulate someone's life call them on
52:17 the phone because they're gonna freak
52:19 out on the other side answer their phone
52:20 if they haven't learned this lesson yet
52:22 if I don't recognize a phone number it
52:24 goes right to voicemail
52:25 and because we have all these robo calls
52:27 it's it's a great way to live your life
52:29 right one of the other things that might
52:33 be interesting I'll take you to all the
52:36 restaurants in my hometown
52:38 none of them other than maybe pizza
52:41 which was awesome back in those days man
52:44 it was incredible nothing's a chain
52:46 there's four or five Mexican restaurants
52:48 none of them are chains four or five
52:50 steak houses none of them are chains the
52:52 food is phenomenal it's big it's
52:55 delicious it's good for you relatively
52:57 speaking it's not full of GMOs not full
53:00 of chemicals no one uses margarine
53:02 there's no sugar substitutes maybe
53:03 saccharine is on the table you know
53:05 because it came out in the 50s or 60s or
53:07 whatever you know better you won't use
53:10 it now here's how I'm gonna tie this
53:13 back to this episode we have adopted a
53:18 bunch of paradigms in our life today
53:21 Society does one level expect you to
53:24 adopt those paradigms hey I emailed you
53:27 ten times in ten minutes why didn't you
53:29 reply I called you 20 times in an hour
53:31 why didn't you pick up your phone I left
53:34 you a message even why why why I have
53:37 the obligation to control your life
53:39 maybe you just say
53:41 I didn't want to answer I was busy by
53:45 the way I control my own life you're
53:48 just a human being over there doesn't
53:50 mean I don't like you but there's
53:52 limitations I got my own personal space
53:55 if I want to bring you in or a
53:57 particular time I'm gonna bring you in
53:58 at the right time all those obstacles
54:01 those games teach us things that are
54:05 particularly unfair mm-hmm what's weird
54:09 about things being unfair is that maybe
54:14 because we live in a chaotic world they
54:16 are fair right I told you guys in one of
54:19 the episodes way back in season one
54:21 really early in the game I said look
54:24 people will say the life isn't fair and
54:27 you know what the truth is it is fair
54:30 and you know why because anything can
54:34 happen to anyone at any point in time
54:36 that's how we know it's fair anything
54:40 other than that would be slanted in your
54:42 favor I always land on my feet I always
54:45 have a job I always have money I always
54:46 have love always have companionship or
54:49 whatever the hell it is you want
54:50 you're always entertained would that be
54:53 a fair world no that'd be God sitting
54:56 over you just moving all the rain clouds
54:58 away from you constantly you know you
55:00 buy a lottery ticket well that's a
55:01 winning lottery ticket you drove your
55:02 car well I give you a 30 miles to the
55:04 gallon even though your car only usually
55:05 gets 26 26 or whatever right that
55:08 wouldn't be a fair world dodgeball locks
55:12 you into a ring it's a bunch of people a
55:15 after you and you know one dude who's
55:20 your teammate this particular week could
55:22 be your opponent in the next week that's
55:26 what life does to you right there's some
55:29 great dynamics in the show Frasier that
55:32 I want to leave you guys with if you
55:34 haven't seen the show Frasier it's
55:36 Kelsey Grammer is the main character I
55:39 forget the other actors real names but
55:42 he plays Frasier Crane dr. Frasier Crane
55:45 II as a psychology show on the radio and
55:47 he answers phone calls it's one of the
55:48 most masterfully written sitcoms in
55:52 history okay they're supposedly
55:53 rebooting it so
55:55 watch out for that when it happens but
55:56 go back and watch all the rest of them
55:58 on Netflix cuz it's just a gym but he
56:01 has a brother Niles and his brother
56:04 Niles is another accomplished
56:08 psychiatrist except he practices it with
56:10 patients Frasier Crane has already done
56:13 that and he is now doing his radio show
56:15 and he's famous in Seattle that's the
56:17 premise of the show well both of them
56:20 like the class structure of life they
56:24 like being in the upper tier of things
56:26 they know everything about wine in Opera
56:28 and alcohol in general in interior
56:31 design you know it's just they know
56:33 everything about everything that makes
56:34 them at this level in the 90s okay but
56:38 several episodes that they wrote were
56:41 very interesting where in most cases
56:44 that get along they're still they have
56:46 this weird sort of competitive jealousy
56:48 that they keep going throughout the
56:50 entire series which creates conflict
56:51 which creates story
56:52 it's brilliant again if you write a
56:55 story you have great characters all the
56:56 episodes and action writes itself right
57:00 but there's a there's a couple different
57:02 scenes different episodes I should say
57:05 one of them's pretty common the last
57:08 couple seasons but they both want to be
57:11 the head of this wine club and the wine
57:15 club is really really old and usually
57:18 it's only a battlefield promotion where
57:20 someone dies or usually it's only death
57:23 I think is the case and then then the
57:25 that grand position in the wine club is
57:28 up for grabs okay well they're partners
57:35 when they're not going for the same
57:37 thing the same girl the same membership
57:40 at a special spa or something like that
57:42 but the second they have to go at it
57:44 together they turn into these little
57:47 demons against each other and they start
57:48 throwing each other under the bus and
57:50 one of them will tend to think the other
57:52 one's going to favor a referral and then
57:55 they flip it all upside down so how many
57:59 of us have felt like we are reached a
58:01 peak in our life where the greatness
58:03 that we have achieved in the great
58:04 circuit and circle that we're in is
58:06 never going to end
58:07 but have
58:08 job forever the security forever the
58:10 knowledge that you have is valuable
58:12 forever it doesn't always happen does it
58:16 in fact I'm not even sure it can happen
58:18 at this point there are a few careers if
58:20 you're a doctor and you stay up on what
58:23 it is that you do you probably are
58:25 pretty secure as my relative said he was
58:29 a doctor he said look I gave up 10 years
58:30 of my childhood my whole 20s went to med
58:34 school and so I never got to be a young
58:36 guy and so they always have this
58:38 disproportional by sports cars travel
58:41 the world trying to make up for their
58:43 20s missing that's a tough one
58:46 gotta make those decisions what you want
58:49 to sacrifice to get what you want one of
58:53 the flip sides are if you're like our
58:55 famous rock star in your 20s you never
58:57 grow up at all because by the time you
58:59 hit your 30s you're still famous if you
59:02 don't play as much but you never had to
59:04 deal with contrary opinions because
59:07 everywhere you went everyone's like yes
59:08 sir oh man I get your autograph well let
59:10 me buy you a drink better and you don't
59:11 live in the real world so when you do
59:13 have to live in the real world in some
59:15 way buddy calls the Jack Daniels moment
59:18 whoo-hoo right everybody has their
59:22 version of that so I would say this one
59:26 on a technical note if someone starts
59:32 pissing on dodgeball in schools
59:34 maybe this episode will shake your brain
59:37 up and think well no there is a reason
59:38 my dodgeball exists I know it seems
59:40 brutal and all this stuff but no one's
59:42 dying playing the videogame right or
59:44 video game playing the game they're not
59:46 getting their eyes knocked out of the
59:47 sockets it's just a game but it's gonna
59:49 teach my kid and your kid what life is
59:52 sort of like before they get a chance to
59:54 enter it and never escape because you
59:58 can leave the dodgeball ring right you
60:01 can leave the gym you go back to your
60:03 world of warcraft or your cell phone
60:06 texting and all the other crap right but
60:09 if you feel like life is being unfair
60:13 perhaps it's because it is fair that
60:15 you're you're feeling the way that
60:17 you're feeling and then what are you
60:19 gonna do about it you're an adult
60:22 you know your over-30 sorry to break it
60:25 to you kids you're an adult but I don't
60:27 you accept that challenge
60:28 that's the facts Nutting up to your
60:32 obstacles and nodding up to life is
60:36 probably one of the biggest gifts you
60:37 can give yourself it doesn't mean you're
60:40 gonna know what to do don't sit in a
60:42 vacuum either ask questions ask find
60:45 people that have succeeded in life and
60:47 the area that you're trying to CC don't
60:49 worry if you hate everything else they
60:50 do all right a lot of people hate Donald
60:52 Trump all right you can hate him for a
60:54 million reasons but you know what if you
60:56 want to succeed in real estate and he's
60:58 willing to give you his time you should
60:59 sit down and shut up because this dude
61:01 understands real estate
61:04 maybe you admire more about him than
61:06 real estate whatever find your uncle
61:09 your aunt's your grandfather your father
61:11 some guy is someone else's dead Andrew
61:13 Robert Kiyosaki wrote a book called Rich
61:16 Dad Poor Dad and he got all of his
61:17 advice about how to be rich from his
61:19 buddy's dad
61:20 and that's why Roberts rich today it's
61:24 cool so it's just one of those little
61:27 episodes hope you dug it let me know
61:30 your thoughts let me know if anything
61:33 let me know where you ran into something
61:35 like this whether it be dodgeball
61:36 specifically or some other obstacle in
61:39 life that you weren't able to get around
61:41 and you had to just simply deal with it
61:43 and how it made you a stronger person
61:47 maybe even share a story about someone
61:49 in your life that was special a parents
61:52 a relative a friend somebody that
61:57 inspired you who helped maybe even a
61:58 fictional character I've had plenty of
62:00 fictional characters inspire me you know
62:03 from films to whatever stories and you
62:07 think well even though this is a
62:09 fictional story written by some author
62:10 unless it's completely outrageous like a
62:12 Marvel hero story it's probably written
62:17 based on someone's truth somewhere and
62:21 so maybe it's a one-in-a-million thing
62:23 that happened to one person now you're
62:25 getting to experience that as
62:27 entertainment but you know why not
62:29 improve yourself by looking at that and
62:32 saying well you know I can't quite get
62:33 it to that level in the first day
62:35 may never get it to that level ever but
62:38 you know sometimes goals are meant to
62:40 guide you more than you're meant to get
62:42 the goal it still makes you a better
62:43 person I've recently been hearing that
