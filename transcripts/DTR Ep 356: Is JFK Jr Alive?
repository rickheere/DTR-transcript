00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back boys and girls the deep
00:39 thoughts garage edition it's reading
00:42 outside and I'm sitting in the office
00:45 something you know yeah let's get it
00:46 they're making episode so I thought we'd
00:49 do a doozy today a good one
00:51 and I think it's fun because some of you
00:53 will have not heard of this conspiracy
00:55 and some of you will been following it a
00:59 lot I was chatting with a lot of
01:02 listeners last night and he asked me the
01:05 question he's like do you think that JFK
01:08 Jr's alive and for those of you who are
01:13 not familiar with this conspiracy as
01:16 crazy as it sounds it's fairly plausible
01:19 so in the late 90s JFK jr. the son of
01:23 John F Kennedy same you know has to have
01:27 the same name to go jr. right he's
01:29 getting pop more popular more popular
01:31 more popular he came out with a magazine
01:33 called George there's some discrepancies
01:37 on why he called it George he would
01:41 often have George Washington covers
01:43 people dressed like George Washington
01:45 actors/actresses hot models whatever
01:49 towards the end there was a notion that
01:51 he was calling it George because he knew
01:53 that George Herbert Walker Bush
01:54 participated in his father's death and
01:57 the entire thing was to laser in
01:59 eventually and uncover the fact that
02:02 that was the case now we know that
02:04 George Herbert Walker Bush was involved
02:06 with the death of JFK for a couple
02:09 reasons
02:10 one we have a picture of him on the Book
02:12 Depository steps just looking around to
02:17 at President Ford's funeral he he
02:23 usurped the the eulogy you know the last
02:30 words to talk about how we shouldn't
02:33 entertain wild conspiracy theories as it
02:37 related to JFK's death I mean talk about
02:38 an old [ __ ] with some serious paranoia
02:40 you know if this summer is a little
02:43 warmer it's because some of the bushes
02:46 are down there heating the [ __ ] joint
02:47 up
02:48 so gets towards the end of the 90s and
02:53 he's finally considering stepping into
02:57 political office and going for the the
03:01 Senate for the New York region but there
03:06 was a problem Hillary Clinton has had
03:10 this dream to be the President of the
03:13 United States and she needed to
03:14 establish herself politically and I
03:17 don't know what it is I'm going to
03:18 assume that the state of New York is one
03:20 of the easiest states to throw an
03:22 election in probably California next so
03:27 her only in her only way of buying her
03:29 [ __ ] seat is through the state of New
03:33 York but here comes JFK jr. handsome
03:37 smart and again if you hear rumors
03:41 otherwise you need to know you're
03:43 probably sucking on the extremities of
03:46 some deep state revisionist stick
03:48 history thing the people who make all
03:50 these documentaries telling you that
03:52 Mark Zuckerberg is a [ __ ] genius but
03:54 Steve Jobs was a complete [ __ ] all
03:57 right so the people who can't code like
03:59 Bill Gates can't code Mark Zuckerberg
04:02 could probably barely code very the
04:05 Einsteins right Einstein was a complete
04:08 [ __ ] idiot so he just goes on and on
04:10 and on they flip everything so the
04:12 morons are the geniuses and the geniuses
04:13 are the heretics not just because I say
04:18 it because I heard someone say well I
04:20 heard he wasn't very smart really have
04:23 you ever heard him talk and public just
04:24 go rewind all the speeches and then go
04:27 watch Whitney Houston on [ __ ] you
04:30 know Johnny Carson show or the her City
04:32 Hall show and you'll see a definite
04:35 difference in [ __ ] intelligence okay
04:37 but the Kidney family's got an
04:39 interesting thing about him right
04:41 they've had two of their own murdered
04:43 and Teddy was most likely framed I was
04:48 not a big fan of this guy so me saying
04:50 he was framed is not trying to dig the
04:52 guy out of him being a complete douche
04:54 of the deep state eventually because he
04:56 was
04:58 the rumor is that he's cheating on his
05:00 wife and this girl comes home this is
05:02 for Teddy Kennedy she's going home they
05:05 push her off into a lake and then they
05:07 call him up and say we control your ass
05:11 so the reason why he never called and
05:14 the reason why he looks like a big
05:15 [ __ ] is that it was something that
05:17 was orchestrated on him to make sure
05:20 that the last Kennedy who have murdered
05:22 again you know this lone gunman [ __ ]
05:25 is ridiculous you have Lee Harvey Oswald
05:27 logged omen and you have sirhan sirhan
05:29 lone gunman neither these dudes had
05:32 anything to do with putting a bullet in
05:34 a Kennedy Sirhan was actually there but
05:37 he was [ __ ] m'kay doubt of his mind
05:39 shooting at the ceiling as the hotel
05:41 manager in the kitchen was slamming his
05:42 hand against an aluminum table Robert
05:46 Kennedy was shot three inches from the
05:47 back of his right ear by a rent-a-cop
05:51 but all that was over by 1968 I forgot
05:56 exactly when the Ted Kennedy girlfriend
05:58 issue happened she died he was
06:02 committing adultery she can judge him
06:05 for that if you want but nearly 30 years
06:09 later 70s 80s and 90s JFK jr. is a grown
06:14 man very well integrated into the New
06:18 York lifestyle and generally the
06:21 constituents of his father and his uncle
06:23 and here comes word Hillary Clinton is
06:27 going to kill you she works for them you
06:32 don't in fact your family has
06:33 traditionally not worked for them and
06:35 you're trying to resurrect this banner
06:37 your father has of sticking it to the
06:40 deep state so in potentially the first
06:44 time in American history maybe even
06:48 world history for a long time no
06:51 executives do this every once in a while
06:53 this dude arranges a flight he's a pilot
06:58 JFK jr. was a pilot I owned a plane but
07:04 now he had a couple regiments every time
07:06 he flew one he always flew with his
07:10 teacher as
07:11 copilot - he always brought his dog when
07:16 he traveled on family vacations so their
07:20 family has this join up in Martha's
07:21 Vineyard and every time he goes there he
07:25 takes his little dog with him it's not a
07:27 little dog it's a dog dog and he takes
07:30 his wife of course and on this
07:31 particular occasion he took a
07:34 sister-in-law except this particular
07:37 flight was different one JFK had a cast
07:41 on his foot all the way up to his knee
07:45 we can't fly a plane with the cast on
07:48 your foot because you couldn't even feel
07:50 the [ __ ] thing you couldn't feel a
07:52 pedal you use pedals to turn left and
07:55 right in a plane he also didn't bring
07:59 his dog and he didn't bring his co-pilot
08:03 / teacher just all the sudden with the
08:06 cast on his foot he feels extra secure
08:09 doesn't need any extra assistance yeah
08:12 it's starting to make a lot of sense
08:14 doesn't it
08:15 meanwhile Hillary Clinton wants you
08:17 murdered because Hillary was taught in
08:19 the 80s and 90s if someone is in your
08:22 way kill them Arkin side them the true
08:27 death toll of the Clinton family I would
08:30 imagine you know matches any world
08:34 dictator who has like Saddam Hussein the
08:37 hell his guys dragged out of the room
08:39 and murdered it's sort of like that in
08:43 the modern era I mean that's just based
08:46 on a bunch of information coming out of
08:48 Arkansas recently all these people that
08:52 got in their circle got their heads
08:53 blown off
08:54 I mean horrific deaths if this was
08:57 anything normal and not a political
08:58 family there would be FBI investigations
09:02 into serial murders why is there a wire
09:06 they're a bunch of people dying in this
09:08 particular area of the world without any
09:09 cause of death I mean without any like
09:11 motive and who did it and that kind of
09:13 thing there unsolved mysteries all of
09:14 them but on July 16th 1999 JFK jr. dies
09:21 in a plane crash and official news
09:25 okay and that's pretty much it I mean
09:29 there was definitely some conspiracies
09:30 around the fact that it looked like the
09:32 plane the the first fisherman that found
09:35 the plane said that it most certainly
09:38 was exploded from the inside that the
09:40 burn marks were all on the inside of the
09:42 plane and the outside was clean as a
09:43 whistle then you see different pictures
09:46 like I've seen that plane and on a video
09:49 being dragged off dragging on to a dock
09:51 and it's all in pieces sort of and then
09:54 I see pictures later on of them dragging
09:55 somebody that looked like a male figure
09:58 out of the top of the plane there's
10:01 discrepancies with the paint job on the
10:03 side of the plane that took off which is
10:05 the one that's on the bottom of the
10:06 ocean the other thing is that when a
10:08 plane does hit the ocean it is a bit
10:10 like hitting a cement wall I mean it
10:13 tears the [ __ ] out of anything drop a
10:16 plane a drop a car out of the sky into
10:19 the ocean and when you find it it'll be
10:21 pancaked pretty good because the oceans
10:23 not going to get out of the way of the
10:24 card in real time which causes
10:27 resistance which causes energy transfers
10:31 which causes an impact I didn't see a
10:37 plane the one where they're dragging his
10:38 body out of the bottom of the ocean I
10:40 didn't see a plane look like it had
10:41 landed in the water so why on earth do
10:43 people think this dude still alive hmm
10:47 that's where it gets interesting so
10:51 fast-forward 18 years there's this dude
10:59 who keeps showing up behind Trump at
11:01 Trump rallies and he sort of changes he
11:07 calls himself Vincent fusca which I
11:10 believe means something like conquering
11:12 darkness and he looks a little odd he
11:15 looks a little strange now JFK jr. was
11:17 by all means a handsome man
11:20 he's like a handsome dude the word dudes
11:23 like my dudes good-looking man so
11:25 Vincent fusca I don't know he looks like
11:28 he's definitely in some ridiculous
11:30 disguise whoever this dude is and the
11:33 going theory is that there is a guy
11:35 named Vincent busca he lives in the
11:36 Philadelphia
11:38 he was filmed with a trump truck right
11:41 before the election was complete and he
11:43 was you know wrong for for Trump and of
11:46 course Trump won but that guy sort of
11:50 got a balding spot on his head he looks
11:52 kind of heavy in the face and it doesn't
11:54 seem to be doesn't sound like JFK jr.
11:57 but some people think that this guy
12:00 every once in a while would trade places
12:02 with JFK jr. like JFK jr. will dress up
12:05 like that guy put this fake gene Simmons
12:08 hair on put a black top hat on or you
12:12 know whatever this hat he did not top
12:14 out but I had on and then he definitely
12:16 seems like he paints a fake beard on his
12:18 face I mean this some of these beards
12:21 look ridiculously bad the original fusca
12:25 is he's fairly in shape but the other
12:28 one looks like he's really in shape
12:31 people have studied his face and some
12:33 people think that fusca is almost 80%
12:35 JFK jr. most the time under in major
12:38 disguise and they're trying to measure
12:41 teeth and the whole eyes nose mouth face
12:44 recognition they study him is the his
12:49 sort of idle positions when he's
12:51 standing against the wall and look how
12:52 he covers his hand one hand over another
12:54 which is a very JFK jr. thing to do but
12:57 I mean I think a lot of people do that
12:59 from time to time but that's not it
13:03 that's that dude is not the reason we
13:06 believe that JFK jr. is alive at all the
13:10 reason why we believe JFK jr. is alive
13:12 is because of his wife his wife appears
13:17 to be next to this dude whether that guy
13:20 be JFK jr. or the other dude to the
13:24 right of him as a woman that looks
13:29 exactly like his wife and you might say
13:31 well that's just because there's
13:33 doppelgangers everywhere people look
13:35 like people okay well I've made quite a
13:40 bit of money in my lifetime drawing
13:41 people's faces
13:42 painting people's faces and I will tell
13:47 you that pound-for-pound this woman's
13:49 the the real JFK
13:51 a spouse has an extremely unique set of
13:55 features her nose is very very unique
14:01 and I mean and out of all the faces I've
14:03 ever drawn in my lifetime I've never
14:05 drawn her nose unless I was drawing like
14:08 Bob Hope's nose it's a very sweeping
14:10 distinct nose I don't know where her
14:12 bloodlines from she kind of looks
14:16 Norwegian or Dutch to me she has a smile
14:19 that's gigantic she smiles well and she
14:24 just has a gentle bone structure to her
14:26 face in addition she's always wearing
14:30 this studded hat that's like a baseball
14:33 cap with all kinds of rhinestones on it
14:36 it's been bedazzled and one of the most
14:39 amazing things is that JFK jr. had given
14:45 his wife an Eiffel Tower ring which from
14:49 what I can tell looks like it has a
14:50 giant Ruby in it and for those of you
14:52 don't know rubies can be more expensive
14:53 than diamonds and this woman had that
14:56 ring on I wanted to comp one of the
14:59 conventions so you always have fusca
15:02 here and would either right next to him
15:04 or a couple people over you have this
15:07 woman looks just like his wife and one
15:09 of the appearances to his left you've
15:12 got a woman that looks like the absolute
15:14 hybrid of the two of them who's younger
15:16 looks like she might been or late 20s
15:19 early 30s
15:19 beautiful dress just like mom has her
15:23 own star studded hat first time I ever
15:25 saw her she kept holding the troll
15:27 button I was like literally a button you
15:29 put on your shirt but the little little
15:31 frog head dude and she keeps holding it
15:35 and she looks like she's looking off in
15:37 the distance on a monitor because her
15:39 head kept getting clipped in the shop
15:40 because Trump was further down and she
15:42 was up in the bleachers so she kept
15:44 bending down and showing it and holding
15:47 it and if any of you have looked at
15:49 these H and Fortran boards where the
15:52 after P guy is number 17 that is a
15:56 symbol that is all over the posts Plus
16:01 that little anonymous guy out there he's
16:03 always told us wait till you find
16:05 who's talking to you it's gonna be
16:06 interesting but aside from any of that
16:10 whether that's real or LARP or some sort
16:14 this dude and his wife and his wife
16:19 sister seem to be there there's also a
16:23 best friend of JFK juniors that died
16:25 within a year relatively handsome guy
16:29 very distinct looking face and the two
16:31 of them have been fusca and this guy
16:33 I've been standing right next to each
16:34 other and when you compare the guy with
16:37 these little round glasses to the best
16:39 friend
16:40 it's a spitting image of him aged up 15
16:43 17 years now the sister-in-law the
16:47 wife's sister died supposedly in this
16:49 plane crash I believe I am accurate in
16:53 saying that her son the sister's son has
17:00 been viewed at one of the conventions
17:03 well why would that be there you know
17:05 this whole family's staunch Democrats
17:08 well but two or three people back from
17:11 that kid is a woman looks just like her
17:14 sister aged happy imagine going into
17:19 witness protection and then now you can
17:21 come out and not only come out in public
17:23 but you get to travel at the president
17:25 United States kind of cool but not what
17:30 is the connection between JFK jr. and
17:32 President Trump
17:33 why is he always showing up at Trump
17:35 rallies ah well
17:39 JFK jr. and Donald Trump were I think
17:43 can be safely described as best friends
17:45 as as as besties as those two kind of
17:50 guys can have they admired each other
17:53 both New Yorkers I think right after JFK
17:57 jr. died Donald Trump went on Larry King
18:00 Live and brought a letter the JFK jr.
18:04 had written him and Henry King realized
18:07 that it was written I think on the 18th
18:10 two days after JFK died hmm but is that
18:15 the end of the evidence oh no
18:18 oh no that's just the beginning so again
18:23 some people think that this after P anon
18:28 that he is JFK jr. now it seems a little
18:33 bit of a stretch even with the official
18:35 story because whoever is whoever this
18:37 person is appears to be extremely
18:41 military and part of an intelligence
18:44 group and I don't think that JFK jr.
18:49 would would necessarily spend the next
18:51 17 years 18 years of his life digging
18:54 that deep into military comms he may be
18:56 absolutely involved but whether or not
18:59 he is one of them are them or him it
19:03 doesn't really matter but he's
19:04 participating it would seem but now when
19:07 this plane crash occurred you know how
19:11 when these kind of accidents occur in
19:13 the in the news organizations they want
19:17 to get calls in from people from the
19:18 Coast Guard from the NTSB to comment on
19:22 things one of the very first people to
19:25 call in and I don't remember what
19:28 Network it was was this gentleman I
19:31 believe pretending to be part of the
19:33 Coast Guard talking about where the
19:36 plane was because there seems to be some
19:37 discrepancies as to where the plane was
19:39 and that seems as if there was the real
19:42 plane was flying to safety and the decoy
19:45 was being dropped in the ocean quite
19:48 frankly the only thing that needs to
19:49 occur is the plane could be put there
19:53 the night before
19:53 and the little repeater box the little
19:57 you know black box could simply be
20:02 pushed out the window of the real plane
20:04 as it flies and then the real plane can
20:06 take attorney and that might account for
20:08 the fact that the Box said I felt us you
20:10 know felt the plane do this nosedive I
20:12 could simply be someone toss on the
20:14 black box out the window I've never
20:17 heard that theorized but there you go
20:18 but this gentleman who calls in once we
20:23 rewind rewound the tape and listen to it
20:26 sounds exactly like JFK jr. I mean
20:30 remarkably like JFK jr. and how do we
20:32 nowa JFK jr. sounded like well there's
20:36 two types of interactions with JFK jr.
20:38 that were recorded one of the
20:41 interactions is him in multiple
20:44 interviews with various you know current
20:48 affairs or some sort of news
20:50 organization where they sit down in a
20:51 nice miked room and he's talking but the
20:55 other common what is it stock footage
20:58 that we have of this gentleman is he's
21:00 out talking at universities he's giving
21:02 presentations at conferences and so then
21:05 he's on a mic like this and he's having
21:10 to raise his voice a little bit because
21:11 he's outside and that changes the voice
21:13 just a little bit when we rewind the
21:19 presentations of JFK and we played
21:22 against the guy on the phone call and
21:25 just go back and forth between that and
21:28 the other presentations you have what
21:32 appears to be an exact match of a person
21:35 and what's interesting about it is that
21:38 those both come from recordings that are
21:40 over 18 years old so 1999
21:44 it's like June July 16th or 17th this
21:48 person's calling in and be talking on
21:50 behalf of the coast guard talking about
21:52 where everything was so that's recorded
21:55 back then and then we compare it against
21:56 his speeches in the 90s and so those
21:59 recordings are old so the the
22:01 shenanigans that would have to be that
22:04 could be orchestrated today are both
22:06 quarantined because those are old
22:08 recordings we can compare them against
22:11 you know old recordings of people
22:13 sitting at home you know the hoarders
22:14 that record every single thing and put
22:16 it on the shelf
22:16 thank God they do that every once in a
22:18 while because we get this exact footage
22:21 from the past and then an interesting
22:23 thing occurred because the radio station
22:25 or sorry the the TV station that
22:27 actually had him had this gentleman call
22:30 in who sounds a lot like JFK jr. they
22:33 rieta today sequence and republished it
22:37 without that phone call as if someone
22:40 figured it out today we have videos on
22:44 YouTube being created by a
22:46 and who on Twitter refers to himself as
22:49 Joe em now whether or not Joe em is the
22:53 exact voice on the recordings we don't
22:56 know but Joe em owns those videos as I
23:02 understand it and this after P guy was
23:06 number 17 dude when he posts and he
23:10 wants to update the world on the on his
23:15 cause and his movement he uses Joe in
23:19 videos that Joe and videos have that
23:23 voice and it sounds exactly like the
23:26 dude in the 90s JFK jr. so what are the
23:30 odds that you have this this movement
23:35 that is anti deep state and you have a
23:38 gentleman whose family was experienced
23:42 two assassinations due to the deep state
23:44 his uncle was controlled by the deep
23:48 state who randomly dies of a brain tumor
23:52 Chris he drank Diet Coke and that's one
23:55 of the things aspartame does to your
23:56 brain and I should say the videos are
23:59 immaculately created I mean they are
24:02 beautiful the monologues that are
24:05 written are on point there's not a
24:10 single word wasted the imagery is
24:13 fantastic the the emotional arcs of the
24:16 imagery of the montages that are going
24:18 on the background or a phenomenal and
24:21 the the videos so absolutely cover the
24:27 conspiracies of this world from the
24:29 banking cartels to the instigated Wars
24:32 to the bad medicine to corrupt
24:35 politicians child traffickers there if
24:40 you watch them all I think you would be
24:43 hard-pressed to find anything that
24:45 wasn't covered in his videos in terms of
24:48 the things that we dislike about the
24:50 world today at the same time he's not
24:54 sitting there complaining the whole time
24:55 he's telling you how they have planned
24:59 to fix the problem
25:01 so Joe him is sitting there on Twitter
25:04 he owns the face or the YouTube page
25:06 that creates these amazing videos the 17
25:09 guy posts all his stuff but the Joe and
25:13 videos are talking about the 17 dudes
25:15 full objective full plan of how they're
25:20 going to do this now some people are
25:23 skeptical because they've been so awake
25:28 for so long they can't imagine the deep
25:30 state ever falling that they don't see a
25:32 path to that being possible and some of
25:36 that's just you know you're so beat down
25:38 that you know you're like the elephant
25:40 that thinks it's a little you know
25:42 you're like an elephant the size of a
25:43 house that still believes at the rope
25:44 and the spike in the ground can hold you
25:47 down because that's the way it was when
25:48 you were a little kid the fun thing
25:50 about this is that with surveillance and
25:54 this is a bummer and this is a good
25:56 thing all at the same time we have a
25:58 Fourth Amendment to the Constitution the
25:59 United States in America which is that
26:01 you are not allowed to bees dropped on
26:03 without a due process in a and a warrant
26:07 to do so but you have to convince a
26:10 series of judges that you should have
26:13 your Fourth Amendment suspended because
26:15 you look like you're up to no good
26:17 but when 9/11 occurred and the Patriot
26:20 Act went on the military commissions act
26:22 turned on it was a it was legal to just
26:25 do whatever they wanted to but of course
26:27 the bad five eyes organizations which
26:30 are all centered in New Zealand by the
26:32 way they could do whatever they want and
26:34 then use it against you and I'll give
26:35 you an example of sort of the Wild West
26:39 nature of the world in the 90s when I
26:42 was in the database industry we would
26:45 have folks that would go to Europe every
26:46 once in a while to negotiate deals big
26:49 corporate deals and on one occasion we
26:55 were I mean this is just me telling you
26:57 what I was told so whether or not this
26:59 is real or not it's it's I've heard this
27:01 repeated a couple times and I've
27:02 repeated this a couple times and had
27:04 people go oh yeah that's what they used
27:05 to do but they checked into the hotel
27:08 put all their laptops the inside the
27:10 hotel and then took off to eat dinner
27:13 in Paris and the French Secret Service
27:18 went into the room raided the computers
27:22 downloaded everything and then when my
27:27 sales partners my buddies went in to
27:30 negotiate the deal the other side had
27:32 all the terms and they literally knew
27:35 this you know this is as low as we're
27:37 gonna go as high as we're gonna go and
27:39 now the negotiations screwed up they can
27:41 go straight to the low point and get out
27:43 for scot-free and I'm sure the United
27:47 States had its own versions of this but
27:49 that was the way it used to work used to
27:51 be very spy oriented so when we had
27:55 surveillance going into the five eyes
27:57 and going into the NSA the NSA being
28:00 constrained by FISA courts meaning you
28:02 you can collect all the data you want
28:04 but you can't look at it unless you've
28:06 got a FISA warrant to look at it the
28:09 five eyes I mean they could just tap
28:12 into any camera in the world and
28:14 pleasure themselves to videos of your
28:17 wife taking a shower if she happened to
28:19 set up her cell phone the wrong angle
28:20 they could do anything they wanted to
28:22 they could use the information against
28:24 you think about child trafficking you
28:27 know you know people what what do
28:29 criminals do criminals case joints case
28:32 you know houses and businesses to figure
28:34 out the best time of day and when the
28:36 security guards come and go now imagine
28:38 you had a direct route into people's
28:41 telephones and you know the daughter
28:44 who's you know 14 years old goes hey mom
28:47 when you're gonna be home I'm all alone
28:48 oh honey I'll be there in two hours you
28:52 know your dad's out of town for two
28:53 weeks so you just hunkered down and now
28:55 is some some weird child trafficking guy
28:58 gets tipped off maybe there's some
29:00 artificial intelligence listening to
29:02 that kind of statement and they just
29:04 show up and pick up your kid and it's
29:05 over or you're off of vacation New
29:08 Mexico and they just kidnap you and
29:11 blame it on the local Mexicans and so
29:13 this poor indigenous group of people or
29:15 like Graham we don't kidnap people but
29:18 other people do on their behalf maybe
29:20 not even the same from the same country
29:23 so the NSA
29:26 started so efficiently grabbing
29:28 everything and once they cracked open
29:33 enough cases and saw enough horrific
29:36 stuff especially child trafficking and
29:38 human trafficking
29:40 they had a change of heart about what
29:44 they're supposed to do with this
29:45 information
29:46 they also found out that was a cabal
29:48 against the United States of America
29:49 that presidents were getting installed
29:52 to throw America under the bus
29:56 Republicans and Democrat presidents were
30:00 willing to do this the Bush family does
30:03 not identify themselves as American
30:05 citizens they identify themselves as the
30:09 3:22 skullenbones descendants of german
30:13 druids from europe they see themselves
30:18 as the uncrowned monarchy of the United
30:23 States of America who knows what they're
30:25 worth I would estimate they've got
30:29 billions and billions if not a trillion
30:32 but they do a good job of kind of
30:34 staying low and I think with granddaddy
30:37 passing away Jeb will never be President
30:41 Jr has already done it all their kids
30:45 seem to be you know either girls and
30:48 they're sort of into their own world
30:50 they've kind of struggled with substance
30:52 abuse and all kinds of stuff I just
30:55 think they're kind of started to turn
30:56 into a normal American family to be
30:58 honest I don't think we're gonna see any
31:00 problems from that side but they did
31:02 their damage the Clintons are an amazing
31:05 family because you have the father the
31:07 father Bill Clinton is a complete rapist
31:10 and he's literally celebrated by the the
31:14 satanic demon crats that again we're
31:18 they're the most racist party ever
31:20 created in this country founders of the
31:23 KKK against abolishing slavery against
31:26 desegregation always pulling out the
31:28 race card constantly because they know
31:30 how to manipulate that card they want
31:33 the Mexican vote but they call them taco
31:34 truck voters inside all their internal
31:37 emails
31:38 walk away people walk away men the
31:43 clintons also have all these people that
31:45 disappeared who were in their financial
31:47 circles in Arkansas
31:49 you've got whitewater problems you've
31:51 got Vince Foster who was going to
31:55 investigate the whitewater real estate
31:57 shenanigans which I believe are all in
31:59 Hillary's camp and he ends up shot in
32:03 the back of the head rolled up in a
32:04 carpet in a park and you will still have
32:10 baby boomers saying that he committed
32:11 suicide the cognitive dissidence of baby
32:15 boomers is the most palatable [ __ ]
32:18 quantum insanity we have ever seen in
32:22 American history with the reason why
32:25 this new movement can succeed is because
32:28 for the very first time the President of
32:32 the United States has everything and
32:36 he's backed by generals and he's backed
32:40 by intelligence agents who are the most
32:42 patriotic American citizens part or bar
32:47 none and so imagine having all the cards
32:51 just like this French group that used to
32:54 come in and raid the computers what did
32:58 that do against my partners in the
33:00 software business well they went in for
33:02 negotiation where the other side knew
33:03 all the terms our side didn't know their
33:06 terms they cheated if this truly
33:10 occurred then the French Secret Service
33:14 I would think well it would have broken
33:17 some sort of ethical law between our
33:19 country in their country to do this but
33:23 I'm sure we were doing the same thing
33:24 with our operating systems where you
33:26 know we could go into anyone's computer
33:29 being Microsoft Windows but the NSA is
33:33 fighting crime the NSA is looking at
33:36 this going there is an utter cabal we
33:38 just had a president who has the most
33:41 mysterious identity on planet Earth the
33:44 reason why this big College payoff
33:47 scandal is breaking is that
33:51 this prince and Saudi Arabia have bought
33:55 the degree for the president the United
33:58 States Barack Obama
34:00 Oh Barry bought his degree at Harvard
34:03 which is why no one ever saw the dude he
34:06 was a head of entire committees over
34:08 there and these people were like I never
34:09 saw him I got the pamphlet that said he
34:11 was a Kenyan exchange student I got that
34:13 part but I never met the guy Elizabeth
34:18 Warren running around saying she's
34:19 Native American and she is not disbarred
34:22 she is not thrown out of the Senate I
34:24 mean you talk about ethics violation
34:26 that's an ethics violation to the degree
34:28 of going to jail and this [ __ ] broad
34:31 is gonna run for 2020 president she's
34:33 put this new green deal we got something
34:36 wrong with America if Elizabeth Warren
34:39 can be a free woman
34:41 she belongs behind bars I don't believe
34:45 she's even formally apologized to the
34:46 Cherokee Indians a Native American tribe
34:49 of which one cannot test one's blood and
34:53 find out one is part of that tribe the
34:55 thousand 24th blood that she said that
34:58 she matched with some weird tribe and I
35:00 don't mean weird and bad way but some
35:02 obscure tribe I should say in Peru yeah
35:06 I'm sure Elizabeth Warren's family spent
35:08 a hell of a lot of time in Peru right
35:10 give me a break
35:13 Barack Obama says on an interview that
35:16 he's a Muslim and then the the the
35:19 liberal Schilly
35:21 [ __ ] an interview person said you
35:23 mean Christian yeah I mean Christian oh
35:25 do you make those mistakes cuz I don't
35:27 make those mistakes I never say I'm a
35:29 Muslim and then oopsie
35:32 I meant Christian and I also don't call
35:35 my girlfriends are my wife's dudes names
35:39 and then correct them the same dudes
35:41 name which is Michael Adolf Hitler
35:43 worked really hard to hide his origins
35:46 he went back to Austria and got rid of a
35:49 bunch of his birth records and the fact
35:51 that maybe his grandmother was Jewish
35:53 okay so when Barack Obama got in and
35:57 they found out we're not sure where this
36:00 guy's even born looks like his father
36:02 some Indonesian guy
36:04 which his mother was at some indonesian
36:06 cult with this sex cult with this guy
36:08 I mean what's crazy is his mother was a
36:11 soft porn model that that posed to raise
36:16 money for a communist party through the
36:20 Frank Marshall Davis fund a dude who was
36:24 like completely against America
36:25 full-blown communists so she is very
36:29 suspect as well and all of this all
36:32 these little triggers the reason why I
36:33 mention this is not necessary to pick on
36:35 rock obama but to tell you this is what
36:37 start stripping the little caution tape
36:41 inside the minds of an NSA / military
36:44 organization their job is to protect the
36:47 United States of America and I keep
36:51 forgetting to mention this analogy it's
36:53 from a fictional character if any of you
36:56 seen the very first Christopher Reeve
36:58 star Superman back in the day he is
37:02 going up against Lex Luthor Lex Luthor
37:05 has an assistant miss Cass pucker I
37:07 forgot this woman's name he plays her
37:10 but at one point Lex Luthor is launching
37:12 two nuclear missiles one's gonna hit the
37:15 East Coast and one's gonna hit the west
37:16 coast
37:17 I've coast when I think it's just sheer
37:20 carnage in a populated area and the
37:23 other ones gonna hit the San Andreas
37:24 Fault in California and cause a massive
37:26 earthquake and of course Lois Lane's out
37:28 there in the desert driving on top of it
37:30 right of course he wants to save Lois
37:32 Lane that's his girl the Lex Luthor has
37:36 put a kryptonite chunk on a necklace
37:40 around his neck and he sunk to the
37:42 bottom of a pool and even though he's
37:43 Superman he won't exceed he doesn't have
37:46 enough energy to pull this thing off of
37:48 his neck and so he's he's just hobbled
37:51 while these 2.you nuclear missiles are
37:52 going in opposite directions even even
37:57 though he's Superman he doesn't have the
37:58 speed to grab both missiles before the
38:01 impact and so he's coming out of the
38:03 pool and and you know she gets in he's
38:06 just drown he's like right at the very
38:07 edge and she says look my mother lives
38:09 where this first one's going I'll take
38:12 this off your neck if you go get my
38:15 missile first my mother's missile first
38:17 and so he agrees why not he's got
38:21 nothing else to do and you have to watch
38:24 the movie see what happens with the
38:27 military they are miss Cass Walker the
38:32 Kryptonite around the neck and the
38:35 Superman is a metaphor for America
38:39 America knows how to do what's right
38:41 we're raised to do what's right this
38:44 fake layer of freedom that we have
38:46 because we've allowed people to erode
38:48 our Constitution our financial system
38:50 our education aka our awareness and this
38:54 universe that's the Kryptonite around
38:58 our neck killing us all the guy to do is
39:01 get this crap off and the NSA knows if
39:06 they don't take that off the neck of
39:07 America the NSA will go down as well the
39:11 military will go down the generals will
39:14 have no jobs the soldiers will have all
39:16 died in vain if any of you watching me
39:20 are soldiers you know I've talked to
39:22 plenty of big boys in the military and
39:25 I've said it a couple times on different
39:27 shows but you know they've told me
39:29 unequivocally look we've seen all you
39:32 conspiracy theories we don't know which
39:35 ones to believe but if someone tries to
39:37 get rid of the Constitution of the
39:39 United States the first amendment the
39:40 second moment and the rest then all
39:43 those graves all around the world will
39:48 be completely moot everyone would have
39:51 will have died for an absolute frivolous
39:55 reason and we can't allow that to happen
39:58 now we know there's plenty of wars out
40:00 there that should have never been fought
40:01 the majority of the war should have
40:03 never been fought it was all about us
40:05 being lured into borrowing money to then
40:08 get into debt to these cabal
40:10 organizations I know this is about JFK
40:13 jr. but what I'm talking about if he is
40:17 alive is what he lives for
40:20 now there was this shot which I'm going
40:23 to show this video I'm gonna put a lot
40:24 of photos in I just have to it really
40:27 slows down editing but I have to do it
40:28 there's a shot at the military base
40:31 where
40:31 Fort Knox is located Fort Knox most of
40:35 you know is the location that when Chile
40:39 Theodore Roosevelt banned the ownership
40:42 of gold in by like 1934 it was all
40:47 shipped to Fort Knox and Fort Knox is
40:48 right next to a military rebel track
40:51 excuse me on a military base no so it
40:54 was protected by a military base it had
40:56 easy in-and-out access and for about 20
41:01 years or so I think the gold was really
41:03 there but by 1954 when people would go
41:07 in and try to look at it one they hadn't
41:09 audited it according to Ron Paul I think
41:11 the last time he said that the Fort Knox
41:13 was physically audited was 1952
41:15 so maybe plus or minus two years on that
41:18 52 to 54 the word came back that it
41:22 looked like painted tuck tungsten and I
41:26 didn't know what tungsten was until I
41:27 looked it up and its really kind of a an
41:31 overly orangie yellow bar it looks silly
41:36 it doesn't look like gold if you really
41:37 know what gold looks like now if you
41:40 look up the history books on Fort Knox
41:41 so I want to make sure you guys follow
41:42 this rabbit hole because it will blow
41:44 your [ __ ] mind okay they tell you
41:47 that Fort Knox was named after some Navy
41:49 admiral Knox I'm gonna tell you that
41:52 that's not true there's a gentleman by
41:56 the name of Philander Knox and it's the
41:58 first two letters of his name is pH it's
42:01 spelled exactly like it sounds Philander
42:04 Knox was the attorney for the
42:07 Rothschilds the Rockefellers the
42:10 Vanderbilts the Carnegie's and the
42:14 Morgans he was an attorney that oversaw
42:17 the complete and utter domination of the
42:20 railroads and all the industries that
42:22 build the railroads so you not only
42:24 dominate all the railroads themselves
42:26 but you dominate the coal the oil the
42:29 steel that builds the track the land
42:31 development etc etc this guy saw was
42:35 over everything and by 1900 they stuck
42:38 him in under a belief Teddy Roosevelt is
42:40 when he got into the sort of the
42:42 administration of the White House and I
42:44 believe that he was
42:45 most likely one of the key authors of
42:47 the sixteenth amendment which is sort of
42:50 your byproduct of the Jekyll Island
42:51 meetings you know Jekyll Island is
42:54 typically romanticized
42:55 as just the heads of state getting
42:58 together in devising things but you know
43:00 these guys don't write any of their own
43:01 documents so some Brainiac on the back
43:03 end is gonna be writing those documents
43:05 now something like the sixteenth
43:06 amendment as I understand it was pushed
43:09 into Congress somewhere between 1894 and
43:11 1896 and was ceremoniously kicked out
43:15 because we were like what the [ __ ] was
43:16 what's this we're not letting this
43:17 happen we're not having a National Bank
43:19 where we have fiat currency overseas so
43:22 related to this JFK jr. being a live
43:24 thing to get back on point there was a
43:29 post and I can't remember it was a chant
43:31 of 4chan but it was a post from a
43:33 gentleman that signed it with the letter
43:36 R hmm now I don't really understand why
43:41 JFK would suddenly start signing with R
43:45 doesn't make any sense to me personally
43:48 I don't know if this post is real but it
43:50 was an individual claiming that claiming
43:55 to be JFK jr. quite frankly and it said
43:58 look my father figured this whole thing
43:59 out and he goes down a list of things
44:04 now you know there's a bit of there's a
44:10 line of interpretation in that
44:11 particular post because he posts
44:13 everything you know you learned that the
44:15 bankers were doing this and that we all
44:16 know the famous Kennedy speech where he
44:18 talks about secret societies and he
44:20 literally broke down the secret
44:21 societies because they knew exactly how
44:24 they were infiltrating the United States
44:25 of America and influencing everything
44:27 and this is a lot of stuff that's been
44:28 now repeated inside the Jo M after P
44:32 organization but in one of the lines
44:36 like there's two lines that says my
44:38 father figured out what NASA was and
44:40 what NASA was really doing and then he
44:43 says something to the effect of he
44:46 learned about the greys
44:49 now most people interpret that as some
44:52 sort of outrageous claim of NASA being
44:56 involved with grey aliens
44:58 it's the way it first comes out yeah
45:02 full disclosure for those of you just
45:03 come to the channel I don't have I don't
45:08 know I don't take claims of meeting
45:10 aliens very lightly and I don't take
45:13 claims of meeting ghosts lightly that
45:15 kind of thing so I'm not necessarily one
45:17 of those guys even though I have a few
45:19 stories for you grace you know Roswell
45:24 1947 if you go and research it and cut
45:27 away everything and you just simply
45:30 research the testimonies of individuals
45:32 from the town who have never written a
45:33 book never sold a t-shirt who remained
45:36 in a significant amount of fear their
45:41 entire life's as a result of this event
45:43 I think you will come to the conclusion
45:45 that something really occurred that
45:48 there was some sort of craft it did
45:50 crash one of them died instantaneously
45:53 as a result of the damage of the
45:55 injuries one of them was dying and one
45:58 of them seemed to be perfectly fine and
46:01 at this individual and his ship and his
46:03 craft were all picked up and taken to
46:05 various locations most likely the debris
46:08 was taken to wright-patterson Air Force
46:09 Base which is where a lot of our covert
46:12 military aircraft is finalized in the
46:15 design even to this day and then it's
46:17 built fabricated and then shipped to
46:20 area 51 for actual testing so I don't
46:23 know if the guy was talking about great
46:25 aliens but there's a whole separate
46:26 theory the greys were not aliens at all
46:29 graves were simply the individuals that
46:31 operate inside the deep state they're
46:32 sort of this you know covert group of
46:36 folks which you have a JFK jr. which
46:39 appears to have turned into and
46:41 invisible faked his death potentially
46:45 and he is again completely aware of
46:50 what's going on because his family was
46:51 so attacked and so there's our character
46:55 post one time and never again as far as
46:57 I know I don't know why that would be
47:00 done I don't know why you would do that
47:04 now the Jo M character on Twitter
47:06 because my friend follows him very
47:08 closely he will post all kinds of
47:11 bizarre things that
47:12 seem off-topic for what we're trying to
47:14 do with this awakening he'll chime in on
47:17 the moon missions like I did that whole
47:19 episode the did that 17 guy lie because
47:24 he said oh no we've been to the moon and
47:25 it was with the covert space program I
47:28 got it uh y-you know I guess the
47:33 rationale behind the covert moon
47:35 missions really leans over to the the
47:37 alien conversation you know it's where
47:41 the the moon is a big secret base for
47:43 aliens and it's an observation deck and
47:47 the backside of the moon has all this
47:49 this you know manicured contours which
47:54 John Lear follows and of course you know
47:58 we did go to the moon but we found
47:59 aliens and so we had to quickly fake it
48:02 I mean it's just you know that whole
48:03 thing is to make sure that we don't
48:05 follow what's really going on did we
48:07 don't know it's a fake why he ever said
48:10 that I don't know we just know that the
48:12 moon missions that were that were
48:14 broadcast at us are fake but like for
48:18 instance he recently chimed in on the
48:20 Michael Jackson leaving Neverland series
48:23 and said that Michael was always
48:25 innocent and he has been attacked
48:28 bizarre I mean it's not like we don't
48:32 want to hear that we all want to hear
48:33 that Michael wasn't a boy toucher I
48:36 don't want to get off on too much of a
48:39 bizarre thing but this is stuff that Jo
48:41 M has said and Jo M is absolutely
48:44 positively involved with this 17
48:48 movement absolutely a hundred percent so
48:53 this Fort Knox pictures taken and it
48:55 looks like and they all stand in a queue
48:57 alright oops I said it they stand in
49:00 this queue and you have a bunch of khaki
49:03 soldiers on the outside and a bunch of
49:05 darker uniformed military individuals in
49:08 the center but along the front lip of
49:12 this picture and will show to you I'll
49:14 show it to you you have
49:17 a couple civilians in the in the front
49:20 run there's some on the left side of
49:22 this thing as well when you're looking
49:23 straight at the picture where they don't
49:25 they don't have any military designation
49:26 and the guy in the very very front when
49:29 compared to pictures of JFK jr. appears
49:32 to have the exact same facial build and
49:34 hairline and we know that the Kennedys
49:38 had I mean the Kennedys bloodline should
49:41 be somehow parsed in a genome project so
49:43 we could get rid of all hair loss or
49:44 everybody because oh my god
49:46 I think Kennedys grow more hair as they
49:48 get older on their head it's crazy
49:50 best hair lines and planet earth so of
49:53 course this guy kept all of us here and
49:55 he has a great widow's peak down the
49:56 middle it's extremely convincing that
49:59 that could be JFK jr. and they don't you
50:03 know he's cussed everyone's staring
50:04 straight ahead no one's staring at the
50:06 camera as far as I understand and he's
50:09 not wearing sunglasses too which helps
50:11 sort of look at the bridge of his nose
50:13 and what-have-you now the other
50:15 interesting concept is that this dude
50:18 would be alive and that just like all
50:21 conspiracies where you have a resistance
50:23 against the conspiracy one of the
50:25 low-hanging fruit methods of resisting a
50:27 conspiracy is to say that a bunch of
50:29 people have been holding this conspiracy
50:31 in their heart the lie of it and that
50:33 they would normally eventually have a
50:35 breaking point and confess okay well I
50:39 would assume that if JFK jr. went
50:42 underground in 1999 to save his own life
50:45 from a hit from the Clinton family
50:48 that's the theory anyway that he
50:52 wouldn't have come out until just
50:55 recently and because he was a friend of
50:58 Donald Trump I mean he was a really
51:00 close friend of Donald Trump there's
51:02 plenty of pictures of them together
51:03 I think it's been claimed that one of
51:06 the final photographs of JFK jr. was at
51:08 a dinner with Donald Trump you can get
51:10 the picture really easily online again
51:14 Donald Trump has always been consistent
51:16 with his mantra of look I don't really
51:19 want to run for president I like my life
51:21 I like being a billionaire sleeping with
51:23 supermodels have an amazing children and
51:25 he likes building he just loves what he
51:27 does I mean if he didn't he wouldn't be
51:29 who he was
51:30 but for some reason he shows up about I
51:35 think 2010 and he's going after Obama's
51:39 birth certificate issue and I probably
51:42 have that date wrong but I think by 2012
51:45 or 2014 or something like that when
51:47 Obama drops his fake birth certificate
51:49 which is a layered PDF from the White
51:52 House which everyone has a copy of on
51:53 their hard drive now we know it's fake
51:56 but on the same exact day that Obama
51:58 confirmed that he is a liar and that his
52:00 origins are completely [ __ ] unknown
52:02 because his birth certificate is forged
52:05 from another guy's birth certificate
52:06 which the Italian forensics division of
52:11 the country proved again this this
52:14 Italian forensics team found the
52:16 original birth certificate and proved
52:17 that 76% of every pixel in Obama's
52:21 official submitted birth certificate to
52:24 the public has been lifted off this
52:25 other guys birth certificate and just
52:27 every single thing that needed a change
52:28 to make it a new birth certificate
52:29 that's the only stuff that varies from
52:32 this 76 percent of the original so we
52:36 get the proof that this guy is a fraud
52:38 and Donald Trump pulls out that day and
52:42 never talks about it again for some of
52:46 us it was like what what the hell Donald
52:49 Trump you've got the proof that you were
52:51 right go to the next like shift in the
52:54 fifth let's go and as soon as you get it
52:57 six we put him in jail and he's he is
53:02 erased from the history books so he
53:05 pulls out some reason for some reason
53:07 hmm
53:08 well the whole the whole thing about the
53:12 JFK junior 17 movement is that Donald
53:16 Trump was approached by the military on
53:19 the side and they just said okay forget
53:21 about this birth certificate thing for
53:22 now I know you hate the guy and I know
53:24 you love America and you know this guy's
53:26 a Arab Brotherhood deep stater Muslim
53:30 who wants to race Christianity wants to
53:33 erase the Constitution wants to sell
53:35 America straight back to its owners in
53:38 their mind right the European banking
53:41 cartel or even the Saudis again Saudi
53:44 Arabia has been
53:44 cleaned up by the new Crown Prince who I
53:48 believe has been framed by his brother
53:49 for the death of this journalist in
53:51 Turkey don't be fooled but he pulls out
53:56 and then what happens
53:58 the dude runs for president and the dude
54:02 wins what was going on the night of the
54:05 election
54:05 you all remember Hillary Clinton has a
54:10 99.9 percent chance of winning
54:12 remember the Young Turks oh that was a
54:15 beautiful night
54:16 absolutely melting down on live internet
54:19 streaming it was beautiful
54:21 all these crying snowflakes all of these
54:24 news organizations including Fox I can't
54:29 believe this is happening I can't oh my
54:31 god I can't believe this happening like
54:32 it was a bad thing for Fox to have a
54:34 Republican president they had been told
54:37 Hitler he was gonna win and so they're
54:40 sitting there crapping pineapples
54:41 because they're like oh my god what's
54:43 changing here because we know that we
54:46 are always told who's going to win and
54:48 that person always wins and now our
54:50 information is wrong so these
54:51 journalists that are all mockingbirds
54:53 journalists every [ __ ] one of them
54:55 okay now their masters have lost control
54:59 in all these issues all these issues
55:05 that presidents always run on during
55:07 their campaign and always renege on well
55:11 this president has delivered on every
55:13 possible thing he could deliver on
55:15 between the day he got pulled into
55:17 office and today huge list still left
55:20 huge list but think about all the stuff
55:22 that happened got rid of the mandated
55:25 existence tax the Obamacare stuff first
55:28 week in office executive order no more
55:30 penalties you can buy it if you want to
55:34 but you don't have to and you can't be
55:36 penalized for not buying it beautiful
55:39 this is gigantic list of stuff I won't
55:42 go through but we know the dude is
55:44 delivering so it goes pretty quiet all
55:47 the way through 2017 until about October
55:53 and as dude who we believe had been
55:57 posting since June
55:58 finally gave himself a handle which is
56:01 the letter 17 and he's outrageous from
56:06 the very first post he says that the
56:09 Hillary Clinton will be arrested in a
56:11 week and then she starts having
56:15 appearance anomalies she starts kind of
56:17 not showing up as much and then her and
56:20 Obama at one point have a foot brace on
56:25 both of them took a spill must have been
56:28 on the same ski trip and bumped into
56:29 each other well if she had to hide an
56:32 ankle bracelet a GPS ankle bracelet
56:34 where would you put it underneath some
56:37 sort of faux medical condition Hillary
56:42 you know obviously was having some
56:43 serious medical issues before the
56:45 election was even finished looks like
56:48 she well she absolutely collapsed on
56:52 September 11th 2016 like I've said
56:55 several times the rumor inside was that
56:58 she absolutely passed away and was put
57:00 inside that ambulance and defibrillated
57:03 brought back to life taken to her
57:05 daughter's house supposedly she lost all
57:08 bodily functions and then they send out
57:10 the actress to pretend to be her out
57:12 front of that news conference what a
57:13 hilarious trick that was the the body
57:16 double was much heavier than Hillary if
57:19 you can believe that's possible and you
57:22 know where these weird kind of John
57:23 Lennon glasses and kind of smiled most
57:27 of the time and just talked a little bit
57:29 and then you know given the impression
57:30 and she was out there by herself too I
57:32 think that was funny
57:33 you know if Hillary's out there she's
57:35 got a Secret Service detail around her
57:36 and a bunch of people around her I don't
57:38 remember that being the way that that
57:40 little news conference was was
57:42 orchestrated but if it's just a little
57:45 doppelganger model who cares no one's
57:48 gonna kill her because they know it's
57:49 not her or if they do who cares
57:51 according those people right so this
57:54 busca guy keeps appearing and he does
57:57 appear to change in appearance there's
58:02 also other appearances where Foose goes
58:05 onstage the guy that looks nothing like
58:09 JFK
58:11 but the wife's up there the best friends
58:14 up there
58:14 the sister-in-laws up there it appears
58:17 even relatives of those individuals this
58:19 mysterious girl looks like the daughter
58:21 and then there's a guy in the audience
58:25 there's been one picture of this
58:27 occurring who kind of like Tommy Lee
58:30 Plus JFK jr. he's thin he's really fit I
58:35 believe it was 2018 January 16th one of
58:40 the relatives of JFK jr. posted a
58:43 picture in the New York Harbor of this
58:46 event that it happens I guess at that
58:49 time of year where everyone comes in a
58:51 masquerade costume of some sort you can
58:54 come in anything you want and they they
58:56 windsurf right so it's a surfboard with
58:58 the with a sail on it but you can also
59:01 bring a kayak you could bring all kinds
59:03 of interest to anything water-based and
59:05 I believe it's the brother-in-law I
59:07 don't wanna get that wrong maybe it's a
59:09 cousin the relative of his post a
59:12 picture of this guy on this windsurfing
59:15 board on the anniversary of JFK Jr's
59:19 death and he's wearing a V for Vendetta
59:22 mask hmm and his body type looks a lot
59:26 like JFK Jr's body type there are
59:29 pictures from the funeral of his wife
59:34 with his wife's mother chatting to
59:37 individuals at the funeral and she is
59:40 smiling and looks frozen and a laugh in
59:43 one of the photographs now we all react
59:47 to death in a different way but for any
59:49 of you who are parents I want you to
59:51 contemplate for a split second burying
59:53 one of your children some of you
59:55 probably have had to do that I've had
59:57 some friends have had to do that there's
59:59 nothing comical about it there's no joke
60:02 anyone can tell you at a funeral that
60:05 will take the edge off of the fact that
60:06 you will not see your daughter produce
60:09 children fulfill her life figure out
60:14 what goals she might have added to her
60:16 life fulfill the goals that she had that
60:18 she communicated with you it's a tragic
60:20 situation for some reason her mother was
60:23 able to pull out of laughs and
60:25 I would cast no dispersions on her
60:27 mother's ability to deal with reality I
60:29 would think that this woman is highly
60:32 intellectual highly intelligent and
60:33 would take it to take it to heart that
60:37 this occurred now some people might blow
60:40 that off I do not but I remember when he
60:43 died there was a conspiracy went around
60:47 right after his death that one of the
60:50 other things that he was going to do
60:51 with his magazine George was that and I
60:54 would love to have someone else chime in
60:56 on this that maybe have gone down the
60:58 rabbit hole a little bit better but they
61:01 said that JFK had a double issue in
61:04 production I don't know if it was going
61:06 to be literally the next couple
61:08 magazines but he had a double issue that
61:10 he was working on that was going to
61:12 finally accuse George Herbert Walker
61:14 Bush of being involved in the death of
61:17 his father I'm sure he would have to
61:19 implicate a tremendous amount of other
61:20 people LBJ and maybe even Hoover who
61:23 knows again according to the mistress of
61:27 LBJ she said that Jagger Hoover was at
61:30 the lodge the night before when they had
61:33 the secret meeting and it got really hot
61:35 and Jay LBJ came out and said when she
61:38 asked him is everything okay and he said
61:40 well that'll be last time the son of a
61:41 [ __ ] embarrasses me he's not talking
61:44 about anyone in the lounge he's talking
61:45 about his the President of the United
61:49 States his running mate that took away
61:51 the nomination for presidents LBJ had to
61:55 go in as the vice president so the
61:58 question is does JFK jr. or is JFK jr.
62:01 still alive well no one knows except for
62:04 people that are I mean if you knew he
62:07 was alive for sure you would be a part
62:09 of the 17 group you would now the
62:14 liability of him being alive goes as
62:18 follows the deep state could find him
62:21 and kill him and then they get to keep
62:26 their history there are exciting rumors
62:29 out there wishful thinking rumors the
62:33 JFK jr. is going to resurface and tell
62:35 his story
62:37 obviously there's a few dimensions to
62:41 that one is it a crime to fake your
62:45 death to create a situation where where
62:50 the Coast Guard has used the NTSB is
62:52 used police officers are used racking up
62:56 a gigantic bill to clean up a death that
62:59 might be faked
63:00 if a body was truly pulled out of the
63:02 plane and it wasn't JFK's body then
63:04 whose body was that did you kill someone
63:06 to put it on the plane well obviously
63:08 not if it's JFK jr. but where did you
63:10 get a cadaver the other thing would be
63:12 that obviously if they pulled a body out
63:14 there's this photograph I'll put it in
63:17 there a debate putting in there but it
63:19 was part of the official news and the
63:21 news was the sensor so hopefully we're
63:23 okay if we put it in there but you would
63:25 examine the body the dental records the
63:28 hairline and you would know whether or
63:30 not you're dealing with JFK's cadaver or
63:32 not now his father who was assassinated
63:35 in Dallas there was you know dozens of
63:38 photographs taken of his dead body both
63:41 before the reconstruction and after the
63:43 reconstruction to hide the method of
63:45 death the actual trajectory of the shot
63:49 that went over his right eye I've seen
63:50 the shot that went over the right eye
63:52 big old hole in the top of his right
63:54 head and then they came in and cut the
63:56 forehead really badly they cut it so so
63:59 idiotically it's ridiculous I guess the
64:03 JFK files that were recently released I
64:06 was unaware of this talk about the fact
64:10 that he was actually shot by the from
64:11 the overpass into his throat that it
64:14 wasn't from behind by Lee Harvey Oswald
64:18 but now let's just say that there's some
64:21 method of exonerating and not paying any
64:24 penalties for faking your death there's
64:27 no he's not gonna go to jail for it
64:28 perhaps his pardoned by the president
64:30 because there was a hit on him if he
64:35 comes out and he's faked his death then
64:39 he has to prove in a court of law that
64:40 there was there was just cause for
64:43 faking his death we don't know if he
64:46 really did faked his death and by the
64:48 way the the 17 dude
64:51 said that JFK was not alive so that's
64:54 something you have to bear in mind again
64:58 it it's such a mindfuck the stuff that's
65:01 going on this disinformation and the
65:03 regular information which those
65:05 statements believe it or not hurt the
65:08 17:00 movement more than ever it really
65:11 does hurt the movement because if for
65:13 all of these things that are said that
65:15 may turn out to be a lie and they call
65:17 it disinformation well I mean again if
65:20 this guy is your buddy
65:21 and he's helping you but he's lying to
65:23 you at the same time at the end of the
65:25 entire movie you'd have to explain why
65:27 all those lies were told and they're
65:28 gonna have to be damn good excuses but
65:31 again let's just say he's exonerated
65:34 from paying any penalties or going to
65:36 jail he's pardoned by the president if
65:38 he's gonna come out and say look the
65:40 reason why I faked my death was because
65:42 I had reason to believe maybe even
65:47 conclusive reason he's gonna have to
65:48 present his paperwork and his
65:49 intelligence but perhaps he was given by
65:52 some agency that monitored such things
65:55 he's gonna have to come up with
65:57 paperwork to prove that potentially the
66:01 Clinton family put a hit out on the guy
66:05 that's a tall order so what is everybody
66:09 in the 17 movement waiting for but
66:11 they're waiting for a lot of stuff but
66:13 one of the things they're lady waiting
66:14 for and it comes up and almost every
66:15 single presidential address is lock her
66:21 up they're referring to Hillary Clinton
66:24 they could lock up Hillary Clinton for
66:27 more than two dozen reasons most notably
66:31 recently is the wholesale slaughter of
66:34 the United States of America selling
66:35 twenty four point five percent of our
66:37 uranium to a Canadian company that was
66:39 then acquired by Vladimir Putin all the
66:44 hillary foundation shenanigans of
66:46 kidnapping kids in Haiti those thirty
66:49 thousand emails have a lot of bad stuff
66:51 in them a lot of bad stuff in them just
66:54 literally making deals you want me as a
66:57 secretary of state to approve your money
67:00 transfer to approve your weapons deal
67:04 how much money gonna put my foundation
67:05 you put enough money my foundation I'll
67:08 get your deal through and that's been
67:10 going on for an extremely long time
67:12 there's a lot of rumors that Truman did
67:14 that he wouldn't pay any bills for the
67:17 government until those outside
67:18 corporations sent money to his Swiss
67:20 bank account it's sort of like a
67:22 president getting a retirement fund
67:25 because those salaries that you make are
67:27 not big enough to live on I mean the
67:29 salary right now is four hundred
67:30 thousand dollars Trump donates every
67:32 single penny to various organizations
67:35 but think about it the guy's a
67:37 billionaire he stops making billions and
67:40 he you know literally disengages from
67:42 his own franchise and now he's making
67:44 $400,000 a year for four years eight
67:48 years big deal
67:50 1.2 million dollars excuse me at 1.6
67:53 million dollars for one term that's not
67:59 enough double that it's not enough so
68:02 you really do serve your country when
68:04 you become the president United States
68:06 now what did they do Obama got done with
68:10 his eight years and came out I think he
68:11 got out a forty million dollar advance
68:13 on his book they don't care if the book
68:16 sells in my opinion that's hush money
68:20 Bill Clinton goes to Russia it gets five
68:24 hundred thousand dollars for I think
68:26 less than an hour speech that's that's
68:31 deal money man now as for the rumors
68:34 that if JFK pops back up he could run as
68:36 a running mate of the president United
68:40 States I think that's a huge order for
68:45 the minds of Americans that could
68:46 actually throw the 2020 election more
68:49 than anything but Hillary Clinton and
68:51 her clan and all these deep Staters
68:52 would have to be arrested first first
68:56 before the election and that's going to
69:00 be a pill to swallow that will be
69:02 phenomenal you could have a 50% approval
69:06 rating for Trump you could do all those
69:08 arrests for very legal reasons just you
69:11 know putting forth those what 60,000
69:13 indictments and stitching everything
69:15 together with conclusive proof you could
69:17 have
69:18 cellphone videos from Lolita Island
69:20 horrific videos from Lolita Island and
69:23 you're still gonna have baby boomers out
69:24 there saying it was all special effects
69:27 something of which they know nothing
69:28 about simply because they're never gonna
69:31 get through the kubler-ross phases in
69:33 their lifetime they're gonna remain in
69:35 anger and denial the whole time
69:38 the only negotiating they will ever do
69:40 is to keep their faux reality I think it
69:44 would be highly unlikely for him to come
69:45 out and run with Trump it's too early
69:47 it's too much it's too much for the
69:51 American people to digest and trust that
69:55 individual right away now maybe if he
69:58 came out and spent the next I mean let's
70:02 say he came out next year or but let's
70:05 let's advance that he'd a little bit
70:07 more he comes out later this year we're
70:10 in the third year of the Trump
70:11 administration I don't think he can
70:14 button up all of the skepticism around
70:16 him before the 2020 election and Trump's
70:18 gonna need to pick a partner before that
70:21 time but if he spent the next five years
70:26 cleansing his story we all do this huge
70:29 adjustment for all these people being at
70:32 Gitmo and a lot of people getting put to
70:35 death because they're they're up on
70:37 sedition charges and treason charges and
70:40 we have that time to heal and we have
70:42 that time to communicate with each other
70:45 and and you know some baby boomers are
70:48 gonna cry in there already a very soaked
70:52 towel of Tears they can make a decision
70:56 of whether or not that guy could just
70:58 simply run for president he would
71:00 certainly be a strong running mate in
71:02 five years if you were to come out
71:03 relatively right away but obviously
71:07 that's not gonna happen because the
71:08 arrests are not going to happen
71:09 relatively right away I think it goes
71:12 without saying the deep state is
71:17 scheming and I hate to even say this but
71:21 we all know this is true this is why we
71:23 have to talk about it for a split second
71:24 we know that the deep state is scheming
71:26 to assassinate the President of the
71:28 United States Donald Trump
71:30 and believe me they know it too he knows
71:33 it the NSA knows it the military knows
71:36 it the Secret Service know it how the
71:38 Secret Service can remain the Secret
71:41 Service and protect Trump is beyond me
71:43 because they have always done what
71:45 they're told and they've always served
71:46 the deep state to make sure the
71:50 president doesn't say anything he's not
71:51 supposed to say be anywhere he's not
71:53 supposed to be etc etc so that
71:55 organization I assume has been
71:57 completely and utterly gutted but I
72:00 don't know you know a lot of those guys
72:02 continue from one administration to the
72:04 next to the next to the next
72:05 maybe they're quarantined maybe they
72:07 have never been involved with the deed
72:08 State deep State but it seems highly
72:11 unlikely that they're protecting deep
72:12 state assets for God on our own 60 70
72:16 years and all of a sudden now they're
72:17 just clean as a whistle we know a lot of
72:20 the Secret Service guys that were
72:21 supposed to be protecting Kennedy when
72:22 he was assassinated came out very
72:25 quickly after the assassination and said
72:27 look we were told to not ride along on
72:31 the car because there were special
72:32 little foot foot pedestals on the back
72:35 of the car and there's supposed to be
72:37 two dudes on the back of that car
72:39 holding on to the trunk lid but they
72:42 were told not to do it and they just
72:45 obeyed it and that ended up resulting in
72:48 the death of the president now the
72:50 president would have most likely have
72:51 died anyway but those Secret Service
72:53 agents might have been hit by some of
72:55 the rounds that are flying all over the
72:57 place and it would have it would have
73:00 interrupted this lone gunman theory
73:02 because you would have more trajectories
73:03 and bodies from places that were from
73:05 the front from the side who knows they
73:07 wanted clear shots so that way they
73:09 could clean this Magic Bullet theory
73:11 which is utterly ludicrous with anyone
73:13 who has half a brain now what I find
73:16 sort of circumstantially interesting is
73:19 the notion that you know JFK doesn't
73:24 exist afk is dead okay that the
73:28 individual narrating all these Joe and
73:30 videos seems to sound identical to him
73:33 that there is definitely heavy
73:36 insinuation all over the internet that
73:38 this guy's alive and that he's been put
73:40 behind trump or at least his family's
73:42 been put behind trump his wife's butt
73:44 put behind Trump during these rallies so
73:47 the question remains it looks as if they
73:52 are most definitely trying to instigate
73:55 this conspiracy from the 17 movement
73:57 they are again you can't just in my
74:01 opinion you can't just say you can't
74:05 just inject all this into our optics and
74:07 then say it doesn't exist and you know
74:09 when the 17 dude said that he was dead
74:11 it's like well I guess since 18 years
74:14 the guy could just pass away of normal
74:16 reasons but then it would seem that a
74:19 little bit morbid for the other family
74:21 members to show up on his behalf now I
74:25 should say also the very first time the
74:26 fusca showed up that I ever saw him he
74:29 was holding a pink sign that said women
74:32 for Donald Trump and on that sign he
74:35 wrote Ruby cute and magicmarker I mean
74:38 in like you know sharpie marker and
74:43 people are like what the hell's Ruby
74:45 cute well it turns out that JFK had a
74:48 cat named Ruby cute and so that's
74:52 obviously trying to sway our minds and
74:55 those the anons of the world to do all
74:58 that deep research to find that fact and
75:00 go oh my god that's a JFK connection JFK
75:05 jr. connection now the 17 movement just
75:08 to recap on that as it exists today and
75:10 again almost every day of my life i
75:12 watch seventeen recaps on youtube
75:15 because when I go to my smoke lounge
75:17 they're always showing those videos I
75:19 absolutely never watch any of that in my
75:21 house I don't watch it anywhere but my
75:24 smoke glands cuz I just it's a great
75:26 source and it's all I can take you know
75:28 a couple hours of that and I'm sort of
75:29 done one of the big giant frustrations
75:32 is the time that it is taking to get to
75:36 the point where these individuals can be
75:37 arrested in bulk because to arrest a few
75:40 of them leaves plenty of them out in the
75:43 public who can cause problems for the
75:47 optics of the event for the legal
75:50 persecution of the event and so for
75:53 those of you that don't follow that
75:54 movement and I'm talking about the
75:55 letter seventeen for
75:56 of you who are having a problem
75:57 understand what the hell I'm saying I'm
76:00 trying to keep as many keywords out of
76:01 this video as possible the military
76:04 slashed the president United States and
76:06 everyone in between who is on the
76:08 up-and-up they're trying to get in
76:11 Supreme Court justice judges that will
76:14 rule for the Constitution of the United
76:15 States in this country people they don't
76:18 have either don't have deep state
76:21 affiliation or formally had deep state
76:23 affiliation never wanted to be a part of
76:25 it we're forced into it they're all
76:27 pulled aside and they get a chance to
76:31 fight for the right side to redeem
76:33 themselves to repent within action
76:37 instead of just image there are as of
76:44 March 2019 the theory is now advancing
76:49 to a level of Mueller which I've heard
76:54 pronounced Muller I don't know how the
76:56 hell to pronounce that guy's name I'm
77:00 most hurt most often here at Mueller I
77:01 believe but anyway that dude and rod
77:04 Rosenstein who has been definitely the
77:06 the target of many 17 posts saying he
77:10 was absolutely corrupt beyond
77:11 imagination but they have actually
77:14 either always have they've always been
77:18 on the 17 side slash the president's
77:21 side and they are essentially becoming
77:25 double agent spies for the Trump
77:29 administration / the military to find
77:32 all the deep Staters to uncover all of
77:34 the Cabal because they've been brought
77:36 in a room and said look we got you dead
77:37 to rights we have you dead to rights we
77:41 may not have your bosses dead to rights
77:42 but you're gonna help us and if you
77:44 don't want to go to jail for the rest of
77:45 your life or potentially be executed in
77:47 some military tribunal which seems a
77:49 little hard to believe that you better
77:53 start coughing up the information so
77:55 that would be a beautiful you know a
77:58 beautiful twist in the story at the end
78:00 wouldn't it that these individuals flip
78:02 now senator Graham he at times has been
78:07 very very slimy
78:10 it would appear being you know really
78:13 good friends with uma Abidine the deeps
78:17 that was at the deep state Arab
78:18 Brotherhood she loved the Clinton
78:21 administration and most likely the
78:22 partner of Hillary Clinton at times she
78:26 was the beard for Anthony Weiner who had
78:30 his computer confiscated due to sending
78:32 pictures of themselves to a 15 year old
78:33 girl naked on his computer was a folder
78:37 called insurance and inside that folder
78:40 is supposedly all kinds of heinous
78:42 things involving Hillary and Huma Abedin
78:45 I don't know if that's true you know
78:48 it's it's all I can say is it's not hard
78:51 to believe that that could be true but I
78:54 think we all should hold back a little
78:56 bit on that but seems like Graham turned
79:01 it seems like he turned the day after
79:04 John McCain's funeral when he was asking
79:07 Cavanaugh in the Cavanaugh hearings
79:10 whether or not an individual citizen a
79:12 non-military personnel citizen of the
79:14 United States could ever be tried in a
79:16 military tribunal this was recently
79:19 echoed by senator Feinstein who when
79:23 told yes that is absolutely possible
79:25 seemed to stumble in her questions
79:27 because she knows that she would be one
79:30 of those individuals not ladies in her
79:31 80s but she's an absolutely beyond the
79:34 shadow of a doubt an absolute bully on
79:36 the hill and that's not uncommon that
79:41 it's not uncommon we have the hole in
79:43 the britain they call it a whip
79:45 it's what the house of cards book
79:49 released in 1982 was all based on was
79:52 the frances orkut character in the
79:55 original book and the original BBC
79:57 series of house of cards that went for
79:59 three seasons he was a he was a whip and
80:04 his job was to get the votes together
80:06 you know like we have to make a vote
80:08 here you can't be all over the place and
80:10 so that's what those guys do so Pelosi
80:15 is one of those Schumer's one of those
80:16 all these people are one of those I mean
80:18 that's just a process that takes place
80:20 it's an organic process so you know I
80:23 don't blame some
80:24 for trying to get their way through I
80:26 blame them for going against the
80:28 Constitution of the United States that's
80:30 what I have a problem with so do I think
80:32 JFK Jr's alive I think that if I were to
80:36 say yes it wouldn't be based on any
80:38 evidence that I've seen his face there's
80:43 a lot of composites coming out on
80:44 Photoshop and I will tell you that for
80:48 you know Photoshop could be a conclusive
80:51 tool used to figure out whether or not
80:53 someone's face of someone else's faced
80:54 it you major all the distances between
80:56 the face but because of the little
80:59 filter called distort you command-t and
81:02 you can hit Reich's
81:04 right select right click it and select
81:06 warp you can move those noses and mouths
81:08 wherever you want in a minuscule level
81:10 and then hit return and then you can
81:13 start matching it to anyone else's face
81:15 so because that manipulation can occur I
81:18 don't know but the wife seems for me to
81:21 be absolutely conclusive and usually
81:23 when someone like that shows up they
81:26 find the original person they say that's
81:28 not his wife that's this woman her name
81:30 is that that that the does she lives its
81:32 own so and she shows up this she works
81:34 at this company whatever and no one to
81:36 my knowledge has done that for her or
81:38 the woman that appears to look like her
81:40 sister so it would be based on the
81:43 ancillary members of the family that I
81:44 would think that there's a possibility
81:45 he could be alive y17 would say he
81:48 wasn't alive I don't know is that trying
81:52 to like kill dissent because lying to us
81:55 the people doesn't make any sense
81:56 because I would assume the deep state
81:58 would know whether or not the do was
81:59 alive so you're not manipulating the
82:01 deep state's opinion you're manipulating
82:03 our opinion so I don't know I really
82:07 don't know would it be the best movie
82:10 ever written yes
82:12 if this 17 thing turns out to be what it
82:15 claims to be
82:16 if the arrests ever occur if the Great
82:19 Awakening prevails if the state deep
82:23 state losses if Europe is finally freed
82:26 from this at brexit finally occurs if
82:29 all the five eyes have their eyes poked
82:33 out
82:34 and we can we can real edge asleep the
82:38 entire world to make sure this never
82:40 happens again or if it tries to occur
82:43 again there mediately caught their the
82:44 the one of these things is not like the
82:47 other kind of formula then yeah I think
82:50 that would be the greatest thing that we
82:51 could ever witness as citizens of this
82:53 planet and it will be one of the only
82:55 times in history since man has either
82:59 crawled out of the primordial ooze
83:02 exited a spaceship or was divinely
83:05 created by God that we will have ever
83:08 seen anything so miraculous and amazing
83:11 which is why regardless if the 17
83:14 movement is a live-action role-playing
83:16 exercise or real it really doesn't
83:19 matter we need to pretend like it's real
83:20 do what we can to keep the pressure on
83:25 for justice and the American Way or
83:29 whatever country you live in
83:30 it's all about freedom people it's all
83:34 about living under common law do no harm
83:38 it's vital anyway I think that's all
83:42 I've got on that subject
83:43 hopefully you dug it if you have them
83:46 into deep thoughts radio calm please go
83:47 it's where all the feeds are audio-video
83:49 a lock Facebook group a Twitter page and
83:51 a patreon account just in case you want
83:54 a tip for all of those supporting me and
83:56 any one of those genres thank you so
83:58 much take care of yourself in someone
84:01 else and I'll see in the next deep
84:02 thoughts over now
