00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen today is actually a really
00:34 warm day and it's like November 2nd
00:38 absolutely crazy I love it and this is
00:42 sort of gonna be a bit of an overlap
00:44 with another episode I made called
00:46 weapons of natural destruction but I
00:50 think the name of this will catch quite
00:52 a few eyes for anybody who's either you
00:58 know inquisitive about this or you've
01:03 just recently suffered due to some of
01:06 these situations and you're looking for
01:09 some form of Sandy and it's never
01:14 occurred to you that as you suffer or
01:18 your friends suffer that there's a bunch
01:21 of slimy politicians and slimy world
01:26 bankers who orchestrated your suffering
01:29 such that they could advance either an
01:32 agenda which is more of a in this
01:37 conversation kind of a global plan or
01:39 some short-term short-term business gain
01:43 like bill building a high-speed rail
01:45 through your neighborhood now there's a
01:49 weird thing going on in the world and it
01:53 really has been a 21st century
01:55 phenomenon which is you know we we grew
02:03 up for for centuries and and passed down
02:06 you know family stories and what have
02:08 you about our indigenous area and we
02:12 will talk to each other about what to
02:15 expect right the grandparents teach the
02:19 grandkids and then they pass that down
02:21 and if something doesn't happen once
02:22 every two or three hundred years then
02:25 it's the generation after generation
02:26 that might say hey you know every once
02:28 we'll forget this gigantic flood but it
02:29 only happens every 300 years because
02:32 people keep track they write it down
02:34 what they have done is so utterly
02:36 brilliant
02:38 that's very difficult to casually track
02:42 it in the mind
02:43 wishes to say you know certain events
02:48 like there's natural disasters that we
02:52 have been traditionally raised with they
02:56 just happen because mother nature gets
02:59 to a state where it does something but
03:02 we're not raised to think that it's
03:05 possible to cause certain natural
03:07 disasters because we barely understand
03:09 them to begin with I'll give you some
03:12 examples we know that if we modified
03:16 weather which they've been doing since
03:18 the 1950s we could cause tornadoes
03:23 because we will start creating a cold
03:27 front it's gonna bang into a hot front
03:31 it's gonna phone it's gonna funnel
03:34 horizontally and it's gonna rain on one
03:36 side of the funnel it's gonna turn up
03:37 and boom you could kill everyone at
03:38 Joplin Missouri I want to remind people
03:41 in Joplin Missouri who lost a third of
03:43 their entire town that I was in Lake
03:46 Havasu about 24 hours or so a little bit
03:51 before the weekend before taking
03:55 pictures of some of the most
03:57 unprecedented chemtrails ever being
04:00 sprayed and in the boat with my friends
04:02 I was having a conversation about
04:04 whether or not they were real and I got
04:08 the whole photo gallery of that spring
04:11 and the thing I told my friend I said we
04:15 can't accept this weather modification
04:18 stuff because it can create problems in
04:21 a different location and I mentioned the
04:22 fact that China when they spray it over
04:24 the Olympics they caused a typhoon and
04:27 they killed by I think 75 people or
04:30 something or even more that's what
04:33 they're willing to report so I'm sitting
04:36 there telling you look somewhere in the
04:37 Midwest something horrible could happen
04:39 and sure enough this freak tornado
04:44 happens in Joplin Missouri maybe it has
04:47 to do with creating high pressure zones
04:50 and
04:51 pressure zones when you start creating
04:54 clouds that are gonna rain
04:55 you got low pressure when you spray and
05:00 wipe everything out you get high
05:01 pressure what so through manipulating
05:04 just those basic principles you can
05:07 control where it's gonna rain remember
05:10 there's a service out there for a
05:11 hundred grand you can have them spray
05:14 above your wedding spray above your
05:16 event and it won't rain satisfaction
05:20 guaranteed so why do we have category 4
05:24 in category 5 hurricanes out in the
05:27 ocean that are allowed to just sit there
05:29 and do what they do well we could take
05:31 an armada of dump so much retardant into
05:36 the cyclone of a hurricane they wouldn't
05:41 be able to be as at least as strong as
05:43 it is how about that they began to
05:46 completely get rid of it maybe you don't
05:47 want to get completely rid of it because
05:48 it might do something else funky but
05:51 fires California fires think about it
05:55 how easy is it to create a fire very
05:59 easy child could do it
06:01 children have done it everyone's done it
06:04 I got to California in 1987 August
06:09 August 19th as a matter of fact and I
06:13 was googoo eyed for this place and I
06:15 pretty much still AM
06:17 but when you're googoo eyed for
06:19 something you were noticing more your
06:21 eyeballs are wide open and you're
06:23 ingesting every molecule every every
06:27 cent of this place on every metaphorical
06:30 and physical level and so if something
06:35 was bad I would have noticed it and
06:37 something is good I definitely noticed
06:39 it this place was amazing back in the
06:41 day I'm telling you in it what it is
06:43 turned into since we got out of red
06:45 leadership into blue leadership it's
06:48 horrendous
06:50 but that's part of agenda 21 to bankrupt
06:53 the state and to get everyone to leave
06:56 California that is their goal so funding
06:59 sanctuary cities and getting the whole
07:02 metropolitan area of San Francisco
07:04 covered
07:05 feces soon and Los Angeles soon every
07:07 other town to get us to run out so that
07:10 we can depopulate the state it'll be
07:13 easier to clean up once everyone was
07:15 gone
07:15 that's agenda21 that's what they're
07:17 doing it might sound crazy until you
07:20 explore it and then you're gonna be like
07:21 oh my god
07:22 Rosa Korey was completely correct so
07:26 California fires we're not as prevalent
07:29 as they are today not even close
07:32 I wouldn't looked up a chart it's very
07:36 difficult to find this information but I
07:37 tried to find an information about not
07:39 only the frequency of fires in
07:41 California but the magnitude of fires in
07:43 California and then there's definitely a
07:45 rise on one side of the fence we have
07:48 arsonists that are working for these
07:50 globalists trying to clear out land
07:52 trying to rape the federal government of
07:55 aid and their other side of their game
07:59 is they have you know climatologist who
08:03 are alarmists who are lying to you about
08:05 how the atmosphere works trying to get
08:09 you to believe that anything that bad
08:11 that anything bad that happens and
08:13 they'll fake what's bad they lie about
08:16 what's bad that's the other interesting
08:19 thing we're living in like a movie at
08:23 this point in our life in America but
08:27 California's double movie because the
08:29 place is built out of dreamers who
08:31 either succeed at what they're trying to
08:33 do become an actor director writer or
08:35 whatever musician where they fail but
08:38 they keep the capabilities in their
08:40 brain to imagine to fantasize and then
08:45 when they get told about global warming
08:46 which is completely fake it's a taxation
08:50 system again to depopulate the world and
08:53 to control us that's it at 21 is very
08:56 simple they believe it because they have
08:59 no problem imagining because that's the
09:00 kind of DNA that they are no I've seen
09:04 little fires in California yeah probably
09:07 the second half of the 90s I used to
09:11 live in the Bay Area San Francisco area
09:13 I'd ever lived in San Francisco lives
09:14 south 30 miles or more
09:18 but you drive over by Gilroy the the
09:21 garlic capital and you'd see them
09:24 burning crops but it was a controlled
09:25 burn it was something that the farmers
09:27 were doing between the highways between
09:30 the two strips of the five okay you see
09:33 that in Kansas where I'm from I mean
09:36 I've seen people burning crops my whole
09:37 life it's just a thing that you do to to
09:40 rejuvenate the land but I moved back
09:44 down here in January 1st 2003 literally
09:47 first day of the year that's when I
09:49 plopped onto this this patio right here
09:52 and very soon after I got here when
09:55 summer hit which was hot as hell man
09:58 because there's a lot of sun spots at
09:59 the time so the Sun was ejecting a
10:02 massive amount of material at us nothing
10:06 to do with co2 men but there were fires
10:10 all over the place but there's a big
10:13 stretch of them down in San Diego and I
10:17 was going to a buddy Mines Italian
10:18 restaurant and next door was a thick a
10:26 Ralph's and they were on strike they
10:30 were forced to go on strike and so ended
10:32 up happening was they were protesting
10:34 during the day but they'd break for
10:37 lunch and come over to the restaurant
10:38 and someone who had a background and in
10:44 fire fighting sat in the room and said
10:46 there they go again and I'm like what
10:50 what are they doing and he says for this
10:53 most part I'm completely asleep I'm a
10:56 suspect that you know Lee Harvey Oswald
10:58 shot Kennedy but overall I'm totally
11:02 asleep he says he says the budget for
11:07 the California fire prevention getting
11:10 to budget two buys all of their cargo
11:12 jets that drop stuff and everybody
11:14 salaries and everybody's equipment
11:17 he says the budgets coming up they start
11:20 these fires but every 10 years when the
11:23 big massive budget update happens and
11:26 they get a ton more money
11:29 and I'm sitting there going oh now in my
11:32 mind it was a a maybe just keep that in
11:36 the back of your head
11:37 this guy limited by his background but
11:40 then a few years past pass and we have
11:44 some additional fires about 2005-2006
11:48 arrow so I'm up late one night and this
11:52 is how it happens I mean while I was up
11:55 late before the flight 800 it blew up
11:59 over in New York I was up real late at
12:03 night when the fake chemical bombers
12:06 were caught in London headed to New York
12:08 which made sure we couldn't take a tube
12:10 of toothpaste on an airplane but I'm up
12:13 late one night and his fire had started
12:15 and all sudden there's this story on the
12:21 news and it said that the FBI was
12:25 chasing some dude on a motorcycle that
12:29 supposedly had no lights and that he was
12:36 seen driving down this back road and
12:40 everywhere this guy was is when the
12:42 actual fire starts where it starts like
12:45 an arsonist but later you know - two
12:49 days later within that time frame they
12:53 didn't talk about this guy at all all of
12:56 a sudden it's a some brush fires started
12:59 by a construction site and what's
13:03 interesting is when they faked the
13:04 reason for a fire to begin a lot of
13:07 times they don't sue anybody because
13:10 they know if they took it to court the
13:12 construction company is gonna go what
13:14 are you talking about we didn't have
13:15 anything flammable there was no fire we
13:18 don't we don't start fires just because
13:21 we're building a house I mean it makes
13:22 no sense at all right no such thing fire
13:26 is the Nemesis of construction sites so
13:30 what have we had in the last couple
13:32 years here
13:34 we've had some horrific horrific stuff
13:37 happen in California
13:40 and the way I look at this whole thing
13:42 is that well there's a psychological
13:45 situation and honestly you know I never
13:49 thought it was as intense as it was one
13:51 of my employees from Electronic Arts who
13:53 is definitely a very strong-minded
13:56 individual sort of like you know one of
14:00 these guys that would be you know a
14:04 mountain climber a motocross racing guy
14:09 skateboarder there's like a man's man
14:11 he's not easily moved by anything he had
14:16 moved I think North from California and
14:22 he said that they had unpacked their
14:25 stuff in their house then the family
14:27 he's got two kids boy girl and his wife
14:30 and they hop in this hot tub in the back
14:34 and they're just chilling out in the hot
14:36 tub and somehow the house catches on
14:40 fire to this day they don't know what
14:42 happened and it burns the entire house
14:45 down and they're just trying to put it
14:49 out they're trying to keep the kids safe
14:51 but I will tell you this dude was a
14:54 different person after that happened and
14:56 you know be almost like taking somebody
14:58 who's a you know not quite a Navy SEAL
15:02 but someone who's definitely seen some
15:03 serious military time and then you think
15:06 you've seen it all already and then all
15:08 the sudden a little fire happens or a
15:10 big fire and they're even further
15:12 modified and it's just it just shows you
15:14 how devastating it could be because he
15:16 lost everything all of his computers all
15:19 of his family possessions all of the
15:22 relics from his family so I'll say this
15:27 much the one thing I know that I don't
15:29 know is how utterly devastating it is to
15:33 have a fire burn down everything that
15:36 you own there's that old saying I can
15:39 only imagine and you know as I progress
15:42 through this video I want everyone to
15:44 know if you've suffered from such a
15:45 thing I can only imagine what you've
15:48 gone through period but a fire has so
15:51 many dimensions of its existence you
15:53 have
15:53 those that are in a feral state of
15:56 survival because they're on their stuff
15:58 is on fire and they're trying to get out
16:00 trying to get out of paradise California
16:03 they're trying to get out of a
16:04 neighborhood when I first moved to the
16:07 Bay Area I watched the Oakland fires out
16:10 my four-story window nice maybe
16:12 three-story window at a perfect view of
16:14 Oakland
16:14 across the bay and just watch this thing
16:16 burn it's crazy but what else happens
16:21 when a fire is going on you have
16:23 obviously a ton of volunteers that go in
16:26 to help you have the social media
16:29 virtually signaling thing that happens
16:31 which is it's kind of good and it's kind
16:34 of disgusting at the same time you know
16:36 some people going up saying oh my god
16:38 I'm so sorry you lost everything what
16:40 can I do and then you have people that
16:42 just want everyone to cry and they want
16:45 to be the reason why you cry they want
16:46 to share that bad news with you this is
16:48 the sickening thing but the Paradise
16:51 Fire has revealed something completely
16:54 different which is also the Malibu fires
16:58 we had something unprecedented occur
17:02 homes burned completely to white ash and
17:06 I mean right down to the ground and then
17:10 if you look at the floor plan of the
17:12 home you've got a green bush that was up
17:16 against the house and it didn't burn it
17:18 all still green you had cars that had
17:23 the aluminum engine block melt
17:25 completely out on the ground and run
17:26 down the street with windows missing but
17:32 it's right next to a tree
17:35 trees barely disturbed but the amount of
17:38 heat to melt an engine block the amount
17:43 of heat to melt a window is so hot that
17:47 that tree would be gone that tree would
17:49 least be massively scarred and most
17:51 likely dead as a result of its car we
17:55 had homes that were way out in the
17:57 forest like a home on the end of a dirt
18:00 road surrounded by lush green forest
18:04 with a gravel road and somehow the house
18:08 burns all the way to the ground and it
18:10 burns to ash now for those of you're not
18:13 firefighters homes don't burn down to
18:17 ash they burn for a while and then they
18:21 go out and various materials never burn
18:25 because they take way too much heat to
18:28 burn right after the Paradise fires you
18:31 have the residents sort of split into
18:35 two you have individuals that are so old
18:39 they don't even know what a computer is
18:41 they don't know what the Internet is and
18:42 so they never report in their loss at
18:46 best they're walking around their
18:47 property getting filmed by a local film
18:49 crew but then you have some of the more
18:53 progressive thinkers they're artists
18:56 that are out there that are now taking
19:01 photographs and going this was not
19:04 normal
19:06 one gentleman who's probably got the
19:09 most famous video out there about the
19:10 Paradise thing he's an artist sort of
19:15 off-the-grid kind of guy but his art
19:18 relates to using a kiln just out in
19:22 front of his house and so he goes look
19:24 this is my kiln it takes me 20 minutes
19:26 to get that thing hot enough to perform
19:28 any type of melting to get my art to
19:30 work but he goes I came outside because
19:34 I heard that the fires were within you
19:37 know a few miles of my house he said
19:40 came out and I looked and he goes I see
19:42 this fire that's definitely a couple
19:44 miles away and even if it's traveling
19:47 you know summon God
19:49 the amount of speed 3040 miles an hour
19:51 it's not coming his direction and he's
19:53 got some time he's also got a dog he's
19:58 got a truck and so he's thinking okay I
20:01 need to quickly get my stuff out of the
20:02 house it's important and then he said
20:06 all the sudden everything around him was
20:09 on fire he can still see the fire way
20:13 the hell away and there's nothing
20:15 crawling over a hill his stuff just went
20:19 up in flames he says I looked at my kiln
20:22 here as Mike ILM's on fire it was like
20:25 the kiln itself was on fire he said all
20:29 the timber that I used to put in the
20:30 kiln to get it going it's just in a pile
20:32 on fire he looks back at his house it's
20:35 on fire he's like Jesus I get the hell
20:38 out of here so he described the
20:41 situation and he's got some of the most
20:43 famous footage of trying to escape the
20:44 Paradise fire but he said that he it
20:48 went up in flames so quickly that he
20:51 said the oxygen around him disappeared
20:55 imagine that because I ran to my truck
21:00 got in my truck
21:01 I think his dog got in there as well but
21:03 he said the only thing that saved his
21:04 life but kept him alive I should say was
21:08 the oxygen inside the cab of his truck
21:09 and there's neighborhood after
21:13 neighborhood after neighborhood in this
21:14 in the Paradise / Malibu fires where
21:18 houses burned to the ground and burned
21:20 to white ash but if you look at
21:23 thousands and thousands of photos of
21:25 homes that are burned down all over the
21:26 world you won't find any photographs of
21:29 a house burning completely - there's
21:33 always part of the house left even if
21:35 it's absolutely charred you will also
21:38 still have several of the inner
21:42 structures of the home it didn't burn
21:44 like a chimney a metal frame around a
21:48 window now windows can get hot and break
21:52 and pop out so just because you don't
21:54 see a window doesn't mean it melted but
21:57 according to the people making all these
21:59 videos who are
22:01 at the site of the you know multiple
22:03 locations of his fires they said look
22:06 there's no glass anywhere there's no
22:08 metal anywhere our chimneys burned away
22:11 now there are some photos of chimneys
22:15 still existing but they're sort of
22:18 melted down now here's the thing there's
22:25 two types of people out there when it
22:26 comes to a fire and how to deal with
22:28 perhaps its cause you have individuals
22:33 that are still in such pain that the
22:35 last thing they want to hear is someone
22:38 tell them that there's a potential the
22:41 politician and agenda21 globalists are
22:45 participating in starting these fires
22:47 which then took away everything that
22:49 they own are potentially potentially
22:51 loved ones right we had people burned
22:54 alive and the Paradise to Malibu fires
22:58 probably the most horrendous California
23:01 fire I've ever witnessed since I've
23:02 lived here I watched the videos of the
23:06 people walking up to two vehicles with
23:10 their neighbors their best friend's
23:13 chart up inside the car one of the guys
23:18 said that you know he was in some convoy
23:22 of people trying to get out of there and
23:24 he ended up having to park his truck
23:26 next to some sort of body of water and
23:30 he jumped out into the body of water to
23:31 save his life but his the rest of his
23:34 convoy got eaten up by fire so before we
23:38 spread and disseminate this information
23:39 we need to understand what kind of
23:41 person we're dealing with because if
23:42 someone is on the edge of sanity because
23:44 of the loss we don't need to say any of
23:47 this kind of stuff to them but there are
23:51 some people that are mad as hell
23:54 just like the movie Network and they
23:57 don't want to take it anymore
23:58 and they don't want to be run off their
24:00 land because I I have never heard like
24:06 after Paradise and Malibu fires
24:08 I didn't hear a lot about people leaving
24:11 in California or leaving the area and ex
24:14 but this last round of fires here I'm
24:19 now starting to hear that people want to
24:21 leave California I want to leave their
24:22 area
24:23 well that's pure unadulterated victory
24:27 for agenda21
24:29 folks they want you out of there
24:32 now one of the defense mechanisms of
24:34 course is that you would never do such a
24:37 thing to another human being for any
24:39 reason whatsoever especially since
24:41 you've potentially experienced it and so
24:44 it's that threshold and the brain that
24:48 the elite love the globalist love it's
24:51 your Democrat politicians who are
24:54 feeding agenda 21 in California
24:56 absolutely love it and that is that you
24:59 cannot conceive of the evil that they
25:01 portray that they conduct you can't
25:07 conceive of it they say well you know if
25:10 we're gonna get a Jena 21 to work we've
25:12 got to get everyone out of the rural
25:13 areas of California you know according
25:16 to Rosa Cory they're pulverizing 1,200
25:21 miles of 1,300 miles of road or at least
25:24 they're not going to take care of it any
25:25 more and so you won't be able to get to
25:28 your home unless you go on a dirt road
25:29 you won't be able to get your business
25:30 to run unless people want to soil up
25:33 their cars to get whatever it is you
25:35 sell its eventually you'll die off
25:38 that's one way of doing it but these
25:41 globalists that are brown get their
25:44 meetings their spirit cooking events and
25:49 I'm sure the conversation has gone on
25:51 I'm sure that I'm a thousand percent
25:54 correct that someone says well how am I
25:57 gonna get these people out of like
25:59 paradise and Malibu and all these other
26:02 locations and someone says we'll burn
26:08 them out oh yeah forgot because they can
26:12 be evil and you can't perceive of it and
26:17 because they can blame it on a natural
26:18 cause they win
26:22 they went in a forest fire is probably
26:25 the easiest thing in their bag of tricks
26:28 to create without anything spontaneous
26:31 going on but there was a satellite image
26:40 and it's featured on the channel sgt
26:42 report attends some other you know
26:45 ancillary videos by itself but it's it
26:49 shows you from a satellite and i'm gonna
26:51 try to cut in at least the frames of
26:52 this because i don't know if someone's
26:53 got a copyrighted we're in two volleys
26:59 for the 2019 fall fires you have
27:05 explosions going off within a few
27:08 seconds of each other in two bursts when
27:11 overlaid with the fire map it is exactly
27:14 where these fires started and these
27:17 explosions are big because they show up
27:20 on a satellite so it's not a lightning
27:22 bolt it is big and so it looks like
27:26 within a few minutes arsonists probably
27:30 on the behalf of the globalists i know
27:33 this sounds crazy but if you continue to
27:36 believe the emperor has this clothes on
27:38 then this is going to continue and
27:42 they're just gonna say it's climate
27:44 change or some horseshit right they want
27:46 to give you the impression that it's
27:47 some evolving problem that we're having
27:50 in california the whole world would be
27:53 experiencing this stuff the rainforests
27:56 that burned in South America it was a it
28:01 was a big deal
28:02 two months ago or so right but no one
28:05 could figure out how it happened and
28:07 everyone's like oh well the natural
28:08 fires do occur lightning bolts happen
28:10 and dented the data well the rainforest
28:12 is fairly saturated in moisture so it's
28:15 a little bit tougher to get the
28:16 rainforest to start sparking up and
28:19 going but after it all cleared out what
28:23 do we find out it's exactly where they
28:27 want to drill for oil how convenient
28:32 now let's say that you don't believe
28:34 that it's like oh my god
28:36 you conspiracy theorist you have to have
28:39 something for everything right okay well
28:45 why don't you look up HAARP h eh r RP
28:53 you might have even heard of it before
28:55 you might have even heard it as a
28:56 pretext for other bad things happening I
29:03 believe the gentleman is named Bernard
29:05 Easton he's a naval researcher who filed
29:11 the patents for HAARP and it's an
29:15 antenna that's based on Tesla designs
29:19 nobert Tesla was creating a superweapon
29:21 before he died he spent a decade on it
29:24 and his goal was to create a super
29:26 weapon that would pulverize any tank
29:32 submarine missile it would just liquefy
29:36 the object and so you couldn't find a
29:38 war most of us are pretty certain it's a
29:41 directed-energy weapon and just so you
29:45 know if you were to harmonize the
29:48 molecules of aluminum at a particular
29:52 level of agitation that aluminum will
29:55 start to liquefy and go away without
29:58 fire not sure how much heat happens but
30:02 you could do aluminum copper gold
30:04 anything you can resonate probably glass
30:08 anything and get it to melt away to
30:11 atomized it's been done several times
30:14 buddy of mine made one of these things
30:16 about ten years ago you could just take
30:19 a paperclip put it on there and hid it
30:20 in a paperclip with vapor ice so this
30:24 isn't like hidden sci-fi technology it
30:26 really exists so the HAARP antenna
30:31 modulates in a square array this cyclone
30:37 of electricity of electromagnetic energy
30:39 and every time it goes around it
30:44 amplifies it amplifies it amplifies
30:46 because what they have set in motion
30:48 stays in motion and then they add more
30:50 electric
30:50 the more electricity and then the way
30:53 that they can do this is they have these
30:55 little antennas on the top because it's
30:57 like a it's like two or three different
30:58 plus signs all put together in
31:01 three-dimensional space but the top
31:03 thing could lean and they can shoot it
31:05 straight up into space they can lean it
31:07 over and bounce it off the ionosphere
31:09 and hit the ground they can also send a
31:12 pulse it just keeps going
31:14 boom boom boom boom boom if you look at
31:18 the patents in the Patent Office which I
31:19 believe was in 1958 the HAARP antenna
31:23 was was patented for three different
31:26 divisions of science one of them was
31:30 weather manipulation which had nothing
31:34 else you could punch a hole in a cloud
31:35 and once you punch a hole in a cloud you
31:37 get a high pressure system starting to
31:40 occur because the sun rays go down
31:41 through it Hetal ventures start moving
31:44 out everything they patented it for
31:47 earthquakes theory being you've got a
31:51 tectonic plate when you modulate it with
31:54 a frequency it's just like the old
31:58 bridges in the 30s right they got the
32:00 wind on them before they realized how to
32:01 build bridges outside the frequency
32:04 range of wind and you know the bridge
32:06 used to twist and turn until popped well
32:09 they do that to the tectonic plate
32:12 massage massage at massage and
32:14 eventually the play goes Kapow and pops
32:16 and you get yourself a Fukushima you get
32:20 yourself the 19 another 2004 Indonesian
32:23 tsunami earthquake that killed 280,000
32:27 people the third division was mine
32:32 control the human brain operates on
32:36 electricity an infinitesimal amount of
32:38 electricity as a matter of fact which
32:39 makes it and all that much easier
32:42 our craniums are fairly insulated but
32:46 not completely protected against
32:49 electromagnetic energy and so it is
32:53 theorized and again they're CIA guys who
32:55 have defected in the 90s is said by 1996
32:58 they had absolutely perfected
33:01 mind-control
33:03 and if you could look up all the
33:05 experiments they've done on animals for
33:07 zapping their brains and digging a bull
33:09 and the bull one's kind of sad because
33:12 they just electrocute his brain and keep
33:14 him from doing anything so he's he's
33:16 charging at the red you know flag thing
33:19 and all of a sudden
33:19 and he's like stunned that's not mind
33:23 control that's just short-circuiting his
33:24 brain but imagine broadcasting obtuse
33:29 emotion you are feeling melancholy the
33:33 whole neighborhood fills melancholy
33:35 right you're feeling joyous you're
33:38 feeling vindicated you know all the
33:39 little emotions that they can figure out
33:42 that the brain modulates in a particular
33:44 way they broadcast at us and we go into
33:48 whatever state we need to be in you want
33:51 to be you want to put everybody in
33:52 terror there you go poof so I bring up
33:57 that example not to sound crazy but to
34:02 demonstrate that these folks have
34:06 already patented all kinds of things
34:08 they're going after it they'll be going
34:10 after it for a long time to try and
34:13 control all these aspects of the human
34:16 condition so we're not in any safe zone
34:20 just because you can't conceive of it
34:23 doesn't mean they don't do it California
34:26 is the biggest state in the Union when
34:28 it comes to electoral votes typically
34:33 not in Malibu but in Northern California
34:36 you do get a lot of conservative people
34:38 that live up there that are voting red
34:44 they like America they like the rustic
34:47 you know beautiful nature of the woods
34:51 one agenda21 every single one of those
34:54 regions is off-limits to humanity into
34:57 gender 21 go see my episode everyone is
35:01 going to be taken out of the rural areas
35:03 there will be no Midwest
35:05 there will be no Conservative Party
35:09 because once they're done there's one
35:11 party and it's going to be dictated out
35:13 of the Club of Rome
35:16 or club 300 excuse me in Paris and
35:20 they're gonna tell the whole planet what
35:21 to do we're not exactly sure where they
35:24 live but that's one of the controlling
35:25 forces that is all the modern banking
35:27 that controls the planet to this day if
35:31 you haven't I definitely recommend you
35:34 go on YouTube and you look up look up
35:37 Sgt report it's a little religious for
35:40 my tastes but in the end the content
35:42 that they present is pretty amazing the
35:43 interviews that they conduct are pretty
35:45 amazing but go look at the eyewitness
35:48 videos where the cause of the fire is in
35:51 question
35:53 go look at all the photos again of the
35:56 Paradise fire and tell me that houses
36:00 burned to ash and then look up every
36:03 other fire that's ever been reported in
36:05 your local area where firefighters
36:07 couldn't get on the scene in any
36:09 reasonable amount of time
36:10 I remember the Oakland fires it was at
36:15 1991 you had burnt houses but you didn't
36:19 have them burned down to ash
36:21 in my hometown we've had you know and
36:24 Kansas tons of fires tons of fires
36:30 happened in the middle of the night and
36:32 the next day because it's a small town
36:34 everybody wants to drive by the house
36:36 and in a rubberneck at it plus it's just
36:39 fascinating to see you know what fire
36:40 does and in every case the house is
36:45 typically rebuilt and a bunch of the
36:47 houses is surviving timber and structure
36:52 that went through the fire and actually
36:54 survives but not in the modern
36:57 California fire so it's pretty evident
37:00 that with the recent fires this year in
37:03 2019 they were set off by explosions
37:08 because of the satellite footage I mean
37:12 the idea that the press doesn't cover
37:14 this proves it's fake news it's all fake
37:18 news every bit of it Fox's fake news
37:20 everything is fake news the for the
37:24 Paradise fire
37:25 there were several questionable
37:28 photographs
37:29 and some of them are silly
37:31 misinterpretations of things because you
37:35 know anomalies occur inside of digital
37:38 cameras but there are some fairly decent
37:44 photographs that question whether or not
37:47 perhaps some of the military equipment
37:51 that we have that shoots out lasers that
37:56 shoots out beams of all kinds of
38:00 destruction which are Declassified may
38:03 have participated in these fires now
38:07 could it have happened from a satellite
38:09 in space maybe but it probably a lot
38:12 easier just to strafe a neighborhood
38:15 with a plane that's got one of these you
38:17 know fire starters on the front but I
38:21 want to remind you that you know there's
38:24 a lot of the there's a lot of citizens
38:28 of the world who in their 60s and over
38:31 they have to read a newspaper with a
38:34 magnifying glass right now if you said
38:38 hey grandpa grandma can I see your fire
38:41 starter they're gonna go what are you
38:43 talking about your fire started right
38:46 there what this magnifying glass I use
38:49 this to read I don't use this to start
38:51 fires what are you talking about and you
38:54 say oh no check this out and you go
38:56 outside and you hold it in a particular
38:57 way and of course it magnifies and
39:00 concentrates photons and then poof
39:02 there's a fire you can do it with a
39:05 little bit of water and a plastic bottle
39:07 on a bright sunny day in fact there was
39:10 a Japanese drink I just recently learned
39:13 they had made this really crazy looking
39:15 bottle and the problem was that the
39:17 bottle when stored outside immediately
39:20 started creating a magnifying glass
39:21 effect on the ground and on other things
39:24 in the room and they were starting fires
39:27 and so they had to change the bottle
39:28 shape which i think is just what a
39:30 fascinating mistake right so you could
39:34 have military equipment that's charter
39:37 and intention its primary use is not to
39:41 start fires but it will
39:43 and so they just use it for the wrong
39:46 purpose but there are photographs out
39:49 there that suggest that they have
39:51 captured you know rays from the sky
39:56 coming down right where fires have
39:59 become extremely intense now in some
40:02 cases you'll get the fire cyclones that
40:04 are just natural because there's such a
40:06 difference between the temperature of a
40:08 fire and the surrounding wind that when
40:11 it escapes straight up because that's
40:13 where hot air goes it starts to do the
40:15 tornado thing and they could be just a
40:17 string thin I will tell you that since
40:23 for those of you didn't see the episode
40:26 but those of you who have not dove in
40:29 and I'm telling you don't put your foot
40:31 in
40:32 don't put your toe in just dive straight
40:35 in to agenda21 slash addenda 2030 what a
40:40 listeners reminded me that it's agenda21
40:43 because it is the UN program again
40:47 signed by 179 countries in 1991 so it's
40:51 very 1992 it's very very real but it's
40:54 the agenda for the new 21st century so
40:58 jinda 21 21 means 21st century i had
41:02 misinterpreted that to mean 20 21 but
41:07 they're now calling it 2030 that's only
41:11 10 years away and look what's going on
41:14 they're setting fire to California
41:20 unlike any other place in the Union
41:22 they're setting fire to California like
41:24 crazy they have finally done it two
41:26 years in a row and I think they know
41:30 that they they did an unprecedented
41:33 attack on California in 2018 that
41:37 they're not going to be able to pull off
41:39 again for a little while maybe the
41:43 problem is it's very effective but the
41:46 Paradise fires also happened to burn
41:48 exactly where this high-speed railroad
41:50 was railway was going to go before they
41:52 canceled it and I will tell you that you
41:56 know
41:57 depending on how old you are anytime you
41:59 have these megalithic structures
42:03 prophesized by your government meaning
42:07 we're gonna be hot bill high-speed rail
42:09 especially state government or the
42:14 colliders that they were going to build
42:16 and I think Texas I'm just going to
42:18 build it in Kansas these are honey pots
42:23 / money pits
42:25 for people to make a tremendous amount
42:27 of cash they know that there's very
42:31 little likelihood that these things will
42:34 ever be really made but in order to
42:37 survey the land
42:40 there's attorneys there's armies of
42:42 attorneys the politicians are involved
42:45 they can spin off a little LLC that
42:47 provides some little service and they
42:50 launder one to half a billion dollars
42:54 from the program and by the time they've
42:57 budgeted it they really don't want this
43:00 thing to exist and so they keep
43:01 racketing up the budget thinking well
43:03 jeez if it does pass we're gonna make it
43:05 a hundred times more expensive than we
43:08 said so if we said it was a billion
43:09 dollars to make it'll be a hundred
43:11 billion dollars to make and hey if we
43:13 can convince these saps / California
43:17 citizens to approve this thing then we
43:21 make billions and billions of dollars
43:23 off this but how convenient was it that
43:27 a good 80 percent of the obstruction the
43:30 natural obstruction on the earth was
43:32 burned away in 2018 now what's
43:35 interesting about folks that don't want
43:37 to go down this path they don't want to
43:38 hear that anything could be intentional
43:40 I liken it to people who want to go
43:47 online and you know talk about how their
43:51 friend or family member has got cancer
43:55 but if you go to them with cancer cures
43:58 that have worked for all of your family
44:00 and friends they don't want to hear
44:02 anything about it because what they
44:04 really want is for you to feel sorry for
44:07 them because you're feeling sorry for
44:09 your friend
44:10 I am so sorry this is happening to you
44:12 oh that's what they want they don't let
44:15 solutions I had this experience I'm just
44:20 a further this I dated two different
44:23 girls in one year and the first girl had
44:30 her very close friend come down with
44:33 stage four cancer was given like I don't
44:36 know three or four months to live no
44:37 more than six months though
44:39 so she says help me my friend needs to
44:42 live and I said great
44:45 here's your b-17 slash bottom and C
44:48 regiment stop eating meat stop eating
44:51 sugar
44:52 this woman was completely clear of all
44:56 cancer with no chemotherapy and four
45:00 months and she's living a wonderful life
45:02 to this day but she went home one day
45:06 like March of 2015
45:09 excuse me and thought that her whole
45:12 life was gonna end that now she's fine
45:15 the next girl a date in fact it was the
45:20 next two they had their you know very
45:24 close friends come down with cancer the
45:28 first of these other two sat on our sofa
45:32 and I heard about this and I look at her
45:34 and she knows who I am in terms of the
45:36 show and everything and she said
45:37 literally to my face and don't tell me
45:40 about any of these cures so I broke up
45:45 with her and I watched her on Facebook
45:49 literally extort emotions out of
45:51 everyone else for the next year while
45:53 her friend was struggling to cure cancer
45:55 with chemotherapy and eventually died
45:59 wasn't even Stage four when she found it
46:02 it's [ __ ] weird second girlfriend
46:06 just as we were breaking up she said my
46:11 you know my best friend came down with
46:12 cancer you know one of my best friends
46:14 that it up so I'm looking at her I'm not
46:18 getting that full rejection as I did
46:19 from the previous girlfriend but
46:22 definitely she knows I've
46:24 said at dinner several times the story
46:27 of other people that we worked with it
46:29 got cured from cancer she doesn't want
46:33 to hear it there's something [ __ ]
46:35 weird and defective in people's brains
46:37 about finding out the cause and
46:40 solutions to things it's as if the world
46:45 is a bunch of drama queens and the
46:48 second you report that you're dying your
46:52 friends start to almost trade you on the
46:55 stock market of sad emotions so they can
46:58 get some attention to their life right
47:00 it's almost the antithesis of somebody
47:03 who meets you know they make friends
47:07 with Steven Tyler or Tom Cruise or Brad
47:11 Pitt or whatever famous person you can
47:14 name that turns you on and you make
47:16 friends with them you get to see them
47:18 maybe once every quarter maybe once a
47:20 month tops but then you use all the
47:23 downtime to trim it to name-drop right
47:25 to say oh I know this person well you
47:27 know I was over Brad Pitt's house I did
47:28 it oh really oh my god let me get you a
47:30 free beer don't know it's it's a similar
47:33 algorithm to that except it's more sick
47:35 and the mind so as sick as this sounds I
47:40 assure you there are people out there
47:41 that don't want the fires to stop they
47:44 love it they love going to Facebook and
47:46 talking about how you lost your life
47:49 either you lost your real life your
47:53 heart beating life or you lost
47:54 everything you own some people you know
47:58 like to mark themselves safe on Facebook
48:01 that turns them on now it's probably the
48:05 minority group of people that behave
48:07 like this where everyone else would do
48:09 anything to pray it away to make sure
48:11 their friends don't have any issues but
48:14 what they have done the globalists in my
48:17 opinion has they have slowly increased
48:20 what you think is normal
48:23 I've been on this earth for 50 years I
48:27 had never heard of a tsunami in my life
48:31 until 2004 when the Indonesian
48:35 earthquake happened and killed 280,000
48:37 people and all the different coastal
48:41 regions you know where these the tsunami
48:42 hit and then wouldn't you know it right
48:45 after that Chile had a bunch of tsunamis
48:47 and then everyone has tsunamis all of a
48:49 sudden and then what do we have in March
48:52 11 2011 a bunch of 11s Fukushima one of
49:00 the most bizarre events to ever occur
49:02 and I have watched hours and hours of
49:05 the Fukushima footage and it's a
49:08 gut-wrenching mind-blowing thing but now
49:13 we are you know supposed to believe that
49:19 California is gonna suffer one massive
49:22 devastating fire after another but there
49:25 doesn't seem to be any problem finding
49:26 mysterious events around the causes of
49:31 the fire you know one of the he's
49:34 probably two degrees away from me
49:36 because he's a mutual friend of he's a
49:39 first-degree friend of a first-degree
49:41 person to me he said that he woke up I
49:46 can't remember exactly where he was in
49:48 the fires oh no I know where he was he
49:50 was up in Calistoga area he said he woke
49:56 up and looked at his window and he saw a
50:05 fire as far away as he could see it
50:09 which is probably about half a mile to a
50:11 mile away
50:13 he's like oh my god this thing's right
50:15 on me heard about some fires didn't know
50:18 was that damn close to me so he rushes
50:21 downstairs runs outside does he's
50:26 grabbed a few items trying to put it in
50:28 his car he said by the time I went back
50:31 in which is just seconds later he said
50:34 this fire was in his backyard and his
50:36 house was starting to burn and all he
50:39 wanted to do was go into the kitchen
50:40 table and grab his laptop which I
50:42 believe he successfully did because I'm
50:46 sitting there in my kitchen and I can
50:47 see that my the side of my house on the
50:49 back is now on fire
50:51 here's the catch for that little
50:53 situation because you might think well
50:54 that's what fires do he's in a desert
50:58 community without forests without
51:01 anything that's really burning not like
51:05 the Malibu Hills which has a lot of
51:06 green and dried out you know vegetation
51:10 that just keeps you know burning and
51:12 burning we watched that on TV so this
51:14 was like desert cement wall it's like
51:17 living in Vegas if you live on the edge
51:18 of Vegas there's areas with no
51:20 vegetation but he says he's got you know
51:24 a full-length swimming pool like a big
51:28 one square with a brick wall in the back
51:31 no vegetation the chairs and what have
51:35 you around the pool and then his house
51:38 nothing significant to either side but
51:42 this fire had jumped over nothing that
51:45 was flammable fact it wouldn't run over
51:48 a pool no problem and his houses on fire
51:52 it's as if the air itself having nothing
51:56 to burn carried a flame level ignition
52:01 temperature to his home which is made of
52:05 stucco by the way and it was on fire guy
52:08 lost his house you want to tell me that
52:13 a military weapon or some deep state
52:17 weapon hidden inside some alphabet
52:20 Agency is out of the question
52:24 well if you're familiar with Ockham's
52:26 razor where you throw out everything
52:28 that makes no sense and whatever is left
52:30 is what you have to accept but I would
52:33 say this is a perfect candidate for a
52:38 weapon a mechanical device that is
52:42 passing out the fire now of course once
52:44 you started it just does what it does
52:47 if these explosions that we think were
52:50 caught on the radar in this last batch
52:52 of 2019 are real then all you do is you
52:56 pick areas I mean the Forest Commission
52:58 and the fire departments around the
53:00 world know what areas are the most
53:02 susceptible to burn so you just go
53:04 straight
53:05 out to those zones put the little
53:07 backpack out there it's gonna pop and
53:09 burn and then let it do its thing then
53:14 all you have to do is delay your
53:16 response to give it a nice opportunity
53:18 to go and again from the sea Sgt Sgt
53:22 reports the flames the the fireball that
53:26 looks like it came out from this
53:27 explosion must have been really big and
53:31 I mean like as big as a city block sort
53:34 of explosion they want us out of the
53:37 rural areas of the world compacted into
53:41 cities where surveillance will be 3,000
53:46 percent to what it is today you will not
53:49 be able to do anything in this world
53:51 without permission and if you think oh
53:55 well you're exaggerating it's like okay
53:58 and wait till your water quotient is so
54:02 low that you worry about urinating you
54:06 worry about using your toilet you worry
54:09 about how long you're in the shower you
54:11 worry worry worry 24/7 because the only
54:15 commodity in the future if a Jena 21
54:17 gets its way is neighbour telling on
54:20 neighbor that's where you're gonna get
54:22 your extra credit to get a little extra
54:24 money the lecture stuff and then they're
54:28 just gonna you know depending on what
54:30 kind of neighbors you have but
54:31 everyone's gonna be feral and weird
54:33 they're gonna make up stuff about you
54:35 and if you are so much as hanging on to
54:39 your sovereignty which is what America
54:43 is all about you try to hang on to any
54:45 of that old thinking but you're screwed
54:49 you're the first want to be liquidated
54:51 and everyone's gonna profit off your
54:53 liquidation now we've had Wars since
54:58 man's been on this planet right because
55:00 we are yet to achieve anything but an
55:02 inferior final state of mental capacity
55:06 and thinking but at least in the past
55:10 under most circumstances for the several
55:15 tens of thousands of years up to this
55:17 last century
55:19 when we were at war you knew we were at
55:22 war you knew you were being attacked
55:25 someone declares war on you they bomb
55:28 your area you bomb them back I mean you
55:30 know whatever you surrender you get
55:31 genocided whatever but least you knew
55:33 what was going on today's game is to war
55:40 against the United States of America
55:42 Europe's already lost the war all right
55:45 the European Union is a declared failure
55:48 for Europe they've lost Britain is
55:54 trying to dig themselves out of that
55:56 loss by getting out of the European
55:58 Union and if you still think the
56:01 European Union's good then you are de
56:03 facto a very impressionable gullible
56:05 person who doesn't understand the
56:08 slightest thing about agenda21
56:10 about how bankers have tortured the
56:13 planet for years you seem to have
56:15 completely forgotten why America exists
56:17 because tyranny was so bad in Europe
56:19 that our forefathers escaped then took
56:22 the place away from those who funded it
56:24 which were the tyrannical monarchs of
56:27 Europe who wanted to conquer America for
56:30 their own tyrannical rule we used the
56:33 advantage of the Atlantic Ocean and the
56:35 lack of technology to stick it to him no
56:39 we still had President Hamilton who was
56:41 a piece of [ __ ] who continued to sign us
56:43 back up to a world banking system as
56:45 results of the 1812 war we had skull and
56:51 bones in here in 1830s Jackson president
56:56 jackson defeats him for a little while
56:58 but they won again with the 16th
57:00 amendment in 1913 it's been war and in
57:07 most cases we're totally unaware of the
57:09 war doesn't matter how many brilliant
57:13 politicians brilliant philosophers
57:15 brilliant professors out there who write
57:17 books about the cabal that write books
57:20 about how the war is going and how we're
57:22 losing it and if we pass this particular
57:23 thing we've lost everything and of
57:26 course the [ __ ] population of the
57:27 world who doesn't believe in anything
57:30 negative right they can't conceive
57:32 of evil they just continue to grab the
57:36 tail in front of them this is why
57:39 there's been such a dramatic change in
57:42 America from say the 70s and the 80s
57:45 where every individual thought it was
57:48 their obligation to be unique again I
57:52 said it in a previous episode that's
57:53 gonna sound like a silly analogy but
57:55 think about it roll back any footage
57:58 that you know that's legit from the 80s
58:00 and 70s especially like Soul Train the
58:03 theater those dance offs right where
58:04 they walk down they dance down the line
58:06 now I want you to stop the video the
58:11 second that this occurs one of two
58:14 things occurs one as they're dancing
58:16 down the center of that line two people
58:19 dance exactly the same that are in two
58:21 different groups
58:22 it never happens why because the name of
58:27 the game was to come up with your own
58:28 unique dance when you came down that
58:30 aisle to stop the video when you see two
58:34 people wearing exactly the same clothing
58:37 that never happens because we were
58:40 supposed to think original and create
58:42 things that persisted all the way
58:45 through the 80s until we got to the 90s
58:49 and I don't know if it's the vaccinated
58:51 era of kids I don't know what the hell
58:53 the deal is but everyone started
58:54 dressing exactly the same this last ten
58:57 years like ten years ago was the huge
58:59 millennial grow a beard get a mustache
59:02 you know crank it up wax it up whatever
59:04 you got to do and be a hipster but dress
59:09 exactly the same look exactly the same
59:11 as everybody else that's the name of the
59:14 game now is conformity all right
59:17 why was Mussolini bad again something
59:22 called fascism wasn't that bad because
59:26 once you get everybody to think exactly
59:28 the same then all you have to do is drop
59:29 in the pill of indoctrination and just
59:32 like a chemical reaction where the water
59:34 is clear the chemical is clear and all
59:36 sudden whap it turns black that's what
59:40 will happen the state of California is
59:43 under economic
59:45 attack from the leftist extremist
59:49 globalist socialist fascist politicians
59:57 I don't know what Hollywood's problem is
60:00 I think Hollywood perhaps may just have
60:02 very impressionable people I know very
60:05 famous people who are staunch
60:08 Republicans and I know that the
60:11 extremist folks that I know are just
60:14 sweet people who aren't that intelligent
60:18 they just aren't but because they've
60:21 been on television and they've been
60:23 rewarded to the point where they can't
60:25 go to Venice Beach or the grocery store
60:27 without getting mobbed by fans they get
60:32 the God syndrome right everything I
60:35 touch turns to gold so as long as I can
60:38 adopt a philosophy of how the world
60:40 should work that sounds good that sounds
60:43 good that they don't know anything about
60:45 history they definitely don't know
60:47 anything about corruption in the history
60:48 of corruption so they just keep selling
60:52 us down the line they have tons of money
60:55 they think every illegal immigrant slash
60:58 undocumented citizen should move into
61:02 California and get free free free free
61:04 but if you actually were to go up to
61:05 them and say they're gonna live in your
61:06 house they're gonna use all of your
61:08 money from your bank accounts because
61:10 you shouldn't have that much money
61:11 remember because that's the whole Bernie
61:13 Sanders way the 1% telling you how you
61:15 should live it wouldn't do it but they
61:19 know they don't have to so they get the
61:21 virtue signal and this whole process
61:23 continues we'll the fires continue I'm
61:29 gonna say yes they're going to continue
61:32 until somebody with some balls and some
61:35 money starts to investigate this thing
61:38 with legal repercussions it's
61:41 interesting that again entire
61:43 neighborhoods that I'm gonna be flashing
61:44 photos up on this entire neighborhoods
61:47 melted to the ground with shrubbery
61:50 right next to the homes that are not
61:52 burned at all well what's the official
61:54 cause of those homes burning down
61:58 because the trees caught on fire and a
62:03 tree then burned over to another tree
62:05 into a bush into a house and then then
62:07 all the houses caught each other on fire
62:11 mm-hmm one of the defense mechanisms of
62:14 a friend of mine was that they said
62:17 because rich people in Malibu lost homes
62:20 then this can't be a conspiracy I don't
62:25 get that at all
62:26 think about what you're saying if you
62:27 say that a bunch of people with just you
62:30 know a fixed income they've managed to
62:34 nest-egg their home out there in
62:36 Paradise or other locations that's all
62:40 the money they have they've got a
62:42 balanced thing going they lose their
62:45 homes they don't get a chance just to
62:48 rebuild and even if they could it'll
62:49 take a year or two to get the insurance
62:51 to pay for the new home and then once
62:54 you have to suck the tit of an insurance
62:57 company well they could put all kinds of
62:59 mandates down about your rebuilding
63:00 process we can't build that kind of home
63:02 you got to build this kind of home and
63:03 we're not going to give you quite enough
63:05 money to build the one that we're
63:06 mandating or the state moves in now
63:10 let's go back to the Paradise fire and
63:12 talk about some other rumored causes
63:15 PG&E takes care of all the power up in
63:18 those regions there are videos where the
63:21 the power meter on the side of the house
63:24 was overcharged caught on fire and was
63:28 burning on the side of the house what a
63:31 brilliant way to start a big massive
63:33 fire just overload the circuits this
63:36 thing is bolted to your house you can't
63:38 pull it off you can't use water because
63:42 it's an electrical fire let's say you've
63:44 got one of those you know white
63:46 electrical fire extinguishers well you
63:50 empty it out on the wall but since the
63:52 power company continues to overcharge
63:54 the wire it continues burning after your
63:57 after your extinguishers empty so for
64:01 those of you aren't paying attention or
64:03 you don't live in America at all but it
64:06 ended up happening I believe what this
64:08 is completely correct because we watched
64:11 hours and hours of it
64:12 my lounge PG&E was sued for not taking
64:20 care of wire supposedly some other kind
64:22 of cover story never never brought into
64:25 court for these power meters overloading
64:28 and burning person's house down there's
64:30 videos of this right but on the backside
64:33 what they did because imagine the deep
64:35 state controls the power company for
64:39 sure right it's what we use electricity
64:40 in the first place
64:41 generated from all their bad sources
64:44 again we didn't choose coal nuclear
64:48 natural gas we didn't choose any of this
64:50 stuff this stuff was chosen for us but
64:52 who gets the guilt trip for using it we
64:54 do it's their choice
64:56 it was the bank's choice Tesla was gonna
64:57 give it away for free all right okay
65:00 just remember that PG&E then was
65:04 rewarded with a state tax meaning we get
65:10 taxed as the citizens and the money goes
65:12 to PG&E to help them rebuild hmm so
65:18 imagine that boardroom meeting some deep
65:20 state boardroom meeting
65:22 okay here's what we're gonna do you know
65:24 we build this high speed rail so it's
65:28 gonna take us 20 years to eminent domain
65:30 everything it's gonna be bloody and
65:32 messy so we're gonna do is we're gonna
65:34 use this array of equipment and these
65:36 techniques bombs directed-energy weapons
65:40 whatever to set a bunch of the fires but
65:45 you're gonna help us out by overloading
65:47 the power grid for each one of these
65:49 homes causing fires and everyone with
65:51 the homes and then we'll strafe it and
65:53 melt them all down yeah be genies like
65:57 whoa Jesus we're gonna have a banjee
65:58 lawsuit if that happens and they say
66:00 don't worry about it you're gonna take
66:01 that one on the chin but as a reward for
66:04 serving the deep state and agenda21
66:07 we're gonna tax the California citizens
66:12 and you're gonna make all that money
66:13 backs don't even worry about it the
66:15 attacks would be awesome just like a
66:17 9/11 tax right years and years after
66:20 9/11 is done we're still paying taxes on
66:22 our telephones and our utilities for
66:25 9/11
66:26 it's like when they built the Golden
66:28 Gate Bridge they created a tax to go
66:31 across the bridge a toll what was the
66:34 toll for to pay for the bridge but just
66:37 like every bridge in the United States
66:38 of America the second they pay for the
66:40 bridge they double the fee and give it
66:43 to the state which then pays for the
66:46 salaries of the deep state and any
66:49 agenda they need to green-light right
66:52 it's phenomenal it's been going on
66:55 forever but no one has any problem in in
66:59 San Francisco I think the fee is now if
67:02 five or six bucks made me more net but
67:05 it's like five or six bucks to cross the
67:06 Golden Gate Bridge one way what if you
67:09 lived in San Rafael and you worked in
67:10 the tip of San Francisco ten bucks a day
67:17 to go to work
67:19 we'll see you work 20 days a month
67:21 that's $200 it comes out of your pay
67:25 just across the bridge no one says
67:28 anything corruption just keeps going no
67:32 one says anything so now we have fires
67:35 from 2019 and let's work out the
67:37 chronology of the situation what was the
67:41 weird thing that happened the couple
67:43 days before the fire I was there it was
67:47 a few weeks ago you were there too PG&E
67:51 announces that they are going to cut off
67:53 power to up to 800,000 residents in
67:58 Northern America because there was a
67:59 fire scare all right
68:03 seems like you know you can piece that
68:06 together in your brain it makes some
68:07 sense until you start you really think
68:12 about it
68:13 the fire started within 48 hours and it
68:16 started on that satellite photograph so
68:19 PG&E figured out a way to coordinate
68:22 with the attack say they've shut off
68:25 power it's not us man it's not us we're
68:28 gonna get we're not gonna get another
68:29 lawsuit so they turn off the power by
68:34 the way some poor gentlemen died in 12
68:35 minutes in his home because he had an
68:37 oxygen machine that he needed
68:39 to live so they are directly responsible
68:43 for death by turning off the power in
68:47 sane some people don't have families
68:50 people some people don't have friends
68:53 some people don't live in hospice yet
68:54 because they don't need to but they do
68:56 have oxygen machines that that need to
68:58 be on to keep them alive and they don't
69:01 potentially hear all the news they don't
69:05 have the ability to just make a phone
69:09 call and say oh I heard you're shutting
69:11 off my power well I need this to live
69:12 could you bring out a generator they
69:15 never get the news and then all of a
69:17 sudden they're suffocating to death
69:20 inside their house seemingly out of thin
69:23 air
69:24 what happens the fires start within 48
69:27 hours and then the residents of
69:31 California are obviously pissed because
69:32 they have no power and they call and
69:37 demand the power to be turned back on
69:40 now you've taken you've literally
69:42 scapegoated around the orchestrated
69:45 disaster legally and now you could turn
69:47 the power back on because you can cite
69:49 that the people demanded that that was
69:51 the case and I it's funny because I was
69:55 recording a show about a week ago and I
69:59 noticed that the palm tree that's not on
70:02 camera back here but it's it's back
70:04 against this back wall I heard this
70:07 sizzling noise and I thought at first it
70:10 was the insects the the yellowjacket
70:14 scraping off some of the wood off this
70:16 awning to build their nest which is what
70:17 they do it's like this little scratchy
70:20 kind of noise but the scratchy noise
70:23 wasn't the wasp it was the the palm tree
70:27 is up there touching the main power line
70:29 it's now burned away enough that it
70:31 doesn't touch it anymore but I called PG
70:34 an accident because I I kept hearing
70:36 PG&E in my brain I forgot I'm on Edison
70:39 grid a totally different company but I
70:42 listened to the 1-800 message and as of
70:47 what three or four days ago you couldn't
70:49 contact anyone at PG&E because they are
70:52 so overwhelmed
70:53 by the fires and the demands for power
70:55 they literally literally said you know
70:57 we can't talk to you right now
71:00 call back later go to the website now
71:03 I'm gonna bumper this episode at the end
71:06 with this reminder if you're into the
71:12 truth and the Great Awakening then you
71:16 hear this stuff and I'm preaching to the
71:17 choir it pisses you off but you know
71:22 this is very viable and possible right
71:25 and I'm just bringing you the aggregated
71:30 beliefs of several citizens that have
71:35 had their houses burned down in
71:36 California as far as jinda 21 that's
71:39 fact
71:40 really sorry that was signed in 1992 and
71:44 it is go follow Rosa Corey KO ir e I
71:51 think it's a way she spells the last
71:52 name but it's in my agenda 21 episode
71:54 and which i think is 427 the references
72:00 are in the description in that video but
72:02 that's extremely real and their
72:04 objective is to accomplish what these
72:07 fires are accomplishing that's fact
72:10 whether or not it's truly conspiracy I
72:13 don't know but the one thing we always
72:15 get from people that can't conceive of
72:19 evil is we get the accusation that
72:23 somehow all this turns us on that we
72:25 love it and I will tell you that you
72:30 know I debated even making this episode
72:32 because I don't like to have to bring
72:34 you negative fear-mongering sort of
72:38 subjects I don't like doing that and one
72:42 of the big reasons I don't like to be a
72:43 part of that is well it's probably two
72:45 reasons one there are definitely tons of
72:48 channels out there on YouTube that have
72:50 reported on the fires with a video proof
72:53 of everything that I've said - maybe
72:57 being able to prove or the beam from
72:58 space comes from and some of those
73:00 videos some of those pictures are
73:02 actually misinterpretations I will admit
73:05 that
73:05 the houses don't burn down - why - right
73:09 next to a bush it's perfectly green but
73:13 all the bushes in the entire
73:14 neighborhood of that we're up against
73:15 the homes are completely fine now a
73:18 bunch of trees did burn and luckily
73:20 they'll most likely survive so I think
73:24 you have other outlets you can go to but
73:28 if you are a hardcore listener of deep
73:30 thoughts you know that my belief system
73:33 is is that there is a law of attraction
73:35 and law of attraction is pretty generic
73:40 if you sit in a constant state of acidic
73:45 thought that you believe the world is
73:47 against you that there are these type of
73:49 conspiracies that can destroy your life
73:52 then you will you may if you can't find
73:57 a some sort of oasis inside your mind to
74:02 go after you have those thoughts you
74:04 might attract some more negativity to
74:08 yourself I don't want that for you
74:11 but as I always say you know we got to
74:14 have skin in the game because the [ __ ]
74:15 is real and if we put our head in the
74:18 sand because we don't want to deal with
74:19 these conspiracies then we lose
74:23 everything
74:25 who would have ever thought okay let me
74:29 put this to you who would have ever
74:31 thought that Europe would give up Europe
74:36 who would ever thought was born in
74:38 Germany I've always had a fantasy of you
74:42 know going back over there and chilling
74:43 out and seeing my homeland you know
74:46 where all my family came from and now I
74:49 know that if I go back and especially
74:50 was talking to my friends that go over
74:52 there routinely for business it is
74:55 slowly melting away the culture is
74:59 melting away
75:00 they have been duped and then who would
75:04 have ever thought that we would have
75:07 complete globalist Invaders become
75:11 Congress people house representatives
75:14 and senators and presidents
75:17 who would have ever thought that we'd
75:19 have sellouts left and right you know
75:22 john mccain's who go over and form Isis
75:26 remember his buddy Kasich on scene and
75:28 said well it's been 24 hours since John
75:30 McCain was put to death and later on his
75:33 daughter on the view said well you can't
75:34 kill my dad twice kill put to death
75:39 what so to the closest people to John
75:42 McCain no the most likely was put to
75:47 death for his treason istic Isis
75:50 behavior what is it Nancy Pelosi and her
75:54 whole group went over there to the
75:57 Middle East and at about 72 hours later
76:01 Trump kills that Baghdady guy then
76:06 number two is killed within 24 hours
76:09 maybe those things are combined maybe
76:11 their Pelosi is going over there to
76:13 reform Isis because John McCain's out of
76:15 the picture and then Trump goes boom not
76:19 on my watch oh you got a number two boom
76:22 not on my watch who's number three
76:25 imagine you're perceived as number three
76:27 would you come out to the world and go
76:29 hey man I don't have anything to do with
76:31 this place don't kill me so love him or
76:34 hate him once you look at the objectives
76:38 of agenda 21 and you look at what Trump
76:42 is doing for the United States of
76:43 America he is literally undoing
76:46 everything that has been done since 1992
76:50 remember 1992 was when America got NAFTA
76:54 so you pass this agenda 21 resolution
76:59 for a hundred and seventy-nine countries
77:01 again I can't name 175 countries and
77:03 then immediately we get rid of all of
77:06 our jobs in America at least the sucking
77:08 sound that Ross Perot talked about
77:10 starts to occur so it takes 20 years Mel
77:14 really yeah probably about 20 years
77:18 because the fires in 2003 were probably
77:20 more budgetary than agenda 21 but they
77:23 know the race is on because they know
77:25 the Internet has awakened a beast and
77:27 that beast is called humanity
77:29 freedom sovereignty in a liberal rights
77:33 that you get because you exist as a
77:35 human being you know how many times did
77:39 you did you read in school that class
77:41 structure it was a horrible way to run
77:43 the world England had massive class
77:45 structure meaning the rich are up there
77:49 and they're better than you and you're a
77:51 peasant down below but there's all kinds
77:53 of layers of all that if you really want
77:55 to get into it and we all unanimously
77:58 agree that's not the way to run the
78:00 world how many people go to church every
78:03 single Sunday okay and they talk about
78:07 how we're all made equal the class
78:13 structure says absolutely opposite of
78:16 that okay then what are you doing do you
78:22 go to church and say we're all equal
78:24 then you look at the world and you get
78:25 freaked out then you get into these
78:27 events and you start to parse reality
78:30 and go WOW wait a minute sure looks like
78:33 the globalists are making the last play
78:35 in ten years then what this thing
78:38 finished Georgia Guidestones
78:41 I'm just gonna remind you guys they want
78:44 to reduce world population to 500
78:46 million which is about a ninety six
78:48 percent reduction in world population
78:51 that's seven billion people gone off
78:54 this planet alright that's if they want
78:59 to start at the maximum allocation if I
79:01 go anywhere below that you're starting
79:03 to rise to 97 98 99 percent now the
79:08 truth is I'm just one guy in a backyard
79:09 with some observations and opinions
79:12 about those observations but if I have a
79:16 thousand people watch this video then
79:19 you are every profession on planet Earth
79:22 you are in potentially circles that
79:26 could make a difference you might be a
79:30 wife of a husband who is involved in
79:33 this kind of stuff whether they know it
79:35 or not they're involved in it maybe they
79:37 even just defend it maybe your husband
79:40 of someone
79:41 that could make a difference maybe
79:43 you're a brother or a sister or mother
79:46 or a father or a child of someone who's
79:50 participating in this either nefariously
79:53 and intentionally or not or perhaps you
79:58 have the vocational skills you're a
80:01 firefighter you're a forced person
80:05 you're an electrician you put up power
80:08 lines and you may have fought your whole
80:11 life while man I just got this crappy
80:13 job I just put up power lines whoo wait
80:16 a minute you're the expert that we need
80:18 your job really makes a difference
80:20 perhaps you used to do that and now
80:22 you're doing something else and you can
80:23 take back on your on your education and
80:26 your experience and go wait a minute
80:28 that doesn't make any sense but that is
80:30 what happened that doesn't make any
80:31 sense there's a famous video during the
80:35 Paradise fires where the fire department
80:39 from Berkeley went north to help put out
80:42 the fires and when they got there they
80:44 ran video of what they saw and they said
80:48 unequivocally on camera they had never
80:51 seen anything like this ever in the
80:54 history of their career so some B's guys
80:55 been on that detail for 20 years now I
80:59 do unprecedented things happen every
81:01 once in a while do forest fires happen
81:02 that are miraculous and devastating sure
81:06 absolutely
81:07 but do the laws of physics get broken
81:11 easily no and the laws of physics that
81:18 we're talking about is a natural forest
81:20 fire accomplishing temperatures that
81:24 forest fires never achieve if you think
81:28 within this class structure that the top
81:31 echelon classes that we have allowed to
81:33 exist because we like royalty
81:36 we like rich people if you think for a
81:40 second that they believe the people
81:42 below them are their equals and that
81:44 they need to protect them I just want to
81:50 say you're sadly mistaken you know part
81:53 of it is
81:55 imagine someone who's considers
81:57 themselves whether or not they actually
81:59 are not who knows whether the upper
82:03 echelon of the system and let's say
82:07 maybe they're part of Jena 21 maybe
82:09 they're not let's say they're not makes
82:13 it even easier but they go to San
82:16 Francisco and they see the place covered
82:18 in homeless people and feces Oh what do
82:22 you think they're thinking in their head
82:23 this is great I mean if the Djinn of 21
82:26 and then they're like yeah the plan is
82:28 working these people are all gonna move
82:29 out of San Francisco it's gonna be great
82:32 or whatever laws we're gonna pass
82:34 they're gonna help the agenda21 take
82:36 over but I can tell you from my own
82:39 circles my own travels anytime someone
82:41 rich has to stand in line with people
82:44 that aren't rich what's going through
82:46 their mind and what they utter and what
82:48 they comment about either when they're
82:49 getting home or out loud to a friend as
82:52 how they would love for this line did
82:54 not exist they just want it for
82:57 themselves right I'll just say in
83:00 closing that you know in past history
83:02 it's I think the number is like four
83:04 percent any war that's ever been fought
83:07 to save a particular region of the world
83:09 from oppression has been fought by four
83:12 percent of its population I think that
83:13 number comes out of the Revolution that
83:16 we fought here in America which lasted a
83:20 long time right I think most people
83:23 realize that the the war of 1812 is
83:26 really where the revolution stopped to
83:28 be honest with the Internet we have a
83:32 chance of making that a deep double
83:35 digit percentage 10 15 20 30 40 percent
83:41 of the population waking up to these
83:43 agendas and fighting back now will we
83:46 ever find you know a recording of these
83:48 meetings and put people in jail and
83:52 they're probably not but what you want
83:55 to do when what you can do from your
83:57 living room just watching videos
83:58 becoming educated and then perhaps
84:00 posting online which you're willing to
84:02 tolerate is that you're not going to
84:04 tolerate these outrageous situations
84:07 that are so
84:08 to you as if this stuff is just it just
84:12 happens right
84:13 these one-in-a-million natural disasters
84:16 start to become every two or three years
84:18 and the California it's now every year
84:22 and so when they strategize in their
84:26 little meeting rooms to push the next
84:29 phase of their agenda they can't they
84:34 don't have as many options let's put it
84:35 that way they know it they're like well
84:37 we can't do that everybody knows about
84:38 overloading power meters on houses we
84:42 can't do that one anymore we can't do
84:45 the explosions out in the forest unless
84:47 we commandeer the satellite footage to
84:49 make sure those frames aren't recorded
84:51 which they might so back when I had the
84:55 show MKULTRA radio before we change
84:58 presidents before we had we call the
85:00 Great Awakening before cue and I never
85:02 woke anyone up people used to email me
85:06 all the time and say well what can I do
85:07 I feel like I'm I'm completely helpless
85:09 from participating in this situation and
85:14 what we said back then and the answers
85:17 to everyone who said such a thing was
85:19 get educated about everything that's
85:23 your first step your second step is to
85:27 go inside your brain and tinker with
85:29 your threshold of belief and where you
85:33 can't conceive of something being
85:34 extremely negative and extremely hostile
85:37 towards humanity you need to erase those
85:40 little blockers in your brain so that
85:42 you can get over the precipice and see
85:44 what they're actually doing to humanity
85:47 and I'll give you an analogy how many of
85:51 you read the news about these pedophile
85:54 rings and these famous people these
85:58 famous people involved with this stuff
86:00 from billionaires to celebrities getting
86:04 caught with child pornography perhaps
86:07 even getting charged with the actual
86:09 crime of touching a child and you read
86:12 those articles and your brain is like
86:14 going through some weird moment where
86:18 you're like I can't even conceive
86:21 personally of having a fascination with
86:24 such material I can't perceive a human
86:28 being that would touch a child in a
86:31 inappropriate way the scarring them for
86:33 life or you know in extreme cases taking
86:38 their lives right
86:39 you can't perceive of it and yet in
86:43 almost every single town in the world
86:46 these people exist and the Internet has
86:49 allowed them to hide on the dark web and
86:51 have these little websites that go to to
86:53 exchange materials we've had a record
86:56 amount of arrests in the United States
86:59 since Donald Trump's been president and
87:00 he signed an executive order that said
87:02 if you're involved with any of this
87:04 stuff we're gonna seize all of your
87:06 assets and then within a few days in
87:09 fact I think it was signed on a Saturday
87:11 or Sunday and Eric Schmidt resigns as
87:16 CEO of Google who was known for having
87:19 used the company jet to have at least
87:22 teenage parties on his plane that's the
87:25 rumor anyway but his it's a fact that he
87:28 resigned right after that executive
87:30 order went through why would he do such
87:31 a thing
87:32 you're the CEO of one of the most
87:34 powerful companies in the world and you
87:36 just up and quit you know so you got to
87:40 get your brain out of the idealistic
87:43 view of the world now keep that view of
87:48 the world as your destination as the
87:49 goal and then if you have the power to
87:53 conceive of a wonderful world then ask
87:56 yourself why we're not in it right now
87:58 what is keeping us from having the gene
88:01 Roddenberry Star Trek world where it's
88:03 perfect socialism because everyone is so
88:06 educated that there is no greed there's
88:09 no need for it there's no money in the
88:10 future and Gene Roddenberry's world my
88:14 hope if we could ever get our education
88:15 up to that point then perhaps we could
88:17 entertain such a world but we know our
88:20 education is horrible and so we can't
88:23 have it anyway a lot of food for
88:26 thoughts very interested in your
88:29 responses for those of you who have
88:32 jump down the rabbit hole of this you
88:36 know there's tons of videos out there
88:37 that demonstrate virtually everything
88:39 that I've said please take time if
88:42 you're passionate about it to simply
88:44 post in the comment section on YouTube
88:46 other videos that demonstrate this kind
88:49 of stuff be aware that some of the
88:52 channels will be forced to close if they
88:54 start getting real popular some people
88:56 might even get freaked out and delete
88:57 their own videos but let's educate each
89:00 other because that's all we can do at
89:02 this point q and on said one thing
89:04 before he went offline he said you are
89:07 the news so keep going he's right we are
89:12 the news now we got to obviously vet
89:15 each other to make sure that we don't
89:16 have associations with bad organizations
89:19 or we're opportunists that are trying to
89:22 profit from such things let's see what
89:25 we can do to make it dent in this whole
89:26 thing so if we can in this nightmare
89:28 that is agenda21
89:31 start talking about it start getting
89:33 educated about it and again it's it's
89:35 almost if I were I put it to you this
89:38 way if I were to be and Trump shoes for
89:43 say a day to seven days I would sit in
89:49 the Oval Office and address the public
89:51 and I would call out agenda 21 but have
89:55 all my experts sift through the stuff
89:56 and make sure everything I say is
89:58 completely 100% correct but I would then
90:01 announce to the public the United States
90:03 population that in 1982 this thing was
90:05 hatched called agenda 21 and here's
90:08 their objectives boom boom boom boom and
90:10 here's what I've done to undo it boom
90:12 boom boom boom
90:13 but this is what we still need to work
90:15 on as a people I'd get it into the
90:17 common communication of mankind so that
90:21 we could start fighting back because boy
90:23 it will happen overnight
90:24 if anyone formalizes the knowledge of
90:27 this agenda and it will also expose a
90:31 lot of these leftists globalist enemies
90:34 of the state who have infiltrated our
90:36 government Europe man I don't even know
90:40 what you do they held a meeting in 2004
90:42 to review agenda 21 and how
90:46 much progress they've made and how
90:48 they're going to advance their agendas
90:49 and start up in the game it's completely
90:52 an average conversation in the European
90:55 Union so if you're a citizen of Europe
90:58 man you guys are at you're at square one
91:01 and I don't know how many squares there
91:03 are that you need to overcome to get
91:05 this thing to stop but better get on a
91:08 baby because you're gonna lose
91:09 everything that you know is your world I
91:12 mean man if you're thirty years old or
91:14 something and you're living in Europe in
91:17 50 years you'll wonder what planet
91:20 you're on because it it'll be a deep
91:24 state surveillance state which it
91:26 already is kind of but it'll be 50 times
91:28 as bad so anyway if you haven't been to
91:32 deep thoughts radio.com please go it's
91:35 constantly updated as of this recording
91:37 it's completely up-to-date thank god I
91:39 got all that podcast up-to-date 428 is
91:41 the current episode that's out there
91:42 right now but it has two options for
91:46 video bit shoot is another YouTube
91:49 killer which is censorship free I mean
91:53 you're not allowed to probably go up and
91:55 post a bunch of racist stuff but you
91:57 could definitely post what's going on in
91:58 the world without someone gagging you so
92:01 if you don't have a bit shoot account
92:02 you owe it to your world to get a bit
92:05 shoot account currently maybe it
92:06 disappears in the future but currently
92:09 it's going really strong more users the
92:11 better chance they have of succeeding
92:13 rate there's two primary social media I
92:19 just added a third one and that's the
92:21 minds.com website and they're trying to
92:23 kind of go against Facebook it's very
92:26 much like Facebook it's just censorship
92:29 free which is cool so if you want to get
92:31 onto a facebook that's cool I have a
92:33 page up there let's look up deep
92:34 thoughts radio as the name of the
92:36 channel it's up there you have to sign
92:38 up before you can see anything just like
92:40 Facebook but again once you're in it's
92:43 not censored like Facebook of course
92:49 there's the podcast just get on your
92:51 device that you want to podcast from go
92:53 to the website boom click the link it'll
92:54 link up to your software it's great
92:57 there's a few ways to donate to the page
92:59 there's patreon PayPal and then a couple
93:02 products ones the blaze browser and the
93:04 other one is the backup utility
93:06 Backblaze definitely get brave brave
93:10 browser switch the search engine from
93:12 Google to DuckDuckGo and you'll be brave
93:17 browser will keep you from being tracked
93:19 by any of the deep state plus DuckDuckGo
93:22 does not save any metrics on anyone
93:24 searches so you'll be free when you
93:26 search on material and you'll find out
93:27 that you can find a lot of stuff on
93:30 DuckDuckGo that you can't find on Google
93:32 especially videos of mine understand
93:36 that the season one has been unlisted
93:38 from this particular channel it's been
93:40 remastered on a different channel so if
93:41 you want to see episodes one through
93:43 hundred go to the website click on
93:45 season one it'll take you right to the
93:46 channel just subscribe to it so that you
93:49 don't lose it out of your feed no new
93:52 videos will be posted on but at least
93:55 you'll have the link to get back to it a
93:56 lot of good stuff there but until the
93:59 next video take care of yourself and
94:00 someone else and I'll see in the next
94:02 deep thoughts over now
