00:21 [Music]
00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts I realized in the last
00:35 video that it's going to go up tonight
00:38 I was bumping the mic a little bit with
00:41 my foot and I don't hear it but you can
00:43 hear it it's only I really bought like a
00:45 five minute period but haven't done that
00:47 a long time so do apologize if you're a
00:49 little bumps and you like because if
00:51 you're writing your car all those little
00:54 sounds can be really weird
00:56 by the way 494
01:02 whatever happened with the sound it had
01:05 a massive hum on the track so when I
01:07 pulled out the noise it was uh it made
01:11 my voice sound electronic here and there
01:13 so just you're not you're not hearing
01:15 things but that shouldn't happen moving
01:18 forward everybody wants me to talk about
01:21 NASA and I'm always sitting there going
01:23 you know the hell am I going to say it
01:25 you know I don't to go through
01:26 everything I've already said before but
01:30 I recently got a call and I heard a big
01:35 pile of bull Puckey from a friend of
01:39 mine
01:42 and I'm gonna double-blind this a little
01:45 bit but my friend was so excited that
01:49 they had talked to this other person who
01:52 actually you know this person's name
01:54 because this person is rather known I'll
01:58 let you guess this person that they
02:03 talked to essentially claimed that he
02:07 has all the connections in the military
02:11 inside NASA inside all these you know
02:14 deep organizations and that he covered
02:20 the last 100 years of NASA BS
02:26 and the stuff that he told my friend was
02:30 the most asinine crap I've ever heard in
02:32 my life but my friend whatever reason is
02:38 well these weird situations where you
02:40 always tell them the truth and
02:41 everything you always tell them always
02:43 works out and then they get it from
02:44 somebody else and it's completely
02:45 contradictory but because they put on
02:48 such a show which is this guy's whole
02:50 game
02:53 they kept 30 throw out all the stuff
02:55 that you've ever said and he adopt all
02:56 this nutty crazy stuff and he sort of
03:00 disheartening you know my god really
03:01 that's acceptable to someone telling you
03:03 a bunch of lies and when I was
03:06 interviewing my friend back about
03:07 talking his person going well did you
03:09 scan this did yes and that yeah there's
03:10 anything logical was not followed up on
03:14 like big outrageous lies and just
03:17 complete contradictory crap to reality
03:21 that would defy the history that we have
03:24 experienced was not conscious you know
03:28 was not analyzed or whatever and was
03:31 like oh my god I would love to meet this
03:32 dude face-to-face preferably so there's
03:36 not a bunch of like phonecall weirdness
03:38 because if you look someone in the eye
03:40 you know it just changed the atmosphere
03:42 a little bit usually for the positive so
03:46 I'm going to go over some of this stuff
03:47 everything I can remember and then we're
03:49 going to probably venture off into our
03:51 own realm of NASA talk it started off by
03:57 saying that we absolutely did go to the
04:00 moon and these are lowbrow stories
04:04 you've heard before and I've talked
04:05 about him for five years
04:09 and a thing that frustrates me is
04:11 supposedly my friends listen to my
04:13 videos and it's like you have my friend
04:15 really paid attention to my videos
04:17 having the conversation with this
04:19 complete fraud and maybe he believes it
04:22 maybe he totally believes it maybe I
04:23 shouldn't be so critical but it would
04:25 have triggered other questions
04:27 immediately to go yeah yeah I've heard
04:28 that [ __ ] story and you know what
04:33 about this what about that if this is
04:35 true then what about this but the dude
04:39 said that we definitely went to the moon
04:43 because we got to the moon because when
04:45 we when we cease to all the German
04:48 engineering that was going on after
04:50 World War two that we found that they
04:54 had anti-gravity functional anti-gravity
04:57 craft yeah
05:00 the Germans had anti-gravity and they
05:03 lost World War two
05:05 are you serious let me let me ask you
05:07 what do you think would come first
05:09 hmm anti-gravity technology or a nuclear
05:13 bomb which one you think would go first
05:15 right I'm thinking since we don't have
05:18 anti-gravity yet and but we've had the
05:20 bomb for a little while I'm thinking the
05:22 bomb goes first and you know there were
05:24 rumors that you know Hitler was trying
05:26 to come up with some sort of atomic bomb
05:27 he definitely knew about it and his
05:28 engineer his people ended up helping us
05:32 on this end of the deal as well as the
05:35 Russians or whatever but the Russians
05:36 figured it out I think without Operation
05:39 Paperclip we certainly did
05:44 because that was after the war after we
05:46 dropped those bombs okay so when I said
05:50 the questions are my friend will because
05:53 I'm trying to be polite I'm like okay he
05:54 just have your moment I'm not gonna crap
05:56 on your moment you're totally excited
05:57 about a bunch of fraudulent crap
05:59 whatever and I said well then how did
06:02 they lose the war and plain stupid you
06:05 know and
06:08 then I heard my friend make up something
06:11 out of thin air absolutely make it up
06:13 out of thin air saying well they
06:15 probably didn't have that many they
06:17 probably had their supply lines you know
06:20 bombed out and they probably this and
06:22 probably that none of it based the
06:24 conversation with this dude and
06:25 absolutely none of a based on any logic
06:28 right now do I think enter gravity has
06:33 been discovered and figured out oh yeah
06:36 do I think the German said no way
06:39 because they would have probably moved
06:42 forward that technology before anything
06:43 remember the v2 rocket was a rocket it
06:47 wasn't a anti-gravity and I'm gonna
06:49 drive this over to England and hey even
06:51 if you had one ship like that you could
06:55 immediately defeat every single country
06:59 on earth why because you can fly higher
07:02 than everyone else anti-gravity vehicle
07:05 let's go to 80,000 feet nothing we made
07:08 back in those days could go that high I
07:09 don't think we could go 60,000 feet till
07:11 the u2 right so you go 60,000 feet up
07:14 you got one big bomb and hearing you
07:16 just drive it over London make a phone
07:19 call to Church younger look dude we got
07:22 a big bomb I know you don't believe us
07:23 we got a UFO and if you look up maybe
07:26 you'll see it but you can't get to it
07:28 and I might drop this thing around your
07:29 head so I'm gonna do New York next I'm
07:34 gonna do Moscow and st. Petersburg next
07:37 anyone else is messing with us
07:39 everyone's gonna get a little taste this
07:42 and so I need you to pull back I know
07:44 you got a bunch of troops out there just
07:46 ready to take Omaha Beach and blah blah
07:48 blah you're done so don't need much more
07:52 than one but know that the the apex of
07:57 their technology at the time was using
08:00 you know gyroscopes inside the v2 to
08:02 figure out how far to travel so it could
08:04 turn its tip down and nail an actual
08:07 target in England instead of the
08:09 arbitrary V ones that were just flying
08:11 and drop on on everybody unbelievable
08:15 unbelievable this guy pedals this stuff
08:17 again just has to be a little smarter
08:19 than you and then you're sucker
08:23 apparently didn't mention Roswell at all
08:25 which would have been a little important
08:27 thing to talk about yep because that
08:30 would be contact with aliens and what
08:32 happened to that whole story right
08:36 mm-hmm so again as I've told you guys
08:42 I've seen you know I don't even know if
08:45 I could find this stuff anymore half the
08:46 half the videos i linked with the
08:48 roswell interviews have been taken down
08:51 you just go back to my old roswell crash
08:54 episode the first one i got links in
08:57 there and they're all broken why you
09:02 know why would you take it down just
09:04 leave it up there they don't they don't
09:05 charge you per month to keep your videos
09:07 up there so i mean it's just ridiculous
09:10 right now
09:12 we come to the old theory which is they
09:17 know they faked the moon missions they
09:20 faked the living [ __ ] out of them so how
09:23 did they cover up for it well for a long
09:26 time they tried to debunk everything
09:27 that we discovered when they found out
09:30 that we got way more sophisticated about
09:34 the evidence against they gave up on
09:40 trying to debunk I think they even
09:41 pulled all the pages down from NASA
09:43 where they were going item by item and
09:45 their explanations some of them are okay
09:46 a bunch of them are just just sort of so
09:52 you know but
09:57 it's the alien on the moon theory if
10:01 someone let's just say you want to
10:03 believe in aliens who doesn't want to
10:05 believe in aliens yeah I don't know who
10:06 does it maybe a christian preacher who's
10:10 fearing that he's not gonna get his boy
10:11 touching time with the kids if i was
10:13 sudden he's not the center point of
10:15 everyone's life
10:19 so what this person said was that nasa
10:22 went to the moon just the logistics of
10:25 this they're so stupid I mean we're
10:29 talking about dumb low IQ crap that this
10:33 story is based on if she'd just taking
10:36 like a six-year-old going oh yeah what
10:39 about this he said Saturn five goes up
10:45 and gets to the moon fan ambled belts
10:51 were not a problem because they used
10:52 technology from those Germans yeah
10:57 they'd go to the moon and there's aliens
11:00 waiting for them on the moon mm-hmm
11:06 so John layer school of I see you know
11:10 aliens inside sand dunes right and so
11:14 they had to quickly fake the moon
11:16 footage and then apparently fake it
11:21 really technically seven more times
11:24 right because Apollo 13 has a big issue
11:26 so that six times total one failed
11:30 Apollo 9 [ __ ] 10 both go to the moon
11:34 supposedly and again nothing changes
11:38 any of the issues if you have patented
11:44 technology that is you know way more
11:46 advanced than anything that's out there
11:48 and this is the other steal spiel this
11:50 guy I was gonna say stick but I said
11:52 steal it's a spiel stick
11:57 then you would just develop something
11:59 that is going to use that technology
12:01 right in front of our face in a way that
12:03 we don't see it you know really being
12:05 you know the capsule or something would
12:07 actually have this Van Allen belt proof
12:09 [ __ ] on it and then you punched the Van
12:12 Allen belt and you know it's like whoo
12:14 yeah
12:15 quarter inch aluminum totally makes the
12:16 game happen but meanwhile you really
12:18 have a fair day technology and some you
12:21 know I don't know maybe electromagnetic
12:25 inertial dampers force field around the
12:27 outside or whatever because your ships
12:29 gonna have to have that too right your
12:31 anti gravity should but yeah so you go
12:35 there and you bump into aliens mm-hmm
12:39 mm-hmm sure man totally yeah that makes
12:42 complete sense wait oh man
12:44 since I want to believe in aliens I
12:46 guess I'll grab your alien story and
12:48 overlook the fact that you couldn't
12:50 actually get there that's their game
12:52 there's one astronaut lives in Malibu he
12:55 meets with this UFO group up there and
12:58 they're all just drinking kool-aid man
13:00 they want to believe they want to
13:01 believe so anything you say dude
13:03 anything you say it's all true and he
13:06 was trying to make excuses I guess for
13:08 why the astronauts were all just just
13:12 like you know again Glenn Armstrong or
13:14 surgery Glenn
13:15 excuse me about the musician Neil
13:17 Armstrong has been sobbing prior to the
13:21 press conference you can see the
13:23 puffiness of a crying face you can you
13:27 can see Buzz Aldrin who is just the
13:30 little boy who's in trouble in school
13:32 just writing in his desk over to the
13:35 side I mean he won't even look up at the
13:37 press conference saying oh my god you
13:39 got Michael Collins over there he's
13:41 actually holding this [ __ ] together way
13:42 better than everybody else he was the
13:45 most level-headed guy in the whole thing
13:47 god bless it means forced into this
13:50 mannequin it's their fault but come on
13:52 it's the 60s they just killed Kennedy
13:55 Malcolm X Martin Luther King and Robert
13:58 Kennedy just to name a few so when they
14:00 go the astronauts ago that'll be you and
14:02 your family if you say anything I'll be
14:04 a little crashing oh hi right there
14:08 you know they're not playing playing
14:10 games man plus they're coming from a
14:12 very innocent view of America where hey
14:15 yep you know our government is
14:17 trustworthy never gonna kill anybody
14:18 and now the sudden they reveal to you
14:21 that they've been killing all these
14:22 people and they're you're on the list if
14:24 you tell anything yeah of course they're
14:26 gonna keep their mouth shut
14:28 of course they are plus the whole thing
14:32 with thank God
14:34 bart sibrel has saved our ass with this
14:36 whole thing for sibrel during his movie
14:42 of you know astronauts gone a while had
14:46 this story been true about having gone
14:48 to the moon with some other vehicle or
14:50 some other technology Buzz Aldrin
14:52 wouldn't be threatening si Burrell with
14:54 the lawsuit in the back of a bookstore
14:56 packing his [ __ ] when he's shown the
14:58 video that's proof that they didn't go
15:00 he would have said yeah well you don't
15:04 know the half of it man we did go to the
15:07 moon you know or something to that
15:10 effect he be alluding to hahaha you
15:13 idiot
15:14 we definitely went to the moon we just
15:16 didn't we just weren't the first because
15:19 someone else went up first rate that was
15:20 the other big epiphany right when people
15:22 say these these lines and the story it's
15:25 like it just reminds me of real stories
15:31 where you will hear someone say you know
15:33 you know young kid you got some big
15:37 profound thing you you take it to an old
15:39 guy in a little country town on a porch
15:41 somewhere and you're like man did you
15:42 know this happens happen and the old man
15:45 just looking goes you know you don't
15:48 know the half of it and then what he'll
15:49 say is like yeah Neil Armstrong wasn't
15:53 even the first man on the moon and from
15:55 a guy like that and maybe has a huge
15:57 background in NASA wherever he's retired
15:58 on this porch you might be like really
16:00 what happened you know it's like okay
16:02 it's a lot more intense than you think
16:04 but when you hear these outrageous
16:06 claims would not reach us evidence what
16:09 can you do man but apparently they go to
16:13 the moon
16:15 and again there's no claim of when this
16:18 happened
16:18 it's Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin and
16:21 Michael Collins going to the moon with
16:23 you with the technology that we saw but
16:26 some tech that we don't know it's
16:27 working for them
16:30 and they they land and there's a bunch
16:33 of aliens there right there's a guy so
16:34 in a book you just debuted makin 2014
16:37 he's talking about again these polygons
16:40 ships the stuff he drew them for us so
16:42 we can see them and it's like an old
16:43 band drawing what would be a really
16:46 impressive spaceship for an old man you
16:48 know instead of just going
16:50 they were geometric we really don't know
16:53 how to describe them to you we weren't
16:54 there but but this is where we heard
16:56 them and whatever never any photographs
16:58 of this stuff and those those videos
17:01 where people are like showing rocks on
17:04 the moon and they're like saying that
17:09 their spaceships it's like okay here's
17:12 what you do with that and I've never
17:14 seen this once on the web maybe it's
17:17 happened you let me know because this
17:19 would be proof you film a crater and
17:22 right next to the crater is a big-ass
17:24 shadow because it's a big-ass object
17:27 there and you know you've seen these
17:29 videos if you're into this little thing
17:30 you've seen them they'll say this rock
17:32 is like huh it's big as New York City or
17:35 something like that right and some big
17:36 giant thing and it'll say the shadow is
17:39 the ship and it's been parked next to
17:41 the rock because apparently the way I've
17:44 seen the story a couple done I think
17:46 Jerry anism has been one of the ones
17:47 that presented it without saying it's
17:50 true but they're trying to tell you it's
17:53 an alien spacecraft mining the moon all
17:57 right all right so you got a mining the
18:01 moon thing then that means the ships
18:04 gonna not be there then the ship's gonna
18:07 be there the initiatives not gonna be
18:09 there pretty simple
18:11 with your 10,000 10,000 power reflector
18:15 telescope those big thick ones that
18:17 people own in their homes and you clear
18:19 night in the day especially if you're
18:21 living in a rural area especially
18:23 because people drive to get to non
18:25 polluted areas right deserts fields in
18:28 Kansas don't make you [ __ ] jeez 10
18:31 miles and you're in absolutely clear
18:33 skies you can see about 2,200 stars if
18:36 you stare if you like Allah makes your
18:38 eyes for about an hour but you can film
18:41 the moon it look amazing right
18:44 you can get these shots you see them all
18:45 the time okay
18:48 so film one day time stamp it and
18:51 publish it without the object film it
18:54 film it don't take a photograph because
18:56 photographs can be messed with right
18:59 then film it again and then film it
19:04 again have some other mechanism in the
19:06 room to prove that that you're actually
19:10 at that time frame should I don't know
19:12 film the internet on your telephone with
19:14 with the date of the news or something a
19:16 front page URL not a sub article but
19:20 supposedly these astronauts arrive and
19:23 the NASA is like oh crap there's aliens
19:29 up here so here's the thing there's just
19:37 so many ways to debunk this it is just
19:39 it's like where do you start there's a
19:41 thousand ways to tear this to shreds one
19:44 the the stories initially told that is
19:46 Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin and Michael
19:48 Collins course Collins is out there
19:50 doing a big loop out there and of course
19:51 that technology is all bunk spacesuit
19:54 zone where the ships don't or nothing
19:56 works in space that we've ever created
19:58 because you can't retrorocket a ship
20:03 with no atmosphere right so it's hitting
20:05 the moon what 17,000 miles an hour
20:07 minimum sudden you've got this lunar
20:09 lander going seventy thousand miles in a
20:12 orbital loop and so you turn on some
20:14 engines not the ten thousand pound
20:17 thrust thing because it has a cover on
20:18 it all the way to the bottom right and
20:20 these little tiny you know retro rockets
20:23 are not gonna stop a 17,000 mile an hour
20:25 object and no atmosphere what would you
20:27 be pushing off of absolutely nothing
20:29 you're early meteor eight again people
20:35 don't want to pay attention pay the
20:37 price they repeat history this [ __ ]
20:39 happens right so here comes this thing
20:41 17,000 miles an hour towards the towards
20:44 the moon well what its gonna do is it's
20:45 gonna [ __ ] crater at 17,000 miles an
20:48 hour even if they turn that 10,000 pound
20:50 thrust engine like the old lunar lander
20:52 video game they're gonna have to turn it
20:54 if there's some magic thing you can push
20:57 off of
20:58 in a vacuum then you're gonna have to
21:01 turn it you're gonna have to burn it and
21:02 you don't have enough fuel on that
21:04 vehicle to slow that thing down
21:07 you just don't and there'd be no way for
21:09 them to calculate that on earth to begin
21:11 with because they've never done the
21:12 maneuver before but of course they get
21:14 an absolutely picture-perfect on the
21:16 first try oh okay
21:21 I just we're to loop back to the they
21:26 landed in a different vehicle in a
21:27 future to the previous time but let's
21:29 just go with the scenario in did these
21:31 astronauts founded civilian and of
21:36 course NASA's like quickly you know in
21:38 the next two hours
21:40 [ __ ] I mean it was all live right so
21:43 it's like in the next 10 minutes build a
21:45 fake moon base moon surface crane down a
21:50 duplicate put actors on there I
21:53 organized the script get it all going
21:55 together and then just put that on TV
21:57 just Hey look at he split no problem
21:59 right impossible absolutely positively
22:04 impossible now does anybody remember the
22:12 trials and tribulations of getting a
22:14 rocket to go into low orbit does anybody
22:17 remember all those rockets that just
22:19 blew up on the tarmac just went up about
22:22 two feet and then fell down a bow boom
22:23 boom boom boom yeah they've got super
22:27 advanced technology don't they right you
22:29 know someone would step in to clean up
22:30 the mess right even if they're gonna
22:32 fake these moon missions simply to
22:33 milkis full of billions of dollars
22:37 they're gonna step in and make it fixed
22:40 right they're gonna go okay we're not
22:41 gonna get to the moon because that's our
22:42 secret technology but we're gonna at
22:44 least fix this rocket [ __ ] problem
22:45 you've got here
22:46 there'll be no Apollo 13 problem because
22:50 nothing will ever blow up on the outside
22:52 of the service module but isn't the
22:54 never documented rate we won't have to
22:56 use claymation you know stop animations
23:00 my claymation but it stopped animation
23:02 of fake spacewalks where the helmet
23:04 turns and the guy goes are you doing
23:06 right the helmet doesn't turn if you
23:08 turn it you take it off right and you're
23:09 gonna kill the guy ray
23:11 you won't have to fake the rubber seals
23:12 in space all that stuff you would never
23:14 had to fake it because they'd simply fix
23:17 it or never attempted in the first place
23:20 right yeah so you find just to just to
23:25 kind of keep a looping on this whole
23:27 concept you find that there's aliens on
23:29 the moon I think one of the stories I
23:31 heard was that aliens on the moon the
23:33 guy who saw in the book he said the
23:36 astronauts landed in the conventional
23:38 saturn v service module lunar module and
23:41 the alien spaceships were there and what
23:43 they said was get the [ __ ] off our our
23:45 moon that was the first thing he said
23:47 and the first theory I've ever heard
23:49 were really went to any level of detail
23:50 besides Oh or family doing stuff on
23:52 there and he saw a Total Recall - that's
23:54 nice so let's say they went ahead of
23:58 time okay so let's just try to loop back
24:08 the logistics of what a moon mission
24:10 would be let's say you got some UFO out
24:12 there right you got it from Roswell you
24:14 managed to back engineer of course this
24:16 guy never talked about it I mean you
24:18 think that would be something that would
24:19 you would know about right at some point
24:23 I'm gonna do an episode about those
24:24 Hindu ship designs they're pretty much
24:28 yeah it's around the time of Christ if
24:31 not before Christ and it was a bunch of
24:33 drawings of ships that look exactly like
24:35 UFOs that a bunch of people have
24:37 documented because it looks like man
24:41 they figured this out a long time ago or
24:42 wherever the hell were from we got to
24:44 see the home some of the home vehicles
24:46 or whatever so they go they put together
24:50 a spaceship I guess and they get it
24:52 functional at some point and they
24:56 venture out into space they completely
24:58 have the controls of this and according
25:00 to this dude it's all man-made and it's
25:02 it was created by Adolf Hitler's group
25:06 which again that doesn't make any sense
25:08 because the guy lost the war I mean just
25:12 think about the presents attack of a
25:15 ship like that let's think about what
25:18 would be the most basic form of the ship
25:21 and in this you know poor Bob Lazar who
25:25 stuck in his pathological lie of the
25:29 element 115 if you don't have the
25:31 element 115 trick that Bob Lazar was
25:33 talking about it's much again it's not a
25:38 natural occurring elements you have to
25:39 create it on earth
25:40 it may be naturally occurring somewhere
25:42 else in the universe but not on our
25:44 periodic chart they had to synthesize it
25:47 on earth and supposedly didn't
25:49 synthesize it till 2003 but let's just
25:54 say that's just above ground late
25:55 technology ducted them you'd have to
26:00 have damn near a zero-point energy
26:02 system to create an antigravity system
26:06 most of the theories that were on the
26:08 table being taught in universities and I
26:10 saw one lecture from 1965 I want to say
26:14 it was Cornell University but I saw more
26:18 than one and I used to have a book and I
26:19 showed the book I'm one of my episodes I
26:21 can't find the damn thing the hell it
26:24 went
26:24 I haven't donated any books since since
26:30 I made that video you know it might be
26:31 in a different pile a bunch of game
26:32 books anyway it we knew how to make
26:38 anti-gravity work with electromagnetic
26:40 fields the only problem was we didn't
26:42 have the power source to pull it off my
26:45 buddy Syd Mead again had people coming
26:48 to him routinely bragging to him from
26:51 very intense secret agencies very legit
26:54 people okay because he was the futurists
26:57 designer they always like talking to the
26:59 guy that was gonna it was Imagineering
27:01 the stuff into existence but he also
27:04 lacks a lot of the power systems for his
27:05 designs but you would have to have some
27:09 form of the zero-point energy system in
27:11 1945 if there's anything worth taking
27:15 there's a catch
27:18 let's say that I'm telling you that I'm
27:21 working on zero-point energy system in
27:22 my garage which I'm not Alissa's say I
27:24 was and this tally this the meets say
27:29 I've worked on it for um two years but
27:31 it's not really quite perfected yet well
27:35 you wouldn't be able to take that and go
27:36 with it because I've got a bunch of
27:37 stuff that doesn't work yet
27:39 doesn't quite hum it doesn't quite work
27:41 so in order to get it finished to the
27:45 point you could steal it from me means
27:48 that the Germans had completely tested
27:50 it completely tested it what's also very
27:54 interesting about is that Nikola Tesla
27:56 well I think died in 45 right
27:59 he hadn't figured out how to do that of
28:03 all the things he didn't figure out how
28:05 to do anti-gravity and he was a master
28:07 of electricity he was a master of
28:09 infinite energy using his Tesla coils
28:12 and a coil and a pin straight down to
28:14 the earth to use instead of ground he
28:18 used it as a siphon you know for all the
28:21 plasma energy at the centre of the earth
28:24 okay so smartest man in the world didn't
28:28 have my go to the Coral Castle do can go
28:32 well he had a wheel in his house you
28:33 know and he was able to levitate rocks
28:35 he's in this wheel well it's still
28:37 limited amount of power sounds like he
28:39 had a lot of power or some weird sacred
28:41 geometry that he used to infiltrate the
28:43 stones to give them permeability to
28:45 ether so they could rise off that you're
28:47 gonna be moved around by 110-pound guy
28:50 okay it's you know the way this guy told
28:55 the story is it's a turnkey technology
28:57 by 1945 I mean you just got take it just
29:01 that black box right there push the red
29:02 button boom grantee gravity happens see
29:05 those two ships over there well they
29:07 totally work we just didn't deploy them
29:09 during the war when we were losing the
29:11 war maybe think about a desperate
29:13 measures for desperate times you would
29:15 get those damn ships out and do
29:16 something do something
29:19 take a warhead take a thousand-pound
29:21 warhead put it inside the ship it's
29:23 man-made right it's not alien made it's
29:25 man-made so you can make it bigger and
29:27 you grab these antigravity you know
29:29 again if you can get let's just say a
29:33 5000 pound vehicle to float in the air
29:35 I'm pretty sure you get a 10,000 or
29:38 100,000 pound vehicle to float here what
29:40 would be your limitation you need almost
29:42 completely zero point energy system in
29:46 infinite power to make this work in the
29:50 first place
29:51 so what would be the difference right
29:53 again they told said me that the
29:58 spinning mercury and electrifying it was
30:01 definitely a technique that was used to
30:03 create an antigravity situation but that
30:05 they were light years past that and
30:08 didn't require anything weird and
30:11 supposedly from 1945 to 1969 somewhere
30:15 in that region which is approximately 25
30:18 years NASA's sweat and their balls off
30:22 NASA is covering up a gigantic hoax so
30:26 from 1945 1969 is almost 25 years Gus
30:30 Grissom gets murdered in the Apollo 1
30:32 test pad because he said this thing was
30:35 a lemon it wasn't going to go to outer
30:37 space what would be the point of killing
30:40 Gus with cyanide gas or cyanide whatever
30:43 there was cyanide in his body plus the
30:44 other two guys had signed on the buddies
30:46 no one struggled to get out of the
30:48 vehicle they said it was an oxygen fire
30:50 but everyone's still in their suits and
30:52 their suits are burned but not burned
30:54 down at the bone they got a blast hatch
30:57 on one of the sides with TNT pins in it
31:01 so no one moved they just sat there
31:04 because they've already poisoned to
31:05 death then they start the fire a fire
31:07 that's gonna be out in seconds right
31:09 could be out in seconds regardless they
31:12 could pull the hacks and boom blow that
31:14 thing out all the airs gonna go outside
31:16 maybe there's a fire maybe there's an
31:17 issue but at least they could crawl
31:18 outside maybe they would die from
31:20 falling off the vehicle but none of that
31:22 happened why would you kill Gus christen
31:26 if you already been to the moon and some
31:28 SuperDuper whoopity duper's you know
31:29 spaceship why who [ __ ] cares what
31:33 that guy says you don't say you don't
31:38 care what he says because he let's say
31:40 that guy went to the press and said this
31:41 is never gonna take off it's a lemon
31:44 which is what he supposedly did right
31:46 okay fine
31:48 he's he's obviously unaware we've
31:51 already got technology to make this
31:52 happen so we make him look like [ __ ] by
31:57 demoting him out of being the first
31:59 astronaut Neal's gonna be the first one
32:02 now Gus was supposed to be the first one
32:04 and then
32:04 you'll begin the first one if they kill
32:05 Gus and his two buddies all right so
32:09 because they know they have this this
32:10 little this little ace up their sleeve
32:12 called antigravity ship right we're just
32:15 gonna make we're gonna make fun of Gus
32:17 we're gonna destroy his credibility
32:18 because you know we have a bunch of tech
32:20 that Gus doesn't know about or you pull
32:22 Gus aside take him into hangar 18 that
32:27 wright-patterson Air Force Base geo dude
32:29 you need to chill out with your [ __ ]
32:31 Lemon thing I know that this Saturn five
32:33 thing looks like crap which I don't even
32:34 know if that was in the blueprints by
32:36 what 65 or so when Gus was killed take
32:39 him into hangar 18 you shown one of
32:40 these sports model ships that billions
32:43 in the backyard right and you say look
32:45 there it is right there dude we're not
32:48 only gonna go to the moon but you know
32:49 what if you really want to in exchange
32:51 for you shutting the [ __ ] up you can
32:53 actually be the first dude to get out
32:55 what do you think oh yeah Gus is gonna
32:59 be like hell yeah I am a test pilot
33:02 I am definitely flying in that thing and
33:05 I will shut up I will apologize I would
33:08 say I was drinking too much and
33:10 definitely whatever we make on those
33:12 pads is gonna make you just you put me
33:14 in a blow-up rubber duck and I will say
33:17 that that's gonna take us to the moon
33:18 don't even sweat it and he gets to go
33:20 boom
33:21 you wouldn't commit murder if you had a
33:25 ship that was going to the moon now the
33:29 logistics do not get negated simply
33:33 because you come up with an antigravity
33:35 ship what am I talking about okay so you
33:41 guys [ __ ] I've thought about this a
33:42 hundred times over before any of these
33:44 lies came back any of you have ever seen
33:49 the movie explorers which I think was
33:52 directed by Steven Spielberg or Zemeckis
33:54 and Spielberg together whatever it's the
33:56 moment one of the most endearing movies
33:59 ever made it has a bunch of like kids
34:04 stars are in it man it's it's just a
34:05 great movie but these kids were getting
34:07 these dreams of these schematics and one
34:10 of them was a genius which I think was
34:11 Phoenix and he was running them down
34:14 and then they'd build the circuit and
34:16 then something would happen and they
34:18 build up this little ball then it flew
34:20 around all around the room almost killed
34:21 him then they made the ball bigger and
34:23 they realized this balls is is
34:26 infinitely impermeable it's like
34:28 invincible so then they go to the
34:31 junkyard and they steal a car out of an
34:34 amusement park it looks like the ones in
34:35 the haunted house at Disneyland so the
34:38 capsule ones right and they get inside
34:40 and then they make the ball go around
34:41 the castle then they fly all over the
34:43 place but it really there's no air so
34:45 the need ringing the air circuit and
34:47 they put the air circuit in there and
34:48 then poof they can breathe I think it
34:50 was an apple to see in there in the
34:52 vehicle but so I've thought about this
34:55 because it's just one of the most
34:57 beautiful little fantasy movies where
35:00 little kids are synthetics to build an
35:03 antigravity vehicle with the oxygenated
35:06 circuit in it right it's just brilliant
35:07 right it was funny because the air just
35:10 split out from the PC board really funny
35:13 but even if you had that unless it's
35:16 because they had a clear ball around a
35:18 musical park ride they could have gone
35:20 to the moon and they could have seen
35:23 everything at the front of the vehicle
35:25 because there's just nothing but a big
35:27 opening there it's a force field around
35:28 them or they could have looked around
35:29 and seen that we didn't go but we're
35:33 talking about an airship right some
35:36 human-made ship that is using an
35:38 antigravity field around it and I'm
35:40 telling you the only anti-gravity device
35:41 we're ever gonna find is one that can
35:43 displace ether and the second you
35:45 displace ether from the interior of the
35:47 ship you will kill everything inside the
35:49 ship and maybe even the ship itself
35:51 because everything is created using
35:53 ether and once you cut off the the water
35:58 supply your water entity disappears
36:01 right and so if you cut off what you're
36:02 made out of
36:03 you will instantaneously vanish or just
36:05 turn into a pile of light like ether
36:08 reflecting around the room you will
36:09 cease to exist on a level that has never
36:11 been done to my my time frame right she
36:15 gets to the moon you got a window in
36:17 your vehicle I guess maybe you do again
36:21 if the Germans made it they didn't make
36:22 it for interstellar travel necessarily
36:25 they made it mean which is all be us
36:26 anyway but if they did they probably
36:28 make it for
36:28 earth to earth journeys so if the aliens
36:33 are there I guess the only way you can
36:35 really figure it out is to look out the
36:36 window because there's one thing you
36:38 can't do in this vehicle noise that ever
36:40 described right I'm pretty sure it's
36:43 pretty cold in space right
36:44 having never been there I'm still gonna
36:47 say that what is heat and what is cold
36:52 to make something cold you have to slow
36:55 down it's molecule vibration to make
36:57 something hot you gotta speed up those
36:59 vibrations okay that's why the hottest
37:04 things that we run into in this universe
37:06 so far is flames of fire
37:09 why is fire intangible right why does it
37:14 just seem to be this apparition that
37:15 just disappears into the night sky
37:18 because it is unbound by a nuclear force
37:26 all it can do is move so fast that it
37:30 just just dissipates and diffuses into
37:33 the atmosphere
37:34 it ceases to exist plasma energy being
37:38 probably some of the hottest stuff on
37:39 this planet that's when you see the
37:41 arcing electricity on electric liquid
37:43 requires like a Jacob's Ladder or
37:45 something right massive vegetation
37:49 millions of volts half the time right if
37:52 not tens of millions when it comes out
37:53 of a lightning bolt okay
37:58 so the vehicle enters even 200 miles up
38:02 I know that they say that the various
38:07 levels the atmosphere are really really
38:09 hot but there has to do with the fact
38:10 that again probably those particles are
38:12 now even if it is super hot you know you
38:15 have the was a third third law of
38:18 thermodynamics heat attracts the cold
38:21 and so the ship could vaporize simply
38:25 because it's getting annihilated but if
38:26 you had your anti-gravity bubble around
38:28 the outside because I'm sure the Germans
38:29 were worried about interstellar travel
38:31 creating a vehicle that to ultimately
38:34 win world war two so you get through the
38:37 Van Allen belts and you don't get cooked
38:39 because the Van Allen belts are going
38:41 around the skeleton of this sort of
38:43 Faraday cage all right I've suggested
38:45 that my UFO to build a UFO or building
38:49 the UFO episode all right but now you
38:53 get outside the Van Allen belts and [ __ ]
38:55 start slowing down the amount of ether
38:58 that's out there is definitely palpable
39:01 but it's not anything like it is down
39:05 here because we have tangibility down
39:08 here right guarantee you a lot more
39:11 ether or you and I are sitting than in
39:14 outer space it's but space is big right
39:20 so they get to the moon but no
39:23 atmosphere I mean you wouldn't be able
39:24 to see the surface of the Moon the way
39:26 you do if it had an atmosphere so a lot
39:27 of people lean on theories that there is
39:30 atmosphere but there there's no major
39:33 Bowl atmosphere there I mean it's
39:34 crystal frickin clear when you look
39:36 through on a massive telescope which
39:38 I've done
39:40 even if even if you have one of these
39:42 hundred power zoom Sony cameras you'll
39:45 start seeing parts of the moon you never
39:46 thought you would ever see I got a fifty
39:50 power Sony camera and it it takes
39:52 amazing pictures of the moon okay
39:56 it's you're on the moon now the ship is
39:59 really starting to old still man and so
40:03 you're super difficult
40:04 I would even assume that maybe even a
40:08 lie to be super cool but again with that
40:09 atmosphere
40:10 who knows what's really going on are you
40:13 super duper hot is that where the moon
40:15 is white because maybe it's just burned
40:17 by the moon yeah bird by the Sun excuse
40:19 me so you meet these aliens and how do
40:23 you get out what what you got this
40:26 stolen technology from the Germans
40:28 because you don't have the know-how to
40:29 do it what are you gonna do to get out
40:32 what crazy bubble are you gonna come out
40:35 and it's going to protect you from all
40:37 the elements let's say the calculations
40:39 are even remotely correct if there's a
40:41 500 degree swing between the Sun and the
40:43 shadow and its abrupt right so you're an
40:47 astronaut standing in a suit the front
40:49 of your body is 280 and your back is
40:51 negative 280 how does the ventilation
40:54 system work again tell me you know so
40:58 even if you met these aliens how they
40:59 going to talk to you
41:00 maybe telepathically or something sure
41:02 they'll make up whatever you need to
41:04 hear the thing is is that even though
41:08 consumer telescopes in the 60s were
41:11 definitely something to laugh at about
41:15 the tiny star landing on the moon
41:17 we have observatories with a massive
41:19 both lens and reflector telescopes that
41:22 human beings would be looking at the
41:25 landing sites of all these ships they'd
41:27 be there been looking at the moon for as
41:28 long as he possibly can if there was a
41:32 tremendous amount of traffic and I've
41:33 seen some BS videos of little tiny
41:36 particles moving in front of the moon
41:38 it's like I mean you just have to be
41:41 devoid of any CG technology to believe
41:44 that that stuff's real again if you had
41:47 a guy in Arizona who's your friend and
41:50 then some random person and say Canada
41:54 both looking at the moon at a particular
41:56 night and both of them picked up that
41:59 little piece of debris going in front of
42:00 the moon and changing directions and
42:03 changing speed giving it you know de
42:05 facto intelligent movement and it's
42:08 coming from a slightly different angle
42:09 because they're about you know to 2500
42:12 miles away from each other then yeah you
42:16 can go holy crap there was a UFO right
42:19 there in front of the moon but so far
42:22 our little visitors have managed to stay
42:25 out of any major videos on the moon for
42:30 my entire lifetime any assertion by John
42:33 leader that this clump of rock is a
42:35 space base it's like all right mr. leer
42:40 you think you've de facto found a space
42:43 space and every time you look at the
42:44 photographs this guy point sentences
42:45 well it's clearly a higher way there and
42:47 it's clearly a tank and there's a
42:49 vehicle meaning like a like a like a
42:53 like an air tank or something like some
42:55 fuel tank or whatever okay well then
42:58 you've got their base in view which
43:02 means my buddies
43:05 with like $10,000 telescopes can just
43:09 lock that right on their camera every
43:12 single night and eventually ships gonna
43:14 take off our little vehicles gonna tip
43:17 it back you know because hey these ships
43:20 are supposed to be the biggest New York
43:21 with half the stories that you hear we
43:24 would see movement all over the surface
43:26 of the Moon the story would break
43:29 wouldn't be a problem but we never do do
43:32 we no man they were there they were
43:35 there the second that they arrived at
43:37 the alien that romantic sci-fi part of
43:39 it is that it's almost stealing for
43:41 movies that we've already seen where
43:42 soon as man gets to the moon there you
43:45 get to find a monolith you get to find
43:47 aliens waiting for you I mean what does
43:50 that look like and the thing is a
43:53 Operation Paperclip
43:57 you know the romantic story about
44:00 paperclip it's a very real thing the
44:02 hideous part about paperclip is the
44:04 MKULTRA programs that came over here
44:06 that's a very real thing and it was very
44:09 tedious and marginally successful it
44:13 required you know horrible abuse
44:15 patterns on human beings to
44:16 compartmentalize their minds but von
44:19 braun comes over and he has to struggle
44:21 through all this technology but the
44:24 thing is is that von braun imagine you
44:28 come over who would have known about the
44:30 antigravity vehicle more than anyone
44:33 else in german history it would have
44:35 been Verner von braun absolutely
44:38 positively would have that technology we
44:43 know that he you know quotes the passage
44:45 in the Bible that talks about the
44:46 firmament dome on his freaking tombstone
44:51 and he got fired from NASA in 1974 and
44:54 died four years later so thanks for
44:58 nothing it was kind of what they did to
45:00 him because again the head of NASA quits
45:04 the month after we land on the moon in
45:06 1969 in July why would you do that why
45:10 would you do that if we have
45:11 anti-gravity this oh he didn't tell the
45:13 head of NASA about this whole thing
45:15 you've heard this completely Nazi base
45:17 fraudulent Space Agency who's really
45:20 trying to create missiles and ICBMs but
45:23 somewhere in the back we've got an
45:24 antigravity vehicle that's ready to go
45:27 all right
45:30 Cuban Missile Crisis Moscow all this
45:35 kind of stuff I mean you know how much
45:37 does do all these people care about you
45:39 know democracy really spreading across
45:41 the United States if they're these truly
45:43 Marxist deep stages you want socialism
45:45 everywhere somebody would have leaked it
45:47 over to Russia I mean Russia did get a
45:49 ton of the scientists right they just
45:50 didn't get von Braun the other thing too
45:53 is that the second that you had
45:56 technology like anti-gravity in 1945
46:01 your side would be remember because
46:04 morale is huge right morale is a
46:06 gigantic huge thing when it comes to war
46:10 and so letting some people know that hey
46:13 don't worry about it man we got
46:14 anti-gravity we're gonna [ __ ] these
46:16 people up we're gonna make everyone pay
46:18 for bombing us man and you know
46:22 supposedly it's short-circuits before
46:24 it's all over but you go there before
46:27 you can't get out of your vehicle
46:28 because there's no way to survive
46:30 because that technology wasn't developed
46:32 by the by the Germans because they
46:34 didn't see this as a trip to the moon it
46:37 really gets to that freaking the hell is
46:40 that series that the Russian kids had
46:41 created the Nazi sci-fi series it's
46:43 hilarious right they could not third
46:45 movie now whether we're the basically
46:49 the Germans retreated to the moon and
46:52 there's a a swastika shaped station you
46:57 know space base on the moon and a lot of
47:00 times they romanticized it to the dark
47:02 side the moon because we never ever see
47:03 the back side of the moon and I heard my
47:08 friend the other day say well we know
47:09 the Russians went to the dark side of it
47:11 what like I've been in this for a really
47:13 long time you know I've heard that
47:14 dropped every once a while but how do
47:16 you know that right I mean like what
47:18 piece of evidence you think the Russians
47:20 would sit back and take egg on their
47:21 face the whole time canceling their moon
47:24 project and all of their stuff why would
47:26 they you have so many problems on the
47:27 tarmac with their rocket exploding their
47:29 big big rocket which is about 2/3 the
47:32 size of the Saturn 5 with probably twice
47:35 the thrust power couldn't escape Earth's
47:38 gravitational force of course you can't
47:41 what is it time when I did that math on
47:45 that one episode it's like the earth is
47:47 several million times bigger than this
47:49 object you can't just walk away from
47:51 that the other thing that's very very
47:55 telling in this whole [ __ ] story is
47:58 that it really seems like the moon
48:05 missions as rumored as being filmed in a
48:08 Hollywood studio the one thing that I
48:11 think has kind of gotten through the
48:13 cracks is that this was a last minute
48:16 thing for all intents and purposes they
48:19 did not think they were going to have to
48:23 fake
48:23 moon missions but they did in the end
48:25 because of technological problems not
48:27 because of aliens on the moon but the
48:31 big question is like okay shillings on
48:32 the moon let's go with that story you
48:36 really I mean if they're waiting for you
48:37 right there's like two scenarios that
48:42 you've got welcome congratulations
48:47 his first contact you made it to the
48:50 moon that's good yeah we've been waiting
48:52 the whole time for you to make it to the
48:54 moon now let's integrate our societies
48:56 let's move forward I think that's what a
48:59 welcome would mean not oh you still
49:02 repress your people and your killing
49:03 leaders who have been elected oh yeah
49:05 yeah you should stay in charge of the
49:06 earth because you really got your [ __ ]
49:08 together oh and you didn't even make
49:10 this technology you stole it from these
49:12 guys and then frame them for a bunch of
49:14 stuff and then that it uh yeah yeah this
49:16 is great
49:17 you're the good guys right no the
49:19 [ __ ] showed up right the second story
49:24 is the other guy's story who wrote the
49:26 book who said that they were like get
49:28 out of here
49:29 this is our place all untrackable by
49:34 thousands of home telescopes apparently
49:38 they're gone apparently we met them and
49:40 they're gone right because we film the
49:42 moon every night I mean that guy how
49:43 many videos are up there
49:44 Ellen the moon fell looking for the
49:48 those vibrational rings that go around
49:50 the moon right I've seen I've seen
49:54 videos that were like I don't know a
49:57 couple hours long
49:59 just moon I'm looking for those big high
50:01 towers you know the big formations on
50:04 the moon never an alien ship at least
50:09 nothing that's provable right what I've
50:11 seen is a piece of space dust go in
50:14 front of the moon this last video I saw
50:15 probably a couple weeks ago
50:17 constant-speed doesn't look like a ship
50:21 to me right it doesn't change doesn't
50:23 fly in any type of the illogical path
50:26 doesn't very speed doesn't stop doesn't
50:28 take a turn nothing who's filming and
50:32 stuff and not tracking the the piece
50:36 debris that's gone by why are you
50:39 filming the moon if you're not looking
50:40 through the eyepiece I'm just filming
50:41 the moon tonight it's written on the
50:43 moon it's all on auto rotate or whatever
50:45 just filming the moon for no reason
50:48 whatsoever like we don't have enough
50:49 just ambient footage of the moon right
50:51 now you get down there looking through
50:52 going oh man like that grab my let's
50:54 move over here the ones I've seen have
50:56 been meticulously filming the moon
50:57 surface trying to find specific objects
51:02 to see what they can determine out of
51:04 them right if there was any traffic to
51:07 the moon from spaceships we would see it
51:11 we simply would let's say we build this
51:16 ship and we can go back to the moon we'd
51:18 go to the moon we go the moon once we go
51:20 the moon hundred times
51:25 we still won't have technology to get
51:26 outside unless we talk to an alien to
51:28 figure out how to do that and I don't
51:29 know that they do that don't know but
51:33 you would think that would be a
51:33 tremendous advancement in technology
51:35 even the stuff that let us see down
51:37 below but the guy talking providing all
51:41 this hoopla he's a guy that never seems
51:46 to advance his theories beyond his own
51:50 ability to write and really steal
51:53 science fiction from other people this
51:57 dude said once that in a previous thing
52:01 I saw him do you know the big question
52:04 about Roswell was why did this ship
52:07 crash why did he crash the night before
52:11 or the night of I should say of its
52:13 official crash is observed by several
52:15 people and it supposedly the ark
52:17 archaeologists showed up with his four
52:19 students at the crash site
52:21 he said that he saw a massive electrical
52:27 storm that night and that they saw a
52:30 vehicle fall out of the sky and they
52:31 were concerned but they couldn't go
52:33 chase it because of so much electricity
52:34 in the New Mexico desert they didn't
52:36 want to get zapped so they stayed till
52:38 the next day they went towards where
52:40 they saw this thing crash and sure
52:41 enough walk right up on the saucer after
52:43 this other family had already found it
52:45 or you got the one guy one little alien
52:48 and survived one that's dying when it's
52:49 all destroyed so we thought ok you know
52:54 doesn't make any sense that lightning
52:56 would take a vehicle out because come on
52:59 a lightning bolt
53:00 although formidable to human form and
53:03 doesn't knock our 747s out of the sky
53:08 she'd mean to tell me they have the
53:09 interstellar capability or
53:11 interdimensional capability and a
53:12 lightning bolt takes him out come on
53:15 but one of the stories that they patched
53:17 a long time ago and I've said this once
53:20 before was that military radar took it
53:23 down
53:25 well once that kind of ran its course
53:28 you have to dial yours if you're young
53:30 listen up radar technology was about as
53:36 impressive when it came out to laser
53:40 beam guns would be to us today right
53:44 there were a lightsaber if you saw a
53:46 lightsaber today and it really worked
53:48 your mind would blow right
53:50 20:20 lightsaber be amazing if I shot
53:52 you with the shut not you but shot an
53:54 object in front of you use all these are
53:56 being segments come out of my gun and
53:58 then poof just like a sci-fi movie your
54:02 mind would blow the Han Solo rifle well
54:05 that's what they thought about radar
54:06 they thought that was just unbelievable
54:09 and it is amazing technology right RCA
54:13 was amazing at that right so that's why
54:18 the story was told well fast-forward
54:21 let's see 60 plus No yeah 60 63 plus 10y
54:28 so
54:30 seventy-three no [ __ ] it's only a
54:33 fifty-fifty three years later this guy
54:36 told the story again and he was doing a
54:39 presentation to some group of people
54:41 really nice location and he was like oh
54:44 yeah
54:45 you know they said that that was shot
54:46 down by radar no one believes it but you
54:48 know what it was it was some super
54:50 powerful radar that we had back then it
54:52 was covert if I told you guys in one of
54:57 my episodes ok and that I had knowledge
55:00 about all this secret stuff but I can't
55:05 tell you how what really works but I can
55:08 tell you that it exists you know I mean
55:13 there's just a point where you have to
55:15 go dude I'm gonna need more information
55:17 than that right you're you're covering
55:19 up all you're making an excuse why you
55:21 can't tell me how anything works but
55:24 you're you're asking me to believe that
55:26 it exists if it's some fun thing you
55:31 know who knows I mean it's not related
55:33 anything deadly it's just a fun thing
55:36 somewhere in the universe maybe really
55:37 Kyle that's kind of funny but why don't
55:39 you show me your magic trick you don't
55:40 tell me how it works just show it to me
55:42 and I'm like ok Brad Pitt comes out of a
55:43 hat holy [ __ ] you saw the Hat it was
55:45 Indian utter duh
55:46 yeah that's a nice trick good for this
55:50 guy to run around and say ok I'm a
55:52 preface my whole story here I got a
55:54 pattern to my story the story pattern is
55:57 I can't prove anything to you because
56:00 it's all secret but I'm gonna tell you
56:02 all this outrageous crap that goes on
56:04 top of that platform at some point it
56:06 goes well your knowledge is about as
56:07 useful as a science fiction novel the
56:11 author doesn't have to prove how
56:12 anything works they just write whatever
56:13 they want because it's entertaining
56:15 so you're an entertainer right now and
56:18 hey if someone gets entertained and
56:20 they'd like to hear stories and more
56:21 power tool and listen all the fiction
56:23 you won
56:23 I think what pisses me off the most
56:26 about this is that this is not the time
56:30 in 2020 with a gigantic red pill
56:33 community forming
56:35 for some person to architects out of old
56:44 archetypes a bunch of new lies to shove
56:49 into our face right I think that would
56:52 be the most reprehensible thing ever
56:56 great according to this guy you know at
57:00 all it all forked off right this
57:02 SuperDuper technology went into some
57:04 dark black project and I guess he talked
57:08 all about how they're getting financed
57:10 and he just basically took credit for
57:11 every single time the military's ever
57:13 lost money and that's how it's all
57:15 financed who gives a [ __ ] dude I mean
57:17 seriously who cares your your lie
57:19 doesn't need to be financed it just
57:20 stops right at lie
57:22 they'll make up any more stories okay
57:24 we're not in the era where we're gonna
57:27 be tolerating any more crappy [ __ ]
57:30 lies about this kind of stuff
57:31 we're into the truth right so why don't
57:34 you just cough up the fact that we
57:35 didn't go your show and you're not to be
57:40 believed ever again it's really tense
57:44 about to somebody I guess say that word
57:48 right tent amount ta to us getting the
57:53 world reset and then this guy shows up
57:56 and wants to put us back in the box of
57:58 line and then dupes a couple gullible
58:02 people into it now let's fast forward
58:05 with this theory boy they got an
58:09 antigravity this an antigravity tent and
58:12 boy UFOs are just all over the place
58:13 can't seem to stay in the air very long
58:15 because they always fall under the
58:17 ground less Bob Lazar has two PhDs that
58:19 he can't prove he's ever been in Boston
58:21 in this entire lifetime but got a PhD
58:23 there course from MIT doesn't own a
58:26 shirt this is MIT never took any
58:28 photographs of ever being there his
58:30 family doesn't know he got two PhDs but
58:32 he would he would technically be one of
58:36 the smartest people on this planet and
58:39 would not go uncelebrated by his fellow
58:42 classmates he would now go uncelebrated
58:44 by his fellow professors I guarantee you
58:47 I guarantee you
58:49 if anyone had you call my physics
58:50 professor in high school and you asked
58:54 him my name you say what about this dude
58:56 this is this guy is he really smart or
58:57 whatever he would stop you and tell you
59:01 my legacy he's like I've said before
59:05 like I called him once about ten years
59:07 ago and I was like you know I just want
59:09 to tell you I love you death and thank
59:10 you so much your education has literally
59:13 launched my whole career because it took
59:16 everything from mathematics and
59:17 astronomy and sound waves and physics
59:22 and computer class and it's just amazing
59:24 dude and he told me he goes he's you
59:26 were a pain in the ass because but you
59:29 were my second favorite student I was
59:31 like oh and I told you guys recently but
59:33 one thing he said was he goes I ask a
59:36 question and he goes you would give me
59:37 the dictionary encyclopedia definition
59:40 in two seconds and he was like I don't
59:42 know where you came from because I've
59:44 taught for 30 plus years and never had
59:46 anyone ever do that before you were
59:48 since you know and so it's like Bob
59:52 lazarre's got all this he's just like 50
59:55 times over my head right doesn't know
59:57 what doesn't know the gravity is in a
59:59 phenomenon give me a break man we're
60:02 following these folks that create these
60:04 romantic stories I don't know why Bob
60:05 did his thing he's a fraudster in the
60:07 first place right I like the guy I mean
60:10 I like him as an entertainer I like the
60:13 way he thinks because he's sort of
60:14 advanced a few interesting theories the
60:18 1/15 theory is really cool a crystal
60:21 that have resonated with a little bit of
60:22 power creates in an electromagnetic wave
60:26 which could be routed through the
60:27 architecture of the ship down to the
60:30 antimatter engines which then get
60:31 infinite power to then which he doesn't
60:34 even understand he says the crates of
60:36 gravity bubble it doesn't know the ether
60:38 exists but he's talking about gravity
60:39 bubbles like the [ __ ] is wrong with this
60:42 dude he stopped his scam back in the
60:46 late 90s early or late 80s early 90s and
60:49 he never researched any more technology
60:51 that you can get to II throw Sciences
60:53 it's like if Bob Lazar had said gravity
60:58 is not a phenomenon it's ether it's
61:00 Faraday - Tesla and everybody in between
61:02 you figured it out then we could all go
61:04 home all right this dude's legit maybe
61:07 they did erase his pass and all this
61:08 other stuff he has no excuse if that's
61:12 were to do today right 4/20 what's up
61:15 trying to get when they announced it in
61:17 2014 they announced project Orion ok
61:22 apparently we don't know how to go there
61:23 Van Allen belts because project Orion's
61:25 entire Charter was to put man safely
61:26 through the Van Allen belts
61:28 oopsie then they cancelled the project
61:30 to the public then actually launched the
61:33 flight Bart Saburo calls them and asks
61:36 them to release the data on how deadly
61:38 the Van Allen belts were they told him
61:40 it was classified what was the point of
61:43 Project Orion if she got anti-gravity
61:45 ships why would you ever breed like
61:49 something like that again when I told
61:53 you my episode replacing NASA which was
61:57 a month and a half before Donald Trump
61:59 announced the space force which it
62:01 typically follows what I told you I
62:03 would do in that episode I told you I
62:08 said look if the military created an
62:10 anti-gravity vehicle all they would have
62:15 to do is black box the engine no one
62:17 could look inside but it creates the
62:19 field and it gives you the power to do
62:20 this right so given that NASA is
62:23 obviously trusted by the military
62:25 because NASA has more jurisdiction on an
62:29 Air Force Base than the Air Force has
62:31 right if you have any proximity to a
62:37 massive University give you a little
62:40 thing you can do to really convince
62:42 yourself of how predominant these
62:43 industries are go find the aerospace
62:47 wings of any one of the colleges and
62:50 they have full jurisdiction in the
62:52 college they don't answer to anybody but
62:55 they get paid they make their own hours
62:58 they do their own thing they are God on
63:01 campuses so NASA is ultimately trusted q
63:06 clearance levels they are so the
63:10 military had this vehicle you don't need
63:13 the Van Allen belt tester called the
63:15 project Orion you
63:16 would never need that ever in fact they
63:20 wouldn't have had to have destroyed all
63:22 of the fake
63:23 well not the fake but the incapable of
63:27 getting to the moon schematics of the
63:28 saturn v lunar module service module
63:31 they wouldn't have to get rid of those
63:32 schematics all they would have to do is
63:34 say okay you see that lunar module thing
63:36 you see okay so there's that goofy
63:38 little compartment up above with all the
63:40 tent poles and shower curtains and bad
63:42 aluminum that doesn't even seal the
63:43 vehicle off and the [ __ ] photographs
63:45 okay that little compartment down below
63:48 that has the 10,000 pound thrust engine
63:50 all that's just for show what's in that
63:52 compartment is the black box is
63:54 anti-gravity so that little maneuver to
63:56 turn and land on the moon well that's
63:58 all part of that bottom piece we don't
64:00 need to fake [ __ ] it really lands it
64:04 really does this thing it goes from
64:05 17,000 miles an hour to nothing in two
64:07 seconds fact it got there in one day not
64:10 six days great or whatever the D is I
64:13 can't remember but you would need
64:16 Project Orion you just smuggle that crap
64:19 into a new vehicle you launch it with
64:22 some saturday thing or some SpaceX thing
64:26 even SpaceX wouldn't have to know it's
64:28 inside they just go here the ship's
64:30 gonna make it there oh really that's
64:32 cool we'll put it in the Falcon nine
64:35 boom
64:36 but SpaceX is busy building like you
64:39 know Tonka toys that just fall over
64:40 because the wind blew hard they laid up
64:44 that that's spaceship just melted in its
64:47 own footprint they're making toys and
64:51 spending all of our money doing it I
64:53 think he loved us is about to pop I mean
64:56 that guy was like about to spill at all
64:59 but the thing is they're gonna use is is
65:02 in says there is Twitter feed to prove
65:04 that he was nuts and they're gonna bump
65:07 him off and say that he did it to
65:10 himself about you the dude needs to come
65:13 on this show hardcore why don't we start
65:16 out pounding his Twitter I can't do
65:18 it'll look bad you go to his Twitter you
65:19 know I usually get a better view by deep
65:21 thoughts man [ __ ] Jill Rogan I love Joe
65:25 but it'd be a much better interview on
65:27 this show
65:28 wouldn't let him slide as much but I
65:31 given massive respect in the last week
65:36 here they debated the mining rights of
65:38 the moon oh yeah because we're just
65:42 gonna go right back up there no problem
65:43 mm-hmm that's classified its class of
65:48 nature's classified the vennila bullets
65:50 are classified okay here's the thing
65:56 for this notion that they've their 50
65:59 years ahead of us a thousand years ahead
66:01 of us all that consists of Nazis right
66:03 that's how we got Eclipse the whole you
66:06 know spectrum of life it's like know
66:08 that most you are 1945 to 2020 right so
66:14 you're 75 years in the future that's all
66:20 you are
66:20 that's all you could possibly be in the
66:21 future because you can't add proverbial
66:25 belief you know a thousand years on to
66:27 the technology when all it took was
66:29 mankind to do it for the you know from
66:30 Nazi great again supposedly everybody
66:33 escaped no one ever talked about it the
66:36 entire time von Braun never said Oh what
66:38 kind of integrity were you talking about
66:40 you know I mean like saying something
66:43 just nuts but you're sitting at home
66:47 it's 1969 you're watching this Hollywood
66:52 lit Saturn five four I remember they
66:54 hired Hollywood to make the sign of five
66:56 look sexy it's gonna take off and it's
66:58 going to go to the moon now you solve
67:02 the technology on TV let's just say it
67:04 was all he did let's say everything
67:05 worked out just the way that they said I
67:07 did we're all full of [ __ ] okay so the
67:12 Russians saw the Saturn five did they
67:14 build one I mean he built a space
67:15 shuttle why did they build a Saturn five
67:17 they had this other thing it was really
67:18 cool with engines two-and-a-half times
67:20 more powerful than our engines because
67:22 we fly with their engines today designed
67:24 in the late 60s right so um they showed
67:31 every human being on earth to Saturn
67:33 five did anyone go in their backyard and
67:35 build a Saturn five and go to the moon
67:38 Andy Griffith tried in that one showing
67:41 it on TV
67:42 didn't work you have a single person
67:45 since 1972 is ever built the Saturn 5 or
67:49 anything like it in their backyard and
67:50 when to the moon these billionaires no
67:54 one's done it hmm
67:56 so apparently showing the public
67:59 technology that works at least it
68:03 launches right probably gets us in low
68:06 orbit now one's ever built that by
68:08 themselves so if someone showed us an
68:15 anti-gravity vehicle and we don't even
68:18 know how it works that no one can build
68:22 it well you don't think Russian
68:24 scientists if if we have figured it out
68:27 if everyone who told Sydney that there
68:29 was anti-gravity vehicle their way past
68:31 all this spending mercury centrifuge and
68:34 all this other stuff if their way past
68:36 that and it's in the first Iron Man
68:38 movie it's in the lobby of the first
68:40 Iron Man movie you don't think Russia
68:43 has attempted to do that what does
68:46 everybody on the same page about hiding
68:48 all the technology hmm merely showing us
68:53 something that we couldn't possibly
68:55 build doesn't expose the world to that
68:58 technology if you got some closet
69:00 billionaire somewheres like he-man
69:02 ability in anti-gravity view who because
69:05 I suddenly figured out and cracked or
69:06 had some guy telling me how to make a
69:07 zero-point energy system make this work
69:10 we would have supervillains they'd be
69:15 flying around and their vehicles a
69:16 terrorizing cities they would Isis would
69:20 have had them but they don't because it
69:23 doesn't exist
69:24 you know just 2020 for mission which I
69:29 guess has been postponed over and over
69:30 and over again I heard it went out to
69:32 2028 and then I heard recently that was
69:35 postponed again cuz it coronavirus so
69:38 funny you know remember when I said to
69:41 you guys one of the episodes back there
69:45 I said that maybe they know something's
69:48 coming which is why they've picked 2024
69:51 and so they know something's coming
69:53 therefore they can use that something
69:55 that's
69:56 to delay this mission definitely so they
69:59 never have to come up with the goods and
70:01 here we are the worlds are shut down mmm
70:03 coinkidink
70:05 maybe maybe not
70:08 2012 London Olympics I think for me all
70:13 right there's something I need to watch
70:17 to confirm this but if it's someone
70:21 bullshitting somebody else just in a
70:24 personal conversation I guess it's just
70:26 up to that person to believe it or not
70:28 and honestly it's not a global harm /
70:33 foul to public but if this person is
70:37 telling the world this stuff and trying
70:39 to get people to believe this stuff it
70:42 depends on how many people that they
70:44 attract and impact with this story it
70:48 blows me away there you know negotiating
70:50 the mining rights of the moon the other
70:54 thing you have to remember is that let's
70:57 just go back to the Nazi theory because
71:00 again it's so romantic I mean there's
71:02 just a platform for anyone to insert
71:04 whatever revisionist history they want
71:06 to do it you know do because it's like
71:08 you know we covered it all up after
71:09 World War two right and so they can say
71:13 they found black magic
71:14 you know museums or something in the
71:16 ground they can say they have you know
71:19 bases in the Antarctica if you had
71:24 anti-gravity anything think about this
71:28 today we have cellphones teeny-tiny and
71:32 massively powerful we've miniaturize you
71:35 know circuit board components we have
71:39 resistors that are so utterly tiny that
71:43 it would take you know you have to have
71:45 really amazing vision just to see them
71:48 on the board which is why most the folks
71:50 that service these miniaturized circuit
71:55 boards have to use microscope tables to
71:58 see they're about 1,300 bucks at the
72:00 cheapest cost but they go all the way up
72:02 to like 10 grand and you moved as you
72:04 take the PC apart you know I just had to
72:06 fix my old PC put it underneath and you
72:09 have to look at the screen
72:10 zoom it up and you do all your repairs
72:11 looking at the screen cuz it's so
72:13 teeny-tiny well let me ask you a
72:16 question did we just invent those
72:19 miniaturize things initially or did we
72:21 evolve to them we went through old tubes
72:26 right I had to fix my windows computer
72:30 it was a rectifier diode that blew out
72:35 my power supply was screwed up and it
72:37 put power into the unit thank god this
72:39 thing fry cuz it would have fried my old
72:41 computer but that's what that thing is
72:42 designed to do it's a little teeny tiny
72:45 thing I mean it I can't even I mean
72:47 maybe it's uh four millimeters and it's
72:53 the narrowest angle and maybe it's like
72:57 a quarter-inch long I ended up using a
73:00 big normal diode to repair it because my
73:05 pads were fried but if you go look at
73:08 old radios go look at that mr. Carlson's
73:10 lab channel on YouTube which if any of
73:12 you like to watch old fifties radio /
73:14 30s radios get repaired back to pristine
73:18 levels this guy will teach you
73:19 electronics but the old dialed
73:22 rectifiers back in the day were tubes
73:24 big giant tubes consequently when he
73:29 repairs the radio I don't think he's
73:31 ever had to replace a tube the entire
73:33 time I've seen it the tubes of the tubes
73:35 are like 70 to 80 to 90 years old man I
73:39 mean it's unbelievable and they still
73:41 work yeah some are 85 years old and they
73:45 still worked like a charm all he's doing
73:47 is replacing all the wax capacitors and
73:49 and resistors down below there's no
73:52 printed circuit boards it's all like
73:53 just Ghibli Jolly wires underneath right
73:57 well if the Germans were going from
74:00 there aviation technology and really the
74:04 peak of disclosed technology was the v2
74:07 rocket the v2 rocket is nothing shy of
74:10 absolutely massively brilliant
74:12 engineering considering they did it
74:14 under duress amazing and the idea that
74:18 somehow they had an NX group of
74:20 scientists off to the side who were way
74:21 smarter
74:23 then these v2 rocket guys creating a
74:25 zero gravity thing is for me
74:27 pretty damn absurd now could they have
74:30 some stuff on paper theories and stuff
74:32 sure but you don't have the power supply
74:35 if any of you have studied the v1 in the
74:37 v2 the big difference again as I
74:39 mentioned earlier in the episode was the
74:40 V ones basically had this like a plane
74:44 with wings right like a missile with
74:46 wings and it basically had this rocket
74:48 and it would boom over and all they did
74:51 was they knew that he would travel so
74:53 many miles per hour and that that would
74:55 travel miles on the ground and then they
74:57 would aeronautical versus ground miles
74:59 and when they knew it was over British
75:02 soil the rocket would just ended cycle
75:05 and it would fall on houses in South
75:08 England right and then the v2 s I
75:11 believe are the ones that actually
75:12 touched London but that was super
75:15 precise man it was the angle it was you
75:18 know the gyroscopes you know turning
75:19 everything I mean it was just
75:21 unbelievable however the gap between a
75:26 v2 rocket with all of its amazing state
75:30 of the art stuff we're talking no one on
75:32 earth had this technology the v2
75:35 technology at all take that to a friggin
75:39 antigravity vehicle you got to be
75:41 kidding me man that's I mean in terms of
75:44 the normal Moore's law you're talking
75:47 about Oh a couple hundred years I mean
75:50 maybe maybe less if we would stop
75:52 coveting technology but it's a big gap
75:55 man and I supposedly pulled this off in
76:00 a microsecond of time not only
76:03 theorized it but had built it tested it
76:07 and got it working so much that when the
76:09 Americans seized the technology and
76:11 remember the British were there too the
76:15 Germans are sorry the Russians were the
76:16 first people to take back lands from the
76:19 Germans and they're pissed because in
76:20 the history books we read it the other
76:21 way but they seized Berlin remember
76:25 Berlin goes way inside East Germany
76:27 Italy seized that land all the way up
76:29 they were all over the place but they
76:31 didn't bump into any laboratories they
76:33 never got
76:34 a person maybe maybe that's look at the
76:37 Dro but now what about all these other
76:40 theories that that I debunk with my own
76:43 logic which is you know that printed
76:45 circuit boards came from alien
76:47 technology at a Roswell fiber optics
76:50 came out of Roswell velcro came out of
76:53 Roswell
76:55 okay so extruded glass we've always
76:58 known that that carries light so fiber
77:01 optics is nothing more than a binary
77:04 system of flashing lights okay so we
77:06 we've been doing light you know I don't
77:10 even know what they call them the Morris
77:11 code lights that you find on Navy ships
77:12 right we've been doing that we before
77:15 the Navy you would do that you know
77:17 between guard towers in the 1800s right
77:20 because we have Morse code already which
77:22 was transmitting you know messages over
77:25 wires the again the story of Morse code
77:27 and telegrams is one of the most amazing
77:30 technological growth periods of of
77:34 mankind you can ever listen to because
77:37 the way that they had to get the wires
77:39 to carry the signal miles and miles and
77:41 miles and not lose its its amperage on
77:45 the wire it's just amazing the
77:48 brilliance they did so all I did was
77:50 soup it up with glass then they made it
77:51 out of like silicone and all those what
77:53 kind of things first printed circuits
77:55 hey once you serendipitously find the
77:59 taking silicon pour it out and then you
78:03 leave the lights on and it starts to eat
78:04 away and you come back the next day it's
78:06 there and thinner and thinner into ya
78:07 holes and you're like oh [ __ ] light is
78:09 actually burning this thing what's this
78:11 kind of a similar chemical reaction it
78:13 happens with film
78:15 all right well the stuffs very
78:17 conductive too so imagine we just create
78:19 a few logic gates you know boom KOCO
78:25 happens natural nature
78:29 it is literally the mating ritual of
78:32 plants they create little Barbie things
78:36 that look on animal fur and animal moves
78:39 around and cross pollinate a bunch of
78:40 flowers or insects can even do it
78:45 alright all those are gone now not alien
78:49 technology the thing is is that you
78:55 let's just say that thing I'm gonna beat
78:57 this up because it's for me it's just
78:59 there's so many things about this don't
79:00 make any sense right the thing is if you
79:03 had a fully tested antigravity vehicle
79:08 1:1 antigravity vehicle that's totally
79:10 working right remember we found those
79:12 UFO ships that they created which had
79:15 you know propellers on them and they had
79:18 little landing gears on them and stuff
79:19 it was silly looking right nothing close
79:21 to it and yes they had a stealth kind of
79:23 ship you know it looks like our b-2
79:24 bomber again ock tapes Chanute you guys
79:28 my towns home towns named after he came
79:31 up with the idea of shaping the fuselage
79:33 like a wing in the late 1800s Early 1900
79:36 it's okay so this wasn't mind-blowing
79:44 technology to find somebody did it okay
79:47 but now you have to go through all those
79:51 other stages of all the other technology
79:53 to get to the sandy gravity thing you
79:55 got to learn how to build the hull you
79:57 have to learn how to build the power
79:58 source
79:59 what's that power source what is it you
80:01 mean to tell me with the internet being
80:05 completely out there for at least 24
80:08 years where I always think 1996 is sort
80:10 of like the year where the world really
80:12 learned about the Internet right there's
80:16 not any serendipitous discoveries of
80:20 this technology by any other human being
80:21 sitting in their patio somewhere
80:24 something right nobody ever comes up oh
80:26 man I got a zero-point energy thing it's
80:28 this that in this right we can only be
80:31 created by MIT can only be created by
80:33 Caltech or Cambridge or Oxford or some
80:36 other high-end tech facility you just
80:38 can't even remotely bump into this
80:41 now we know that Stan Meyers created a
80:43 water fracturing engine there's been all
80:45 kinds of people that created similar
80:46 engines to that all right
80:50 there's no sign of any kind in German
80:57 weaponry which was amazing right there
81:00 they're machine guns were better than
81:02 all everyone else's machine guns their
81:04 tanks were better the planes were better
81:06 I mean everything they created was
81:08 better they have rocketry that was
81:10 weaponized unbelievable but none of it
81:14 needed anything close to the level of
81:16 technology required to create a fully
81:18 functional UFO now let me be my own
81:24 cynic because what I told my friend was
81:28 there was a video that I've mentioned
81:31 several times I actually found the URL
81:32 yesterday it was hard to find the
81:34 frickin video SuperDuper hard I don't
81:36 know what the deal is but there was the
81:41 dude who took an interview on project
81:44 disclosure he was from Peru well he
81:47 wasn't from parental thing but he was an
81:49 American soldier stationed in Peru they
81:51 were told an aircraft had crashed into a
81:53 mountain and for them to go look at it
81:55 assist I really could he tells the story
81:59 that took a long time to get down to the
82:00 vehicle that it was down in this lower
82:03 area from where they work spruce guy has
82:06 some hills or something and he goes down
82:08 there and he said it was a kind of a
82:11 tear shape vehicle slammed into the
82:12 mountain all kind of purple chrome
82:15 licking leakiness this sludge I'll put
82:19 it in the description of the video but
82:22 it was kind of like good down-to-earth
82:24 guy who just told a story I mean he was
82:27 just like he really seems credible to me
82:29 I don't know but he said that he once I
82:33 saw it their minds were blown and they
82:35 were kind of concerned because looked
82:36 like a bad impact but he said that as
82:39 soon as they got close to the vehicle
82:40 they got this sort of telepathic message
82:43 from the aliens inside telling the
82:45 soldiers outside they're okay not to
82:47 worry relax and said they all felt good
82:51 now seem like what he was saying was
82:53 they were kind of walked around in the
82:55 days of sort of comfort after this sort
82:58 of mental thing happened to them but
83:01 according to this guy blacc if I
83:04 remember this right black vehicles
83:07 descended on this guy
83:09 full antigrav and his shock and awe
83:15 soldiers came out of the vehicles
83:17 wearing black outfits all-american folks
83:22 he's American right so he's like kind of
83:26 a tough guy you know most like like a
83:28 like a Brooklyn kind of guy you know
83:30 it's like I'm not taking [ __ ] from
83:31 anybody but he said these dudes were
83:32 immediately very pissed off most I mean
83:37 again this speaks of low IQs response to
83:40 the situation in my opinion they were
83:43 yelling at the soldiers just like the
83:45 story from Roswell like what the [ __ ] he
83:47 doing here at the [ __ ] you should be
83:49 blah blah blah really cussing it was
83:50 like that was the big point of his story
83:52 he says they aren't yelling at me and
83:53 we're all kind of going who the [ __ ] are
83:55 you man but Jesus Christ where these
83:56 ships come from according this guy he
84:00 goes men somehow the US military's got
84:01 like a bunch of ships we don't even know
84:03 about did you show up
84:07 he said he was dragged into some he was
84:11 dragged back to his vehicle and I got to
84:15 rewatch this I should have realized
84:16 before you did this episode but I never
84:18 thought about it but he said he had the
84:21 bob lazar treatment where they kept
84:22 jabbing him in the gap with the gun and
84:24 saying he didn't see anything not gonna
84:26 say anything otherwise we'll kill you or
84:28 whatever they said I think he said they
84:30 held him for like 14 hours which is like
84:32 that's all day this is like really but
84:36 he said that you know he wasn't gonna
84:37 put up with their crap and he was gonna
84:39 tell his story so he did he told the
84:40 story it is the most like believable
84:43 witness I've ever ever ever heard in an
84:47 interview other than the Roswell people
84:49 for me it doesn't really change the moon
84:51 hoax thing because of all the death and
84:54 all the craziness and all the faux pas
84:56 they made you know but that's a several
85:00 years after the boom missions and so
85:04 what that story correlates for me more
85:07 is all the dudes talking to Sid meaner
85:09 maybe it's the one guy that keeps coming
85:10 back to said I don't know Sid his past
85:14 so he said didn't know anything back I
85:17 mean Sid sat down told me everything the
85:18 guy said it did sound like
85:24 it did sound like
85:28 the last time someone told said about
85:30 the stuff it was so complicated that or
85:35 maybe the guy was obvious kidding and
85:36 straight to SIDS face that he wasn't
85:38 able to kind of recall it and make it
85:40 make sense
85:42 but the lecture I saw in 65 the dude
85:45 basically drew a flying saucer and said
85:48 that if you could put a live
85:49 electromagnetic pole through the ship
85:51 that you would start creating an
85:53 interference wave with gravity and you
85:56 would be able to go anywhere you wanted
85:58 to I think one of the themes that I said
86:02 in one of my last videos but I want to
86:04 repeat it here in case you guys only
86:05 dial in for this video is this this
86:08 whole patronizing game that you hear
86:12 about which I believe is probably one of
86:15 their tactics internally is that someone
86:22 inside this organization hatch the
86:24 excuse to keep all this technology for
86:27 themselves by saying that the public
86:30 can't accept reality like you can handle
86:34 the truth right so they don't tell us
86:36 because we can't handle the truth well
86:39 isn't it amazing that all these people
86:41 who talk [ __ ] they can handle the truth
86:44 right they can always handle the truth
86:47 even if they're totally surprised by
86:49 another spaceship that lands with
86:51 another thing another objective another
86:53 alien race they're always completely
86:56 capable of of accepting the truth no
87:01 problem no one you ever hear goes to a
87:03 funny farm after they talk to an alien
87:05 or see a spaceship you never hear that
87:07 story they're always able to do it but
87:08 supposedly we're not able to do it I
87:12 want to suggest that for the rest of
87:14 your life if anyone passes that excuse
87:16 on you you need to just say [ __ ] that
87:22 that is completely stupid
87:24 sure all these cognitive dissidence
87:27 people that can't believe anything well
87:29 [ __ ] them don't whatever you show to
87:32 meeeee they're just gonna write a blank
87:34 check and say it doesn't exist anyway I
87:36 mean you could literally show it to
87:37 their face and they're gonna be like
87:38 that doesn't exist
87:39 you know I know I don't know what I'm
87:42 going to cognitive dissonance whatever
87:43 like but for the probably 98% of the
87:48 rest of the population we should be able
87:50 to see this stuff we should be able to
87:51 know these things
87:52 yeah we talked to aliens all the time
87:55 again the one thing that makes me think
87:57 that nothing's going on in the moon is
87:59 that we'd see it we'd see the activity
88:04 all right I mean there's a debate at
88:09 young cousin loons a big object crate
88:11 that if a ship went up there the idea is
88:14 that you couldn't see it well it depends
88:17 if you make the ship highly reflective
88:21 very moreish then maybe it's always
88:24 going to reflect enough of its happening
88:25 you know of its surroundings that are
88:27 kind of like emulates and blends in with
88:28 the surrounding well maybe that's the
88:30 case one could suggest if you can make
88:33 it a gravity bubble around a vehicle
88:35 that perhaps light wraps around it and
88:37 so it looks like a mirror anyway and
88:39 it's just kind of invisible as you know
88:41 it's in space is black on the moon it's
88:43 white and so you just wherever it is you
88:44 just can't see it
88:47 but unless they're building a base on
88:49 the Dark Side of the Moon for instance
88:52 anything they would build in standard
88:54 light you would start building a
88:57 structure you would start disturbing the
88:59 surface of the Moon from previous
89:00 photographs and then some one over time
89:02 get start to go that wasn't there before
89:06 yeah we can do before and afters in
89:08 Photoshop I think even though the the
89:12 moon does wobble and its orbit there's a
89:15 time-lapse photography of the moon
89:17 orbiting and and you can see it wiggle
89:20 in its spot you actually do see part of
89:22 the moon you don't see on some days and
89:24 then wiggles and you can see slightly
89:26 just who knows probably a mile of the
89:28 surface or whatever you can see a little
89:30 bit of it but when this are building
89:34 like on the edge of darkness you know
89:39 yeah would you want to work in like sub
89:42 Kelvin degrees when you could work in
89:47 the Sun you know you could take
89:49 advantage of solar power if you had it I
89:52 mean technically speaking with infinite
89:54 power you know Jesus you could just do
89:57 anything you wanted to but now let's
89:59 think about one of the other basic
90:01 things that kind of negates this whole
90:03 story so far what I've told you is that
90:08 NASA has this technology and the
90:11 government has this technology the
90:13 weaponized CIA kind of government right
90:15 wright-patterson Air Force Base kind of
90:17 [ __ ] right okay so who do you think was
90:22 involved in 9/11 was it Joe down the
90:25 street some neo-cons a little vanilla
90:28 pad and paper I keep Branston first
90:30 thing happens now the deepest darkest
90:35 intelligence agencies on planet earth or
90:38 a part of those hoaxes right
90:43 so why do they make so many mistakes if
90:46 they have all this thousand year in the
90:48 future technology why can't they pull
90:51 off one of their massacres without
90:53 massive massive mistakes follow the
90:57 super duper technology
90:58 why is everything they do look like [ __ ]
91:01 why are they caught the second they pull
91:03 anything nowadays super duper technology
91:06 trying to overthrow the world I mean
91:08 think about it the deep state who wants
91:12 to take over the world more than
91:15 anything on planet Earth they want to
91:18 take over the world they want to knock a
91:20 bunch of us off probably 99% and one of
91:24 our listeners to make a cool comment the
91:25 other day and I didn't see you till just
91:27 today he said that one of the stories he
91:32 read about the Georgia Guidestones is
91:34 that they were built 1979 everything
91:37 I've ever heard was the 81 but was is a
91:39 you know doesn't take multiple years to
91:41 build them think about it probably six
91:43 months to quarry out those big rocks and
91:44 get them all fitted was that it was the
91:48 belief that supposedly in 1979 there was
91:51 going to be an apocalyptic war of
91:53 nuclear weapons and that this was the
91:55 message to the survivors of the nuclear
91:57 holocaust
91:58 oh yeah it's all [ __ ] I mean it's
92:01 like give me a break
92:02 I'm not criticizing the person bringing
92:04 to come and I very much appreciate the
92:06 comment but one we were in no nuclear
92:10 threat in 1979 go back and rewind
92:12 everything that was in the movie
92:14 theaters in 1979 the culture of America
92:17 the culture of Russia we were not in the
92:20 nuclear threat envelope okay and there
92:23 was a few those nerds that keep dying
92:25 that clock the prediction of when we're
92:27 gonna have the Holocaust I mean [ __ ] off
92:29 already right the fear clock look at the
92:32 fear clock to be feared into something
92:34 right 79 might have been one of the best
92:37 years in American history no one's gonna
92:39 be predicting the apocalypse right
92:41 unless they you have the button already
92:42 gonna be pressed right but to if that
92:46 was the true Charter of those stones
92:50 then we we got past it right it got past
92:54 this nuclear holocaust
92:56 so the secrecy of who owns the [ __ ]
92:57 things doesn't need to continue to exist
93:00 they can be torn down now we made it
93:02 past it you don't have to retrofit in
93:04 two hundred and 2015 stone towards the
93:07 top and then take it out later this is
93:10 an agenda twenty one thing period right
93:13 it is okay
93:15 let's just get that other way before we
93:16 move on here but okay so we see them
93:22 trying to do the slow-cook coronavirus
93:25 completely a deep state move pre-planned
93:28 simpsons in 1996 George magazine with
93:33 Bill Gates 97 2012 London Olympics
93:37 Tilley an accent right in front of your
93:38 face and then of course all the [ __ ]
93:41 stuff we've seen this year okay planned
93:44 emic scam demmick whatever you want to
93:46 call it death rates over exaggerated by
93:49 probably a factor of 10 okay and only
93:53 triggered because Trump became president
93:55 right that this whole thing had to occur
93:57 okay if you wanted to take over the
94:02 world and have all the super duper
94:04 anti-gravity technology from 1945
94:06 reflects sake and this von Braun threat
94:09 of an alien invasion thing not one he
94:14 was saying that before he died in 78
94:16 okay let's do a little bit of math here
94:18 45 all the 50s all the 60s almost all
94:22 the 70s it's 35 years roughly they
94:24 already had all the technology they were
94:25 incubating this thing and they had
94:27 already flown to the moon according this
94:28 guy so you got the invasion locked down
94:32 and you just make a few hundred of these
94:34 vehicles some of them maybe drone driven
94:36 some human driven whatever and you just
94:39 fly them all over the world and you
94:40 freak everybody out and you make one
94:42 land and you fake a bunch of guys
94:44 getting a house and the hybrid children
94:46 or whatever there's a Fatah TAS weird
94:48 language and then I'll Klaatu Barada
94:51 nikto and then they leave and they're
94:53 like okay they want us all to be under
94:54 the same roof and if we get under the
94:56 same roof one economy tattoos on
95:00 everyone's arms and you know mark of the
95:02 devil or whatever and then we're all
95:05 gonna get the next batch of goodness
95:07 from these guys and poof the whole herd
95:09 jumps
95:09 and that would have happened trust me
95:13 it's frustrating is great it would be
95:16 like a aliens boom let's get under 1 new
95:20 world government but they realize they
95:22 can't do it well this corner virus has
95:24 taught them how much we love freedom the
95:28 ass-whoopin hasn't even really begun yet
95:30 and they were probably gonna call
95:31 everything off and everything start
95:32 before they even occurs which is good
95:34 but let's just run their scenario for
95:37 they've got all the super duper
95:38 technologies thousands of years in
95:40 advance ok but they want to have the
95:42 whole world to themselves let me give
95:46 you cancer it's sort of a morbid subject
95:50 of them killing us all off or it's
95:52 pretty morbid right if you're gonna
95:54 commit a crime and you're well if you're
96:00 gonna commit a crime then you sort of
96:02 have to worry about society coming after
96:04 you for the crime right there's people
96:06 did that is that are still in existence
96:08 after the crime occurs and they're gonna
96:12 come after you and they're gonna sue you
96:14 and they're gonna put you in jail and
96:15 they're gonna try you and they're gonna
96:17 put you you know maybe to death or at
96:18 least keep you in a prison for the rest
96:19 your life depending on the magnitude of
96:21 your crime but what if as a result of
96:25 your crime there are no more people left
96:28 any major bill amount of people that can
96:31 do anything to you and if they've seen
96:32 you kill 99 percent the world
96:36 still leaves a couple hundred billion
96:38 people on planet Earth but they're all
96:39 distributed all around the place that's
96:41 easy to herd them you got dynamic Boston
96:43 dynamic robots can come in and [ __ ] you
96:44 up if that's the case what are you
96:47 worried about you kill off any one who
96:51 could descend against you you kill off
96:54 everyone that could ever rise up a hand
96:55 against you of the 200 million people
96:58 that you have left we just run your
97:00 database of social media dissidents and
97:03 anyone who was ever awake goes to Lyon a
97:05 or b in the fema camps and gets
97:07 annihilated immediately okay we just
97:10 killed off all the dissidents
97:11 alright so out of the people who are
97:13 left they're all serfs they're all
97:15 people who sell their freedom to get
97:19 Liberty so if they had all this tech
97:23 we'd be gone by now
97:26 hundred percent deep state would say
97:29 yeah why are we why we slow-cooking the
97:31 frog take this [ __ ] knife and just
97:33 stab him right through the heart slice
97:35 him in half
97:37 done done get rid of all these people
97:40 that bother us right Oh No
97:44 but pretty sure they could drop a virus
97:46 here in their did a really killer
97:48 bastard right hopefully none of us see
97:51 that in our lifetime but I fear that
97:52 we're all gonna get a front seat to that
97:55 [ __ ] nightmare if no one grows any
97:57 balls and arrests these people I mean
98:00 it's gonna really be frustrating he just
98:02 throws out there it's gonna be really
98:04 frustrating if you know all of our
98:07 neighbors start dying you say you're one
98:09 of the lucky few did not get this stuff
98:11 in your system and you're you wake up
98:13 late like I do and you work all night
98:15 and you wake up and your neighbors are
98:16 all pulling the ground you go back
98:18 inside old [ __ ] you know they dropped it
98:21 bin and and Q is out there going well
98:24 you know we gotta we gotta get all this
98:26 stuff legally put together and all else
98:28 you can just arrest people because we
98:29 know they're criminals you know you're
98:30 gonna do this other stuff and if no one
98:34 grows and evolves in the next six months
98:36 or so we start pulling these people off
98:38 the street and getting them incarcerated
98:40 some big people big people that are
98:42 infiltrators and crazy [ __ ]
98:45 then you don't keep you don't secure
98:47 their money
98:48 that they can pay someone to hurt you so
98:52 again I think that because of all the
98:55 flubs they've ever done their group is
99:00 really small in my opinion a lot of
99:03 people think you know this this dude was
99:05 pitching this idea that it's a 70/30
99:07 split seventy percent of the people are
99:10 good in these intelligence agencies and
99:12 thirty percent are bad I mean 30 percent
99:14 such I gain the portion of any
99:16 intelligence agency right was most
99:20 disappointing about the way this
99:21 information was brought to me is that
99:26 you I mean if you're a true red pillar
99:30 and I don't know anyone in our group
99:32 that is it is like this but when you put
99:40 forth you prioritize your need to hear
99:43 good news over truth you're a very
99:47 dangerous person to society and you're
99:52 very dangerous to be a person spreading
99:54 information because you're spreading
99:56 lies so that you don't have a problem
99:58 sleeping tonight you shouldn't have any
100:00 problem sleeping at night knowing the
100:02 truth as bad as it might be at least we
100:06 know and if someone's getting fully
100:08 exposed like a Bill Gates even though
100:10 it's frustrating to you that the guy's
100:12 not in jail for all the shitty is in
100:15 Africa for all this stuff he's done in
100:16 India
100:17 I mean why they haven't publicly stated
100:21 as a government Bill Gates is the one of
100:25 the most wanted men in the world and
100:27 according to our intelligence and sorta
100:29 our group because he's given 47,000
100:32 people polio sterilized half a million
100:34 people in Africa and quite easily met
100:36 that much but almost about 450 million
100:39 every one 50,000 excuse me you know
100:45 again I want to make sure we all check
100:50 ourselves we're not that kind of person
100:54 if someone comes in and tells us a sweet
100:57 story that just cleans the slate of all
101:00 of our concerns Oh
101:01 wasn't like that was like this and it
101:03 makes no [ __ ] sense whatsoever
101:04 logically but you're like nom nom nom
101:07 you're just eating it all and it becomes
101:09 your your mantra hey it's okay if you're
101:14 all by yourself and you're just feeling
101:16 better now it's [ __ ] in yourself but
101:20 it's still not healthy we know that we
101:25 believe a bunch of we as the population
101:28 of this planet we still believe a bunch
101:31 of crap that is false I mean it's almost
101:36 too much to even mildly mention I
101:39 mentioned all the time on the show so I
101:40 won't bore you too much with the but you
101:42 know history of the Egyptians the
101:46 burning of the Alexander library
101:48 you know there's pretty good evidence
101:51 that maybe like your Jezza would serve
101:53 the budding Jesuit someone in there and
101:55 got all the books out why the hell
101:56 wouldn't you take everything that's
101:57 coveted and then burn the place down
101:59 you're still stealing it from the people
102:01 because you're gonna covet it to
102:03 yourself you know one of the things
102:06 about um I guess this vehicle is drove
102:10 by my house I like a freaking the Sun
102:12 what the park brake on or somebody and a
102:16 freaking spaceship but you know if the
102:21 I mean this is kind of off topic but
102:23 this is on the topic of us coming to
102:24 grips with reality you know there's this
102:29 and I alluded to it in an episode I
102:32 think knowing your enemies but the whole
102:35 idea that we're coward again
102:41 two lies so that we don't have to ingest
102:44 something that hurts our feelings but
102:47 those people that hurt our feelings by
102:50 doing things that if we knew what they
102:51 did we'd be floored right especially
102:56 famous celebrities
102:58 if there's any truth to that and again
103:00 we've heard rumor rumor rumor yes we see
103:03 the satanic ritualism Super Bowl and all
103:07 the award shows yeah we see all a stuff
103:09 trust me but it still just shy of like
103:15 proof that things are happening that
103:17 have been alluded to it's all based on
103:20 that that thing that people gain handle
103:22 it so we can tell you the truth okay
103:26 I was watching the Q boards all day
103:27 today and at one point a chant her a can
103:30 went down somebody was posting a bunch
103:35 of cartoon I guess you could call it
103:40 child porn and there was no action going
103:44 on there was only one character was
103:45 always a little girl and it was always
103:47 like Japanese anime but it was like all
103:49 this sick little drawings of little kids
103:52 and so I was posting a constantly fine
103:54 the moderator woke up and started
103:56 reporting it like crazy this time I
103:58 reported so much of the stuff that they
104:00 said it can't you can't report anymore
104:01 your cue is too long and where the
104:03 hell's my cue pardon the pun but someone
104:06 clean it all off then got but people
104:09 were pissed they're like okay your help
104:11 you're dragging your feet on this [ __ ]
104:13 for whatever [ __ ] reason you're
104:14 dragging your feet on it and but you
104:17 tell us you've got everything right and
104:20 again everyone's yelling you LARP at the
104:21 camera right now I understand but you
104:24 know you know what you know it's just
104:29 like nuts like these people do get to
104:30 run around the world and I mean
104:34 there's gonna be a day of reckoning when
104:38 it comes down to when did you have this
104:41 informations like all these people were
104:43 arrested and stuff right and so we then
104:48 learn the whole story right the thing
104:50 you keep saying let me the greatest
104:52 story ever written the you know in the
104:54 history of mankind but Papa but there's
104:56 gonna be a point when some parent gets
104:59 the real data but it's all fully
105:02 disclosed let's just say it happens okay
105:04 go with me on this but they used to have
105:08 a kid that kid disappeared and when they
105:14 find out the truth they can deduce this
105:17 to say that one of these crazies grabbed
105:20 their kid he did something horrific with
105:23 their child and then they learn oh you
105:28 could have stopped this person way back
105:31 in 2017 but to insulate my feelings you
105:34 let my kid get kidnapped by these people
105:36 tortured murdered whatever and then you
105:41 pull the trigger in 2021 late 2020 maybe
105:44 then you're gonna try to tell me to my
105:46 face you couldn't have done something
105:47 earlier I don't know man I don't know
105:52 how God works but if your God figuring a
105:55 soul and you're sitting on this
105:56 information I mean you got this is what
106:00 this is what just pisses me off right
106:02 you got Comey former head of the FBI
106:06 admitting that he's leaked false
106:08 information to pump up a dossier it's
106:11 all fake he's leaked everything I mean
106:15 shift leaked everything out of it out of
106:17 his hearings the second he could but he
106:18 you can't listen to his earrings in the
106:20 basement of the Capitol building right
106:21 which has now been transcribed we're
106:23 waiting for the [ __ ] file dump on
106:25 that okay so we've seen how they work
106:30 they leaked all right
106:33 what about Anthony Weiner's computer
106:37 information how about leaking a little
106:39 bit more of that maybe nothing horrific
106:42 but something that's going to really you
106:44 know some famous person in a really
106:45 awkward situation maybe it's even an on
106:47 legal situation but it's like whoa I
106:50 never saw a town meetings look like that
106:52 before something right Hillary's oh no
106:54 we're compromising position something
106:56 they're not playing with you know fire
107:00 against fire they're like oh we got the
107:03 fire truck right here it's full of water
107:06 he's got all the firemen ready to go to
107:07 put this fire out but we're waiting for
107:09 the fire to get really busy before we
107:11 put it out meanwhile your shits burning
107:14 right in front of your face right what
107:15 do you mean you put it out man all my
107:18 photo albums are right there on that
107:19 side of the building it's not even on
107:20 fire light it up no we're gonna wait for
107:23 that room to be completely engulfed in
107:24 flames and as soon as your photos are
107:26 completely destroyed we'll turn on the
107:28 hose is basically what we're being sold
107:31 right now but I mentioned this because
107:34 you know it's enough already right is it
107:37 aren't you - just had enough oh and this
107:41 guys running around pitching all these
107:42 other lies so we'd get back into an
107:44 envelope of complete [ __ ] history I
107:47 just feel like some people are old
107:49 enough that but teddy bear that is the
107:53 moon missions they just can't put it
107:56 down it's like the crack pipe they just
107:59 can't put it down it calls to them save
108:02 me save me
108:04 Oh missions I will save you you know you
108:09 know I mean they there's talk of like
108:10 pardons that were handed down before
108:13 Obama left office everyone's pardon it's
108:15 like sorry we're just gonna wipe those
108:17 off the face of the planet you don't
108:19 have a pardon I'm sorry and you know
108:21 yeah maybe we will write the legislation
108:22 on how a pardon is given by the
108:24 president united states they are
108:26 revocable especially if it's a
108:29 treasonous decried there's no pardon for
108:31 treason no you know maybe an agent had
108:36 to sell a kilo of coke to some drug
108:38 dealer in South America which is kind of
108:40 the opposite what he buys it from or
108:42 goes through some drug deal that catches
108:43 a cartel guy and you want a pardon that
108:45 dude because it was illegal technically
108:47 for him to get involved in a drug deal
108:49 but she pulled off a deed off the
108:51 streets who was providing metric tons of
108:53 cocaine or heroin to America hey that's
108:56 a that's a cost-benefit analysis that we
108:59 can all live with right
109:01 start leaking the truth you know one of
109:05 Q's whole tactics is to ask everything
109:07 in questions which is supposedly
109:10 absolving him of breaking any federal
109:12 law I didn't tell them anything I asked
109:13 him everything and then they had to do
109:15 research on their own to find out what
109:16 it is okay that's a nice game
109:18 that's a nice game maybe it's not you
109:20 cute that leaks this stuff maybe you
109:21 pretend to be in a non you come into
109:23 your own feed after you make a post we
109:25 have 700 posts 750 replies and somebody
109:29 just starts shoving up the photographs
109:31 starts just really pointing out all the
109:34 truth it's not you man it's somebody
109:36 else they're anonymous so you can't
109:38 catch him maybe not on the game one
109:39 catches chocolate porn poster that was
109:42 just up on the boards right I could just
109:46 I was just watching that today I was
109:48 like oh my god this is gonna be someone

109:52 because they're gonna say that someone
109:54 was you know the child porn is on the
109:55 board I mean you know what that's that's
109:57 probably why it's up there
110:00 anytime that guy tells you no anytime

110:45 gone on I've interested in any rumors
110:49 you've heard around those story lines
110:51 any other logic that you can apply to
110:53 this to knock it out
110:55 criticism welcomed as well I just don't
110:59 buy it for all the reasons I just
111:02 lamented anyway if you have many deep
111:06 thoughts radio Calm please go that's the
111:08 central hub for it all I feel like we're
111:10 writing on like you know very nice a
111:12 little bit with the channel on YouTube
111:14 so I haven't heard the channel getting
111:17 banned for a really long time but they
111:18 supposedly took down 200 channels
111:21 related to disagreeing with things the
111:24 official narrative so let's just see if
111:25 us keeping a little bit diverse kind of
111:28 ironically rides the the truth margin
111:31 like the twilight zone did back in the
111:33 day
111:34 but that's why you need to bookmark deep
