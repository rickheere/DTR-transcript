00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:27 [Music]
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen
00:37 now truth be told this is the first
00:39 episode i've recorded for
00:40 season six as my three computers are
00:43 blasting away frames in there
00:46 some of these frames are taking over two
00:48 hours of pop
00:51 crazy so it'll turn out pretty cool
00:55 okay today's episode which you've
00:58 already seen the title
01:01 is i almost wish i could hide the title
01:03 until
01:05 after it uh kind of gets to a few
01:07 minutes but
01:08 then again you wouldn't click on it what
01:11 if
01:14 you were the controlling elite of this
01:16 world
01:18 by elite we mean a pedophile psychopath
01:21 satanists and you wanted to
01:26 change the world you wanted a problem
01:27 reaction solution
01:30 mechanism to continue and continue and
01:32 continue
01:35 and in order to get a ever increasingly
01:38 educated group of people
01:40 although there seems to be an ample
01:42 amount of uneducated people
01:44 to support you you needed them to
01:47 believe
01:48 that was everything was the opposite of
01:50 what it really is
01:52 and you needed them strung out on a
01:54 bunch of
01:56 things that are just
01:59 completely false but entertaining
02:03 to sort of gain credibility with the
02:05 people
02:06 so you can vent certain historical
02:10 claims to the past that make a
02:12 particular
02:13 group of people feel good
02:16 but then you need to launch one foe
02:19 science after another
02:23 it to convince the people that they have
02:26 problems that they don't have that the
02:27 world has problems
02:28 like physical problems climate problems
02:32 fresh water problems all these problems
02:35 problems problems
02:37 and let's just say that you were a
02:39 person who
02:41 really really likes smart people
02:45 intelligent people people who think for
02:48 themselves
02:48 and create wonderful things you love
02:50 what they create
02:53 and you would love to be as intelligent
02:54 as they are but
02:56 learning that's for suckers studying
02:58 well i don't quite get it
03:01 i got a degree in one thing it has
03:03 nothing to do with any of this other
03:04 stuff
03:06 and so i feel like because i've got a
03:07 degree in this other thing i don't need
03:09 to do any research
03:11 on other things
03:15 what i'm describing is the platform of
03:18 their wish for society today
03:21 i'm not sure what they call it when
03:24 they're able to create one of these
03:25 people
03:26 to convert someone who perhaps 20 years
03:28 ago wasn't this way
03:30 and today they are on overcharge
03:34 in this particular direction of what i'm
03:37 going to call
03:38 the stupid expert or stupid experts
03:41 plural
03:43 they're all over the place aren't they
03:47 and depending on your background it's
03:49 either very easy to find a stupid expert
03:52 or maybe you're just more cautious more
03:55 intelligent
03:56 and even it will which leads to the idea
03:59 that if you don't know something you
04:00 don't chime in that you do
04:02 you might repeat what you've heard but
04:03 you keep it at arm's length and go well
04:05 you know i'm not an expert in that i
04:06 haven't
04:07 been able to stop my life and do
04:09 research in it but i did hear from
04:11 some folks that are pretty
04:14 fairly well received in terms of
04:17 original thinking that sort of thing
04:19 and they seem to disagree a little bit
04:22 so i don't know
04:24 either one of those positions is healthy
04:25 you either have the expertise
04:28 or you're cautious you don't believe
04:31 everything that you're told
04:33 now i was told the definition when i was
04:36 young
04:37 of the word stupid and i was taught
04:41 the difference between the words stupid
04:43 and ignorant
04:46 ignorance is predominantly an innocent
04:52 perspective of a particular subject
04:54 could be life could be a particular
04:56 science and what that means is you
04:58 simply haven't heard
05:00 anything about that a stupid person
05:04 is much different in a nice subtle way
05:09 they have been shown the truth
05:12 at least perhaps in the most cynical
05:15 form they have been shown
05:16 several things that could be the truth
05:19 and they
05:20 simply choose to ignore all the
05:23 empirical evidence that matches
05:25 observable reality
05:26 in order to go for perhaps what is
05:30 viewed as the most popular perspective
05:32 of a particular piece of science or
05:34 information now there's the word dumb
05:39 which is a little bit different in my
05:41 take of life for me
05:43 dumb would be a person who
05:47 may lack the genetic ability
05:50 to absorb information and ever
05:52 understand it i think those people are
05:54 extremely rare
05:55 sometimes it's due to abuse and trauma
05:58 by which their mind is so preoccupied
06:00 with psd
06:01 algorithms of previous experiences that
06:05 new information has a hard time making
06:07 it through the constant
06:08 defense mechanism to fight off the
06:10 demons from the past
06:13 and again ptsd is a traumatized event
06:16 that is lost in time however the
06:20 horrific effect of the trauma is still
06:23 affecting the human being so they can
06:25 feel the trauma in their chest they can
06:27 feel it in their person
06:28 it could get in the way of speaking
06:30 clearly perhaps a person who stutters
06:33 might have had something traumatic
06:35 happen they tried to express
06:36 themselves and there was always someone
06:38 there to interrupt them
06:39 abuse them so they never quite feel
06:43 comfortable
06:44 just speaking clearly because when you
06:46 can get someone
06:48 who is kind of on the fence between
06:50 stuttering and not stuttering and if you
06:52 can make them feel comfortable
06:54 they tend to sing a song beautifully
06:56 with every word they speak
06:57 and it's perfect and then usually
07:01 they can conquer their stuttering by
07:04 manifesting that feeling in themselves
07:06 right
07:07 so i rarely use any i really use the
07:10 word dumb in any true context you know
07:12 you might tell that's dumb
07:14 but towards a person a little bit
07:16 different
07:18 but stupid is a conscious effort
07:22 to ignore options to ignore
07:26 that which matches observable reality
07:29 now
07:29 to their defense when you have a group
07:33 of
07:33 trillionaires if not quadrillionaires
07:36 financing fake observations
07:40 scientific data that comes in on a piece
07:42 of paper
07:44 that may claim a particular situation
07:48 well as disinformation and if they trust
07:50 those organizations
07:52 meaning they don't think for themselves
07:54 and quite frankly everyone should be
07:55 able to trust their governments they
07:57 should be able to trust
07:58 unbiased unslanted news none of that
08:01 exists anymore
08:03 governments are totally infiltrated
08:05 worldwide by all levels of criminals
08:08 sometimes they are infiltrated by
08:10 criminals that have
08:12 done their deeds in the past
08:16 and have always looked forward to the
08:18 time when they
08:19 don't have to use those techniques to
08:20 exist probably very rare
08:23 once you figure out a way to make things
08:25 work you tend to keep using those ways
08:27 so if you were a gangster and you become
08:29 a president you
08:30 tend to become again get to continue to
08:32 be a gangster
08:33 which is why some of us like people
08:36 who have no history of being in that
08:38 method and
08:40 even though they might not be the most
08:41 refined human being
08:44 for the kaleidoscope of people out there
08:46 listening we still
08:48 understand their intent and sin in my
08:51 opinion
08:52 is intent i intend to hurt you
08:55 therefore i'm sinning i didn't mean to
08:57 hurt you that was an accident
08:59 well my bad i need to learn from that
09:01 but it wasn't necessarily a premeditated
09:04 sin against you now i've done you know
09:07 numerous episodes
09:09 on pop science topics i even have one
09:13 called pop science
09:16 and it's a platform that we have to
09:20 disassemble
09:22 but i wanted to do this episode because
09:24 it will take a slightly different angle
09:27 we're aware of a lot of bogus science
09:30 we're aware of a lot of bogus history
09:34 and we are aware of the pundits that
09:36 they
09:37 finance into positions
09:40 of authority who
09:44 will take a paycheck to destroy the
09:47 human race
09:50 and i actually believe that in some of
09:52 their demented minds
09:54 that to the degree they really hate
09:56 themselves
09:58 it's almost the medicine to get back in
10:02 society
10:04 i think in some rare cases people feel
10:06 super enlightened
10:08 to talk about you know extinguishing
10:11 humanity from the world
10:14 but we're strapped to this planet aren't
10:16 we
10:18 i mean unless we're in the dream world
10:20 unless we're astral projecting
10:22 if you're able to do that i don't think
10:23 i am that's a dream is what that is
10:27 we're stuck here so the metaphor i keep
10:31 throwing out there to you guys
10:32 in the last six months here is the jet
10:36 you're on a passenger jet being driven
10:38 by these stupid experts
10:41 they're panicking when they don't need
10:43 to panic and they're not panicking when
10:45 they need to panic
10:46 so they worship celebrities that are
10:48 satanists
10:50 right they don't panic i think that's
10:53 the greatest thing and they get mad at
10:54 you
10:55 when you remind them that these people
10:57 are showing up to maria bronovich
10:59 parties
11:00 cutting cakes up in the shapes of human
11:01 beings
11:03 i was at dinner the other night with a
11:05 friend of mine
11:07 gwen stefani song comes on now we all
11:10 loved her before she started showing up
11:12 but maria branovich
11:14 parties posing in front of the cake
11:17 you know this is great totally total
11:20 sacrifice of a human being in the form
11:22 of a
11:22 i don't know 100 000 cake
11:26 and so this there you should just kind
11:28 of tap into the music and i said you
11:29 know this is
11:31 this is one of them man i still like the
11:34 song though
11:35 oh yeah okay and i like probably a lot
11:38 of products made by a lot of these folks
11:42 i'm slowly changing my ways because i
11:44 need to
11:45 get that energy away from me you know
11:49 i have to say you know you'll see me
11:50 recording hundreds of shows
11:53 wearing my the antwerp
11:58 and i got into their music i got into
12:00 their videos i thought they were
12:01 something extremely original i mean they
12:03 are
12:05 the more i listen to lyrics and i look
12:07 at these symbolism on the album covers
12:09 they're done now they're not going to
12:10 make any more albums
12:12 i don't know where they are
12:16 they you know he talks about you know
12:19 the mark of the beast and that was part
12:20 of his success thing you know i just
12:22 recently realized that's what he was
12:24 saying
12:26 it's a bummer when you find out that
12:27 some of these folks that you have
12:29 adopted into your circle of influence
12:34 are some of these people you know
12:37 and that's what's happened with a lot of
12:38 these
12:40 i don't even know what we call these
12:41 neil degrasse tysons these bill nye the
12:44 douchebag guys
12:45 what do we call these people who aren't
12:47 like carl sagan
12:48 carl sagan believes everything that he
12:50 said i don't necessarily believe he was
12:52 in any weird
12:54 eyes wide shut party
12:58 i think that when you have a person who
13:00 is falling for
13:02 the science that you want out there and
13:05 he's very well educated
13:06 very well delivered person you just keep
13:08 funding his shows
13:09 because he keeps putting it out there
13:10 and it's like a freebie right hey we
13:12 didn't have to make him drink blood you
13:13 know he doesn't take adrenal farms man
13:15 it's cool
13:16 he just goes out there and destroys
13:18 tesla through faraday's work
13:20 by constantly uttering the meanderings
13:24 of one albert einstein
13:26 a complete and utter fraud but why do we
13:29 care
13:30 about these folks and where do we see
13:33 these folks the most
13:36 well what prompted this episode to
13:38 actually get into my phone
13:41 all i wrote was stupid experts in there
13:44 was that i noticed that there is this
13:47 thing
13:48 going on and i've talked about a little
13:50 bit in previous episodes but never
13:52 totally on point like i'm doing now
13:54 which is the fall
13:56 [Music]
13:58 there has
14:01 there has been this new archetype of
14:03 human behavior
14:06 and it took me a while you know i was
14:08 seeing the behavior
14:09 and then i took me a while to sort of
14:12 like mentally profile the people that
14:14 are engaging in the behavior before i
14:15 started to see the utter common
14:17 denominator of their behavior
14:19 to thus reveal the pattern of their
14:21 behavior and i want to make you hip to
14:23 it
14:23 so as you ingest social media and mainly
14:26 what i'm saying is your friends posts
14:29 you can start discerning who's who
14:32 now what's fascinating about the human
14:34 condition
14:37 is that people really want to be
14:40 intelligent slash smart smart
14:44 for those who are new to the channel is
14:46 defined in this channel
14:47 as a memorizer repeater
14:50 it's a very powerful resource you must
14:53 have
14:53 smarts to then gain intelligence
14:58 it doesn't have to be science related
15:01 super deep physics and all that kind of
15:03 stuff you could simply be
15:04 you're a farmer you live in a small town
15:06 and you're just watching
15:08 you know the seasons come and go you're
15:10 watching crops uh
15:12 be turned and you know various things
15:14 you see people have kids and pay
15:16 attention to them people have kids and
15:17 not pay attention
15:18 you see all those things and memorize
15:20 and repeat
15:21 the correlations and connections cause
15:24 and effect models in your mind
15:26 then the next step would be to say
15:29 well honey you know i say you had a
15:31 daughter and you watched a bunch of bad
15:33 car accidents happen inside families
15:34 right and you're like
15:36 if you're going to have children you
15:37 want to find a good man
15:39 you can stay married to for as long as
15:41 possible hopefully till death do you
15:43 part way down the line
15:44 and you're going to have to raise your
15:46 children from the second they're born
15:47 not when they start misbehaving
15:50 because then they're already down the
15:51 wrong track and you seem like a strange
15:54 person telling them what they've done up
15:55 to this point
15:57 is suddenly a bad thing but the behavior
16:00 goes like this
16:02 people want to be smart i don't know
16:06 honestly i don't know exactly where it
16:08 comes from because you'll have someone
16:09 who has a great job
16:10 makes great money great family great
16:13 family below them a great family above
16:15 them
16:16 good friend circles and somehow it's not
16:18 enough
16:19 they want to be able to engage in a
16:21 conversation
16:22 somewhere phone backyard whatever and
16:26 somehow dominate maybe with intelligence
16:28 not sure
16:30 smarts maybe and so they
16:33 they're attracted to the quest of this
16:36 thing
16:38 and so how do you do it well back in the
16:41 day
16:43 before folks offered you ridiculous
16:46 things on a plate
16:48 one of the first most ridiculous things
16:50 that was ever offered to mankind
16:52 was the original model of the earth
16:56 which was that it was on the back of a
16:57 turtle
17:00 when asked what's the turtle standing on
17:03 the old woman is quoted as saying
17:05 it's turtles all the way down down to
17:08 what
17:08 you know it's infinite turtle stack
17:10 right
17:12 but if that was actually accepted by
17:15 society then that person could hold that
17:17 tiny
17:18 little theory of it's on the back of a
17:20 turtle and seem like
17:22 the oracle in the movie matrix
17:25 around 1969 stephen w hawking finishes
17:28 his phd he resurrects an ancient theory
17:31 of the
17:32 big bang cambridge universities got the
17:35 publishing power and the overall
17:38 credibility with the world to announce
17:39 that that's the way the universe started
17:41 even though physics hadn't been tracked
17:44 back to the big bang's actual
17:46 moment no explanation for why anything
17:48 would explode
17:49 and once it's all compressed into a
17:51 massless singularity i mean it's just
17:52 the most ridiculous theory ever
17:55 but what happened well your average
17:58 stay-at-home mom
17:59 who was raising the kids while dad was
18:01 pulling in the single income
18:03 that they needed to pay all their bills
18:04 and go on two vacations a year
18:06 could tell her husband you know what i
18:07 found out today i found out how the
18:09 universe was started
18:11 it's a real simple little stories have a
18:13 seat oh i'm already done
18:14 there was an explosion that was it
18:18 oh my god did i ever marry the right
18:22 woman he says
18:25 today's version of that's slightly more
18:27 complex but what has happened is we have
18:29 these
18:30 pillars of fake media
18:33 and let's just be clear they are all
18:36 fake
18:37 if they are supported by any major
18:38 corporation at all they are all fake
18:41 the ones that you think are right wing
18:43 are fake
18:44 they just play a slightly more relaxed
18:46 game with the
18:48 microscopic molecules of your mind to
18:51 make you think that they're still
18:52 supporting your team
18:54 but you're being totally had
18:57 every single column of fake media
19:00 engages in trauma journalism so they'll
19:04 they'll want you to swallow something
19:06 that isn't true
19:07 and they know that in a traumatic state
19:09 of mind your
19:11 frontal lobes ability to discern
19:13 incoming information depending on how
19:15 sensitive you
19:16 are whether or not you watch this show
19:19 they'll report that um
19:23 i just just tabbed through the news and
19:25 there was an article about a guy that uh
19:27 dismembered his entire family his mother
19:30 and his father
19:32 this is a little graphic but it's front
19:33 page news okay let's just let it out
19:36 he boiled his mother's head and made a
19:38 stew and i
19:40 guess consumed it it was i didn't want
19:42 to go into the article
19:44 he got life sentence today
19:47 okay those of you are against capital
19:50 punishment for a guy like that it's like
19:51 i don't care if he's mentally insane
19:53 hey let's not pay for his insanity for
19:55 the rest of his life let's just
19:57 push reset that's why reincarnation
19:59 needs to be something we believe in
20:02 got some bum jeans maybe he's got a
20:04 tumor in his head who knows right
20:06 whose parents were jerks man taking it
20:08 to that level
20:11 so that article is in there to make
20:12 someone
20:14 freak out to go into a state of micro
20:17 fight or flight to cause the frontal
20:20 lobes of the brain to lose a little bit
20:22 of blood which means thus functionality
20:25 those lobes are the difference between
20:27 us being a mindless
20:28 you know drooling animal when we're
20:31 hungry to actually being
20:33 creatures that can make tools create
20:35 spoken language
20:36 create art and so they traumatize these
20:41 and then they say something next that
20:44 you're supposed to swallow bad guys good
20:48 good guys bad
20:51 uh the world's supposed to have 72
20:52 degree temperatures around the world
20:54 except by the ice caps
20:55 they're supposed to be below zero all
20:58 the time never supposed to change
21:02 and the universe just started with a
21:04 little pop
21:06 okay well isn't it interesting that
21:11 as i've said several times on the show
21:13 those who research nothing
21:15 typically claim to be the experts of the
21:17 world
21:19 how poetic that is as the definition of
21:22 a stupid expert
21:24 let's just make that the definition of a
21:25 stupid expert
21:27 research is nothing knows everything
21:30 that's the archetype
21:32 so what i'm seeing is people going to
21:34 these
21:35 repositories of what they have ingested
21:38 as
21:39 truth every fake news media outlet
21:43 every newspaper every online newspaper
21:46 every magazine
21:48 and they will or or a pundit a
21:50 particular individual sitting off to the
21:52 side
21:53 rambling on sort of the distillation of
21:56 all those other
21:57 outlets perhaps they're the writer and
21:59 creator of some of those outlets
22:01 and they will cut and paste something
22:03 from somewhere else onto their social
22:05 media site
22:06 and hit post instagram twitter
22:09 facebook and they are so
22:13 confidently posting this even though
22:16 they really don't know what it says half
22:17 the time they certainly don't know any
22:19 science behind what they're saying
22:21 but in their mind they don't need to
22:24 why because they're usurping in their
22:27 mind
22:28 masterful works of art that are
22:30 completely true
22:32 and thus they believe that they have
22:35 snuck in the back door
22:37 of some honorary degree of pure truth
22:42 and when you attempt to go in which
22:45 you really shouldn't you should just let
22:47 these people bite be on their own
22:49 when you attempt to go in there and add
22:50 a little bit of clarity perhaps
22:52 propose a question that might unravel
22:55 that post
22:57 what are you doing to them
23:01 what you're doing to them is you're
23:03 cutting away
23:05 their pseudo attempt
23:09 to seem intelligent and smart to the
23:11 outside world
23:14 now if you are intelligent or you're at
23:16 least comfortable with whatever you know
23:18 and you have a regimen that you take on
23:20 new information
23:22 you know you're like a person on the
23:24 deep thoughts facebook page
23:27 you're just posting information trying
23:29 to see what other people's think you
23:31 were leaning one way when you posted it
23:32 and based on some responses of people
23:34 that are like you you might change your
23:36 mind you might double down you might be
23:38 totally confident that what you did
23:39 right was mostly true
23:41 and that's a healthy regimen
23:45 but when you're trying to steal the
23:46 credit
23:48 oh you are essentially
23:51 assassinating their attempt to come
23:54 in at some large level and that
23:58 for them is heresy
24:02 again there's a lot of us out there
24:05 especially in this year of 2020 we see
24:08 homelessness
24:09 sort of on the rise due to the crazy
24:11 hoax that's going on
24:14 and you'll see someone who's
24:18 you know panhandling and they you can
24:19 tell they haven't really done it before
24:21 and those are the people i usually try
24:22 to help but there are a few folks in
24:24 town that have been doing this for 10
24:26 years
24:27 they stand on the same corner every
24:29 single day
24:30 for about 12 hours a day
24:33 holding up some sign that they're
24:34 incapable of working
24:37 and i have very little sympathy for
24:38 those folks
24:40 because they're career bumps
24:43 but you look at that and you say well
24:45 geez if you can stand up for 12 hours
24:47 you could probably stand up for
24:49 six to eight a day and earn a living
24:52 and then you have the dignity of a
24:54 paycheck well earned
24:56 believe it or not you'll probably be
24:57 able to contribute something new to any
24:59 organization
25:00 that you end up working for no matter
25:01 how old you are there's some wisdom in
25:03 your mind
25:04 that would improve the operations maybe
25:06 you touch
25:08 the heart of the body of somebody else
25:12 and you
25:13 uplift them maybe a mistake in your life
25:17 uh might improve someone else's life and
25:19 so as a lot of us
25:20 look at that regiment we go geez you're
25:21 working way too hard
25:23 for for losing all your dignity and
25:26 making
25:27 scraps of cash when you could just go
25:30 get a job
25:32 and the same theory applies to stupid
25:35 experts
25:36 they're lazy they smoke weed every day
25:41 in a way that is keeping them lazy and
25:43 always
25:45 always less than what they are i mean
25:47 how could you put
25:48 a depressant a slow down drug in your
25:52 body
25:53 and be the best that you could be in my
25:56 test the
25:57 episode 500
26:00 i talk about the fact that uh he taught
26:03 he
26:03 he had reviewed every stimulant he'd get
26:05 his hands on because he said look
26:07 you really have to have some sort of
26:09 minor stimulate in moderation to be your
26:11 very best because
26:12 some days you're going to get good sleep
26:14 some days you'll get bad sleep but you
26:15 still got the tasks
26:17 ready for you the next day
26:20 and so most of us are trying to research
26:24 as much as we possibly can
26:27 to kind of get a you know a very
26:29 three-dimensional view on a particular
26:31 subject matter so that we can then do
26:33 what
26:35 just like the old man example in the
26:38 hometown
26:39 watching all these um little micro
26:42 events happening in the hometown
26:44 eventually
26:45 wisdom just comes out of it you don't
26:47 even have to participate in the
26:49 in the regiment of wisdom it just
26:51 happens
26:53 you learn hey don't do that again i
26:56 think i told you guys you know
26:59 my dad taught me things were hot by me
27:02 asking him is that hot and he goes
27:05 i don't know touch it almost a soldering
27:07 iron
27:08 and he let me get a little blister on my
27:10 finger because he thought you know
27:12 there's no way i can tell you that this
27:14 is hot and have you have
27:16 the air create in your mind and your
27:19 instincts
27:20 the true caution of heat you need to
27:22 feel a little bit of pain that won't
27:24 kill you
27:25 no scarring or anything a little tiny
27:26 blister on my finger and then it was at
27:28 a mexican restaurant where these uh
27:31 these um ceramic black plates had these
27:33 steel plates in them and they were super
27:35 duper hot i mean there's
27:37 cheese sizzling i should just i was dumb
27:40 i asked my dad
27:42 is that hot i don't know touch it second
27:44 time boy finally it's stuck
27:46 ever had to ask again never had to touch
27:48 again
27:49 but now
27:52 we are seeing the writings of the
27:56 economic hitmen come true
28:00 in america a classic classic play
28:04 and what's really funny is as sort of
28:07 ironically pathetic is that you have
28:11 all these white privileged kids have
28:14 super duper low vibration
28:16 existences they really
28:19 want to be smart but they really don't
28:22 know how to do it
28:23 or smoking weed every day or whatever
28:26 they're doing they simply cannot
28:29 find a fact if their life depended on
28:31 their next heartbeat depended on them
28:34 uttering a true statement god just goes
28:36 say one thing that's true and i'll
28:38 let you live boom they'd be dead it's
28:41 just
28:43 but what was the story of the economic
28:45 hitman
28:47 it technically people always quote this
28:50 guy wrong
28:51 he said look i didn't work for the cia
28:53 but i worked for the imf
28:55 the international monetary fund which
28:57 serves as an investment
29:00 vehicle the world bank he wrote a book
29:04 about the fact that he was involved in
29:07 most of the takeovers in south america
29:12 they would organize the militia
29:15 charge them up with either true or fake
29:18 things didn't matter
29:20 they'd rush the leader get him to leave
29:22 office
29:23 then they would install an imf
29:25 consultant that was already willing to
29:27 do
29:27 everything that they needed that leader
29:30 to do a new president
29:32 which typically involved signing
29:35 gigantic loans with the imf slash world
29:38 bank
29:38 of which they knew technically speaking
29:42 it was impossible to ever pay it back in
29:44 the terms of the contract meaning a
29:46 certain timetable right
29:49 for instance uh boris yeltsin was one of
29:51 these shills
29:53 raging alcoholic who knows what he did
29:56 in his personal life
29:58 they coo out gorbachev now we did lose
30:00 the communist party in the midst of this
30:03 but it wasn't until putin got in charge
30:05 with new year's eve 1999
30:08 that um we got rid of the drunk and they
30:12 finally started rebuilding i think
30:13 like 30 million of their population that
30:15 died off
30:18 but all south of america was taken over
30:20 by this mechanism
30:21 create a militia overthrow the
30:22 government install the shills
30:24 bankrupt the government and now you have
30:27 venezuela in brazil
30:28 that is probably one of the most or two
30:31 of the most deadly places to be on
30:32 planet earth
30:35 so we have a terrorist organization in
30:37 the united states of america
30:38 built out of 100 stupid experts
30:42 100 they haven't been alive on planet
30:46 earth
30:47 long enough to ingest things
30:51 it just happened but they talk to each
30:54 other and there's this big feedback loop
30:55 and they take their personal
30:57 problems their personal
30:58 disenfranchisement
31:00 and they feel strange in the universe
31:03 because they have become a very unique
31:04 person
31:06 i don't know if that's out of um
31:08 persecution or just
31:10 paranoia and they're they're the leaders
31:13 of these organizations you see them say
31:15 i'm the leader of this organization and
31:16 boy they just
31:17 they look like craze balls man
31:22 no big surprise that a sociopath
31:26 would want to burn the world down i
31:30 can't
31:30 figure out the world so you can't have
31:33 it either
31:34 my existence sucks so your existence has
31:37 to suck
31:42 but if you talk to them about some of
31:44 their movements
31:46 which are bogus in many cases because
31:48 they don't have any demands
31:50 there's or their demands are absolutely
31:51 absurd
31:53 lacking any form of reality
31:57 they don't really have good will towards
31:59 men
32:01 and they don't know who they're working
32:02 for half the time
32:04 they don't know who they're voting for
32:05 all the time
32:08 but it's not just relegated to our
32:10 friends in 2020
32:14 because of my background and again this
32:16 is sort of hard to put in perspective
32:18 but
32:18 because of my background in the sciences
32:22 i will and because i've been blessed to
32:25 work with
32:26 either you know peers or bosses people
32:29 who are charging me
32:30 who were bona fide geniuses
32:34 and we sit around and talk it would
32:38 become apparent that
32:40 you know we're both on the same level or
32:42 even some topics i've gone way deeper
32:44 but they've gone deep in other things
32:47 and so they would introduce me to people
32:49 that are
32:51 technically world experts and things
32:55 sometimes it's a parent of a friend but
32:58 it was interesting how i i had
33:00 one meeting with a gentleman at a picnic
33:04 that to this day i don't understand
33:08 how it could have occurred
33:11 and it was that i was uh i forgot what
33:14 the event was
33:16 but my friend's dad showed up and he was
33:18 this big physicist
33:20 he worked on the collider at stanford
33:23 pretty awesome for those of you don't
33:25 know the bay area
33:27 san francisco kind of area between san
33:29 jose and san francisco
33:31 is stanford university in palo alto and
33:34 they built
33:35 a straight collider underneath the
33:37 highway because it has to go underneath
33:39 the highway and you drive over it every
33:40 time you go north between san jose and
33:42 san francisco drive over it and my
33:44 commute was about halfway to san
33:45 francisco
33:46 at the time i drove over this thing
33:49 thousands of times
33:51 literally now i spent uh
33:55 gosh 15 years of my life you know
33:57 studying and coming up with a unified
33:59 theory based on the false definition of
34:01 gravity
34:02 but i also combed
34:05 stanford university's books
34:09 bookstores because they had all the good
34:11 stuff
34:13 and i had been just diving into
34:15 colliders like crazy
34:17 and finding out the whole history of the
34:20 stanford collider i mean we're
34:22 probably three years into this thing at
34:23 a very deep level and so i was very
34:25 excited to meet this man because
34:27 he was very old but he looked great he
34:29 was in his 80s but he looked like he was
34:31 like maybe 60 years old maybe
34:34 and i was reiterating to him
34:38 just recent papers that i had read
34:41 papers that were published out of that
34:43 organization talking about quarks they
34:45 discovered
34:47 and he looked at me after i
34:50 said oh you know then you're working on
34:52 this so i can't wait to talk to you blah
34:54 blah blah
34:54 and he got this angry face on his face
34:56 and he goes
34:58 we're not doing anything like that it's
35:00 nothing to do with that at all
35:02 i'm like what and then i started trying
35:06 to cite
35:07 paperwork you know that i just read out
35:10 of stanford
35:11 the university man and this guy looks at
35:14 me and says you know like i was the
35:16 dumbest person on planet earth
35:18 now here's the weird part i don't mind
35:22 anybody calling me dumb stupid whatever
35:25 as long as the next thing out of your
35:26 mouth is to correct me right and just
35:28 say okay well this is
35:29 this dude works there let's talk about
35:31 this right educate me man i mean is it a
35:33 conspiracy theory i'm reading the
35:35 the fake stuff that you're supposed to
35:37 be working on but you're doing something
35:38 way more exciting maybe
35:40 engineering the mandela effect i mean
35:41 who knows right
35:43 he wouldn't share another word
35:47 and that was the last i talked to him
35:50 and that was just
35:51 sat weird with me it was like what could
35:53 he have possibly
35:55 been so offended about that he wouldn't
35:58 talk to me anymore like he was sort of
35:59 like
36:00 yeah you're so stupid i won't talk too
36:02 much sort of the vibe you gave off
36:04 i don't know if he's going to see now or
36:06 whatever the deal was i don't think so
36:08 so you will get very eccentric bizarre
36:12 people like that who i
36:15 have to assume that without him solving
36:18 the mystery of his claim
36:21 he was definitely an intelligent person
36:26 isn't it weird when you wake up to all
36:28 this fake science
36:31 especially through digging in the
36:33 science and not just
36:35 kind of hearing it on a youtube video or
36:36 whatever you study people like eric
36:39 dollard who reads you the books
36:41 of the the elders of electricity
36:44 you know he does contribute quite a bit
36:47 of dna of his own
36:48 findings his own research and again if
36:50 you haven't seen the uh
36:52 the videos that eric dollar made in the
36:54 80s where he shows you electrical
36:56 circuit
36:58 using um he's using
37:01 uh he's demonstrates the difference
37:03 between transverse
37:04 and longitudinal waves and ends up
37:06 creating a circuit that that
37:09 moves electricity through circuits
37:11 eleven times the speed of light
37:13 he measures it right in front of your
37:14 face he shows you all the equipment this
37:16 is like 86 in a basement
37:19 once you see those things you cannot see
37:21 them
37:24 once you do your research on einstein
37:26 and realize that it was a coup
37:29 probably started off organically as a
37:31 guy simply lying and then when he gets
37:32 caught they're like okay
37:34 you're pretty good at this whole thing
37:35 oh thank you so much
37:38 so let's uh let's get you on board here
37:40 we need to destroy ether out of science
37:43 we need to turn gravity into a
37:44 phenomenon
37:45 so that no one can figure out how energy
37:47 is made because we're going to sell
37:48 energy
37:50 and uh it's the most bona fide product
37:54 that man can sell man is energy
37:58 once we became dependent on
38:02 okay so in my lifetime
38:05 i have been blessed serendipitously at
38:08 least 50 percent of the time bumping
38:09 into geniuses
38:10 who i will then have incredibly
38:14 incredibly detailed conversations over
38:16 years and years and years
38:19 sometimes following up with them ten
38:20 years later and then spending another
38:22 five years with them
38:24 super deep subjects in the sciences
38:29 from cosmology to subatomic physics the
38:32 whole gamut in between how the universe
38:33 is put together at a macro level and how
38:35 it's put together a micro level
38:39 and so when you have that kind of
38:40 background and it matches what you
38:42 discovered from
38:44 elders of the past matches a thousand
38:46 percent
38:47 but you're observing in the in the real
38:49 universe
38:53 you can start smelling the frauds
38:56 on tv frauds put in sitcoms the frauds
39:01 cut and pasted into movies to make them
39:04 famous
39:04 so that every time they talk the stupid
39:07 experts can't get enough
39:09 i'll give you an absurd example
39:13 and uh last time i mentioned this
39:17 software it's just a weird example
39:20 a bunch of you reached out to me to make
39:22 sure you figured out what it was called
39:24 and how to download it but it does
39:26 project called terrigen which i believe
39:28 is a version five right now it's a
39:30 product you can download for your
39:31 computer
39:33 hey it's got a it's got an odd spelling
39:36 it's like two bars and
39:37 or something like that but anyway
39:40 if if every student in
39:44 the world let's just say had a laptop
39:47 with a little bit of power in it
39:48 they could download that software and
39:51 find themselves watching youtube videos
39:53 on how to use the software sharing
39:54 information between
39:56 having thousands of contests around the
39:58 world to make the best looking version
40:00 of mars
40:01 with terrigen the belief
40:05 in the nasa projects as it relates to
40:08 the gpl nasa partnership
40:10 to put rovers on mars would vanish
40:13 overnight
40:15 because they would realize that what
40:17 they've been looking at there since
40:19 the mid 90s when this product was
40:21 invented
40:22 is probably a mixture of
40:26 actual real world microscopic slicing of
40:29 rocks
40:30 so that looks really real why not do it
40:32 if you can fake it that way
40:34 but all these terrains they're a button
40:36 press away
40:38 it blows me away that people can see
40:40 these movies that are based on mars
40:42 and the last uh in fact there's
40:43 television shows that just do an amazing
40:45 job man
40:46 and they do an amazing job simulating
40:48 mars
40:49 friend of mine has just recently
40:53 become pretty good expert in this and he
40:55 texts me
40:57 probably about 10 months ago and he just
40:59 goes
41:00 all the mars stuff is bs i said oh yeah
41:03 museum and i guess i just created mars
41:05 intelligent like a couple clicks because
41:08 you can't tell the difference
41:09 it's like oh that's not even his main
41:11 job
41:15 but what happens with these coups i mean
41:17 how does that work
41:20 the most painless algorithm of a coup
41:23 that the
41:25 world powers love to engage in is the
41:27 cheapest fastest
41:29 means of controlling the largest group
41:31 of people
41:34 well since we have adopted
41:38 and this is going to sound maybe heresy
41:40 to you
41:42 until you think it a few steps through
41:45 it's going to frustrate you once you see
41:46 the other side of what i'm saying
41:50 once you realize that we have adopted
41:53 certain forms of government to run our
41:55 our territories
41:57 we believe that we have elected a person
42:00 to represent us
42:02 and there's several different stages and
42:04 they're compartmentalized and they have
42:06 to work in groups you know one
42:07 stage proves it in the united states we
42:09 have a house and then a senate and then
42:10 we have the president
42:13 and all three parties have to get it
42:15 through their system and the president
42:16 has to sign it before anything goes into
42:18 effect
42:19 and there's executive orders here and
42:21 there
42:22 once we have adopt that they control us
42:25 this is the way that we've all agreed
42:28 i mean if you don't there's chaos so you
42:30 gotta be careful with the other side of
42:32 the game
42:33 then all that has to happen for our
42:35 country to go completely down the toilet
42:38 is to overthrow the people who run
42:42 the government and there's two ways to
42:44 do that there's
42:45 the draconian way of actually telling
42:47 the people hey
42:49 we are now in control of you if you step
42:51 out of line
42:52 you're dead you're out of here or
42:56 to keep from having a revolution
42:59 where we would get rid of all those
43:01 people
43:03 let's go see the french revolution how
43:05 that's done
43:07 in order to make sure that we don't go
43:08 off the handle
43:10 they do it in secret they throw votes
43:15 in america what they have discovered is
43:17 the electoral college
43:19 in new york and the electronic electoral
43:22 college in california
43:23 there's a pretty good staple you can
43:25 keep those two two states
43:27 super duper corrupt then you can
43:31 pretty much wiggle all the ones in the
43:32 middle that no one has ever been to
43:34 the majority of the population of
43:35 america hasn't ventured into the center
43:37 of america
43:38 because they live on the coasts all
43:41 right well you know hey i didn't you
43:43 know toledo ohio had an issue today uh
43:45 omaha nebraska you know they voted the
43:47 other way we thought they were gonna
43:48 vote this way i don't even know those
43:49 hicks blah blah blah
43:51 and they look the other way seems
43:53 organic seems real
43:55 the thing is is that we have this
43:57 fermentation of stupidity
43:59 in our country in america you have to
44:02 speak for your own country
44:05 we have the virus the true virus
44:08 spreading in america is sheer stupidity
44:14 a total lack of history no
44:17 um no historical knowledge of who all
44:20 the dictators of the world
44:22 were what they actually did
44:25 and how they did it such that we can see
44:28 the patterns being repeated today almost
44:30 like a playbook out of some high school
44:31 football team
44:33 i think it's interesting that there's
44:36 all this
44:37 uh just to give you an example there's
44:40 all this sympathy for china right now
44:43 a communistic country communism let's
44:47 think about that
44:49 now north korea has their own weird
44:50 communism it's sort of like a jesus
44:52 communism
44:53 to the young family whatever
44:56 i don't know haven't been there but
44:59 china remains
45:00 one of the only countries in the entire
45:02 world that believes that communism
45:05 is the way forward and if you mess with
45:09 that country if you
45:10 speak badly about one of their
45:12 politicians they'll come get you and
45:14 harvest your organs and you'll end up in
45:17 a few uh
45:18 elite people's bellies right
45:22 but the world seems to think it's a
45:23 really good idea
45:25 to empower them with trade to make sure
45:29 that that country has
45:30 trillions and trillions of dollars of
45:32 power
45:35 when we don't want their form of
45:37 government anywhere around the world
45:39 as the citizens of the world but guess
45:42 who wrote
45:44 the marxist doctrine the very people
45:48 that want to control the world an
45:51 idealistic doctrine that may work on
45:53 paper but because man is far from
45:55 perfect
45:56 will never work in real life
46:00 if what if somebody you know you raised
46:02 their child and they said a
46:05 child hasn't made any mistakes yet
46:06 hasn't really ventured out in the world
46:07 yet and they say
46:09 mommy daddy how do i live the very best
46:11 life i can live
46:14 a marxist would say well do everything
46:17 right your whole life
46:19 until the very end and you'll have a
46:21 great life
46:22 case closed but a true doctrine of
46:26 freedom
46:27 is one of chaos and abstraction
46:30 because life comes at us through chaos
46:33 and abstraction
46:34 life is very rarely a linear thing
46:38 it's so much so that way that even our
46:41 biology
46:42 is not linear between the two of us
46:43 right
46:45 some people are born with congenital
46:48 illnesses
46:50 since they were born they have this
46:51 illness some people
46:53 are diabetic and they have a decade or
46:56 two cut off of their lifespan
46:58 unless they get it under control but you
47:00 definitely can get it under control
47:02 but you're going to have to eat right
47:03 and exercise
47:05 today's diabetes is mainly
47:08 unfortunately trusting the packaging
47:11 that tells you that things are healthy
47:12 and you overeat sugar to get away from
47:14 fat you eat fat to get away from sugar
47:17 and you just
47:18 start to wreck yourself we believe in
47:21 medicine that doesn't cure
47:24 watch pharmaceutical companies go after
47:26 folks with cures to cancer
47:29 again you can't cure cancer forever
47:32 i mean you can't take one thing and it
47:34 you never catch it ever again but if you
47:36 catch it you can exterminate it
47:38 and then you'll have a mechanism when
47:40 you catch it again but you
47:41 probably should look at your regiment to
47:42 make sure you don't do what you did to
47:44 get sick
47:46 so life isn't some
47:49 rule book that we can simply just check
47:51 things off a checklist
47:53 and so many of these stupid experts
47:57 try to do that exact thing i have people
48:00 in my family that think that love is a
48:02 checklist
48:04 and so there's no passion there's no
48:05 empathy in that game
48:08 well they might love you i guess but
48:10 when they try to approach you for a
48:12 conversation
48:14 when they will try to it's so funny i've
48:16 got family members that will try to
48:17 impose what they believe to be
48:19 a very deep-witted mind and the more
48:22 that they talk the more they remove
48:24 all doubts that in their lifetime they
48:27 probably will never be accused of being
48:29 truly intelligent
48:32 they might have a decent score on
48:33 jeopardy but they won't pass a mensa
48:35 test or a prometheus test right
48:39 now here's the thing when we aren't
48:42 manipulated as human beings
48:45 it really doesn't matter
48:50 how extensive your intelligence is as
48:52 long as you hit sort of the critical
48:54 mass of intelligence that
48:55 allows you to coexist with other people
48:59 i was raised in a really tiny town a lot
49:01 of very simple people there
49:03 wise people guess where their wisdom was
49:06 centered
49:07 their wisdom was centered on the
49:09 brilliance that made my hometown
49:11 possible and they also understood what
49:14 it took
49:15 to maintain that beautiful little
49:17 capsule
49:18 almost like a twilight zone town that
49:20 you'd always want to go
49:22 like was it willowby but now i watch
49:26 on social media these individuals
49:30 engaging in massive hyper narcissism
49:34 by the way that phrase that my buddy
49:36 gave me on the patio here
49:38 has become a staple in the lexicon
49:41 between my friends and i
49:43 and it has so assisted in us
49:47 you know sort of categorizing the
49:49 behaviors around us
49:51 and also allowing us to
49:55 sort of police any micro narcissism that
49:57 we might be doing ourselves right
50:00 so if you wonder how these terrorist
50:03 organizations
50:04 in america are able to you know first be
50:07 labeled a terrorist organization and
50:09 then continue functioning
50:11 as they always have it's because there
50:14 is a
50:15 sort of a sedimentary rock that is
50:17 starting to
50:18 grow throughout the plains of america
50:23 and it's all these stupid experts
50:26 the thing to heresy is a great thing
50:32 now you'll hear me use the word
50:33 archetype a lot and i got it out of
50:35 writing
50:36 screenplays and i just find it to be a
50:38 brilliant word that really describes a
50:41 pattern
50:42 a pattern of behavior you have a pattern
50:44 in a story an archetype and a story boy
50:46 meets girl girl meets boy that kind of
50:48 stuff right
50:50 what this episode is about is
50:51 identifying the archetypes of
50:54 stupid experts so that we can
50:57 do a couple things one the name of the
51:00 game initially in life is for you to
51:02 gain control over your life
51:04 and some of you might um i have a pretty
51:08 good list of what that would be
51:09 right away you might think financial
51:11 stability is definitely a good archetype
51:14 the problem is that if you gain
51:15 financial stability by creating a lot of
51:18 or engaging a lot of criminal activities
51:21 okay
51:22 then you got a problem
51:26 you weren't intelligent about how you
51:27 created your money
51:29 but we're below that we're now at sort
51:32 of a subatomic level of human
51:34 consciousness
51:36 where these individuals are trying to
51:38 engage in a bunch of weird behaviors
51:41 that we really haven't seen before in
51:44 bulk we always have that person who's
51:49 in our lifetime try to manipulate us
51:53 could be a relative could be a friend be
51:56 a lover
51:58 and sometimes they're not trying to
51:59 manipulate you in an absolutely heinous
52:01 way
52:02 but today in this society we have now
52:08 they're trying to guilt-trip you
52:12 for being intelligent
52:16 by accusing you of not being intelligent
52:18 because they have cut and pasted
52:20 something from one of these
52:21 trusted organizations that differs from
52:24 your
52:24 lucidity again they haven't done any
52:27 research on anything
52:28 they don't know if what they're pasting
52:30 is true or false
52:33 but they want to be right and they want
52:35 to be smart
52:37 and more than anything else they want to
52:38 be smarter than you
52:41 and i think part of the archetype that's
52:43 going on here
52:45 because we have we have really two
52:48 generations that i see that most
52:50 fuel this kind of behavior you have your
52:53 youngster
52:54 who you know
52:58 admires what they believe to be
53:00 intelligence
53:02 but again because of the way society's
53:04 put together
53:06 because of certain drugs they don't have
53:09 any
53:09 perseverance to get anything done but
53:11 they don't like the fact they don't have
53:12 control of their life and so again
53:14 they're trying to usurp
53:17 these organizations to the maximum
53:20 extent so they can
53:22 sort of get ahead in life by cheating
53:26 and the other archetype that's important
53:29 are people
53:30 in their 40s and above
53:34 i do believe there's like a weird thing
53:35 in the 30s or 25 to 30 25 to 40 let's
53:38 just say where i believe that people are
53:40 so busy trying to engage life
53:42 that they kind of subtract themselves
53:44 out of the equation for a little while
53:46 but there's the thing called the midlife
53:48 crisis right
53:50 it has numerous definitions you know
53:52 probably the most classic definitions as
53:54 you start looking in the mirror
53:56 and when your eyes don't work and two
53:59 you
53:59 you realize that your mortality is sort
54:02 of
54:03 it's in sight now you know if uh getting
54:06 to the end of the terrain
54:08 is going to be where you have to jump
54:09 off and die because you can't stop
54:11 running in that direction
54:13 you get worried but the other big one
54:16 that i see a lot of
54:17 is a lot of personal regret
54:21 and that's really best itemized by
54:23 someone who will look back on their life
54:25 regardless of how good or bad it was and
54:27 they live in the past the whole time
54:30 now imagine you um
54:34 when you look backwards you have a
54:36 couple things you can do you know a lot
54:37 of things
54:38 you can do the most classic archetypes
54:40 are people saying things like
54:42 gosh you know i could just go back to
54:44 that day
54:45 you know i would change these few things
54:48 and i'd be a totally different person
54:49 because i've learned
54:50 how ignorant i was in the past hey we
54:54 all do it
54:54 trust me but one of the most dangerous
54:58 ones
54:59 is turning into this stupid expert stuff
55:02 in my opinion are people that say gosh
55:08 i really wish i had become smart by
55:11 their definition
55:12 they probably are already maybe they're
55:14 intelligent in a really valuable way
55:17 of all kinds of wisdom but they're
55:19 paying attention to that because they
55:21 already have it
55:22 and we know what greed does greed means
55:24 no matter what you have you want
55:26 something else
55:28 it's sort of that kiss that's about to
55:30 happen
55:31 it's the hoarder that only likes buying
55:33 the object
55:35 but when they come home it goes in the
55:36 pile of walmart bags
55:39 but they never look in again yet they
55:42 can never get rid of it right
55:45 so imagine being in your 50s
55:49 you're not giving any value to your
55:51 current life and i'm speaking of this
55:53 as an archetype because i can name in my
55:56 mind half a dozen people from my
55:58 hometown area
56:00 regardless if they've moved away they do
56:02 this online all the time
56:06 and so they don't have time to go get
56:09 the degree
56:10 maybe they don't have the intelligence
56:11 to actually get it who knows i mean i
56:13 have faith in everybody to be able to
56:14 get to learn whatever you need to learn
56:15 especially nowadays
56:18 but they try to cheat and they do this
56:21 cut and paste thing
56:22 see how smart i am see how smart you
56:24 have those uh
56:25 people that just post memes all day not
56:28 the funny kind
56:29 but the kind that you're trying to have
56:30 some profound piece of wisdom
56:33 yeah okay so maybe a month of that in
56:36 your friend's feed and you're just kind
56:37 of like
56:38 hey you know is this thing on are you
56:40 alive
56:42 because i haven't seen a picture of you
56:44 the picture in your profile is either
56:46 somebody else
56:47 or it's a picture of you 30 years ago
56:50 where are you right now because your
56:53 profile looks like you're living in the
56:54 past
56:56 you're not contributing anything if
56:58 looking intelligent is what your goal
57:00 was
57:01 you have ruined that illusion
57:05 now i did an episode a long time ago
57:07 about sort of flow intelligence
57:09 which is where i made the separation
57:11 between smart and intelligent
57:15 being again memorizers and repeaters and
57:17 problem solvers and critical thinkers
57:21 what is the forbidden fruit
57:24 of the 21st century well we've allowed a
57:27 bunch of corporations
57:29 to run our communication between each
57:31 other like we can't communicate with
57:33 each other besides emailing each other
57:35 or maybe texting and apple's now
57:37 deleting text messages
57:39 totally confirmed they're censoring your
57:43 personal property
57:45 right if i send you a text it's your
57:47 personal property on your memory card
57:49 but apple's going in and finding out
57:51 you're having controversial
57:52 conversations and they're erasing your
57:54 text messages
57:56 crazy but the corporations do not want
58:00 us to think for ourselves
58:03 they want nothing but stupid experts
58:08 what's interesting is they haven't
58:09 really figured out a way to financially
58:11 reward stupid experts in mass
58:14 and so these protesters and what have
58:16 you
58:17 either living off their parents which is
58:19 about 85 90 percent of them
58:22 or they're destitutes because they've
58:25 been
58:25 oppressed in their neighborhoods and so
58:28 they're all angry
58:29 they all want change they have no idea
58:31 how to get it
58:34 they know no history they don't know
58:35 science
58:37 and they're mad i told this silly silly
58:40 story a long time ago an episode
58:42 probably three or four hundred episodes
58:43 ago
58:45 but i was like 18 19 years old
58:48 and i'm hanging out with these two
58:50 brothers
58:52 and their teens so we're kind of all you
58:54 know intellectually the same age but
58:56 there was like a 13 year old kid
58:57 brilliant little kid man but
59:01 i think it was something to do with like
59:03 the conversation came up about
59:04 microwaves or something
59:06 and i had just learned how they work i
59:08 mean how they
59:09 you know was in fact my definition was
59:11 probably the loosest thing you could
59:13 possibly imagine not even scientific
59:17 or deeply scientific so i i said oh hey
59:19 guys you know how that works
59:22 and we were walking from their house to
59:24 my house it was about a country block
59:26 so i thought hey i'm just just rattling
59:27 off something it's not like i'm in their
59:29 face
59:31 but this kid this 13 year old starts
59:34 acting weird towards me like immediately
59:36 i was hey dude what's up what's he's
59:38 like oh yeah you know i'm mark lowe
59:40 i'm like i'm gonna know it all blah blah
59:42 blah blah and i'm like
59:44 so you were offended like 50 feet ago
59:46 when i told you how a microwave worked
59:48 that bothered you that i said that his
59:50 dad's an electrical engineer
59:52 his dad designs pc boards on his lazy
59:55 boy at night
59:56 uh he's a genius right the whole family
59:59 is really smart
60:00 so i'm kind of going you live in a
60:01 scientific home
60:03 why is this offending you and he felt
60:06 like
60:06 i was being a narcissist from his
60:10 perspective i get it
60:11 i was being a narcissist from his
60:13 perspective and this is where i kind of
60:14 chilled out all that stuff and only
60:16 spoke to spoken to kind of thing about
60:17 those things
60:18 someone asked me how something works
60:20 i'll tell them if i know whatever
60:22 but what that revealed for me was a
60:26 sensitivity a very fundamental
60:28 sensitivity out of a 13 year old boy
60:32 and i find more value when young people
60:35 react to things than when older people
60:37 react to things sometimes
60:39 because i feel like it's more
60:40 fundamental to our instincts
60:43 and i made the episode that um
60:46 it got uh demonetized by itself which
60:49 was called a playground wisdom
60:53 and i talked to you guys about the fact
60:54 that the playground is full
60:56 of all kinds of lessons that if you pay
60:58 attention
61:00 they seeped into your future you saw
61:04 kids behave certain ways on playgrounds
61:06 being selfish greedy considerate nice
61:10 helpful not helpful and when you watch
61:12 those people a
61:13 big giant percentage of them continued
61:15 in those behaviors their whole life
61:19 it's phenomenal how much evidence is
61:21 right in front of us at all times
61:24 but we have some big things on the
61:26 horizon right
61:29 luckily i'm seeing um a tremendous
61:32 awakening in terms of agenda twenty
61:34 thirty slash agenda twenty one
61:37 twenty 21 again referring to 21st
61:38 century people are still
61:41 super ignorant about the georgia
61:43 guidestones which talks about the huge
61:45 depopulation
61:46 of which buried inside of the agenda 21
61:48 documentation
61:49 describes a 97 reduction of population
61:52 on planet earth
61:55 and the real way that they have
61:57 discerned that just in case you guys are
61:59 like well i don't know if i believe that
62:00 that's true
62:01 okay so what they have discovered
62:04 inside the agenda 21 documentation are
62:07 these world maps
62:09 of where humans will be allowed to live
62:11 and where we won't be allowed to live
62:13 we're only going to be allowed to live
62:14 in these major metropolitan areas
62:16 and all the countryside of the entire
62:18 world is all white clean
62:20 with staff that are policing those areas
62:23 of the world to make sure no one ever
62:24 lives there
62:25 so you can't just say i'm just going to
62:27 live in the woods man when they come
62:28 after everybody i was going to live in
62:30 the mountains like no you won't
62:31 there'll be helicopters that'll find
62:32 your heat signature and they'll come get
62:34 you they don't kill you first
62:36 and let the animals sort it out so when
62:39 they count up
62:40 how many people could live in these
62:42 metropolitan areas the number is
62:44 teeny tiny compared to what we have on
62:46 earth now
62:50 so the reason why i mentioned that is
62:52 that how many times have you
62:54 you know been in a social situation in
62:56 your lifetime maybe you go to church
62:58 and there's a weirdo in church talks a
63:02 lot
63:02 maybe sings really badly in front of
63:04 people there's no mental illness there
63:06 they're just weird
63:08 maybe there's mental illness but it's
63:09 not what we classify as
63:12 you know hospitalized mental
63:15 illness and you just go yeah
63:19 that's that's earl over there you know
63:21 we just tolerate him he's
63:22 just a really strange guy don't know if
63:24 he's hurting anybody or not
63:26 you know we keep an eye on him don't let
63:28 him get around the kids
63:30 or the ladies and you can do that in a
63:34 small community
63:36 unfortunately today because the disease
63:40 of the stupid expert
63:41 is being absolutely spawned
63:45 and converted by these fake media
63:49 organizations these fake science
63:50 institutions these you know how many
63:53 colleges in the world actually give you
63:55 a degree that's um
63:58 attached to a real job maybe your super
64:01 ivy league
64:02 schools have a pretty good record still
64:04 harvard's got a good record
64:06 not too many people graduate from
64:08 harvard and starve after that
64:12 most these state colleges oh they're
64:13 just atrocious men
64:15 they'll give you a degree in anything
64:16 you can make up it's almost like you
64:18 could go to a state college and
64:21 have like a big wall of like you know
64:24 cork board behind just words and you
64:27 just throw darts at three words and
64:29 they'll just
64:29 combine those three words and give you a
64:31 degree
64:33 it's crazy charge 100 grand for
64:36 or more then they crash the economy
64:41 with hoaxes and you got these student
64:44 loans that are piling up
64:46 and then they've created this this
64:48 problem where they give you a crappy
64:50 education you can't get a job they crash
64:52 the economy so you can't pay the loan
64:54 and then what do they do they create a
64:55 political party that will
64:57 claim claim can't actually financially
65:00 pull this off they'll claim
65:01 they're gonna zero out everyone's
65:04 student loans okay well if everyone
65:08 forgives the loan we can do it so if a
65:10 college forgives the loan
65:11 the bank forgives along then this
65:13 government forgives the loan then yeah
65:14 you can do it totally great
65:15 but if anyone's going to get paid then
65:18 we can't do it
65:18 we don't have enough money so they're
65:21 harvesting
65:22 these stupid experts into political
65:25 affiliations
65:26 both official and non-official terrorist
65:29 organizations
65:31 and if you're a parent or a grandparent
65:35 of some child that is say under 25
65:39 it could it could extend way past 25 but
65:41 definitely over 25
65:43 they're under 25 excuse me then they're
65:46 coming after your kids
65:50 and unless you stay really engaged with
65:54 your kids
65:58 they understand your kids way better
66:00 than you do
66:01 they know the triggers to push they know
66:04 because they researched it and they've
66:06 created it they've even researched it
66:07 before they hatched the thing that made
66:09 your kid feel horrible about themselves
66:13 indoctrinating the minds to deny the
66:15 physical biology of the human body
66:17 so we have more than two genders
66:20 wow if anybody told us that 40 years ago
66:23 no one would believe that that was even
66:25 possible and now was a trudeau passed a
66:28 law that if you uh
66:30 don't call someone by the identification
66:34 that they have made up in their
66:35 psychotic minds that you can go to jail
66:39 get charged a fine the eu recognizes
66:42 72 genders do you realize that if i took
66:46 any of you listeners
66:48 anyone i think anyone in the world
66:50 including everyone in the eu itself i
66:52 could take
66:53 angela merkel strap her to a chair
66:57 put a gun against her head and say name
66:58 all 72 genders i'm gonna pull this
67:01 trigger
67:02 no one would be alive after the game but
67:05 they got laws that you have to
67:07 call everyone by what they come up with
67:11 stupid experts bill nye the douchebag
67:14 guy
67:15 did an episode a long time ago
67:16 explaining boys and girls and
67:19 yeah he did an episode saying he was
67:21 wrong and then there's a bunch more than
67:22 boys and girls
67:23 okay where's the insectoid aliens that
67:26 we have to acknowledge your asexual
67:28 you know what is this you know
67:31 it's an infectious disease created by
67:34 suffering and fear
67:36 i was watching some video the other day
67:38 and i can't remember it was a show on tv
67:40 or if it was like a documentary on
67:41 youtube or something
67:43 but i was reminded of an old phrase
67:45 which i think is extremely important
67:49 which is fear is the mind killer
67:53 and not only does this saying kind of
67:56 sound interesting but it is absolutely
67:58 the mind killer remember i told you
67:59 about trauma journalism i did an episode
68:01 on it
68:02 back in i think season one or two
68:05 they shock your mind with some horrific
68:08 information of which you do not need to
68:10 know
68:12 think about the story i mentioned the
68:13 guy dismembered his
68:15 father and mother and cooked his
68:16 mother's head and some stew
68:21 that doesn't need to be publicized by
68:23 anyone
68:24 anywhere ever except for the people that
68:28 are affected by it
68:30 maybe they deserve more information
68:32 police officer to pick up that mess
68:34 family members are wondering where their
68:36 relatives are they need explanations
68:39 it doesn't need to be an international
68:41 story
68:43 does it but it shoved in your face
68:47 all the time what's interesting is is
68:51 that
68:52 the other thing that i'm seeing become
68:54 more and more true
68:56 because you'll hear this theory you guys
68:57 have already heard this i'm going to
68:58 repeat it
69:01 that repetition is the simplest form of
69:04 brainwashing
69:06 the other way of looking at repetition
69:08 is the simplest form of brainwashing is
69:10 to realize that if you can't beat them
69:12 join them
69:14 stockholm syndrome of which i've done an
69:16 episode about
69:19 get sorted you can't beat them so you
69:21 join them you've been captured by
69:23 someone
69:23 you can't break free well you can choose
69:26 to fight them every day which is going
69:27 to make every day
69:29 officially horrible or somehow
69:32 you can convince yourself that the daily
69:34 torture that you receive by this nut bag
69:39 is yeah you know it's not so bad just
69:42 you know
69:42 get into it the other thing that i've
69:46 i've mentioned a couple times and i want
69:47 to repeat it a few times
69:49 and probably for the end until the end
69:51 of the year or until it stops
69:55 is that in america we have two political
69:57 parties
69:59 i'll let you discern who i'm talking
70:01 about
70:03 one party when they post social media
70:05 posts will be
70:06 hey i made this really cool casserole
70:09 hey look at my kid they're going to
70:10 school for the first time hey
70:12 my kids graduating from the military or
70:14 whatever it's like life things it's
70:17 positive sharing of their life
70:21 and the other group of people who belong
70:23 to the other party
70:24 in their mind are always posting things
70:27 to control you
70:29 to guilt trip you to make you fearful if
70:31 you don't follow their ways because
70:33 they're
70:34 fearful of not following these
70:38 aristocratic ways
70:41 socialism in itself is
70:44 usually largely fueled by fear
70:48 old people who are into socialism
70:52 are usually folks that have been living
70:54 off their parents
70:56 or they're realizing that age
70:57 discrimination is real
70:59 they're supposed to work in america
71:00 until you're 70 years old
71:03 like man if you if you told me where i
71:07 lived today i had to
71:09 today uh in the whatever amount of hours
71:13 the businesses are open i've got to go
71:14 to businesses randomly
71:16 any business i want i got a full tank of
71:18 gas i got to find someone who's 70
71:21 years old who's still working and
71:24 producing a wage
71:26 that actually pays the bills at home
71:28 without any social security without
71:29 anything else
71:31 i i would think i would fail if i had to
71:34 find uh
71:35 five in one day you might go to law firm
71:39 or something where you kind of have some
71:40 older employees
71:43 maybe some state agencies maybe
71:46 i don't see anyone working that old
71:48 around here
71:50 i've had some good friends of mine who
71:51 are very famous people for doing some
71:53 very
71:54 amazing things and they had
71:59 all their possessions removed from them
72:02 because of the 2008 crash
72:05 all their savings gone all their
72:08 investments gone
72:10 and they're literally in debt up to
72:12 their
72:13 eyebrows they might have a little tiny
72:17 retirement pension at some company but
72:19 it's teeny tiny like 2500
72:21 a month which would barely pay for a
72:24 home
72:24 in southern california then if they hit
72:27 70
72:28 and they get their full take that the
72:30 2500 comes in
72:32 they get 5 grand a month so maybe they
72:34 can sustain
72:36 not going to go a whole lot of vacations
72:38 unless they move in with their kids
72:41 some people are really into that my
72:43 family is not
72:46 but that's going to build up a lot of
72:50 you know fear and what if the person's
72:52 healthy
72:54 they're going to live to be 90 something
72:55 years old well the pension is going to
72:57 run out at some point
72:59 social security will continue but is
73:02 that a dignified way to live when
73:03 they've invested a tremendous amount in
73:05 society they've really given to society
73:08 maybe they still have great ideas but
73:10 now we'll employ them because there's
73:12 age discrimination
73:15 we've lost our way
73:18 and what's really sad to me
73:22 is when society can be
73:26 easily disrupted this 2020 thing
73:32 there are hundreds of thousands of small
73:35 businesses
73:36 around the globe that just shut their
73:38 doors for the last time
73:41 some of them institutions have been
73:42 going for a long time and they were
73:43 going to pass it down to their kids but
73:45 they can't because no one's allowed to
73:47 show up and
73:48 go inside their place and they don't
73:51 recognize that the groups that they
73:53 worship
73:53 are the groups that made the phone calls
73:55 to create this hoax
73:57 and of course those who created are
73:59 blaming the people that tried to stop it
74:02 and then they die in the middle of this
74:07 crap show if you will
74:10 you know i uh i apologize for mentioning
74:13 this more than
74:14 once but you know i had a real good
74:15 friend of mine passed away last year he
74:17 was very
74:18 amazing man and he passed away
74:23 a couple days after christmas and we
74:26 buried him about a month later
74:29 and because we had to get him cremated
74:30 and that was going to take a little
74:31 while and it was all before this
74:33 craziness had occurred
74:36 this year now his partner's having to
74:38 live through this craziness
74:40 he's doing a great job
74:43 but part of me is like i'm glad he got
74:45 out of here before
74:47 this all happened even though i do
74:50 believe that perhaps after he leaves he
74:52 discovers all this is going to happen
74:54 whatever
74:56 maybe he chills out a little while
74:58 helping some of us out but anyway
75:02 these moments in time that are that are
75:04 sensationalized
75:06 up to the point that people die
75:10 and this year has been a very sad year
75:13 in
75:14 uh suicides
75:18 my family and the sort of the married
75:22 inside of the family
75:24 we've had an 18 year old girl take her
75:26 life
75:27 by taking a bunch of antidepressant
75:29 pills all at the same time
75:33 18 years old man now
75:36 she had the pills because she was having
75:38 issues but i don't know all the news
75:39 about that situation i would imagine
75:41 that this year
75:42 if she had any you know clinical issues
75:46 like
75:46 biological issues that were plaguing her
75:49 then we know these drugs are the worst
75:51 drugs you can get on because they
75:52 replace the chemicals in your brain that
75:54 stabilize you
75:55 and then if you vary your regiment you
75:57 can go into complete suicidal
75:59 uh death spiral this girl will never
76:02 have kids
76:04 so never be married everything that she
76:06 could have been
76:07 has been terminated now i do believe
76:10 she's in a great place and
76:12 i believe that at her choosing she can
76:14 come back and do this again
76:16 better time better place she had great
76:19 parents
76:20 great family around her so the attrition
76:25 that those of us who are battling
76:29 this mess to the best of our ability
76:32 we all have limited capabilities to
76:34 doing stuff so we do as much as we can
76:36 word of mouth
76:36 is probably the biggest thing you can do
76:38 [Music]
76:41 but we can't control our kids we don't
76:44 want to control our kids
76:45 again you might be a grandparent with
76:47 grandkids so
76:48 you know depending on how your family is
76:50 configured physically
76:52 location wise you may not have any
76:53 influence over your kids and so you want
76:55 your kids to live great lives perhaps
76:57 the one that you lived
76:58 but now you're looking at stupid experts
77:00 running around the world
77:01 like chicken little saying the sky is
77:03 falling constantly because some fake
77:05 news
77:05 column told them that that's the case
77:09 and they could be the mezzanine they
77:11 could be your kid who's freaking out
77:13 your grandkid
77:15 to the point that they might hurt
77:16 themselves fatally
77:19 i don't think that was the case in my
77:20 particular situation but
77:23 it's happening so i want to make you hip
77:26 to this archetype
77:29 watch people on social media i think
77:31 quite frankly if you have even a hundred
77:33 virtual friends on social media
77:35 especially facebook
77:37 you can just go right after this episode
77:39 tab into your
77:41 home feed and with what you've learned
77:43 in this episode if you didn't already
77:45 know it
77:45 you can go oh there's one there's one
77:48 there's one oh that's interesting
77:50 this person is trying to control me from
77:51 their home this person showing me they
77:53 want a boating trip yesterday
77:55 or over the weekend oh that is right
77:58 yeah that one's in that political party
77:59 and that one's in that political party
78:01 isn't that interesting and you know the
78:04 fundamental difference
78:07 and this has been going on for ages i
78:08 just started watching rowan atkinson's
78:10 old show on bbc called
78:12 not the nine o'clock news and they were
78:15 making fun of
78:17 these archetypes which is really back in
78:19 the 70s and early 80s
78:22 but one group has always been big
78:25 government
78:26 controlling you and one group has been
78:28 get rid of these
78:30 these people who don't know anything
78:32 about me
78:33 who are trying to create a
78:33 one-size-fits-all solution for the world
78:35 which never works
78:37 that's marxism that's socialism
78:41 and we realize because we've typically
78:43 experienced more of life that's what i
78:44 find out when you smoke cigars
78:46 at a lounge or you've got a group of
78:48 buddies and they can smoke a stick at
78:50 two o'clock in the afternoon because
78:52 they're self-employed they've
78:54 once you're self-employed you've lived
78:56 more life than most people on planet
78:58 earth
78:59 and if you're self-employed you know
79:00 that for a fact even if you've been
79:01 self-employed and you're not
79:02 self-employed by choice
79:04 you know you've lived both sides of the
79:06 coin
79:08 and you'll typically have very similar
79:10 conversations
79:12 and i think we have to disrupt that
79:16 we have to disrupt this uh
79:19 look the other way thing
79:23 do you realize that right now on planet
79:25 earth because we are so worried about
79:27 everyone's emotions and everyone's
79:28 feelings of which are completely dynamic
79:31 and the scale is never
79:32 never the same the spectrum of what
79:33 defends one person versus another person
79:35 is never alike
79:39 we can let a country over populate in
79:41 this world
79:42 and take over the whole planet because
79:44 it would be offensive for us to call
79:45 them on the phone and say hey
79:48 knock it off you know you're screwing
79:51 too much
79:52 sorry get that [ __ ] under control
79:55 because you can't take over the world
79:57 just because you
79:58 procreate too much and you're spreading
80:01 your people all over the planet you
80:02 don't have you have plenty of land
80:03 you're not even spreading in your own
80:04 land you get
80:06 phantom cities that can house almost a
80:08 billion people
80:09 but you're farming them all over the
80:10 place
80:12 you can't take over the world just
80:13 because you screw too much and just
80:15 because you claim you're offended if i
80:16 happen to recognize
80:18 the emperor has no clothes on
80:22 and there's a million of those things
80:23 going on
80:25 anyway i hope you dug the episode i'll
80:28 be uh recording
80:29 season six episodes as all these uh
80:31 frames render
80:32 and i'm looking at a render right now
80:34 it's gonna take probably three days
80:36 three days and it's like it's like uh
80:41 about 65 frames of animation
80:45 unbelievable so i'll try to see if i
80:47 can't speed that stuff up with some
80:48 other techniques
80:50 anyway i hope you guys are having a
80:52 great year uh we are going to start
80:54 pouring these episodes out like crazy
80:56 so i'm going to try to get a chunk done
80:58 before new year's
81:00 to pay you guys back for having the
81:02 patience to wait for me
81:05 if you haven't gone to
81:06 deepthoughtsradio.com that's the place
81:07 to go that's where you can find
81:09 everything even
81:10 episodes that you can't find anymore
81:14 so we've got uh two reliable video
81:16 sources youtube and bid shoe we've got
81:18 all the
81:18 podcasts you could ever want we got
81:20 social media
81:22 which is typically uh facebook
81:25 twitter and then we've got uh
81:28 mines.comandgab.com
81:31 i try to get on the parlor but you know
81:33 it's the weird platform i'm really
81:35 excited about it
81:37 um there's an all-new remastered season
81:39 one which causes a little bit of
81:40 confusion for folks if i mention an
81:42 episode and you're searching the channel
81:43 you can't find it
81:45 that's why you want to search on all the
81:46 episodes of deep thoughts radio
81:48 and i've actually for those of you go
81:50 there often you'll realize that in the
81:52 last
81:52 month and a half i've sped everything up
81:55 for any of you wordpress fans never
81:57 ever ever ever install jetpack it slows
82:00 your server down 10 times
82:02 and i have like 20 copies on the server
82:04 side through them all up the server now
82:05 all the sites are super fast
82:09 you have a few ways to donate to the
82:10 page and i just want to say a huge shout
82:12 out to everyone who's
82:14 been so generous uh i mean i just got
82:16 another paypal today i just so
82:18 appreciate it
82:20 and i'm very transparent about the money
82:22 i i generate so
82:24 you know from time um if i settle a
82:28 a wallet somewhere i'll actually
82:30 announce it on the episode so if you
82:32 just listen to episodes and write it all
82:33 down you'll know every penny i've ever
82:34 made
82:36 i think the youtube channel before it
82:37 was demonetized i think it
82:39 grossed about 1600 bucks that was over
82:42 six
82:42 years so you know obviously censorship
82:46 right now is just off the chain
82:48 so i just went to a channel to
82:52 research like you know ancient mysteries
82:55 and that kind of stuff talking about
82:56 pyramids and stuff and the guy was
82:57 demonetized
82:59 so i'm i'm going okay wait did he have a
83:01 conspiracy video or something
83:03 and other than suggesting that
83:04 archaeologists have gotten things wrong
83:06 and suggesting the history had it wrong
83:08 and not in any heavy-handed way in fact
83:09 his
83:10 episodes are incredibly boring he never
83:12 really reveals anything super deep
83:15 if you've done any research on other
83:16 channels the guy was demonetized
83:19 wow so their their reach is getting
83:22 more and more intense to make sure that
83:24 you just can't wake up in
83:26 any artery in the world which is why we
83:28 have to find alternatives and put these
83:30 guys out of business
83:32 so when the lawsuits come around you
83:34 know and they're like hey maybe there's
83:35 an anti-trust thing here a monopoly
83:37 there
83:37 you gotta get on board with those and
83:39 support the push until they're wiped out
83:42 or
83:42 they're corrected you know because like
83:45 marshall mcluhan said
83:47 the medium by which you receive messages
83:49 or information is more important
83:52 than the information itself and that's
83:54 because certain methodologies
83:56 can make you believe things are real
83:57 that aren't real thus forging
84:00 stupid experts anyway
84:04 take care of yourself and someone else
84:05 and i'll see you in the next deep
84:07 thoughts
84:08 over now
84:28 so
84:34 [Applause]
84:40 [Music]
84:42 so
84:45 you
