00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts man I guess the season
00:34 fives gonna be like 80% at night I might
00:40 get a little bit more daytime action
00:43 here in December because one of my
00:45 writing projects is in a in a little
00:48 holding pattern while I wait for some
00:51 feedback I'm gonna start a new movie
00:55 though on my own which I've been working
00:57 on back of my head for a few months but
01:03 I thought today we talk about alien gene
01:08 splicing I smoked this little Ashton
01:12 here nice little stick quality company
01:16 pretty damn good taste in new world
01:18 cigar alright big ass label on this
01:22 little tiny this big label on here it's
01:25 like 40% of the stick is covered by the
01:27 band it's cool okay so I think you guys
01:34 know I love the subject of aliens in
01:35 general because I feel like you know
01:40 what we have discussed in this world
01:43 about aliens it's always some again I'll
01:48 lean back on my old phrase unexplained
01:50 science you can watch a one-hour
01:52 documentary on discovery or the sci-fi
01:56 channel you know regarding theories
01:58 about aliens splicing us together and
02:01 they don't really consult doctors and
02:05 scientists regarding the requirements to
02:08 do such a thing
02:09 and I know gene splicing guy myself but
02:12 I think that there are methods of
02:16 definitely looking at some of the
02:17 science that's fairly aboveboard not
02:20 stuff that people probably know off hand
02:24 but you know there's probably several
02:27 ways to do this sort of thing and
02:29 there's always a reason for doing
02:31 something right why would an alien race
02:34 come here and splice into perhaps the
02:36 indigenous
02:37 beings on this planet and create homo
02:40 sapien sapien or just all these other
02:45 amazing beings that we have on this
02:47 planet you know for me I've said it a
02:50 thousand times on the show you guys are
02:52 probably tired of me saying it but for
02:54 me when I look at pretty much any of the
02:57 life on this planet
02:58 you know I'm looking at amazing
03:01 creations you know from from everything
03:03 the insects to the everything fish
03:06 animals everything is majestic and
03:10 amazing and I think with the internet we
03:11 are finally starting to appreciate
03:15 animals a lot more than we ever did in
03:17 the past
03:18 you know Trump just signed this
03:20 executive order making the penalties for
03:23 being cruel to animals where they should
03:26 be you know at least it's a good start
03:28 and you know it's it's interesting that
03:31 anyone that would ever hurt an animal
03:32 you know really with the only the
03:35 objective of creating pain is someone
03:38 who is completely off base
03:41 as a human being and so I'm glad that's
03:44 through you know millions and millions
03:47 and millions of videos on all the social
03:49 media sources people are starting to
03:51 find out well yeah you know these are
03:54 beings that if we're going to especially
03:55 attempt to domesticate several of them
03:58 we need to rethink what they are now
04:01 there's obviously a lot of folks that
04:02 domesticate wild animals and I'm getting
04:05 eaten by them and I think there's some
04:07 wisdom that can be harvested from those
04:09 experiences as well but gene-splicing
04:13 well where are the touch points where
04:17 gene splicing is generally thrown into
04:22 the mix as a possibility well like I
04:25 said you might look at you know again
04:30 there's just some exotic insects I mean
04:33 insects for me are the most phenomenal
04:36 because they're teeny tiny things
04:37 literally and they have brains and their
04:41 brains are very smart and they have all
04:42 kinds of wild instinctual rituals that
04:45 they go through the mating rituals of
04:47 birds I mean
04:49 come on the hill birds doing a little
04:51 dance the little fish that creates the
04:54 beautiful diagram in the sand by just
04:58 sucking the sand in his mouth and
05:00 blowing it out and blowing out water and
05:02 he creates a perfectly symmetrical
05:05 beautiful concentric circle thing I mean
05:08 it's just phenomenal I mean the little
05:11 guys he's got an instinct to procreate
05:14 and you know in most beings out there
05:18 other than human beings we have well
05:21 most wild nonhumans basically they
05:24 copulate extremely fast right so it's
05:26 not I'm sure they you I've seen a tiger
05:29 get really tired right after the the
05:30 magic moment which i think is hilarious
05:33 that everything gets tired right after
05:35 that moment you know it's the guys do
05:37 but uh there's two real touch points of
05:41 my brain for alien splicing homeless
05:43 sapien sapien into existence there's the
05:47 missing link which last time i did my
05:49 big anthropological dig and watch
05:51 lecture after lecture on it some
05:53 conspiratorial that went off into
05:55 bigfoot things hominid worshipping but a
05:58 lot of them were just just lectures just
06:03 medical lectures about it or
06:04 anthropological lectures that are more
06:06 medically based without any conspiracy
06:09 attached to him there's far more those
06:10 out there but the missing link is about
06:13 150 million years you know if you
06:16 believe all their dating well the more
06:19 that that chasm you know expands it's
06:23 more mind-blowing the other gene
06:27 splicing stories that come about or our
06:30 stories that are very similar like your
06:32 planet x theories where an alien race
06:34 comes to you know earth and it's funny
06:39 they come to earth an extremely short
06:40 window of opportunity with at least that
06:44 theory with their planets you know
06:45 careening through the universe and it's
06:47 going to take you know I mean at most if
06:51 they were traveling at least sixty
06:53 thousand miles per hour in space
06:55 relative to our Sun that would only be
06:58 available to really travel to our planet
07:01 and for maybe what
07:02 six months a year and you know that's
07:05 not enough to gestate a human being to
07:08 anything other than an infant you know
07:10 and I really highly doubt that they use
07:12 some we're gonna get into all this stuff
07:14 but this you know some super
07:15 accelerating thing to see what they had
07:16 you know there's just not enough time
07:18 they'd have to be in space and be
07:20 touching us for millions of years
07:22 stopped by you know and left eggs you
07:25 don't jump off their planet and then
07:27 wait for the next epoch of this this
07:30 loop that this you know star nemesis
07:34 with Nibiru come it's all hokey crap but
07:37 whatever but splicing when you take the
07:40 conspiracy theories out of it for you
07:43 know crazy stories like Planet X and
07:46 just look at it from an interstellar
07:48 exploratory theory or for some of you
07:52 maybe interdimensional and for some of
07:54 you maybe you know if this is the dome
07:57 of some sort we're going to talk about
07:59 this I interview my geologist today for
08:01 an hour about her experiences in in
08:04 Antarctica because she went there for a
08:07 little shy of a month but it took her
08:10 three months to do the month there
08:11 basically because you go to camp after
08:13 camp and you keep getting you know
08:15 prepped and trained to do what you need
08:18 to do so let's just look at the theory
08:22 in general because the theory in general
08:25 if it makes anyone roll their eyes I
08:27 don't understand
08:28 maybe rolling your eyes planet X because
08:31 of the logistics of their other half of
08:33 the story which no one ever looks at the
08:34 logistics of it but let's just go back
08:37 to an earth that maybe has naturally
08:40 evolved a hominid a two-legged two-armed
08:45 biped that is like a big giant thing and
08:49 has a smaller brain cavity it doesn't
08:52 have articulated skull and you know
08:54 nasal passages so it can't speak in
08:56 syllables and so they need to refine it
09:02 and get it to be more like them which is
09:04 capable of speaking and developing
09:06 really intense IQ and thus become the
09:10 tool makers that the Homo sapiens
09:12 sapiens are known for here's the kicker
09:14 for anyone who has
09:16 doubts that that would be something that
09:18 would happen on our planet if we were to
09:23 survive our own greed and and and
09:26 finally get rid of these deep state you
09:28 know
09:29 bankers and and oligarchies and
09:33 monarchies on earth and find a way to
09:36 operate in a in a way that economically
09:41 we don't starve people and all that kind
09:44 of stuff and get past this and become
09:45 like the gene roddenberry world's go see
09:48 my episode on Star Trek for a whole
09:49 breakdown of that beautiful universe
09:51 then we would get into this realm where
09:56 a lot of us live who watch this show and
09:58 definitely me making the show or you're
10:00 just creating 24/7 that's what you're
10:04 doing okay so then we start you know if
10:07 their space exists if the universe
10:09 exists is we believe it to be and
10:11 there's a bunch of planets out there and
10:14 other galaxies then we could go to them
10:17 and if we can get to them in a
10:20 reasonable amount of time and we figure
10:22 out a way to accomplish all these things
10:24 we come up with you know ether or
10:26 gravity engines we maybe figure out a
10:29 way to travel faster than the speed of
10:31 light with no problem perhaps there's
10:33 some you know folding space technology
10:36 hyperspace or whatever we can get there
10:38 quickly then we can start serving the
10:42 entire universe just like we surveyed
10:43 the planet of Earth and all of its
10:46 continents and islands and we would most
10:48 likely find although very difficult I'm
10:50 sure an in class planet like Earth like
10:54 Gaia we as human beings have probably no
10:57 problem conceiving of finding a planet
10:59 and you know we're in a different frame
11:02 of mind now we're not necessarily in a
11:04 first contact situation because there
11:06 wouldn't be necessarily an intelligent
11:11 like really like a human sentient
11:13 speaking written language shelter burial
11:18 ritual sort of society down there and
11:21 then we would go okay this is this is
11:22 right for domination makes an oxygenated
11:25 atmosphere the gravity is very similar
11:28 to human beings it's a little heavier
11:30 a little lighter or whatever and at the
11:32 same time at a parallel track of space
11:34 exploration technology we would most
11:37 likely continue to advance and I think
11:39 it's already been accomplished
11:40 all of the medical procedures and
11:45 scientific discoveries to bridge
11:49 automatically species barriers between
11:52 us and whatever's down there such that
11:55 when we introduce our DNA it's not
11:58 rejected its accepted and then it starts
12:00 to splice together for me I think the
12:03 species barrier is phenomenal just the
12:05 concept of a species barrier
12:07 it really makes I think very little
12:11 mathematical sense when it comes to
12:12 evolution evolution you know and they do
12:15 splice you know where they don't splice
12:17 they they you know they mix a lion and a
12:21 tiger together and get this gigantic
12:23 thing they've mixed you know zebras with
12:26 other animals of similar species and a
12:31 lot of times the reproductive organs
12:32 fail to properly create themselves but
12:35 there's a lot of myths about these
12:37 animals not being able to procreate and
12:39 they can it's strange right
12:42 so we've seen within our species on
12:46 earth being able to do this but isn't it
12:48 interesting that if you were to
12:51 inseminate a elephant with a chihuahua
12:54 it won't work it's interesting it's more
12:58 it's it's more than just the microscopic
13:01 compatibility of a sperm and an egg it
13:04 is truly a genetic barrier that says
13:05 you're not like me enough for me to know
13:08 how to bring our two DNA sequences
13:10 together so nothing conceives nothing is
13:13 created no it's probably a really good
13:17 thing because the summer is the world
13:18 we'd have go people but you know what if
13:24 you figured it out what would it take to
13:27 figure it out there's tremendous
13:29 misconceptions about how the human body
13:31 works in general on planet Earth which
13:33 really prevents anyone from having the
13:36 conversation for that long now the
13:38 species barrier thing I just want to go
13:42 into that a little bit because I
13:43 think most of us in the red pill world
13:48 we understand that there have been
13:52 laboratories after laboratory after
13:54 laboratory all around the world every
13:55 major country that you can name has done
14:00 this as unethical as it might sound
14:03 they have spliced all kinds of words
14:06 stuff together and there's been a lot of
14:08 Declassified things admitted to write
14:10 spiders insects linked in with animals
14:14 gene splicing I think that for the
14:20 purposes of what we're talking about the
14:22 level of ingenuity would have to be
14:23 extremely controlled and refined prior
14:28 to the experiments taking place whereas
14:30 human beings are kind of going well
14:32 let's just see what happens you know
14:34 let's put a spider with a pig you know
14:36 and somehow they get that to work now
14:38 there's this there's two techniques that
14:43 I understand that could possibly be done
14:46 one you've heard about gene splicing and
14:49 that is to take an embryo and start
14:52 playing with its DNA before it ever
14:53 develops in anything and then you can
14:55 put random you know nucleic acid
14:58 sequences into DNA such that it will
15:01 start replicating RNA and then reform a
15:04 DNA and there just keeps going until you
15:05 have some weird monstrosity I would hate
15:08 to think about the experiments that man
15:11 has done because I'm sure they did it
15:13 with you know non-human varieties from
15:16 animals to insects to finished or
15:18 whatever birds but at some point I think
15:21 that if any of these laboratories went
15:23 for any length of time you're sort of
15:26 reptilian brain scientist is going to
15:29 have no problem working with human DNA
15:32 at some point there have been rumors
15:35 from folks working in deep clearance
15:39 locations in the United States of seeing
15:41 reptilian humans escorted by black suit
15:45 people there's actually one that I don't
15:50 know if it was part of part of project
15:52 disclosure but there was a guy's as a
15:54 British dude sitting at a picnic table
15:56 I've mentioned this only once
15:57 for but he said that on one particular
15:59 day at this facility and I can't
16:02 remember which facility it was I don't
16:04 think it was anything that has like a
16:06 name that we know like 51 or something
16:08 like that but he said he left his office
16:11 to go to another office and he said
16:14 suddenly he found himself in a hallway
16:16 it's the hallway everybody uses the
16:18 corridor and there were two black suits
16:20 on both sides of this reptilian-human
16:24 that was very large and the dude said
16:27 look I just got a glance at it but in
16:30 this particular world that I work in
16:32 this is the sky talking he said you know
16:34 you're not allowed to look where you're
16:36 not allowed to look and as so does so as
16:38 soon as you're surprised
16:40 seeing something you want to make sure
16:44 that you are observed not observing so
16:47 that no one you know chases you down but
16:51 the dude seemed genuinely freaked out
16:52 about what he saw but what was
16:56 interesting about as he said you know
16:57 what I thought I saw in that instant of
17:00 a moment writes that vision worth you
17:05 know 10,000 pages he said I just got
17:10 this sense that it was probably someone
17:14 having spliced a human being with
17:16 something else because this thing didn't
17:19 seem to have its own mind meaning it had
17:24 to be escorted from point A to point B
17:26 and it wasn't like you know tell a story
17:29 or moving on its own in a way that we
17:34 would do you know if one of us got
17:36 escorted by our two black suits we you
17:38 know you definitely get a sense that
17:39 this person is alive but he says you
17:42 know sort of like a dead-eyed being the
17:44 sort of the gist of what I got out of it
17:46 so and then there's the conspiracies
17:50 about governments creating alien looking
17:55 beings in order to facilitate this fake
17:59 alien invasion and then of course you
18:01 have all the logistics of trying to pull
18:03 that off or you might be able to put a
18:06 bunch of these beings you know you you
18:08 you raise them you
18:10 of them a totally different world of
18:12 Education totally different world of
18:14 influence I mean you realize you know I
18:17 was making a joke to a friend of mine
18:19 you know you could have a kid and if you
18:23 had enough money maybe not even maybe it
18:25 wouldn't even take that much money I
18:27 think this happens in various areas of
18:29 rural America where they don't have a
18:31 lot of money but you could raise a child
18:34 to believe that the world is like it was
18:37 in 1975 a child doesn't have the right
18:40 you know what so sorry excuse me a child
18:42 doesn't have the ability just to hop in
18:44 the car and go somewhere so if you were
18:46 to say okay just like a was it that the
18:50 sixth sense guy they created that one
18:52 where everyone was picked back in the
18:55 past and I forgot what year would have
18:57 been it's kind of a Quaker little
18:58 Society and you found out something
19:00 about that later well and just at the
19:02 spoil it for you during the modern age
19:04 and somehow you know planes didn't fly
19:06 over and all this other stuff it's a
19:08 very fascinating thing so you would have
19:10 to raise where you could raise these
19:13 kids in a world that looks totally
19:18 space-age you could tell them they're on
19:19 a spaceship you know you could you could
19:22 run the windows you could say they can't
19:24 see out for a particular reason there
19:25 are no windows and they if you don't if
19:28 you don't know there's something outside
19:30 you wouldn't want to see it and so they
19:33 could create a language for these beings
19:35 that's totally different and you just
19:40 never don't you could talk to them
19:41 through a computer you know once you get
19:44 them up to a certain now someone's gonna
19:45 have to take care of them and feed them
19:46 and get them to the point where they can
19:48 maintain themselves they got to eat and
19:50 clean themselves and and learn things
19:53 see someone's gonna have to teach them
19:54 if that was going to be the case but you
19:56 could push a bunch of them inside of a
19:57 vehicle that has you know black
20:00 technology it's you know flying around
20:02 looks like a UFO and then it lands in
20:05 your in your and you're on your street
20:08 and then the door opens up and of course
20:10 they're going to come popping out and
20:13 they're preconditioned perfectly to say
20:16 everything that you would ever want an
20:18 alien to say and then of course the
20:21 locations are automatically
20:24 known because they're landing these
20:27 vehicles in various areas and so they
20:28 could make a public landing and then you
20:31 know what looks like normal people
20:33 coming in to talk to them and get them
20:36 you know taken off somewhere to talk to
20:38 their leader our leader those are all
20:40 just actors and then boom you've got the
20:43 scam pretty interesting right be
20:47 interesting if like they made some
20:48 mistakes on that day you know the
20:50 vehicle what I'm just flops on the
20:52 ground and unfortunately would probably
20:54 kill everybody inside but so because
20:58 mankind would do this in two seconds if
21:00 we could we could travel the universe if
21:03 it truly is an open space out there and
21:05 if we could find an in-class planet and
21:07 especially if we could find an
21:09 indigenous race of you know bipedal
21:13 beings that okay that's the best thing
21:17 we have to matching our own DNA then we
21:21 could start splicing or start doing what
21:24 we do now again if I always recommend
21:28 everyone go off and listen to Bruce
21:31 Lipton's book the wisdom of our cells
21:33 because he'll teach you the rest of the
21:35 creation process of a human cell
21:38 especially the chromosome and the
21:41 protein patterns that dictate the
21:43 nucleic acid chain combinations and so
21:46 in my knowledge and my estimate of how
21:50 this would be done properly we would
21:53 have reached a point where we can well
21:57 first we have a full catalogue of our
21:59 own protein patterns we know exactly
22:01 what makes us tick there's no protein
22:03 patterns that would ever travel in the
22:05 human body that we wouldn't have fully
22:06 documented and protein patterns you know
22:09 they come together and they procreate
22:10 that's why again you have to eat red
22:13 meat because five of the pieces that you
22:17 need to make healthy proteins is in red
22:19 meat and the other three can be gathered
22:21 through other methodologies and I've
22:25 actually heard it up to eight you know
22:27 the eight is you only get from red meat
22:28 you can't get it from fish you can't get
22:30 it from chicken and you know look at all
22:33 the dominant species on this planet you
22:35 know you go to the jungle
22:36 is the ruler of the jungle the lion or
22:39 even a tiger well they eat meat you know
22:43 even the prophesized Tyrannosaurus Rex
22:47 and all the big dinosaurs are all meat
22:49 eaters so everything that eats meat
22:51 turns into the dominant race because the
22:53 brain and the visual cortex grow with
22:55 meat proteins especially red meat of
22:58 course and that's how we get you know
23:00 who we are you know the other thing too
23:04 is that you do get aggressive because
23:06 you're so sentient with a bigger brain
23:09 that you sense injustice and part of
23:12 agenda21 entire objective is to turn
23:15 everyone into vegetarians which makes us
23:18 extremely docile very unhealthy etc etc
23:21 so I think that a gene splicing routine
23:25 would have to do with looking at the
23:27 differential between the protein
23:29 patterns and a particular being and then
23:32 whatever we want to splice it with now
23:35 for those of you who haven't you know
23:36 watched any other show the theory of
23:39 this missing link which I don't know
23:42 about you and I've never had anyone
23:43 comment on this please comment if you
23:46 can
23:46 I was thought the missing link was a
23:49 very quick little thing and I didn't
23:51 really understand what it meant until I
23:54 researched it and again they have
23:56 approximately 32 different skulls of
23:59 what they believed to be an evolving
24:01 hominid and it doesn't evolve in terms
24:03 of its brain capacity per capita of the
24:06 size of the skull what evolved was that
24:09 the skulls got bigger these are really
24:13 really old skulls right so what's
24:16 interesting about it is is somehow bone
24:18 preserved for this really long period of
24:20 time I don't believe they're fossilized
24:22 and then there's this huge gap now again
24:26 it could be a carbon dating issue or
24:27 whatever but we do have in one fell
24:30 swoop with no intermediate skulls the
24:34 homo sapiens sapiens skull the Homo
24:36 Sapien skeleton that's way way different
24:40 and that Lucy thing was a complete joke
24:43 right they they found a basically a
24:46 monkey or a gorilla with a tear shaped
24:49 rib cage which
24:51 not Homo Sapien right we don't have big
24:54 giant arms that force our our lung
24:58 capacity and our ribs to go into a tier
25:00 shape but that's what all monkeys all
25:03 gorillas have because that's the way
25:05 they're built so if you ask an
25:07 anthropologist they will tell you that
25:09 even though you can strip down a gorilla
25:13 any form of monkey and look at their
25:15 bones and then look at a human body
25:18 stripped down they say there is not a
25:21 single bone of a human being inside an
25:23 ape or vice versa and so a lot of them
25:26 quietly reject the theory of evolution
25:30 without a replacement theory because
25:33 they're not a lot of them are not
25:35 willing to jump off on creationism as a
25:37 replacement and you know I respect that
25:39 and I don't know what I think you know
25:42 but let me let me give you an analogy of
25:46 the engineering of the human skull
25:49 versus all the hominids that came before
25:51 in gorillas and what-have-you right
25:53 let's say you had a a whistle a whistle
25:59 made out of a piece of wood all it has
26:03 is a aperture for your mouth and then a
26:06 hole at the end there are no little
26:08 holes to put your fingers in at the top
26:11 but you blow on it and it makes a
26:14 whistling noise through it of course you
26:15 have to have some sort of valve down by
26:17 the by the mouthpiece of course it's
26:19 like a whistle you might blowing a cop
26:21 whistle right that's about the
26:23 sophistication of the inside of a
26:25 hominid skull all they do is howl and
26:28 that's why in the jungle you hear
26:31 variants of howling so you know you've
26:34 heard a million different movies have
26:36 these things in it but even though a
26:38 monkey might go up up up up up up up
26:39 it's still just a howl
26:41 they've just created a rhythm to the
26:43 hell and of course you can vary through
26:45 dopplers effect and a bunch of other
26:47 things the tone of the how by changing
26:51 the amount of air you push over your
26:56 vibrating bits but the human skull gains
27:00 this amazing chamber inside the nasal
27:04 cavity
27:05 and our tongue is utterly phenomenal in
27:08 distinguishing between different
27:10 languages I mean you know how many
27:11 rolling r's do we have how many you know
27:14 there's tribes that have the popping
27:16 noises in their in their language which
27:19 is I think so cool at the same time the
27:22 brain capacity of a human being is
27:26 massive compared to the skull what does
27:29 that do for us well it increases our
27:33 ability to create a denser neural net
27:36 well the more data you can store the
27:40 more that you can sense the your
27:41 surroundings the more you can think
27:43 about it now having said that look at
27:48 all the insects look at all the fish
27:49 with teeny tiny brains all the little
27:52 animals out there with teeny tiny brains
27:54 that manage to live hundreds of years
27:58 there I've recently bumped into this and
28:01 I've never heard this as a kid but there
28:04 were they're now finding this there's a
28:07 particular shark that I don't believe
28:10 it's of any danger to man but this shark
28:13 lives I forgot the name of it but it has
28:15 to it can't procreate until it's a
28:18 hundred and fifty years old and they
28:21 found one that they believe is 400 years
28:23 old and when you see it it's huge and
28:27 you can actually believe it so somehow
28:29 it doesn't have a predator that's easily
28:32 you know endangering its life and it
28:35 just roams around but its skull I mean
28:39 sorry its brain cavity it's still
28:43 relatively small especially compared to
28:45 the size of the bean now again you know
28:48 there are you know I feel like animals
28:52 are getting smarter in the world the
28:53 more that we connect with them
28:55 empathetically but you've always had a
28:57 friend this is my cat's really smart my
28:58 dogs really smart and then some of them
29:01 are I mean it's tremendous what they did
29:03 what they know and there's insects that
29:06 act like pets it's weird well John
29:09 Cleese and his pet bee remember that
29:10 whole thing so you know they look at
29:13 like the size of a dolphin brain then of
29:15 course dolphins do all these wild tricks
29:17 they seem to have a little
29:18 personality in them and it should be the
29:21 case right
29:21 dogs have personalities cats at
29:23 personalities but they when they really
29:26 measure the areas of the brain that make
29:29 a dolphin's brain gigantic it's all the
29:31 cerebellum muscle memory tiller House
29:34 swim to do all their tricks and not
29:37 necessarily the cognitive front of low
29:39 frontal lobes that might really help
29:41 them discern philosophy you know we have
29:45 monkeys that can do excuse me apes that
29:47 can do sign language it's interesting I
29:50 mean what an amazing thing you know
29:53 watch that video I think I mentioned it
29:55 about 10 episodes ago about Robin
29:57 Williams saying goodbye to one of the
30:00 monkeys that was sort of you know it's I
30:03 forgot her name because she was kind of
30:06 you know being she was kind of ill and
30:08 they knew that her lifespan was coming
30:10 to an end but you know it wants to hug
30:13 you and you know there's a bunch of
30:15 these monkeys they're a bunch of these
30:16 gorillas out there they can do this it's
30:20 like it's interesting right but the
30:22 other theory that's very interesting and
30:23 I just want to throw out there because I
30:24 always forget to say this which is I
30:27 even forgot to say to my evolution 2.0
30:30 or whatever it was there is a question
30:33 of if evolution is a certainty then why
30:38 do we not like we don't we don't have
30:41 prehistoric things still here everything
30:45 evolved up into its next logical thing
30:48 we don't have what we still have monkeys
30:52 we still have gorillas but were
30:54 supposedly descendants of them according
30:56 to evolutionists and so why are they
30:58 still there we they should have all
31:00 moved up into some humanoid thing if
31:03 that's if it's some logical thing that
31:04 starts to occur and a bunch of them eat
31:07 meat oh my god I watched videos where
31:10 chimpanzees or just eating the crap out
31:14 of rhesus monkeys eating their own kind
31:17 I watched it was gross you know so the
31:21 other thing about evolution that doesn't
31:24 make sense to me is that we don't have
31:28 we have a lot of different human beings
31:30 of course
31:31 human beings big giant human beings I
31:33 was at Disneyland
31:35 two months ago three months ago waiting
31:39 in line to get some food and there was
31:42 this Latin family in front of me and I'm
31:45 telling you these there was three women
31:47 that obviously were related one of them
31:49 was the mother you could tell two more
31:50 sisters / daughters and they were the
31:53 tiniest human beings I've ever seen they
31:55 weren't dwarfed they weren't what I was
31:58 thought is [ __ ] which is a perfectly
32:00 proportional small person they were just
32:03 there probably about 4 8 somewhere in
32:07 there and proportioned and it's just
32:10 wherever they come from they're tiny
32:11 people you know and I've been at
32:14 Disneyland I went on a Space Mountain
32:17 once with these and some of you guys
32:19 didn't notice there's two brothers they
32:21 have a Latin last name they look pretty
32:23 Caucasian but they're both 70 feet tall
32:25 and they're famous they were famous
32:28 college basketball players when I saw
32:30 them and I think they've split up into
32:32 two different teams that are pro now but
32:35 I went on Space Mountain with them which
32:37 is a roller coaster inside a beautiful
32:39 enclosure and I was wondering like I'm
32:42 standing next to these dudes and their
32:43 hit was if their belt was about right up
32:46 here by my chin I was like damn these
32:49 are some tall dudes man and they
32:50 actually fit in the front car both of
32:54 them side by side and it worked
32:57 perfectly they actually had legroom and
32:59 everything the bar came over them just
33:00 fine I was like man that engineering to
33:03 put two guys I know family members of
33:06 mine that are too fat to ride the ride
33:07 because the bar can't click on their
33:10 belly right very interesting but why
33:13 don't we have elfs halflings dwarfs you
33:20 know why don't we have even an ogre you
33:24 know or an orc why don't we have these
33:27 these human beings at all different
33:30 levels of evolution and I know some
33:33 people would speculate that that's the
33:35 case but it's not the case but I mean we
33:38 don't have necessarily like physically
33:42 mechanically hath evolves human beings
33:45 we're all here now some are smarter than
33:48 others because they have weird
33:49 governments that repress them or they
33:51 just have been living in the jungle
33:53 that's different that's just access to
33:55 information but you know you find a
33:57 tribe out there and it was it north of
34:01 New Zealand and you know I was watching
34:04 like I said am I
34:05 I said like three or four episodes what
34:07 I was talking about them discovering
34:09 these tribes in the 80's and 90's and
34:13 there some one were black guys you know
34:16 a black tribe and one was a Peruvian
34:18 tribe now I don't have much reference
34:20 for Peruvian genetics but some of the
34:23 black guys in these tribes that were
34:25 still undiscovered by me and I they look
34:30 like friends of mine some of them look
34:31 like friends of mine so that genetic is
34:33 exactly like the other genetic but my
34:35 friends have obviously grown up modern
34:36 societies they're just as amazing as I
34:38 am and you know but this other tribe is
34:41 this other group of humans are fully
34:43 developed
34:44 they're just tribal people you know so
34:48 we don't have that disparaging DNA in us
34:52 so I think evolution really falls short
34:54 of proving itself through the lack of
34:57 variety in Homo sapiens how many dogs
34:59 are there how many cats are there I mean
35:02 there's a there's just such DIF such a
35:05 spectrum how many different bears do we
35:07 have you know was it the anteater I mean
35:10 I didn't realize there were so many
35:11 different species of ant eaters we
35:12 should have that too and yes we have
35:14 some different pigmentation colors and
35:15 we have different nose shapes and
35:17 what-have-you but we're really similar I
35:21 mean all of us are pretty damn similar
35:22 just if you were to take a knee pick a
35:24 color pick any color you like and take
35:27 every human being on earth and you know
35:29 for hair and skin colors change it all
35:32 to the same maybe make it a funny color
35:34 and then compare us all across the
35:37 spectrum we're damn near exactly the
35:41 same you know so I think that begs some
35:45 questions as well but let's say at the
35:48 time of this missing link you don't have
35:53 any evolutionary skulls because there
35:55 weren't any hominids
35:58 would have most likely have been the
36:00 base DNA slice protein patterns that
36:03 this race would have used otherwise we
36:07 would look just like them and probably
36:08 look really really different there's a
36:11 chance that they just dropped off some
36:13 of their own people and then all sudden
36:15 were here right but I guess the first
36:18 question you might ask is why why would
36:21 they do it well I would you know being a
36:25 storyteller myself I would well the
36:27 analogy I always use is like imagine you
36:31 know you do have some I mean this simple
36:35 one is to say that that every being is
36:38 programmed to procreate and hand down
36:41 their legacy so there could be just that
36:43 that basic thought process that creates
36:46 the will to do this okay but if you were
36:51 you know I don't know what if there's
36:53 like like an alien invasion of some sort
36:56 and it's not you know it's not good it's
36:58 like was it Starship Troopers where
37:02 there are insectoids running around or
37:04 like edge of tomorrow
37:07 with Tom Cruise my favorite movies this
37:10 is something is definitely not human and
37:12 we're fighting it out but they're
37:14 winning they're winning they're winning
37:17 they're winning and it gets to the point
37:19 where just through sheer geography they
37:22 have wiped out like every race on earth
37:25 except for one race but you're sort of
37:28 in that realm and you know the irony in
37:32 a great movie would be some guy's a
37:34 racist right let's say he's racist
37:36 against maybe Chinese people and China
37:38 is the last place to get dominated just
37:40 from sheer luck and this guy's in there
37:43 and he's a racist and he's fighting this
37:46 out but he realizes all of a sudden it's
37:48 all about human against creature and so
37:52 he almost like would try to maintain his
37:55 racism he just he's raised with it
37:57 whatever his goddamn problem is but the
37:59 very last second they're winning and
38:02 this dude dies he's gonna realize for
38:06 the this is a great story right so he
38:08 looks up like a Chinese guys been
38:10 treating him well even though he's been
38:11 a dick
38:12 the other way and he realizes okay I'm
38:14 about to die and I'm the last of my race
38:16 whatever the hell that is and at least
38:19 at the last second he's like at least
38:20 humanity won you know and so there are
38:24 all kinds of things that could come into
38:26 the mind of an alien to to make sure
38:29 their DNA lasts all over the universe
38:32 maybe their planets getting destroyed or
38:34 whatever you know so I think there's
38:36 plenty of plenty of reasons not that
38:38 anyone's really debating that particular
38:39 part of the game but okay let's talk
38:43 about the logistics of it okay well if
38:48 they can do this that means they got
38:50 here somehow which means they have a
38:52 barrage of ships some Armada of ships
38:54 that are going to to land and let's just
38:59 do a little bit of logistics they'd have
39:00 to have some facilities to do all their
39:03 experiments in place to live maybe
39:05 they're totally monotone need no
39:08 entertainment so that doesn't come or it
39:09 does come but they need a probably an
39:11 enforcer group of their alien you know
39:15 species to make sure predators don't get
39:17 them maybe they can set up in a way that
39:20 that's not even an issue machines take
39:22 care of it but then they're gonna need
39:24 time even if their exports are gonna
39:26 need time now they could come capture
39:29 some of our beings simulate our
39:32 environment in their world get it all
39:35 patented and drop them off but I think
39:40 it'd be easier to work with in the
39:41 environment that these beings would have
39:43 to live in and why work with indigenous
39:45 DNA first well as we all know anything
39:50 that could live on a planet is
39:51 beautifully balanced with nature so
39:54 nature is providing food because before
39:56 shopping centers and grocery stores we
39:59 had to go get our own food and so you
40:01 know maybe you don't get meat every day
40:02 cuz it's really hard to capture so you
40:05 can you know nuts and berries and fruits
40:07 and that kind of stuff vegetables
40:08 whatever you're eating to kind of tide
40:11 yourself over nutrition wise and someone
40:14 kills a wild boar or a bull or some
40:17 mammoth and boy everyone eats for a
40:19 while so the beautiful thing is is you
40:21 might actually get a lot of DNA the SLAs
40:24 protein programming
40:25 accomplished by the planet itself you
40:28 won't have to start from complete
40:29 scratch but that depends on their level
40:33 of sophistication now I mentioned this a
40:35 couple times the season but there's the
40:37 Star Trek episodes where they ask the
40:40 computer to synthesize the DNA of some
40:44 piece of evidence they found somewhere
40:47 maybe like a like a fingernail of some
40:48 material and they put it in the computer
40:51 and it samples it and then because the
40:54 computer understands the cause and
40:55 effect a protein pattern folding as it
40:57 relates to do clay gas and creation it's
41:00 able to synthesize up and follow all the
41:03 structural rules of the human body and
41:05 of life in general and it's able to
41:08 create the monster the person and show
41:12 you what exactly like what the being
41:14 would look like so say maybe clothing in
41:17 hairstyle right that seems crazy today
41:21 but you know it's not too crazy if you
41:24 think about quantum computing taking off
41:27 and then having a few hundred years to
41:29 do what it does they can't accomplish it
41:33 and you know I I'm trying to figure out
41:35 a way I've been trying to figure out for
41:37 a couple years on how to explain what
41:40 I'm about to attempt to explain here
41:41 probably do it really badly the first
41:43 time here but there's all these
41:46 experiments well excuse me there's all
41:47 these projects in the world to try and
41:49 figure out pretty much the infinitely
41:51 complex you know kurtz well with the
41:53 singularity project trying to figure out
41:55 the human mind there's obviously a
41:58 tremendous amount of experimentation you
42:00 can do to figure out how syn up fires
42:03 electricity through the brain whether or
42:05 not when you're on cocaine there's a
42:08 chemical / electrical pattern that makes
42:12 this what it is right because there's a
42:16 lot of talk about you know digitizing
42:18 the brain and putting inside of a
42:19 computer and of course the it's it's
42:22 it's about like saying we're gonna
42:24 create miss possums over there about
42:27 creating a computer that's going to
42:30 understand where every particle is in
42:33 the world such that we can predict
42:35 whether perfectly
42:37 you can't capture all of the particles
42:40 in the world at least currently we don't
42:43 have any methodology of figuring out
42:45 where everything is I mean there's
42:47 trillions upon trillions to the power of
42:49 trillions of things that make up our
42:51 planet however some of you know that you
42:56 know they used to teach artificial
42:57 intelligence one sentence at a time one
43:00 word at a time
43:01 breaking down noun subject verb noun and
43:05 making it understand you know relative
43:08 morals oh this is good this is bad when
43:10 your death it's not good when you hear
43:12 birth it's good and so nowadays they
43:17 just point an AI at the internet and say
43:21 read everything you possibly can we've
43:23 taught you the basics you got this
43:24 kernel now we want to see what you can
43:26 do with that kernel of knowledge of
43:29 course you know translating to every
43:30 single language out there and so there's
43:32 a lot of cause and effect that can occur
43:34 in a computer's mind my my uncle told me
43:38 it was deep into this stuff in the 80s
43:41 he told me probably around 84 85 that
43:46 the AI that he had been dealing with was
43:50 capable of basically probability and so
43:55 it could read an article and say okay a
43:56 semi-truck is going this direction a car
43:59 is going that direction it's a slippery
44:02 road will these two vehicles hit each
44:06 other and it would think and go probably
44:09 you know I mean that's pretty cool
44:11 that's pretty intense deduction again
44:14 they're all based on human rules that
44:15 are put into the code etc etc but now
44:19 when I worked on or worked with excuse
44:22 me
44:23 the folding at home project is Stanford
44:27 and I was providing graphical stuff for
44:30 them so I wasn't doing any research or
44:31 anything but I sat there and got a
44:33 couple good talks with Penza that's PA
44:37 in je or GE the guy that runs the place
44:41 because I met him that's how I got
44:44 involved
44:45 he was just sitting outside eating some
44:48 lunch or something and I saw him and I
44:50 was like you're that guy
44:51 you know and he liked that so he was
44:54 teaching me all about protein patterns
44:56 within our conversation it was just all
44:57 mind-blowing and then I bumped into
44:59 Bruce Lipton I was like oh my god the
45:01 pictures been completed for me but he
45:05 was telling me flat-out to my face he
45:07 goes look he goes protein powders have
45:10 been clocked folding faster than the
45:12 speed of light so he goes we don't
45:14 understand how this is possible
45:16 and what they were studying was a
45:18 protein in its original form and then
45:21 protein after it's done its activation
45:23 which is I believe that involves a fold
45:25 and so after it's completely folded in
45:28 its final state it activates and then
45:30 starts dictating instructions to the
45:33 body okay so if we are able to create a
45:39 device that can take a picture of some
45:42 sort a chemical picture a physical
45:45 picture that discerns the chemical
45:46 combinations the proteins the pieces of
45:50 the protein and then watch it fold or at
45:53 least see it after its fold at which
45:54 they do today
45:55 there's tons of that data what they
45:57 didn't know which is what folding at
45:58 home is all about is trying to figure
46:00 out exactly how it folds I mean it's one
46:04 of these things if you had you know you
46:08 had a shoe what the shoelace is untied
46:10 and then you see it tied well we know
46:13 there's four or five ways to tie a
46:14 shoelace but if that shoelace being tied
46:17 creates a protein virus like mad cow the
46:21 bovine encephalitis BSE was right it
46:27 they want to be able to put a finger in
46:30 there right when you're folding the
46:31 tying the knot to prevent it from time
46:34 so they can stop protein viruses from
46:37 occurring or maybe make them who knows
46:39 right but right now they're dumb to any
46:43 I should say ignorant they're ignorant
46:46 to how the physical composition of a
46:50 protein pattern of a particular
46:52 combination would fold as an empirical
46:57 piece of information right so if you had
47:00 a piece of paper and 8 by 10 piece of
47:01 paper with a seam down the middle
47:03 because someone's already done the fold
47:04 or you just see a piece of paper and you
47:08 know that it folds directly in half well
47:12 then you could look at the before and
47:13 after and probably deduce oh it looks
47:14 like someone just folded it in half and
47:16 because there's no other creases
47:18 anywhere in the paper like an origami
47:20 experiment you didn't fold previous to
47:22 this one fold and you'd have a rule that
47:24 pieces of paper that you bite to him
47:26 they end up folded in half are gonna
47:28 fold this one way but if they could
47:30 extend that knowledge into a quantum
47:33 computer or use a quantum computer to
47:35 figure out the probability of folding
47:37 and then test it and find out you can
47:39 always block a protein from completing a
47:41 fold with this algorithm that is 100%
47:45 then we could run that algorithm on
47:48 let's say we figured it out with four
47:50 proteins but it always works so these
47:53 rules that are inside this program are
47:55 so good that now we just run every
47:57 protein through that piece of software
47:59 and it's one for one accurate and then
48:02 we have our protein folding rules that
48:06 then 100% work therefore we have a from
48:09 two technology to engineer these
48:14 proteins and thus cause effect so we get
48:19 our hominid we look at its proteins look
48:22 at our proteins we'd have ourselves
48:24 completely sequences right the genome
48:26 project was sort of a waste of time the
48:28 genome projects real objective was to to
48:32 sequence the average DNA of a human
48:35 being and then allow exotic companies
48:38 like Amgen to patent strands of our DNA
48:41 you can't patent what's in nature I
48:44 can't patent tree but they're allowing
48:46 pharmaceutical companies to do this and
48:48 it's absolutely insane it's it should be
48:51 uh nalaut right you can't own me you
48:53 can't own what makes me but if you had
48:56 that program think about it you take all
48:59 the protein patterns of this hominid
49:01 just a sample of the tissue push it
49:04 through this computer and the computer
49:06 could simply generate the program to
49:09 convert that hominid into us just by
49:14 sheer redesign of the pattern
49:17 we could also leave alone patterns that
49:19 are key to surviving off of the
49:24 dizziness planet so we're like okay we
49:27 don't want you to not breathe oxygen we
49:28 don't want you to you know need a
49:31 different temperature or something but
49:34 they could strengthen the skin
49:36 strengthen the bones we engineer the
49:38 bones and just basically okay well we're
49:41 not gonna you know a more efficient body
49:44 for an intelligent creature because we
49:46 are intelligent we don't need the
49:48 gigantic arms of a gorilla but the
49:51 gorilla doesn't have our brain so it has
49:53 to use sheer force to survive so that's
49:56 what it does so I think that for these
50:00 objectives that seemed infinitely
50:02 impossible it will be a simple algorithm
50:05 that is showing amazing promise amazing
50:09 accuracy when in you know compared to
50:12 with the real world that will start to
50:15 facilitate these objectives like
50:17 kurtzweil has now Kurt's Wells problem
50:20 is that there's most likely a soul and
50:23 so when you pull a brain into a computer
50:26 and remember you don't have to kill the
50:29 human being you just make a copy of it
50:31 into the computer it's going to have to
50:33 rely on an artificial intelligence
50:36 engine to maintain its thought because
50:40 the soul is gone it's still in the human
50:42 being so you might be able to I mean
50:45 imagine there's all these services that
50:49 you can turn your ashes into diamonds
50:53 you can turn them into a record you know
50:55 all kinds of stuff right these are weird
50:58 little businesses but you know it's not
51:00 your relative it is a relative
51:02 physically but it's not going to talk
51:04 back to you but imagine you get to a
51:06 point where you can keep a facsimile of
51:08 your relative I mean whoa you know
51:13 you're like oh my gosh I wish I could
51:14 know what my grandfather would say or my
51:17 grandmother was here my father my mother
51:18 and you have this AI that's doing it you
51:22 know same tone of voice all that stuff I
51:24 mean wow
51:25 right so a lot of people speculate that
51:27 perhaps the Egyptians
51:30 were where these individuals started and
51:35 that the theory about the and it was
51:38 funny because I did my evolution part
51:40 too and I had up several of you come in
51:42 and state something that I should have
51:45 stated which was that the theory about
51:47 the single female in northern Africa
51:52 being responsible for the sudden surge
51:56 in homo sapiens sapiens has been
51:59 debunked big-time okay that's so that's
52:03 something that is currently the thinking
52:04 right now but if you have I mean that
52:08 the thing about the Egyptians it's just
52:10 wild so there's pros and there's cons
52:12 against giving credit to the Egyptians
52:14 for the sort of gene-splicing thing
52:18 obviously they were capable of rendering
52:21 anything in stone and rendering anything
52:23 in painting so when you see the ancient
52:27 Egyptian pharaohs you know Brown like no
52:31 you know black people that's probably
52:34 what they look like which means they
52:35 weren't Arab they they probably bred
52:39 with other races and eventually lighten
52:41 their skin such that maybe the last few
52:43 pharaohs were more of a lighter skin
52:45 variation you know the ptolemies which
52:47 were completely Roman Cleopatra being a
52:49 Roman girl they're all Romans they're
52:52 white people running Egypt so that Rome
52:56 wouldn't roll over the place because the
52:57 Ptolemies honored the unbelievable
53:01 accomplishments of the Egyptians it's
53:05 really cool you know the rosetta stone
53:06 is about the ptolemies it's about the
53:09 ptolemy the forth talking about the
53:12 death of his father and how there's
53:13 going to be revenge and always remember
53:15 about the rosetta stone there should be
53:17 dozens and dozens of Rosetta stones down
53:19 the Nile because the Rosetta Stone says
53:21 that it is a message that's being posted
53:25 at an at a at a port down the Nile since
53:28 that when you trade up the Nile you
53:30 heard about the news so it should be a
53:33 lot of them I don't know why we haven't
53:34 found another one it's just weird how I
53:37 gotta get rid of a big black rock you
53:39 know written in three different
53:40 languages you know I don't know that
53:43 there's
53:43 I've only heard it once but I know
53:46 there's a few folks that think that the
53:47 pyramids were built in the 1800s which
53:49 blows the mind okay okay it's 2019 how
53:53 do they do it because we can't do it
53:54 today right but one of the things you
53:57 can do with Egyptians is look at their
53:59 their understanding of the Stars is
54:01 ridiculous the pyramids in the Giza
54:04 Plateau are amazingly aligned with the
54:07 equator with due north I mean it's like
54:10 this wild compass to the world but if
54:14 you look at their burial rituals and
54:18 it's always good to remember what they
54:20 write in stone what any society writes
54:22 down is what they believe to be one of
54:24 the most important things to write down
54:26 and so they had burial rituals which
54:30 believed you know that there was an
54:33 imperative that you keep your body
54:35 intact for as long as possible
54:38 because you're gonna go you know Pharaoh
54:40 would go hunting in the afterlife and so
54:43 there's a lot of you know that all the
54:45 tombs and the valley of the kings have
54:47 all this decorative painting and all
54:49 their stuff as you know dropped in rooms
54:51 with them King Tut's you know multiple
54:55 chamber tomb has everything an
55:00 eighteen-year-old kid would need in the
55:01 in the afterlife which he's a grown
55:03 adult in their mind at that time you
55:06 know was a it was actually the case in
55:08 America up till about in 1990 so think
55:12 about it if you were some interstellar
55:14 race why would you believe in such
55:17 things as keeping your body preserved
55:19 why would you think that you're going to
55:21 stay on earth and hunt it's sort of a
55:24 romantic albeit primitive way of looking
55:29 at the afterlife at least we think you
55:33 know it's interesting how you know
55:36 there's something I don't talk about
55:38 because there's no real place to put it
55:40 but you know we have human beings that
55:42 like being cremated and human beings
55:44 that like being put in caskets keep
55:46 their body there and it's it's
55:50 interesting because I vacillated with
55:51 that myself most my family's is evolving
55:54 to cremation
55:56 for whatever reason I personally like
56:00 visiting a grave and it's some people
56:03 think that's really morbid but you know
56:05 it's a peaceful wonderful thing for me
56:07 personally to go to my grandparents
56:09 graves and it's just this beautiful
56:11 field in Kansas I mean I'm in like a
56:14 little slice of heaven in there on a
56:16 summer day and just having a
56:18 conversation just knowing they're right
56:20 there that body that they used to use is
56:22 right there I don't like their souls
56:23 down there I don't believe anything the
56:24 Bible says about holding your soul down
56:27 into your body and then you get you know
56:29 resurrected on Judgment Day which was
56:32 always really kind of weird for me and
56:34 disturbing to think about I mean really
56:36 they're down there going
56:37 the old saying that people roll around
56:39 their grave when their their
56:41 contributions to the world are undone
56:43 mm-hmm but now so logistically speaking
56:48 they let's say they get the the Homo
56:50 Sapien worked out it's time to deploy
56:53 well there's one theory that they would
56:56 have it so locked down because they have
56:58 interstellar travel or even
57:00 interdimensional travel that there
57:02 wouldn't really be a need for testing
57:03 things
57:04 it's like Tesla you just think about it
57:06 think about the machine for two years
57:08 aged the ball bearings in your mind
57:10 which is what he did and everything he
57:12 built worked the first day and he's just
57:14 known for that he's this is crazy
57:16 brilliant human being right which you
57:19 know I think there's a lot of just a
57:20 break for one second on that you know
57:23 Tessa lived to be 85 years old which is
57:26 a good life for anyone in his timetable
57:28 because he he was in the more rustic
57:31 version of America at the time rate
57:32 limited medicine and all that stuff they
57:36 really accentuate the fact that he died
57:38 penniless like he's somehow a failure I
57:41 don't think he died penniless you know I
57:44 think that if that dude ever needed
57:46 money he just go get it I think he died
57:49 with what a man needs at 85 I think
57:51 that's really work when it comes down to
57:53 you know again I'm reading a book right
57:56 now by him that he wrote in 1919 I need
58:00 to get back to it because I got really
58:01 into it then I got sidetracked so I
58:04 maybe don't believe that so much you
58:07 know I think that's part of the bankers
58:08 epitaph
58:09 on him to say what a failure that guy
58:11 was or look how we dominated him and
58:13 let's not give him that win I don't
58:15 believe that's true again a guy it's
58:18 interesting because a lot of people at
58:20 85 they don't have like an amazing
58:24 contribution contribution 'value to
58:27 society because all the things that they
58:29 used to get their life you know to move
58:32 forward decade to decade is but
58:34 deprecated right but that dude died with
58:38 more knowledge in his brain that anyone
58:40 on planet Earth I mean that's not even
58:42 an exaggeration he he was one of the
58:45 first founders of wireless technology we
58:48 barely had it in use when he died right
58:50 and now we live off of it you know what
58:52 is it seven years later so the dude he
58:55 could have gotten money if he wanted it
58:56 I don't think he died penniless but they
58:59 also show you his body you know his last
59:01 photographs of him being really old and
59:03 there's see look how look how old and
59:05 pathetic he looked it's like dude it's
59:06 just being old
59:07 relax see how just see how good you look
59:09 at 85 right but so they deploy human
59:13 beings on earth but a lot of indigenous
59:17 problems because again an infant child
59:20 is very very vulnerable I mean how long
59:23 does it take before you personally with
59:26 your child would just let them roam
59:28 around the the forest by themselves
59:31 I'd say 16 to 18 and they probably know
59:34 how to shoot a gun and they'd have one
59:35 you know it's not going to be because
59:37 I'm just getting alive by whatever's out
59:39 there you get a whole pack of Wolf's
59:42 they just tear you apart to get one bear
59:44 you're dead you know I mean it's just a
59:46 wild boar pokey and kill you right so
59:49 it's not it's they like we need
59:51 assistance kind of getting going but now
59:54 let's say that this event actually
59:56 occurs and they actually did land a
59:59 bunch of ships here like a Star Trek
60:02 episode they do whatever it takes maybe
60:04 they were here a hundred years maybe
60:06 they're here a thousand years maybe
60:07 they're here ten thousand years who
60:09 knows right I don't think they'd have to
60:11 stay that long but at some point if man
60:14 was doing this we wouldn't leave behind
60:16 all of our tech to confuse them we would
60:20 probably
60:22 teach them how to build teach them some
60:26 mathematics a building whether it be
60:28 something in spoken language or
60:30 something in just know how right there's
60:34 people that understood pie before they
60:36 understood that there was a number
60:39 that's infinite you know 3.14 or blah
60:42 blah blah a lot right and so you know
60:45 the pyramids are based on PI all the
60:49 sculptures they did of their faces are
60:50 all super PI based so there was massive
60:54 knowledge about mathematics without me
60:56 be totally discerning in language maybe
61:00 they did maybe they didn't I've studied
61:03 you know thousands of hieroglyphs and I
61:06 don't see anything talking about
61:08 mathematic education and isn't that
61:11 fascinating why is there a debate about
61:14 how the pyramids were built because
61:16 there's no schematics of how they were
61:17 built really I mean how many things do
61:22 we build in this world we have no
61:23 schematics leftover like done and we
61:26 didn't write things in stone they wrote
61:28 everything in stone okay why wouldn't
61:32 someone lay it out somewhere like in
61:35 some secret temple somewhere where it's
61:37 like okay you're not allowed in here
61:39 unless you're one of the engineers of
61:41 pyramids because we don't want our
61:42 enemies to know how we build these
61:43 things but eventually they boil off
61:47 through invasion or whatever and it's
61:50 still there and someone can read it we
61:52 don't finding that stuff now a bunch of
61:54 you know that there's a ton of stuff
61:55 that's still being hid in Egypt the
61:58 percentage of things hidden in Egypt is
62:00 widely speculated but it's probably safe
62:03 to say that without exaggeration the
62:07 lowest number I could imagine would
62:09 probably be about 70% of everything is
62:11 still under sand but there are some
62:15 folks in Egypt that say that are
62:18 Egyptian and say look 90% of stuff is
62:20 all understand you're not allowed to go
62:22 because it's going to reveal where we
62:23 truly came from who was really in charge
62:25 and I really think it's just a race
62:27 battle in my opinion they just can't
62:30 give it up to anyone other than the
62:33 Arabs at this point because they own the
62:34 land now and they
62:35 they've lived there now for thousands of
62:37 thousands of years and so you know they
62:40 take all credit for all things down
62:41 there so I think logistically speaking
62:44 we ourselves would set up our new
62:46 species with enough knowledge to survive
62:50 to build a shelter to hunt and to
62:55 probably hunt something that is optimal
62:58 for us right so the you know I don't
63:00 know how they came up with this the
63:04 anthropologists but you know I grew up
63:06 believing that they absolutely knew that
63:10 homeless Abyan sapien hunted mammoths
63:13 elephants and so of course you know
63:16 think about these things you know you
63:18 know I don't have any problem believing
63:19 that mammoths exist it's just a larger
63:21 species of an of an elephant but that's
63:24 a lot of meat right so you kill one of
63:26 these things and you know they're super
63:28 powerful but you know with like 50 guys
63:31 with Spears you could poke that thing to
63:33 death so it bleeds out and harvest it
63:36 and then you could feed a ton of people
63:38 so you know I don't know what was
63:40 indigenous to Egypt at the time I'm not
63:42 sure anyone really does because it was
63:44 definitely more lush at one point
63:46 there's a lot of evidence that the Nile
63:48 itself has been it's naturally moved
63:51 several miles I think to the east it
63:56 could be a natural thing could have been
63:57 man-made irrigation mechanisms who knows
64:00 so I'm not sure we really understand
64:03 what was that we can speculate you know
64:05 but the deserts an unforgiving entity
64:08 and you're not gonna find like we might
64:12 find bones buried in one place in the
64:14 world because the soil is of the nature
64:16 to fossilize something or to preserve it
64:18 you know like we've had some amazing
64:21 finds in Asia with the was it that baby
64:25 woolly mammoth you know amazing so we're
64:30 gonna set these guys up and the
64:34 information that we give them would be
64:36 very tempered wouldn't it be restricted
64:39 we don't want to give them you know warp
64:42 capability on the first day we don't
64:44 want to give them anything that they
64:46 can't have access to immediately after
64:49 whatever we give them has expired right
64:52 so you wouldn't train them for instance
64:54 like I'll give you a stupid example we
64:57 wouldn't feed these individuals Pizza
65:00 because they don't know how to make it
65:01 so here they are thinking that Pizza is
65:04 the only food that they can possibly eat
65:05 and now they can't make it cuz they
65:07 don't not a grind up wheat and and put
65:09 all this you know get milk out of or
65:11 cheese out of milk and all this other
65:12 stuff but maybe we do teach them some
65:15 very basic things to get them and just
65:19 study the resources on the planet okay
65:21 well we got this and it's probably all
65:22 part of the evaluation process if this
65:24 were to ever occur and maybe we even
65:27 bring seeds and we say okay well we're
65:31 gonna drop this seed all over the planet
65:34 so that it grows and all the continents
65:36 so that when they finally reach these
65:38 places there's apples and berries and
65:40 nuts and whatever they need and because
65:43 we've given them innate capabilities to
65:46 hunt kill you know cut it up turn it
65:51 into beef jerky or whatever it is we
65:54 know that wherever they are they're
65:55 gonna be able to survive but I think
65:58 that there's enough sort of non alien
66:02 primitive beliefs that I fully respect
66:06 but you know preserving your body in
66:09 order to live in the afterlife I'm not
66:12 convinced okay I mean everyone who's
66:14 cremated doesn't have an afterlife and I
66:16 believe that for a second but they're
66:19 gonna have to pick up all their stuff
66:20 and get out of here and so you know
66:26 what's interesting is they have the the
66:29 plateaus that are in you know in Cairo /
66:33 near the Giza Plateau and imagine that
66:37 plateau is if geez as far as we know the
66:41 plateau and the pyramids themselves were
66:43 the power supply for the aliens
66:47 themselves you know I mean you know is I
66:49 got let's just put this together we got
66:50 spaceships and stuff we'll just cut
66:52 these rocks out put them out there now
66:53 there's really no evidence of such a
66:56 thing but they kept speculating that the
66:59 runways or they started the plateaus in
67:01 Egypt were runway
67:03 for you know like by playing aliens or
67:06 whatever right they need to really have
67:07 a big runway but maybe it's literally
67:10 the place where they set everything down
67:11 to do all their work and because it's
67:13 stone it lasts forever so imagine that
67:16 the theory is actually correct but the
67:18 interpretation about would be used is
67:19 all incorrect there are actually just
67:21 landing pads you know I have to say the
67:25 some of you will immediately thought of
67:27 Stargate when I said that stuff I
67:29 thought that the idea that the pyramids
67:32 were kickstands essentially landing pads
67:36 for a spaceship with some sort of you
67:40 know pyramid underbelly is very
67:42 fascinating because what would be what
67:47 would be the point of that right because
67:48 a pyramid is actually an extremely bad
67:51 use of space when you talk about living
67:53 in it so it's obviously doesn't have any
67:55 rooms in it besides the few chambers
67:57 that are in there it's not really meant
67:58 to have a lot of folks in there right
68:00 but a pyramid shape is actually very
68:02 interesting in terms of distributing
68:04 stress on the ground and so if you were
68:08 to you know land a spaceship on top of a
68:10 pyramid which I thought was probably one
68:12 of the most clever things in the entire
68:13 script - the actual Stargate
68:16 reconstruction in use you know you maybe
68:19 land some gigantic I don't know a few
68:23 million ton vehicle on that thing and
68:25 it's just you know you just put one down
68:29 you know I think that it would be
68:31 they're built so close together that
68:33 landing several of them would make no
68:35 sense because the upper part would
68:36 probably back into one of the other ones
68:37 right it's a romantic theory I think
68:40 it's kind of fun and remember the anyone
68:44 who tells you that they know what
68:45 pharaoh built the pyramids is full of
68:48 [ __ ] okay you just got to know that they
68:51 have the two things that i read about
68:55 was that you have handwritten painting
69:01 in way inside the thing that says that
69:04 this pharaoh built this then you have a
69:05 keystone there's a cornerstone basically
69:08 that is pulled out and it supposedly had
69:10 you know carved in the top who built
69:13 this particular pyramid but because they
69:16 have a legacy
69:17 of one Pharaoh gets rid of the other
69:19 Pharaoh stuff you could shave the top of
69:22 that thing off put the other guy's name
69:24 and push it back in and just keep that
69:25 process going you know and they're
69:27 pretty good stone and so maybe you put a
69:29 brand new stone in there you pull the
69:31 other one out toss it and then you
69:32 destroy it and then you put the new one
69:33 in yeah whatever
69:36 so then they've deployed it they've
69:39 deployed the Homo Sapien sapien we start
69:43 to flourish they're probably going to
69:47 watch it for several decades if not a
69:51 few centuries to make sure it takes off
69:54 now maybe if we just because there's a
69:59 few threats that could still mess with
70:01 humanity one predators modify their
70:05 attack to overcome whatever lessons were
70:08 taught to the homo sapiens sapiens so
70:09 you need to reprogram to be more tough
70:11 it could be that we procreate way too
70:14 quickly and you have like the several
70:18 theories we have for various races
70:20 around the world that ate all their food
70:22 and then died out you know there's a
70:25 bunch of theories about the original
70:27 Incas doing that exact thing II don't
70:31 know but they get us going there imbuing
70:35 us with information us being you know
70:38 the humans and you know again there's
70:40 according to Graham Hancock and a
70:42 photograph that he shared with Joe Rogan
70:44 which ran on an episode during one of
70:46 the interviews that I saw and which
70:48 weird is what I'm about to say I've said
70:50 it several times but I have to clarify
70:51 in all my studying of hieroglyphs which
70:55 is basically ancient Arabic with no
70:57 vowels there I didn't see these two
71:00 symbols ever referenced in any of my
71:02 materials and these books were from
71:06 about 1910 to 1951 it was very in vogue
71:12 to do Egyptian research but the symbol
71:16 for a year was a circle that was full
71:22 which means the Sun and the circle and
71:26 the symbol for month was a circle that
71:27 was empty on the inside really
71:29 referencing earth
71:31 because you could look at earth and you
71:33 can't look at the sign cuz it's too
71:34 bright right so it seemed like according
71:36 to graham hancock who to this day i
71:40 still respect him very very much it
71:43 looks like they had full knowledge of
71:45 the stars and the planet but then how
71:48 could they how could they know that well
71:53 it could be that they had a Copernicus
71:54 and Galileo dude eventually born in
71:56 there you know evolutionary track and
72:00 some would just utterly figured it out
72:01 and said I think this is the way it
72:02 works well we need a symbol for one of
72:04 these two so for each one of these you
72:06 know durations so let's just whatever
72:08 let's just take your theory that works
72:09 good or because we were dropped off
72:14 because we were engineered and then
72:17 dropped off our creators if you will
72:22 told us that that's the way it was but
72:25 then other theories that theory starts
72:28 to boil off as that indigenous race with
72:30 all that knowledge gets spread out and
72:33 you know killed and you know and so we
72:35 lose it and then we come up with flat
72:37 earth could be like in again according
72:42 to David Icke yeah I can't believe I'm
72:46 about to say this he said that the word
72:49 Zulu means people from space that's what
72:52 they believe the translation means all
72:56 right that's fascinating
72:57 any of you've seen the the Mayan artwork
73:01 it is you know again like I've told you
73:04 I think hieroglyphs are some of the most
73:07 beautiful symbols that man has ever
73:10 created and especially the way that they
73:12 wrote to for beauty and not for phonetic
73:14 organization of the words again if
73:17 you've missed all my other episodes what
73:21 the Egyptians did was they would take
73:22 your name let's say your name was
73:25 Benjamin nice big long big long name
73:29 lots of letters they would organize your
73:33 consonants in a way that looked most
73:36 beautiful and usually a little square
73:39 you know they'd stack it up in little
73:41 squares and so you would have in
73:44 one particular use of your name or
73:47 usually names her in cartoons but you
73:50 know whatever we're talking about a
73:51 watermelon right in one realm they might
73:54 write watermelon in one configuration
73:57 because it's most beautiful wouldn't say
73:59 reading from right to left as they did
74:02 but you could also they also wrote them
74:04 left to right it didn't matter whichever
74:06 way that the symbol and a hieroglyph is
74:08 facing is the way you read into it which
74:11 is cool but they did door jambs all the
74:14 time and that's where you get some of
74:15 the most beautiful configurations of
74:17 some of their symbols and again I'll
74:19 remind you there's the little trick
74:21 you've seen out there will be a
74:22 paragraph and some meme out there where
74:25 all of the words in a paragraph have
74:29 been all the letters in Words have been
74:30 scrambled except the first and the last
74:32 letters are correct and your brain can
74:36 totally read it just like a fluent book
74:38 and that's because I think at the very
74:41 beginning of our phonetic development
74:44 when we moved out of iconic languages
74:46 where every symbol was a word when we
74:49 started doing phonetic language which
74:50 was the Egyptians that's the way we did
74:54 it for thousands and thousands of years
74:56 so we still had that programming in our
74:58 mind to decipher instantaneously it's
75:02 very fascinating and no one ever talks
75:03 about it it's so bizarre how you got
75:06 producers at you know sci-fi channel
75:09 Discovery Channel trying to come up with
75:10 a new hook for something and they really
75:12 just need to watch deep thoughts and
75:14 then right now in terms of there's one
75:19 there's a couple more questions
75:20 obviously there's a million other
75:21 questions but there's a few more that
75:22 I'm gonna address here and one of them
75:25 is the fascination that we have a few
75:28 things that happen we have people of all
75:35 different races on earth extremely
75:39 distinctly different colors that we have
75:43 in our skin pigment and again like I
75:45 said before we do have noses that are
75:46 different ears that are different some
75:50 races are are built to be very skinny
75:52 and other races are built to be really
75:54 big like your Samoan races are usually
75:56 you know bigger people
75:58 and every single place we've ever gone
76:02 on earth including Easter Island of all
76:04 things in Hawaii someone has their been
76:07 able to migrate there or there's this
76:08 indigenous race there
76:10 it's been there for seemingly forever
76:14 now the evolutionary way to explain that
76:18 would be man-like it would be Magellan
76:21 was the only he was like the last famous
76:25 white guy to do it
76:26 right but it looks like everybody was
76:28 the Magellan if you believe in evolution
76:31 everyone just got on a boat and just
76:33 went one island to the next to the next
76:34 if they could see land they go in that
76:36 direction after a while they started
76:37 trusting themselves building bigger
76:39 boats they could go deep sea or at least
76:42 you know deep ocean surface penetration
76:45 you know the theory of or the story of
76:48 Comerica may have finding well he ought
76:51 only he was the guy that actually
76:52 founded but it's it's the the whole
76:55 story that makes hawaii possible mana
76:58 why is out in the middle of nowhere not
77:00 I mean nowhere and they not only
77:03 discovered that Island a band of islands
77:05 but they were able to balance their
77:07 consumption of food at the islands such
77:12 they didn't go extinct amazing how do
77:16 you even send a message back right
77:17 you're gonna get back in that boat hell
77:19 no man once you get to this island and
77:21 middle of nowhere you're in paradise
77:23 you know you invent gin or no sorry rum
77:27 so you've hit rum and make a bunch of
77:29 cool drinks you've hit the ukulele and
77:31 the man you're setting get a little
77:33 grass skirt and you're good
77:34 Eastern are Easter islands we had until
77:37 nowhere
77:37 not only did they discover the place but
77:40 they built all these wild statues that
77:42 they face it's very specific directions
77:43 we've recently found out all these
77:45 statues actually have legs we kept
77:47 thinking they were just heads trying to
77:50 still trying to figure out how they made
77:51 them how they because they look a little
77:52 primitive so we're able to stomach the
77:55 idea that chisel and rock would have
77:58 made them rock against rock or whatever
78:00 it's still phenomenal you know a look at
78:04 the Asian race and it's a phenomenal
78:06 difference in you know Japanese and
78:10 Chinese and Vietnamese
78:12 Kurian it's a very distinct amazing
78:15 different look I mean isn't this great
78:17 that we have all these different human
78:19 beings this idea that we're all supposed
78:21 to be this gray centralized one human
78:25 race it's just it makes me gag it's like
78:28 no man I like differences I like meeting
78:30 people from different parts of the world
78:31 Indians and Russians and you know
78:33 everybody Africans everybody herbs it
78:36 makes the world fun or a pattern
78:39 ingesting being if we were to do the
78:43 globalists plans for the world and we
78:46 lose all of our nation
78:47 you know borders and stuff and so it's
78:49 you know borders are you know walls are
78:51 unfortunate great but saying well you're
78:54 in Germany now hey
78:56 have yourself a knockwurst and a beer
78:59 and then you go to Mexico no here's the
79:02 taco and here's this you know amazing
79:04 corn and stuff and you want to lose all
79:06 that I think it would suck you know so
79:10 but it looks like maybe as part of a
79:14 more logical theory that after creating
79:17 us they dropped us everywhere or we
79:21 could survive maybe even not through
79:26 evolution because black people will have
79:28 albino babies and they have blue eyes
79:31 and I guess every black kid has blue
79:33 eyes for a certain period of time and
79:37 then they change colors but you know
79:40 there's theories that white people
79:41 popped out of black folks okay
79:44 black people or black people can have
79:46 babies if black people have babies
79:49 forever they eventually pop out albino
79:50 white people have babies forever they
79:52 never pop out a black person so there's
79:54 there's little bit of a theory there
79:55 some racists have a huge problem with
79:58 that but get over it but you have
80:00 Aborigines you know we do have the
80:03 Native Americans which are I think
80:05 distinctly different than your sort of
80:07 South American Latin races and even in
80:10 South America the Peruvians look
80:12 completely different than the Brazilians
80:13 you know it's it's there's a lot of
80:16 mix-up you can see or where people
80:19 having sex probably turned out you know
80:23 hybrid race you know I was always told
80:25 that the
80:26 that the native Mexican race is a bunch
80:30 of Spanish conquistadors coming over and
80:32 breeding with everybody was here and
80:33 that's where the Mexican race came from
80:37 that's what I've been told it's
80:39 believable whatever they both speak
80:42 Spanish right so for me it's not a
80:47 stretch it's not a stretch at all
80:49 anytime someone has a problem with
80:52 something that man would do I think I
80:55 laugh inside it's like really we would
80:57 do that in a split second you know maybe
81:00 we would have some sort of prime
81:02 directive like Star Trek has or if you
81:04 do find a fully functional intelligent
81:07 race then we don't touch it we observe
81:10 but after they drop us off wouldn't they
81:16 come back to check to see how the
81:19 experiments going I could understand a
81:22 theory where they wouldn't do that
81:23 because they're just too busy they're
81:25 out there gone well there's a limited
81:26 amount of us especially the special you
81:29 know crack team that can do this but
81:32 maybe you know the crack team goes off
81:34 and keeps putting the DNA all around the
81:36 universe whereas this other
81:38 anthropological team from the other
81:40 group comes in and watches and that's
81:43 where you get UFO sightings
81:44 you know UFOs definitely fall in at
81:48 least two categories if you want to put
81:49 them in that you have ships that are so
81:52 large that you could you could
81:53 understand that there would be a bunch
81:56 of people in them a bunch of beings in
81:58 them and then ships that are so
82:00 teeny-tiny or like well maybe but they'd
82:04 be really tiny people you know that's
82:07 why I think it's funny when they try to
82:08 you know zoom in on a UFO and you see
82:11 like a gray alien inside means there was
82:13 one that was recently done it was so
82:16 pathetic it was so pathetic these hoaxes
82:18 they were trying to push off and
82:20 everybody but again the game
82:22 spores created by will rights for EA
82:26 formerly Maxis he did that exact thing
82:31 in his video game you handled a
82:33 single-cell creature all the way up to
82:35 being a sentient you know bipedal you
82:39 could make it any way
82:40 of like six or seven legs if you want
82:42 but it was like a humanoid level
82:44 intelligent being and again for
82:46 evolution we should have all kinds of
82:48 speaking beings like a you know human
82:51 DNA should have gone in all different
82:52 directions this ape thing should have
82:54 gone in all different directions where
82:55 maybe you have a guy with four arms you
82:57 know there should be a race like that
82:59 you know if you think if you had two
83:01 extra arms would you wouldn't you
83:02 dominate the whole planet you just have
83:05 four six-shooters you know instead of
83:07 two we don't see any that but what he
83:10 did in the game was that you would see
83:12 UFOs every once in a while observing
83:14 your world and the what really was going
83:18 on as those UFOs were administrators at
83:20 EA looking at your world trying to see
83:23 if he came up with something cool that
83:25 they would then take a picture of and
83:26 then feature you in some website for the
83:29 game I thought that was brilliant it was
83:32 like I had you know I think we all have
83:35 that thought of like UFOs could be them
83:37 observing us of course what else could
83:39 you think they don't land they don't
83:41 come out and say hi but to repeat that
83:43 so beautifully in the video game I
83:45 thought was a stroke of absolute genius
83:47 so let me know what you think about this
83:50 whole thing if you haven't done the deep
83:53 dive in this definitely look up you know
83:56 anthropologists I think you'll have more
83:57 fun probably on the first run looking up
84:00 the ones that talk about the missing
84:02 link as it relates to Bigfoot you know I
84:04 in my opinion I disintegrated Bigfoot I
84:06 think it's episode mm mm oh my god 201
84:11 or open with Bigfoot for season two just
84:16 go see that I won't repeating of that
84:18 here but definitely let me know what
84:19 you've run into and I would be really
84:21 really interested I don't think I have
84:23 any anthropologists watching but if you
84:25 know one it'd be interesting to have a
84:28 sit-down conversation with someone that
84:30 actually has seen this stuff forever and
84:32 you have to brace yourself because
84:34 they'll be extremely indoctrinated you
84:37 know by whatever they're told and you
84:39 know that what's funny is of course is
84:40 that everything that we're told it tends
84:45 to tends to shift you know in one theory
84:48 one year and then another thirty you
84:50 know ten years later
84:51 unfortunately since science
84:53 is now officially a religion we we have
84:58 been so stagnant in our and our
85:03 development in science it's really bad
85:05 and it's only really the folks that are
85:10 making YouTube channels and really
85:11 spreading information because they can't
85:13 find like-minded people in their
85:16 universities because it's not even
85:17 allowed to talk against the the doctrine
85:19 against the dogma and so we have to rely
85:23 on each other to kind of spread this
85:24 information I just saw that meme again
85:26 was not really mean but it's a it's a
85:28 picture I think it's even related to an
85:31 article that I see it I used to see it a
85:33 lot a couple years ago and it was it's
85:36 this article that basically says that
85:39 the that they want to I think quite
85:44 literally is the insinuation in this
85:46 article genocide every single human
85:49 being on earth that doesn't believe the
85:52 current theories about everything so for
85:57 instance if you've come to the
85:58 conclusion that the Big Bang is a bunch
85:59 of [ __ ] Dark Matters [ __ ]
86:02 black holes are [ __ ] all that stuff
86:04 it's just not true
86:05 then you buy these idiots that don't
86:08 know anything about what they're talking
86:09 about these are just citizens that want
86:11 to promote an article to say I'm
86:14 promoting this article to kill everybody
86:16 on earth that doesn't believe what I
86:17 don't even understand and that'll make
86:20 me smart you know it's like the guy who
86:21 can't read buys a bunch of books never
86:24 reads them you know hopefully the guy
86:27 will start reading at some point but I
86:29 think that's obviously massively
86:32 dangerous it is it is going to put us in
86:35 a stunted growth pattern and it's
86:37 obviously a piece of propaganda that
86:40 could relate to agenda 21 who knows but
86:43 they want to say essentially say man in
86:46 2019 has figured out everything despite
86:50 when you drill into these theories
86:51 there's big question marks all over the
86:54 place a bunch of you know frog DNA put
86:57 inside the dinosaur DNA it doesn't work
86:59 and I think that we have to fight back I
87:04 think what to fight back and I posted my
87:06 friends post
87:07 and I can't remember even posted it you
87:10 know I said I'm ready for the public
87:11 debate you just let me know where
87:13 everybody shows up and I will eat them
87:15 alive in front everybody but I get to
87:16 bring my computer and bring my slideshow
87:18 to prove that lies are everywhere right
87:22 and those a lot of flat-earthers would
87:24 love that debate now there's a romantic
87:27 side of this argument which is if we are
87:31 descendants of some supreme you know
87:34 Prometheus race then we have within us
87:39 potential Brillon of brilliance that we
87:42 don't use on a daily basis until we keep
87:45 cracking our brain and cracking our
87:47 brain dope and hopefully deep thoughts
87:48 helps stimulate those dormant genes and
87:50 your in your mind
87:52 and again the anthropologist that broke
87:54 down the visual cortex so there's five
87:56 slices of your visual cortex but there's
87:58 protein blockers in there to limit us to
88:03 use one half of one slice meaning we
88:05 don't use but there's a 10% of our
88:10 visual cortex well it's going to happen
88:13 if we see the other 90% of the visual
88:14 spectrum do we start seeing them do we
88:18 start seeing the UFOs everywhere
88:19 did we see them walk it around us who
88:23 knows how the hell did that get there
88:24 why would evolution ever create that it
88:28 was a tuning fork for the eyeballs
88:30 you know we should have well considering
88:34 that human that humanity in general the
88:36 homeless Libyan sapien is driven by
88:38 curiosity we just think when we what we
88:43 think fuels Flat Earth
88:44 that's a speculation that it could be
88:46 true and then what does that mean you
88:49 know anyone is a you a follow gist
88:51 there's a curiosity there because most
88:54 of us have never met one we've never
88:55 seen one land so look we've got other
88:59 people's evidence to tell us that these
89:01 things really occur alright so I think
89:05 that genetically speaking our
89:07 predisposition would be to be
89:08 enlightened to the absolute maximum apex
89:12 of our brain and the visual cortex would
89:14 be probably one of the most powerful
89:17 senses that we could develop so that we
89:21 could see more I think that's all I got
89:23 on that let me know what you think if
89:26 you have been to deep thoughts radio.com
89:27 please go make it a short bumper today
89:29 there's plenty of links for video get
89:31 yourself a [ __ ] to calm account because
89:34 YouTube might start pulling some
89:35 shenanigans on December 10th there's
89:38 plenty of podcast links for you there's
89:40 plenty of social media for you there's
89:42 plenty of ways to donate to the show and
89:43 understand this season one is no longer
89:45 on this channel so there's a link up
89:48 there for the all-new remastered season
89:50 1 please subscribe and just when you get
89:52 through all 100 and whatever episodes I
89:54 did on that channel just you can
89:55 unsubscribe walk off it's not monetized
89:58 because they changed all the
90:00 requirements for monetizing a channel to
90:02 be some damn near impossible feat to
90:04 accomplish with that some viral punch to
90:06 one of your videos so my stuff is not
90:08 gonna pop over there anytime soon anyway
