00:00 [Music]
00:31 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:34 deep thoughts today man
00:36 couple privileges going on today one
00:39 it's warm and it's daytime so you guys
00:42 don't have to sit and watch a nighttime
00:43 episode and then I get to use this
00:47 beautiful metal punch that one of our
00:50 listeners sent over so - Sylvia thank
00:54 you so much this thing is like a dream
00:57 there's one of these punches that a
00:59 person will have their entire life
01:01 because it's made out of steel self
01:04 cleans this is better than the other one
01:05 I borrow from a buddy of mine I thought
01:09 today there was a bit of a conversation
01:11 on the Facebook page about Planet X and
01:13 I did a tremendous amount of research in
01:17 that conspiracy theory as it exists that
01:21 I believe in 2011 and 2012 and I even
01:29 had a father son called me at one point
01:32 very concerned that this was real and it
01:38 was kind of cool you know the dad was
01:39 trying to support his son in a
01:41 particular theory and so he's like well
01:44 let's call my buddy mark and we'll have
01:45 a conversation I had to do some fresh up
01:48 on it and so I went to Wikipedia and the
01:51 funny thing was the theory had
01:56 completely dissolved away from all of
01:59 the animations and very specific
02:02 theories that I was reading about you
02:05 know eight years ago whatever it was so
02:10 let me recap what I last knew about the
02:14 Planet X theory and then we'll talk
02:16 about kind of where it is today because
02:20 it seems to be dismantled today which is
02:22 really interesting so you have this
02:27 woman in 1995 says that she's channeling
02:32 people from Nibiru through an implant in
02:35 her brain which begs the question how
02:38 would you get an implant in your brain
02:39 this compatib
02:40 with Anna biro people if they're in
02:43 orbit around our solar system in a mini
02:47 solar system and they're so far away
02:48 they can't get to us so who gave you the
02:51 implant did they take a little George
02:53 Jetson UFO to her house and go okay
02:55 we're gonna put this in your brain of
02:57 all people not a totally credible human
02:59 being in the world everybody knows but
03:01 this total random strangers gonna be
03:03 super special right
03:05 in fact channeling has always been the
03:07 way that this story has come about and
03:08 the same thing with lumeria Atlantis in
03:11 typical form although Atlantis has some
03:15 romanticized texts you know lamenting to
03:19 its existence but anyway the way I heard
03:22 the theory explained and this is how it
03:24 came to me when there was caution and
03:27 concern in my friends voices which was
03:29 that there is a mini solar system
03:31 comprised of at least two objects which
03:34 I never heard elaborated beyond that
03:38 point but there is a separate son called
03:40 nemesis of course it has to be called
03:43 nemesis right I got a little plane a big
03:47 jet it's overcast I can't see where the
03:51 hell anything is so the way I've heard
03:54 it described again eight years ago was
03:58 that it was a mini solar system
04:00 comprised of a son called nemesis which
04:02 should just ride away sound pretty
04:04 fictional to you and it has a planet
04:07 circling it called Nibiru the bureau's
04:12 an earth-like planet now before you get
04:16 into the theory that exists today that
04:19 this thing was supposed to come you know
04:21 careening into our solar system and
04:23 because nemesis is a star and the
04:26 bureau's this plant you know earth-like
04:29 planet a guy a class planet that because
04:33 it has enough mass it would shake up all
04:36 the ether all orientations or I should
04:40 say gravity orientations and throw
04:43 everything off a huge collision
04:46 end-of-the-world sort of thing so that's
04:50 where it currently exists today but they
04:53 now
04:54 operating nemesis and the bureau from
04:56 each other in different theories but if
04:59 you go to what it was prior it is a
05:05 civilization that lives on Nibiru who
05:09 has a ecological crisis maybe an
05:13 economical one too
05:14 but as an ecological crisis that their
05:16 atmosphere must have gold in it
05:21 SuperDuper heavy ass particles
05:24 supposed to be floating up there okay
05:27 and they need to get as much gold as
05:29 they can possibly get and earth just
05:32 happens to be a gold Haven so a long
05:36 time ago when man was engineered to
05:39 exist
05:40 we were engineered out of the digitus
05:43 ape like you know hominids creatures
05:47 into Homo Sapien sleepin by these folks
05:51 because their solar system was inside
05:54 our solar system and when the bureau got
05:57 extremely close to earth they jumped
05:59 over with whatever spacecraft they had
06:02 to get to earth quickly rounded up and
06:05 assessed all of the indigenous life
06:07 especially the hominids then developed a
06:10 DNA sequencing technology to move
06:13 hominid to homo sapiens sapiens
06:15 obviously closer to whatever form they
06:17 are then after translating the DNA from
06:23 a absolute primitive you know ape
06:27 hominid they gave us intelligence and
06:31 then we started being born with the
06:33 ability to learn and then they
06:34 immediately taught us how to what mined
06:36 gold out of the ground and you know when
06:40 Antarctica research was being
06:42 rediscovered and it's prior to Flat
06:46 Earth as far as I know but when that was
06:48 going through people were saying that
06:53 the gold was being mined out of
06:54 Antarctica and of course Africa and all
06:56 these other locations we got plenty of
06:58 it in the United States that was all
07:00 being shipped to this planet then the
07:05 planet and the Nemesis star
07:08 swing out of rotation from our solar
07:11 system and now they are by on the
07:12 backside of wherever we are they're
07:15 getting the fact that if we are in a
07:17 heliocentric situation we're circling
07:19 Flat Earth this makes no sense at all
07:22 but for the sake of this conversation
07:23 we're not gonna mention flour as much
07:26 now let's look at some logic here if a
07:31 civilization needed gold in their
07:33 atmosphere and they have the technical
07:35 capability of jumping from their planet
07:38 two hours and of genetically engineering
07:42 organic matter the infinitely complex
07:45 and barely understood protein patterns
07:48 the dictate the nucleic acid chains that
07:51 make up our DNA and consciousness and
07:54 all these other things right if they're
07:57 that smart
07:58 then fusion to make gold should be
08:02 extremely easy man
08:04 extremely easy now why don't we have
08:06 that on earth well one we don't have the
08:08 ability to engineer a dog into a talking
08:11 human person thing at least we don't
08:14 have it in the public eye but the reason
08:19 why we don't mess around with creating
08:21 gold bars out of straw the old alchemy
08:26 theories back in the date was that we
08:28 would upset the entire apple cart of of
08:32 monetary eco systems if we just had tons
08:35 and tons of gold we would have to value
08:38 something else
08:40 yeah I've seen diamonds and
08:42 documentaries created in you know
08:45 compressors cubic zirconias again like I
08:48 said they're real diamonds but they're
08:52 flawless and so real diamonds have flaws
08:55 on them and that's what you want to buy
08:57 which is just really odd you try to go
08:59 to the flawed diamonds to try to get the
09:00 most perfect diamond but if you actually
09:02 make a perfect diamond nobody wants that
09:03 because it was an expensive to create
09:06 and therefore you don't love your spouse
09:09 but if we had to get gold made out of
09:12 anything we would figure it out we would
09:15 atomically figure it out even if it took
09:17 us more power to make the bar gold and
09:19 the bar of gold is worth
09:20 if our atmosphere was going to go tits
09:24 up and we were gonna die it wouldn't
09:27 matter right we would work around the
09:29 clock everyone would be peddling bikes
09:31 to make the amount of electricity that
09:32 we need right so that theory sounds just
09:38 as frivolous as could possibly be and
09:41 here's my my concern because we need to
09:45 talk about could probably create an
09:46 episode on it but there's probably not
09:48 enough information to make it truly
09:50 interesting but we have this sort of
09:55 mezzanine of I would say [ __ ] I'm
10:02 just gonna call it [ __ ] [ __ ] it
10:04 is [ __ ] these [ __ ] who say
10:06 they can channel people and channel
10:09 things they are the absolute inception
10:12 point of most of these [ __ ]
10:14 conspiracies that cause a lot of inks
10:17 and we're gonna talk about how much
10:18 angst Planet X Theory caused because it
10:23 was huge you had family members emailing
10:28 astronomers asking them that they should
10:31 kill their children should they kill
10:33 their pets should they kill themselves
10:35 all because this chick in 1995 needed to
10:40 be important but she's only part of the
10:43 problem because everyone who wants to be
10:46 involved with something special jumps on
10:48 that channeling bandwagon and validates
10:53 this crazy channeling okay do we have
10:57 any evidence that anybody can channel
10:58 anything no if you want to see the most
11:01 laughable [ __ ] theories of people
11:04 claiming that they can talk to aliens go
11:06 look at channeling videos with people
11:08 who claim to be talking an alien talk
11:11 and bringing in leaders from around the
11:14 galaxy and all this other stuff to my
11:17 knowledge there's not a single
11:18 channeling situation that is turning
11:20 anything concrete and hardcore but it is
11:26 this mechanism of total delusion you
11:28 know it's like you have you have people
11:31 with giant balls that go I'm gonna say
11:33 I'm channeling the
11:34 stuff well I'm gonna take a random piece
11:36 of metal and I'm gonna jam it in my body
11:38 and then six months later I'm gonna have
11:40 some guy dig it out we're gonna say it's
11:42 an alien implant but then you have
11:44 people that need to be special aren't
11:47 creative don't have the balls to create
11:48 something by themselves even or say that
11:50 they've got this theory by themselves
11:53 that you serve other people's crazy and
11:57 here we go now in my you know you ask
12:04 why that would occur and the answer is
12:07 always entertainment entertainment there
12:10 is this I forgot what they call it but
12:12 there's the I don't even know if you
12:16 call it a conspiracy but there's this
12:18 thing that went around the internet
12:19 telling kids to commit the suicide right
12:21 it was this weird doll girl from one of
12:24 the movies gonna have a strung together
12:26 slapstick thing of a bunch of different
12:28 things put together I forgot the name of
12:30 it but I don't give a [ __ ] I was trying
12:32 to get kids to kill themselves some kids
12:35 did kill themselves so someone started
12:39 this conspiracy online to tell kids to
12:42 kill themselves and suppose the FBI has
12:44 got no mass method of finding these
12:46 people which should probably tell you
12:47 where the source came from but it
12:51 surfaces and a bunch of kids kill
12:52 themselves and then it goes away and
12:54 then it surfaces and a bunch of people
12:55 kill themselves now you might think
12:57 that's a Darwin test why not just let
12:59 these kids kill themselves if they're
13:00 that impressionable they deserve it I
13:03 don't think so because you have little
13:06 kids who don't have any defense
13:08 mechanism they have that one finite
13:11 moment with their parent that frustrates
13:14 them and then all of a sudden someone
13:16 teaches them they can retaliate not good
13:20 so you might think Planet X is a fun
13:23 little thing to play around with until
13:24 people start thinking about you know
13:27 doing a Jim Jones kool-aid party and
13:29 murdering their entire church what about
13:33 the Heaven's Gate people I think that's
13:38 what they were called right the whole
13:39 cult of people that were in a house they
13:42 all made websites for a living they all
13:44 drink the kool-aid wearing their
13:46 sneakers why think
13:47 the leader left he didn't kill himself
13:53 everyone thought he did but he didn't
13:54 you know we have these sickos but now
14:00 the other thing that reason when I got
14:01 the phone call from this father-son team
14:04 was that there was a little extra sort
14:09 of truth sprinkled into the theory and
14:13 it was that NASA and a few other
14:16 organizations that sell doom and gloom
14:18 they're trying to get their budgets
14:20 renewed and one of the things they
14:22 always use and it comes around every
14:24 [ __ ] budgetary cycle of NASA and JPL
14:28 and other little outfits that supposedly
14:31 contribute to this overall data pool is
14:34 the idea that there's going to be a
14:36 meteor shower and we're gonna you know
14:39 have an earth the Cataclysm impacts and
14:43 we're all gonna die okay again we've
14:47 been watching the moon for a really long
14:49 time with optics we have not seen
14:52 anything registerable hit the moon since
14:54 we've been looking at it what we see is
14:57 plasma eruptions directly in the center
15:01 of craters
15:02 because the crater was invented by a
15:05 plasma injection from the interior of of
15:08 the moon and so it's still a weak spot
15:10 if you were to able to do a
15:12 cross-section of a crater in the moon
15:14 you would see the volcanic terror from
15:19 the plasma underneath all right so it's
15:21 coming up through that's why it's pure
15:22 white every single time it occurs and
15:24 that's why you can see the spitballs of
15:25 it just like a volcano if someone films
15:28 it really close you see the center of it
15:30 and you see this bubbles on the side
15:31 very easy to look up they keep selling
15:35 us and reselling us this cataclysmic
15:37 event that got rid of the dinosaurs
15:39 which is a meteor impact in the northern
15:42 tip of South America that is
15:45 interruption from the inside of the
15:47 earth that popped out and it probably
15:49 happened so long ago dinosaurs and life
15:52 itself was probably not here we're just
15:54 over growing this huge pop mark just
15:57 like the moon has a ton of them that's
15:59 why all craters are perfectly round
16:00 because
16:01 it's an eruption from the inside and
16:03 it's perfectly unified when it pops on
16:06 all sides which just makes it completely
16:08 round it's a meteorite you're gonna get
16:10 a bunch of ovals and all kinds of other
16:12 things that cream does that mean that
16:15 rocks on the moon don't tumble down a
16:18 hill every once in a while sure they do
16:21 another thing pops rocks soared him in
16:24 there and it just goes rolling down a
16:26 hill and you'll see these these little
16:28 rolls on the surface of the moon but if
16:32 it's hitting the moon at 35,000 miles an
16:34 hour ain't gonna just roll down the side
16:37 you're gonna have a huge elliptical poof
16:40 mark which doesn't happen but right
16:43 around the time I think it's about 2011
16:45 because we're holding on meteorites so I
16:51 get this phone call and it's a my good
16:57 friends father-son team calling me up
17:00 because this Planet X thing is being
17:04 theorized as happening I believe in like
17:06 I can't even remember is April of a
17:08 particular year NASA's running around
17:11 with their doom and gloom crowd trying
17:14 to raise their budgets you know have a
17:16 whole episode about necessarily doom and
17:18 the whole game is you need them that is
17:21 what they want you to believe that's the
17:23 optic of the PR firm is you need them
17:27 okay because you sure as hell don't need
17:30 an International Space Station you sure
17:32 as hell don't need probes on Mars you
17:34 don't we need human beings to have the
17:40 capability of leaving this planet that
17:42 is all that we need and until NASA can
17:44 prove that they can pull that off hey
17:46 you're just a little Ryu no skunkworks
17:49 research project off to the side my
17:56 friends were concerned because there was
17:58 a whole set of photographs of Obama you
18:02 know visiting
18:03 you know shelters in the Midwest there
18:06 was all these articles coming out of
18:08 Europe talking about how they were
18:10 bracing for impacts now whether or not
18:14 any of this is true you know you've got
18:16 all these crazy-ass websites that are
18:19 just nutty [ __ ] URLs that have no
18:21 sense of anything I'm sorry to get
18:24 emotional but I just find it this is
18:26 like you know a few of us people that
18:29 have run or lived in towns littles lived
18:32 in small towns eventually rose up to be
18:34 part of the executive branch of the town
18:36 to protect our people and to serve our
18:38 people we see these snake oil salesmen
18:41 come in and we run them out of town now
18:45 if the snake oil guy is selling hope and
18:47 and happiness in some faux form you
18:51 might look at and go okay but NASA
18:54 selling doom and gloom and Planet X is
18:56 selling the end of the world getting
18:59 parents literally to think about whether
19:01 or not they should kill their kids and
19:03 their pets and they said that and again
19:07 I believe more of the private accounts
19:09 of this more than I would believe maybe
19:11 NASA accounts that this but most of the
19:13 documentation about this talks about
19:15 individuals getting bombarded with
19:16 people asking questions about the end of
19:19 the world all because of what when I
19:24 used to go to Barnes & Noble all the
19:25 time just before the 2012 thing because
19:30 remember 2012 was supposed to happen at
19:31 the end of the year so a lot of things
19:32 happened in that year misinterpreting
19:35 the Mayan calendar
19:36 you got Mayan calendar experts and
19:39 people can actually read the language
19:40 going well the part that says the year
19:43 where it indicates perhaps an end of an
19:46 epoch a switchover is in is one it's one
19:49 it's terribly damaged but two it's it's
19:52 way in the for thousands it's like the
19:54 4600 range of the years according to
19:57 what well what year is it now
19:59 it's a Christ year it's this arbitrary
20:01 fictional story that dictated one year
20:04 it was and you think the Mayans are
20:06 actually using that calendar that you
20:10 have some translation between their
20:11 calendar and our calendar no way
20:14 you can't discover a race right in the
20:16 middle
20:17 and then try to date it and back dated
20:20 because your only question you could ask
20:21 it would be what year is it today
20:24 according to this calendar and then try
20:26 to reverse-engineer one way or the other
20:27 but the people who made it are long gone
20:29 so the best you have is an
20:32 interpretation so that opens it up for
20:34 all these nut bags to come and make a
20:36 bunch of money but what was happening at
20:38 Barnes & Noble I don't know how many
20:41 books came out that were predicting doom
20:43 and gloom 2012 crap tons dozens of right
20:47 now for anyone who's aware of that it's
20:49 entertainment you're just reading it to
20:51 have fun and hey more power to you
20:53 there's no I have no concern about those
20:57 individuals but the last thing I need is
21:00 you know I'm with my family I'm going to
21:03 some public place and there's some nut
21:05 bag who thinks that it's there
21:07 imperative to help me in my life because
21:10 they believe in some fictional thing I
21:13 don't think Planet X got to that level
21:15 in our worlds but people were making
21:18 these phone calls anyway these
21:19 individual scientists and astronomers
21:20 came out and said we're getting flooded
21:23 with all these calls and emails and
21:24 requests NASA claimed that they had a
21:27 bunch of this and then you have this
21:30 issue of okay the planet next thing is a
21:34 real societal phenomenon for some people
21:38 and again to explore it to research it
21:41 is great okay I have no criticism of
21:44 that but to adopt it and rush out and be
21:47 crazy with it I'm hoping that there's
21:50 some literary step between that point
21:54 before you you know go crazy but so NASA
21:58 knows believe me they knew that this
22:01 Planet X theory was gaining steam on the
22:03 Internet people were concerned and they
22:05 also knew that there was a twenty-twelve
22:10 movement going on but they never pulled
22:12 out the optic of we're gonna have a
22:16 bunch of cataclysmic meteorites hitting
22:18 Earth again it's never happened in
22:21 recorded history and we've never had it
22:24 be a close call and why is it that we
22:29 still have these reports that things are
22:31 extremely close to Earth and no amateur
22:34 astronomer posts the video on YouTube of
22:37 this thing occurring of this thing going
22:39 wolf right past earth only NASA can see
22:43 NASA's conspiracies you realize that
22:45 it's like a they live pair of glasses
22:47 well I can't see it we'll put these
22:48 glasses on oh there it is there's all
22:50 the doom and gloom and the reason why
22:52 NASA should get a ton of money
22:53 I think channelling people who claim
22:57 they can channel at this
23:01 out-of-this-world level okay
23:05 you might make a joke of saying look I
23:10 listen to the spirits I mean I don't
23:12 even need to say it's a joke but you
23:14 might feel like look I can listen to
23:16 influences of the universe I always talk
23:18 about that right that's a little bit
23:20 different you know listening to
23:22 inspiration here and there I need to
23:24 write a movie and so I'm watching the
23:26 movie inside my mind I'm sneaking in the
23:28 back of the theater like I always say
23:29 you know a lot of musicians say I listen
23:31 to the music and it's finished in my
23:33 mind and all I do is translate it well
23:34 that's how you know the lead singer of
23:36 Kansas wrote wayward son' he dreamed the
23:39 song and then he their album is finished
23:41 he rushes back to the students does
23:43 everyone get back to your instruments I
23:44 got this thing you know and you have one
23:47 of the greatest rock and roll songs out
23:49 of the 70s ever written that's not what
23:52 I'm talking about channeling people say
23:56 that they're actually you know releasing
23:59 their body to another person's body
24:02 their spirit right and so they're being
24:05 totally possessed there's this goofball
24:08 dude who claims he was bringing in some
24:11 alien from somewhere in the universe and
24:15 they filmed him and he sits in a chair
24:18 and he talks like this he talks like a
24:21 1950's alien you know and some movie
24:26 because how old was the guy well he was
24:28 probably in a 60s or 70s and he grew up
24:30 in the 50s and so for him and alien talk
24:33 like an alien from a sci-fi movie and
24:37 the 50s or some radio program like X
24:40 minus one
24:41 in fact X minus one has
24:44 episodes that sound exactly like this
24:46 guy but what's he won in the end he
24:49 wants to have he wants to get his rocks
24:51 off he wants to be popular and so
24:55 instead of taking his theories and
24:57 writing a great piece of fiction and
24:58 actually making some money and just
25:00 being another Ray Bradbury he goes into
25:03 this lazier technique of just telling
25:06 people he's channeling an alien and of
25:08 course you have this trough of human
25:10 beings that want to also be special by
25:12 knowing someone special it's like the
25:14 life of Brian right he takes his shoe
25:16 he's mistaken for being Jesus he keeps
25:19 trying to tell everybody I'm not Jesus
25:22 stop calling me Jesus stop following me
25:24 around he takes his shoe and throws it
25:25 at the guys and tells them to [ __ ] off
25:27 and then they pause for a second you
25:30 think he's done it you think he's
25:31 totally cleared these people to
25:33 believing in him and the only response
25:36 he gets back was well how should we [ __ ]
25:38 off a lord you know and he's like oh my
25:42 god and then they pick up the shoe and
25:43 they go he wants us to take off one of
25:45 our shoes and they'll take off one of
25:47 their shoes you know these people who
25:50 want to believe are dangerous for
25:51 society they really really are it's okay
25:55 to know that you want to believe we have
25:57 that famous poster of the UFO and it
25:59 says I want to believe it's in the
26:02 credits of x-files there's that's
26:05 nothing wrong with that and there's
26:07 nothing wrong with letting yourself
26:09 believe something as long as you're not
26:11 creating hysteria in society we have
26:14 rules why you don't screen fire in a
26:15 movie theater right well incubating up
26:18 Planet X to a point where people are
26:20 wanting to potentially kill themselves
26:22 it's like okay you're you're screaming
26:25 fire in a movie theater all right but
26:29 now one of the other theories about
26:32 Planet X that gets people doing research
26:37 and thinking that this is real and there
26:40 may be something to what I'm about to
26:41 say so I don't mean to discount this but
26:43 it doesn't validate the whole of their
26:45 hocus-pocus of some alien race coming to
26:47 earth genetically engineering human
26:49 beings making us dig out gold so they
26:50 can take it back with them again making
26:53 gold from scratch and genetically
26:56 engineering
26:58 homo sapien sapien the gold thing is a
27:01 lot easier than the other thing so if
27:03 you believe they have that other
27:04 technology then the whole story is bunk
27:06 automatically but now there's this and
27:10 I've seen many videos of this there's
27:13 this theory that we have two sons and
27:16 it's sort of like a binary system where
27:18 the sons are kind of around each other
27:21 there's even a theory of a third son
27:24 which is black and that that is
27:26 responsible for the eclipses that we see
27:30 all right now there's all these videos
27:34 of people filming the Sun on the on the
27:36 horizon it's specifically only on the
27:38 horizon that I've ever seen you correct
27:41 me if you've seen something different
27:42 but they believe they're singing two
27:45 suns alright this is where we can
27:49 actually bring in both models of the
27:51 earth and both models could explain a
27:54 little bit of this sort of mirages
27:56 effect just go for Flat Earth first it's
27:59 kind of fun so flutter is the theory
28:03 that we live inside of a snow globe it's
28:06 flat and the earth I'm sorry the Sun and
28:10 the moon are 3,200 miles up they're
28:12 chasing each other in a circle now the
28:16 weird thing is is that they are not in
28:18 complete sync with each other right so
28:19 they're never quite perfectly on the
28:21 other side of each other the entire time
28:23 and so my theory is why don't they ever
28:25 bump into each other it seems like that
28:27 would be the case but anyway we have
28:31 absolute proof that when you take the
28:35 scientific index of our atmosphere and
28:37 the refraction which means how light
28:39 bends inside of the atmosphere of Earth
28:41 you literally just ask NASA what does
28:44 the refraction rate of the atmosphere on
28:46 earth then you get a lens that does that
28:48 refraction you can put it on a flat
28:51 table a fairly large table you can put
28:53 an iPhone on one side it looks through
28:56 the lens and then you can have a piece
28:57 of paper like an l-shaped piece of paper
29:00 with the Sun on one side and as you pull
29:03 it back away from the lens by God you
29:06 see the Sun set on a false horizon it's
29:10 not setting
29:11 when you look around the lens the sun's
29:14 still on the piece of paper it's still
29:16 off the surface of the table but because
29:18 of refraction its distorting it to look
29:21 like it's setting that's one of the best
29:23 piece of evidence is that maybe maybe
29:27 you're not on a ball maybe you are on a
29:28 flat disc or some sort of concave disc
29:30 or whatever the thing is but what's the
29:35 theory for okay I should say also to the
29:39 other theory is that if you're looking
29:40 at the Sun setting in a desert the Sun
29:44 gets super small like a pin light and
29:45 disappears if you're watching the sunset
29:48 three miles from me on the Pacific Ocean
29:50 it's as gigantic ball of fire that's
29:54 it's setting on the ocean itself which
29:57 is more like the lens theory because
29:58 there's so much water vapor coming off
30:01 the ocean that it's doing a magnifying
30:03 effect on the Sun as it goes away from
30:06 our line of sight that's pretty
30:08 brilliant again the table experiment is
30:11 it's brilliant regardless if it's the
30:13 truth or not it's all I got to say I
30:15 love it but now here's a thing with
30:17 seeing the two suns and what they're
30:19 saying is one of them is his soul as so
30:22 well the em1 sign out there that we've
30:26 been raised with and the other one is
30:29 nemesis now what's interesting about the
30:32 nemesis this this dual Sun thing that
30:36 people see and again they filmed it
30:37 inside cameras and the cameras are all
30:39 different so if it's some optical
30:42 illusion inside the camera it it's gotta
30:44 be that can't be the case it's got to be
30:47 an optical illusion outside the camera
30:51 but the other thing is that nemesis is
30:53 somehow an m1 class star it is exactly
30:58 the same size as our Sun because every
31:00 time they see it mirrored and duplicated
31:02 it is the exact same size of the Sun and
31:04 it's usually considered to be behind the
31:07 Sun now again if you guys have seen
31:09 something different please link the
31:10 video but I think that that I mean in a
31:14 in their theory of the binary system you
31:16 would want to have two objects pretty
31:18 much the same size but I don't think it
31:20 would be remotely difficult to see the
31:24 two sons all year round if there are two
31:27 sons and they're orbiting each other if
31:29 they're not orbiting each other then
31:31 they'd be crashing into each other so
31:34 there's a big issue with that but what
31:36 if there's an anomaly and the thickness
31:38 of the atmosphere that creates an echo
31:40 of light and for that brief second that
31:44 you think you're seeing two suns you're
31:46 merely seeing light gets split and it
31:49 duplicates an edge of some sort and you
31:51 think you're seeing one what's
31:53 interesting is is that all the videos
31:54 I've ever seen and we we spent probably
31:57 probably a good month at my smoke lounge
32:00 tracking the multiple Sun thing and
32:04 watching every single video we could
32:06 find on an 80 inch radius excuse me a 60
32:10 inch 4k television and nothing was
32:15 totally conclusive you're looking at
32:17 this thing on oh I kind of see it and
32:19 you know when it's kind of kind of kind
32:21 of kinda you're still in a kind of
32:23 theory so the other one would be to
32:26 rewind the theory that I mean I was
32:28 initially told and again I'm not hearing
32:30 this in the official news about the
32:33 theory as it was later redock you mented
32:35 and some of you might think well look at
32:38 that the erase most the theory in
32:40 Wikipedia because it's true I don't know
32:44 I didn't follow Wikipedia back in those
32:46 days but the original theory was again
32:49 you have this teeny tiny sub solar
32:53 system and I think I've heard the other
32:56 planets named in that solar system as
32:57 well but Nibiru is the only guy a class
33:01 planet with life on it as I remember it
33:04 but there's this idea that somehow this
33:07 has existed for you know billions of
33:09 years or what-have-you at least hundreds
33:10 of millions of years and technically
33:13 speaking it would have to have been
33:14 formed at the same time our solar
33:16 systems form what other event would have
33:18 occurred you know and so it has been you
33:24 know coming through our solar system and
33:27 again there is a tremendous amount of
33:29 space again I always try to remind
33:30 everybody look every time you see a
33:33 solar system model of our solar system
33:38 where you have like the the sun's here
33:40 and you have little pieces of metal that
33:41 hold up all the planets they're showing
33:44 you a proportional distribution except
33:46 the Sun of where these planets are from
33:49 the sun's center but all the shapes of
33:52 the planets are completely exaggerated
33:54 in size I used to mention this a lot in
33:57 episodes this is a good time to mention
33:59 it again if I had a basketball in my
34:02 hand right now which is I think 10
34:03 inches across its diameter and that was
34:06 the Sun then the earth is about 36 feet
34:09 that way and it's about a third of the
34:11 size of a period on a piece of paper and
34:14 the North sorry the Pluto would be I
34:19 think 500 miles from the North Pole and
34:24 you know Infant estimate ly teeny-tiny
34:27 that's how much space is in the in our
34:33 solar system so there is a lot of room
34:35 for another teeny tiny third of a period
34:38 to come through and you may even have
34:40 enough room for a 10 inch ball to come
34:43 you know careening through but because
34:46 of the ether winds which make gravity
34:50 waves you know it creates negative
34:53 pressure in ether just like water and
34:56 bubbles if this thing came sailing
34:59 through at any previous point everything
35:03 would go cockeyed everything would go
35:05 crazy as well you might even have and
35:09 again these trajectories that people
35:11 made up on these YouTube videos again
35:14 they're trying to do the best estimation
35:15 I think based on this channeling you
35:17 know certified truth from this woman in
35:22 95 right but this thing is coming
35:24 through and you would think that it
35:27 would easily swallow up Venus it would
35:29 easily swallow up mercury because you're
35:32 just gonna have it collide it's gonna
35:33 come through it's going to suck these
35:35 things over hell even earth probably
35:38 would have been sucked over towards it
35:39 but the idea was it the way they
35:42 theorize this and again it's just
35:43 interesting theory that's been turned
35:45 into a valid story what if we had a
35:48 small solar system that's in some really
35:52 you know super wide orbit with our so it
35:55 goes way out into space and then it
35:58 comes back every sixty thousand years or
36:00 whatever it is it cannot have occurred I
36:04 guarantee you within the years that man
36:08 has been drawing things on cave walls
36:10 because we would have had a really bad
36:14 year as this stuff starts going back
36:16 past us I would imagine but here's where
36:19 I think that these theories get a little
36:22 frustrating but they can also be great
36:26 my concern in terms of the frustration
36:29 of these theories coming around
36:31 aside from people taking it to super
36:33 extremes which I guess we don't need to
36:34 really worry about only only a few
36:37 people would ever feed their kid
36:38 kool-aid to kill them right so mm-hmm
36:41 maybe Darwin does this thing there right
36:45 but if it creates concern which then
36:49 leads to research that could be a good
36:53 thing your concern so you go out and
36:56 research how this stuff would work what
36:59 I am not seeing and what I didn't see
37:02 back in the day when this thing occurred
37:04 especially when I got the phone call
37:05 from my friends was that we had a bunch
37:08 of press and I mean it was official news
37:10 press about they were you know
37:13 specifically it was Scotland Ireland and
37:17 inside Europe was going to get hit by
37:20 all these meteorites that were gonna
37:22 come in from I can't this location but
37:25 you have to understand is that in my
37:26 lifetime you know we have been paying
37:30 NASA and other organizations to do these
37:33 photographs of space to find alien
37:35 objects that are coming at us so that we
37:37 know if we have any threats coming at us
37:39 and what they do is they take a picture
37:41 of space and then they take they wait a
37:44 little while and they take another
37:45 picture of space and they make sure that
37:48 the picture is aligned there each and
37:51 every night that is the Earth rotates
37:54 and because stars are so far away okay
37:56 they don't parallax because they're so
37:59 far away so plant it's parallax because
38:02 they're closer
38:05 that's how all the astronomers back in
38:06 the day found all these wandering stars
38:08 these planets and so they take a picture
38:12 and if a dot appears out of nowhere
38:14 that's never been in the picture before
38:15 they have computers that sense this new
38:18 light that's coming through
38:20 and again everything besides something
38:23 made out of maybe black onyx is going to
38:25 reflect some light and so if a rock
38:27 comes at us we're gonna see it and so
38:31 they take a picture take a picture take
38:32 a picture and everything that's new and
38:33 it starts moving across the photographs
38:35 every single evening they realize that's
38:38 an object it's a comet's it's a
38:40 meteorite it's a planet whatever you
38:44 know one of the ways they find it too is
38:46 that in this way we found moons around
38:48 planets is that when a moon obstructs a
38:50 planet even if it's not lit well it
38:54 creates a depression in the amount of
38:56 light we get from say Jupiter so
39:00 normally jupiter has a certain number of
39:02 lumens that we get from it and when
39:04 there's a big-ass moon in front of
39:06 Jupiter that's the size of Earth and
39:08 there is one I think it's even a little
39:10 bit bigger than Earth it blocks some of
39:13 the light and even if we can't get a
39:14 absolute photo real thing which we do
39:16 today but back in the day hundred years
39:18 ago we just had these faint light coming
39:21 from that and then we started noticing
39:22 these little blips coming in front of
39:24 the planets we're like oh my god those
39:26 are those are moons and they come on a
39:28 certain cycle we can check it out with
39:30 two weeks from now it's gonna be right
39:32 there and that's how we figured out that
39:34 stuff exists but here's the thing nASA
39:39 has always had to admit and all the
39:40 space agencies have always had to admit
39:42 that they'd never seen anything until it
39:44 gets really really close and maybe
39:47 that's a little bit better these days
39:48 but you know how many reports have you
39:51 heard in the official news when it's
39:52 scare tactic doom and gloom budget time
39:55 for GPL NASA but all sudden a bunch of
39:58 stuffs coming at us and part of its to
40:01 keep up this PR so that it's year round
40:05 again they're approaching the 50th
40:08 anniversary of the moon missions there
40:10 was an article I just posted on the
40:12 Facebook page about NASA saying that the
40:14 moon is shrinking if anything is
40:18 expanding
40:20 but that what they do they linked inside
40:23 the article that the Apollo missions
40:25 took measurements when they were on the
40:28 moon and that measurements today are
40:30 suggesting shrinkage one us being able
40:34 to sense any shrinkage whatsoever would
40:36 be pretty unbelievable because you took
40:39 a 1200 mile diameter ball and let's say
40:42 it shrinks a centimeter you really can
40:45 notice that now they say that the Sun
40:49 goes through these these cycles and
40:51 eric' dollard's talked about it quite a
40:52 bit and again he was inside the Navy and
40:55 RCA when it was you and he was a child
40:57 and he said that they taught him all
40:59 kinds of stuff about the Sun but they
41:03 said that they track its emissions its
41:06 electromagnetic emissions and that it
41:08 goes through cycles now for me the only
41:11 thing that would cause an emission cycle
41:13 variant would be the crust of the Sun
41:18 goes through cycles as well and so maybe
41:20 the burning crust the electrical burning
41:23 crust of the Sun which is a diffusion
41:25 that's on the outside it's going to have
41:28 holes in it it's going to have thicker
41:30 areas in it and potentially as things
41:33 swim around the outside of the Sun is
41:35 blocking this emission pattern which
41:38 means it might cut down the emissions on
41:39 us but could also increase the emissions
41:42 and therefore everything that's
41:44 electrical that's around us is getting
41:46 overstimulated all the valence of all of
41:49 the conductive wires that transmit our
41:51 information any type of satellite
41:53 technology radar even just radar to
41:56 radar bouncing off the ionosphere it
41:58 could be disturbed and the Navy tracks
42:00 this because they're trying to
42:02 communicate with their boats but if the
42:05 expanding earth is based on the
42:07 injection of materials from the Sun
42:09 within every other celestial body in our
42:12 solar system has the exact same
42:13 relationship with the Sun including
42:14 moons and Moon we get some of our
42:18 residual as well potentially and so if
42:22 it were to shut down for ten years to a
42:25 hundred years maybe maybe the expansion
42:29 rate slows down and maybe I don't know I
42:32 there's always going to be admissions as
42:34 the problem with this idea that it's
42:35 shrinking but she might have the force
42:39 of gravity overwhelms the force of
42:42 injection and so you might get some
42:43 shrinkage but I just think it's it's all
42:46 hoopla PR to validate the moon missions
42:49 more and more and more until we get to
42:51 the 50th anniversary so I get this phone
42:54 call like I said and I said you know I
42:59 just don't think this is gonna be true
43:00 and sure enough the dates come around
43:03 and nothing happens I believe it was
43:05 April of the year that it was theorized
43:08 to occur and of course what happens with
43:10 all of these doomsday theories that have
43:13 a date
43:13 you have publishers rush out to put out
43:16 these books to just harvest all of the
43:21 super smart people who believe in all
43:23 this stuff and as soon as the date goes
43:26 and it comes and goes
43:28 nothing happens those publishers are
43:30 nowhere to be found
43:31 pumping this theory again they just go
43:34 hey we sold our books
43:35 joke's on you jack so same thing goes
43:39 for Planet X Planet X made so many
43:41 predictions I think it even was re
43:43 rehash for 2015 it never happens
43:48 and of course Planet X in 2012 were two
43:51 completely different theories with two
43:53 completely different schedules when you
43:55 say 2012 you got to make it happen in
43:57 2012 it wasn't supposed to be the 23rd
43:59 of December like the Winter Solstice the
44:02 day a couple days after Winter Solstice
44:03 supposed to be over of course that comes
44:06 and goes and you're done
44:07 but plan X can keep going and going and
44:10 going because they never quite know when
44:12 it's going to occur but I have not seen
44:16 plan attacks on YouTube and the feed
44:20 that we've got nurtured at the smoke
44:22 lounge is every conspiracy theory on
44:24 planet Earth coming through that system
44:26 but it's died it's completely died
44:30 because none of the predictions remotely
44:32 came true let's talk about the
44:34 psychological reason why this might be
44:37 something that is addictive
44:39 I think there's multiple levels to it
44:42 depending on who you're talking to
44:44 for people that are actually
44:46 that capable and I have to say hats off
44:49 to these con men it always blows my mind
44:53 how con men get to become common and
44:56 when I say man I mean mankind not just
44:58 male gender because a woman did this one
45:02 in 95 and I should say you know there's
45:07 official science about us having a bunch
45:09 of planets in our solar system that we
45:11 can't see but we feel them in the
45:14 gravitational models of all of our
45:17 planets in the system I think that math
45:20 is pretty decent but what happens when
45:24 someone gets to become the center of
45:26 attention you get to become famous among
45:30 your followers you don't think Jim Jones
45:32 felt amazing and his little cult you
45:38 know the fact that he actually called
45:40 for everyone to kill themselves because
45:41 here come the feds after him it's just
45:44 insane you don't like David Koresh felt
45:46 amazing you know and I'm not against you
45:51 know again the theories of him raping
45:53 the kids and in the church I don't know
45:55 if that's true or false I do know that
45:58 based on the information that has come
46:00 out after the fact
46:02 all those people were murdered inside
46:05 that compound before it was burned down
46:06 they burned the place down to hide all
46:08 the evidence of what they had done and
46:11 they blamed it on Koresh cry shot
46:13 everybody in the head it's like no
46:16 that's because some ATF guys got blown
46:19 away trying to read a compound with a
46:21 bunch of weapons and there's got to be
46:23 some backstory to that thing that's
46:24 something we simply have not been told
46:27 but they killed ATF guys and so ATF guys
46:30 go in the middle of the night now
46:32 they're playing a bunch of really loud
46:33 noise at the place you probably can hear
46:37 the muffled shots of whoever's doing
46:39 this they burn the place down and then
46:41 they get to write the history books
46:42 right dead men tell no tales
46:45 but these people raises themselves up
46:47 and they get to become these conspiracy
46:49 theorists people they're the origin of
46:52 the conspiracy then you have a group of
46:54 people that want to feel special because
46:58 they have some coveted information the
46:59 rest of
47:00 doesn't I mean think about it let's just
47:03 run a fictional scenario down down this
47:05 storyline somehow I'm out here really
47:10 late at night and I'm filming an episode
47:12 night because it's got concealment
47:15 and somewhere around me you know there's
47:18 four or five great aliens to show up
47:20 they walk around a corner over there
47:22 they come up by me whatever they're not
47:24 evil and they're just looking at me and
47:26 we start communicating and they start
47:28 saying well we think you're a good
47:30 candidate for telling a certain number
47:33 of people that were coming and we're
47:37 going to come on this particular day at
47:38 this particular time we're gonna land in
47:40 these locations we mean no harm this is
47:43 what our true objectives are we need you
47:45 to translate that the best you can into
47:46 English and let people know and I'm
47:50 sitting there going oh my god I'm gonna
47:52 become one of these nut bags because
47:54 what if you guys don't come but I'm
47:56 gonna look like an absolute idiot but I
47:58 go I go with it they managed to prove to
48:01 me this is going to occur but it's not
48:03 for another 45 days or something so now
48:06 I'm walking around for 45 days with his
48:08 knowledge that I believe I know I met
48:11 these creatures I don't do drugs I don't
48:13 do any you know stuff anymore I've taken
48:15 LSD in my lifetime but I don't do it
48:16 anymore
48:17 so I know I'm of sound mind as far as I
48:19 know but maybe I go crazy in 45 days
48:21 [ __ ] I don't know what I think I've
48:23 talked to these guys maybe they even
48:25 come and visit me every other day just
48:26 to make sure that I know it's real maybe
48:29 they have questions for me and I have
48:31 observations and I say well if you're
48:33 gonna do that you should probably do
48:34 this and make sure you don't give the
48:35 bankers and these evil politicians a say
48:39 you know we need to remove them and
48:41 they're like eight that's why we're
48:42 coming back we've been doing this since
48:43 the Babylonian times we reset society
48:47 and get it out of hands of the corrupt
48:49 few I'm like great that's awesome
48:51 could you do something to prove
48:53 something to me yeah yeah we'll do a
48:55 little tiny thing here and then Obama
48:57 disappeared so you know I mean it's some
48:58 weird thing okay
49:01 I'm gonna be walking around feeling
49:04 special that they've chosen me to do
49:08 this and maybe they've chosen other
49:09 people too but I'm one of these few
49:10 they're gonna bring this message out
49:14 and I'm gonna feel special and then when
49:17 it does occur oh my god you know I get
49:20 to remain a special rock star that these
49:22 grey aliens chose first that would be
49:27 the case right all right so a conman
49:31 always needs well they have a couple
49:34 objectives one they want to skate by
49:36 life you've got you know and again I
49:41 technically don't know if this is true
49:43 or not okay but we have a guy in the
49:48 Philippines who says that his family is
49:51 the original royal family of the world
49:53 that his family ran the entire world
49:56 that it was all peaceful and utopian and
49:59 he is convincing people to take their
50:01 debts to him and he's gonna pay it off
50:03 with this giant treasure he's got but he
50:05 won't show anybody the treasure and he
50:06 won't dig it out of the ground there's
50:08 always an exception to the rule right so
50:12 he gets to be super special to his
50:14 followers his followers feel super
50:18 special when they go over and they
50:19 believe it but what's interesting is you
50:22 usually get these followers and you
50:23 bring him aside and you talk to my solid
50:24 documentary this one from Los Angeles
50:26 went over with enough debt to go
50:29 completely destitute in Los Angeles and
50:31 now she lives on his compound he's
50:33 feeding her so and she loves it which is
50:35 great she's in a better place now but
50:39 the documentary filmed his thugs going
50:42 into banks over there and roughing
50:44 people up and you know again none of us
50:47 have a big love affair with bankers so
50:48 we're not trying to defend that paradigm
50:51 but that's what's going on over there
50:53 these certificates of wealth are all
50:56 forged they don't have any validity in
50:59 any country but the guy's create a
51:02 little compound over there and he's got
51:04 his followers it's very much like all
51:06 the other folks like that in history and
51:11 so there's a giant I feel special moment
51:13 when you jump onto these conspiracies
51:16 again most of the stuff that we cover on
51:19 this show if not every single morsel of
51:21 the conspiratorial stuff that we
51:23 mentioned and we talk about on the
51:24 Facebook page in the comment section
51:27 nobody's happy that these are true
51:30 situations we're not happy that we
51:32 didn't go to the moon we're not happy
51:33 that multiple people took a shot at JFK
51:37 until they got him we're not happy about
51:40 any of this stuff and I'm happy about
51:41 the bankers doing what they do you know
51:44 it would be an amazing day if we woke up
51:46 the next day and there's an article in
51:48 every single international newspaper
51:50 that says you know the Monarchs of the
51:53 world have rescinded their relationship
51:55 with control the bankers of all met at
51:59 some Bilderberg type thing and decided
52:01 look they they had an objective it went
52:06 south everything's out of control now
52:08 they never meant for compound interest
52:09 to destroy everything they just wanted
52:11 society to have a challenge so Society
52:14 would push through they never met
52:15 education to get all screwed up and so
52:18 they're gonna rescind their control
52:20 apparatus money's gonna be made
52:22 sovereign again and education is gonna
52:24 explode and we're gonna become the best
52:26 that we can be as a human race would
52:29 that be great
52:30 bettan happen does it but now then
52:33 there's this this other side of the game
52:35 which is theories that discuss the end
52:38 of the world I have had countless
52:41 conversations with Christians that are
52:45 very fond of mentioning the end of the
52:47 world and some of our extremely good
52:50 people and there's there's a sue for iya
52:53 when they talk about the end of the
52:55 world as it comes to Judgment Day and
52:59 their thing is like think about it man
53:02 we get to meet God we get to meet Jesus
53:05 all the evil people the world get taken
53:06 away by arc angels the demons of the
53:11 world get slayed I mean the demons that
53:13 are like demon demons right and taxes
53:17 are over and it's all over
53:19 basically pain and suffering is over now
53:22 what's fascinating about that is why not
53:24 talk to an eight-year-old who is loving
53:27 life he or she has a dream to become
53:33 something the parents have already had
53:36 their dreams and either achieve their
53:38 goals or not achieve their goals but the
53:40 kids haven't grown up yet and they're
53:43 completely happy that this kid will just
53:47 go straight to heaven I guess I guess is
53:49 the theory so my question for all the
53:53 listeners is the following if you find
53:56 yourself and again don't need to feel
53:58 bad about this at all but if you find
54:00 yourself fond of the end of the world
54:02 theories then ask yourself are you happy
54:06 is this somehow a gigantic relief story
54:09 for all of the suffering you're going
54:11 through and again life does get harder
54:14 as it as it progresses for most of us
54:16 you know most of us don't have a perfect
54:22 retirement plan we don't have the new
54:25 ''tis we don't have a bunch of
54:27 investments how could we the economy has
54:29 gone up and down up and down again I
54:32 will tell you guys on this show I had a
54:34 company that I made with a friend of
54:36 mine and we we grossed I think before it
54:41 was all said and done 7 million bucks
54:44 for the company in about six years but
54:48 the last million took about three years
54:50 of things so six in the first six years
54:54 and then another three years she grabbed
54:56 the other almost million hey can I we I
55:00 didn't have the account and do a full
55:02 total at the end but I think that the
55:04 invoices that I know in my mind totaled
55:06 around seven all right do you think I
55:08 have 7 million bucks in my personal bank
55:10 account
55:10 hell no hell no should I have at least
55:14 half a million of my own bank account
55:16 probably we had the 2008 subprime loan
55:21 scandal happen at the absolute peak of
55:24 our company which destroyed our partners
55:27 I mean our partners were not I mean oh
55:29 sorry our clients excuse me our clients
55:31 were small clients like Marvel yahoo
55:33 games EA the Thai Warner guy made beanie
55:38 babies other gigantic organizations
55:42 Disney they rescinded all their budgets
55:46 we finished the games that we made for
55:49 them a lot of them we just did it we did
55:51 everything they wanted and then they
55:52 were done they were off using our
55:54 technology
55:54 some we completely engineered their
55:58 website to be it's a gaming multiplet
56:00 multiplayer gaming website we engineered
56:03 it but because they had budget cuts they
56:04 never turned on our our version of their
56:06 product what are you supposed to do so
56:11 what can we learn from Planet X what's
56:15 an archetype of a scam in my opinion now
56:19 there's two sides to that assertion one
56:22 could be that we had decent empirical
56:24 evidence slash claims from credible
56:29 institutions in flying quotes and so
56:32 when you put it all together you think
56:34 you're on snot on to something
56:36 legitimate and no one can be blamed for
56:39 going through that face but you know the
56:44 problem with NASA JPL is that we're
56:48 sitting there thinking okay we love to
56:51 say that everything NASA says in JPL
56:53 says is a lie yeah it's not all alike
56:57 not every single thing that they do is
56:59 complete BS they are employing tens of
57:02 thousands of people and as much as they
57:05 do drag out what is it twenty three
57:07 billion dollars I guess article I just
57:09 read was saying that they didn't they
57:13 didn't mention any the numbers which is
57:14 really funny but they tried to dismiss
57:16 this idea that NASA has that budget and
57:19 that they made what they did was they
57:21 figuratively made the claim that the
57:24 conspiracy is that we say those
57:26 conspiracy people the NASA has the same
57:29 budget as the military no one is saying
57:32 that the budget of the military in the
57:34 United States of America is anywhere
57:35 between half a billion to a trillion
57:37 dollars I think a year I mean right
57:40 we're throwing all kinds of money at
57:42 these what is it the f-35 which is a
57:47 hundred and thirty million dollars a
57:48 plane freely 135 million dollars our
57:52 plane the b-2 bomber which is two
57:55 billion dollars a pop that is a lot of
57:59 money for a single point and NASA
58:02 doesn't even build a rocket that cost
58:04 that much money you know if you take the
58:08 missions from 69 to 72 the R&D to get to
58:13 the first launch in July 19th 1969 plus
58:18 all the other additional missions which
58:19 you have Apollo 13 in there that had a
58:21 problem and editor uh he's 9.5 billion
58:25 so it's seven launches but you have I
58:29 believe Apollo 10 and eight was
58:32 supposedly going around the moon I think
58:34 nine stayed in the orbit so there's a
58:36 lot of launches for 9.5 billion back in
58:39 the day now again I haven't amateur eyes
58:42 that up to today's money but maybe it is
58:45 it's got to be somewhere in the hundreds
58:47 of million hundreds of billions of
58:48 dollars by time it's over all right I
58:52 personally have to assume at some point
58:55 that this notion of a conserve a covert
58:58 space program that's actually doing
59:00 things is probably true what they're
59:05 capable of doing by acknowledging real
59:07 science and getting rid of all the stuff
59:09 that we're taught who knows
59:11 maybe they're flying all over the
59:13 universe but if that was the case again
59:15 if they could get to the moon in any way
59:18 shape or form they would construct the
59:21 landing sites perfectly you wouldn't get
59:23 these shots of the apollo limb kickstand
59:27 where the limb was on top of it that's
59:29 four times as big as the real one when
59:32 they send us the photograph say look we
59:34 got proof the scale is wrong it's four x
59:37 wrong that's bad that's super bad math
59:41 but they knew if they did real math then
59:45 the only we wouldn't get for little kick
59:47 stands in the shot we would get a little
59:49 tiny dot if we were lucky if any light
59:53 reflects off that thing
59:55 I mean supposedly is made of a bunch of
59:57 copper foil or its cover of a bunch of
59:59 copper foil so you think there would be
60:00 a fair amount of light that would bounce
60:02 off the legs so we have the burden of
60:05 reverse engineering the truth right so
60:08 trying to figure out okay what could
60:09 possibly be real what couldn't what
60:10 could be real why would they ever
60:12 greenlight the Orion project to try to
60:15 put human flesh through the Van Allen
60:16 belts if they've got this other covert
60:18 technology they wouldn't they would
60:22 simply lace any additional launches with
60:25 whatever super technology they have
60:27 again I suggest I suggested am I making
60:30 a UFO episode a long time ago of
60:33 creating a Faraday fabric on a nano
60:36 sized level of atomic matter and then
60:39 you would be able to fly right through
60:41 any electromagnetic pole and you could
60:43 even siphon the electrical field around
60:47 the vehicle which is mathematically
60:51 prevented from infecting the ship and
60:54 boiling it away but you could create
60:56 little inlets on the outside of the
60:59 craft to bring in infinite energy if
61:02 you're by a magnetic pole but since
61:06 you're in the universe you probably are
61:08 always surrounded by you throw winds
61:10 which you can metabolize into your power
61:12 supply each time a theory comes and goes
61:15 like Planet X we have to learn these
61:17 lessons in my opinion as a society so
61:21 when the snake salesman keeps coming
61:22 through your little town in the Midwest
61:24 in the 1870s in America
61:27 he keeps peddling this stuff that if you
61:30 drink this your hair is gonna come back
61:32 if you drink this you'll never get sick
61:33 again and you drink it and your hair
61:35 stayed vanished and you got the same
61:39 illnesses every single year the guy's a
61:43 con artist got luckily we did not have
61:47 in the phase of the Planet X theory but
61:50 brace yourself if this ever occurs you
61:54 know we did have the the thing of a
61:56 Russia of course but we never have had
61:58 any major Cataclysm in recorded history
62:01 of a meteorite impacting Earth's surface
62:04 and causing a giant problem you know
62:07 kicking up a bunch of dust and in the
62:10 sky I mean imagine imagine even the
62:12 smallest
62:13 meteorite and we've had meteorites hit
62:17 the ground and hit people and hit cars
62:18 and go through houses and that kind of
62:20 thing but we've never had you know like
62:24 one the size of a house land in the
62:26 middle of downtown Manhattan and you
62:28 know blow up a gigantic area of a major
62:30 city it's never happened in the Midwest
62:33 yeah we have that that weird explosion
62:37 that happened in Russia beckon was a
62:39 1908 which again we didn't have a bunch
62:43 of scientific equipment at the time but
62:45 something did an airburst it looks like
62:48 and it looked very similar to sort of a
62:50 nuclear explosion except I don't believe
62:53 there's any nuclear there's no
62:54 radioactive signatures still there
62:57 anything like that so they theorized
62:59 that thing was a comet made of ice and
63:03 that by the time it reached Russia and
63:06 it was just about to hit the ground it
63:08 boiled so much that it exploded and then
63:11 you have this ring of fire that went out
63:13 from the center burned a bunch of stuff
63:16 and then the shockwave from the interior
63:19 came out afterwards and put the fire out
63:22 and so things that the outer edge were
63:24 burned more than the inside there's
63:26 eyewitness testimony of I think an old
63:29 man sitting on his porch and he said he
63:31 was just looking at the forest and he
63:33 saw this gigantic wave a fire light
63:37 everything on fire knocked down the
63:39 trees and then another wave came by and
63:41 put everything out that's pretty amazing
63:44 isn't it there's photographs of that all
63:46 these trees knocked down so some people
63:49 think well the Russians are working on
63:50 some secret weapon okay why'd it take so
63:54 long to get nuclear weapons
63:56 supposedly blowing up and above-ground
63:58 tests in the 40s but this thing did it
64:01 in 1908 you think Russia would take over
64:05 the entire world if they had that kind
64:07 of weapon in 1908 so for me the whole
64:12 thing comes down to that old saying
64:14 outrageous claims require outrageous
64:17 evidence so if there's a person in this
64:21 world who starts channeling spirits from
64:24 the past or from some other planet or
64:26 they say they got a brain implant that's
64:28 like some radio station to Planet X K
64:32 krz or whatever then we need proof we
64:37 need a lot more evidence that this stuff
64:39 is real and you know think about us
64:43 think about us as an advanced culture
64:46 and we're in some star trek scenario
64:48 right we got this prime directive where
64:51 we're not allowed to mess with other
64:53 planets until they've reached warp all
64:56 right well if we were to make first
64:59 contact don't you think we'd have a
65:01 protocol in place to prove to the people
65:03 making first contact to you like they
65:05 there was that the Vulcans land for
65:09 Zefram Cochrane and they you know they
65:11 say hi you just went to warp this is
65:14 where you're gonna be traveling among us
65:16 and there's the Federation in space
65:18 there's that whole theory that there's a
65:20 federation in space and that we're
65:22 simply joining the rest of the galaxy
65:25 and that we need to learn how to behave
65:28 we got rules and all this other stuff
65:31 we're yet to have the Day the Earth
65:33 Stood Still occur right or at least the
65:35 act one where the ship lands in a
65:38 baseball field in Washington DC or
65:39 anywhere else in the entire world you
65:42 would think if someone is channeling to
65:44 somebody this that this amazing thing is
65:47 going to occur they could say okay
65:50 here's a little thing you can tell all
65:52 of your followers so they take us
65:54 seriously because we're coming now we're
65:56 gonna drop by and we're gonna say hi and
65:58 we're gonna see how much gold you got
65:59 you know look at the Sun on May 5th 2020
66:05 and you're gonna see nemesis crawl
66:07 around the corner
66:09 great the lady publishes her date her
66:13 time of day just like a de clips of the
66:16 Sun calendar we know how much we're
66:19 gonna see from a particular vantage
66:20 point maybe they even say ok go to
66:22 Devil's Tower and look at it and you're
66:26 gonna see it ok great what's happen just
66:30 have a little bit of proof on top of
66:32 these gigantic claims but we never get
66:35 that do we we get hysteria and the thing
66:38 is conman knows what you want the snake
66:44 oil salesman can't sell anything unless
66:46 he's got a bunch of problems he's
66:48 claiming to fix so he can conman in the
66:52 1700s are the 1870s could be looking at
66:56 a city in the Midwest
66:59 he just looks at it from far away a
67:01 couple miles away maybe he's on a hill
67:03 you can see it from 20 miles away or
67:05 like the Statue of Liberty you can see
67:06 it 60 miles away and he knows someone in
67:09 that town is losing their hair and
67:11 doesn't want to lose their hair he knows
67:14 that people in that town suffer all
67:17 kinds of illnesses during wintertime
67:19 during pollination time he knows that
67:24 people want to be smarter people want to
67:26 be like the twilight zone and want to be
67:28 fast draws and so he comes up with all
67:31 these benign elixirs and says you buy
67:36 this elixir and you drink it it's not
67:38 gonna happen right away because he needs
67:40 to get away plan right it's not gonna
67:41 happen right away but if you drink a
67:42 little bit of this every single day take
67:44 this little salt pill a sugar pill once
67:47 a day but you take it for 45 days and
67:49 I'll be back around is what the con man
67:51 says then you're gonna get this
67:54 indication in your life and it's going
67:56 to be a wonderful thing okay comes right
67:59 in the town sure enough there's a
68:01 million things out there million people
68:03 that need all those symptoms to be cured
68:06 same thing with Planet X theories they
68:09 know people want to feel special they
68:12 know that there's a constant stream of
68:13 articles that say hey man there's
68:16 meteorites coming meteorites come an
68:18 earth killer coming blah blah blah and
68:22 they also know there's people who want
68:26 the world to end because it comforts
68:28 their current current challenges in life
68:31 and they know it comes from Christianity
68:35 Book of Revelations and they know it
68:37 comes from just people struggling in
68:40 life and so they build an archetype that
68:43 you're more likely to believe because
68:45 you have a need to believe anybody who
68:48 follows you apology okay they know that
68:52 there are tens of millions of people on
68:55 this planet that suspect that there's
68:57 life outside this planet regardless of
69:01 what shape you think this place is and
69:03 they've got a product for you to buy my
69:06 old co-host used to always say I'm not
69:08 buying what you're selling and I think
69:11 that's awesome
69:12 when you coined that phrase in your mind
69:14 I'm not buying what you're selling it
69:16 gives you an opportunity to analyze
69:18 anyone's claims but to not let it into
69:21 your soul in terms of a belief system
69:22 until you get some very very intense
69:26 empirical evidence that this could be
69:28 true now I'm gonna put a footer on this
69:31 episode
69:32 it's about Flat Earth and again most of
69:36 you know I'm always equally representing
69:39 that group as much as I possibly can in
69:41 every video again we don't have a
69:44 picture of Earth from space that's real
69:47 it's always a composite as NASA has said
69:49 many many times again they blew them the
69:51 blue marble shot from Apollo 17 where
69:54 they messed up the Red Sea and then they
69:55 later fixed it and didn't tell anybody
69:57 there's not a single article online
69:59 while the Red Sea got fixed in that shot
70:01 all right so we're these tiny speck
70:06 creatures on this gigantic 79 hundred
70:09 mile wide ball let's just go with that
70:13 first we're not high enough to see
70:16 curvature
70:17 we're not tall enough to see curvature
70:21 again from my estimations from the
70:26 resolution in your eyeballs you're not
70:30 gonna see blatant curvature of this ball
70:33 if it's a ball and so you get 80 miles
70:36 up in the sky there's 500 5,280 feet to
70:41 a mile so multiply 80 times five to
70:45 eight zero that's how many feet you have
70:47 to be in the sky to see the curvature of
70:49 a ball that's as big as the place they
70:52 claim we're on so every single time I
70:55 see a meme or an article or someone
70:58 trying to be really profound with the
71:00 lack of curvature I don't see anyone
71:04 saying we went 80 miles in the sky and
71:06 we look down at the earth and it was a
71:08 flat disc or it just was flat couldn't
71:10 see the edges I hear people say yeah
71:14 well they did someone did a weather
71:17 balloon in an amateur situation and
71:22 there were maybe 165 thousand feet in
71:25 the air
71:26 that's not much and so you're not high
71:30 enough to see the curvature if we were
71:33 to be on this ball now had all of the
71:37 scientists flying quotes if they had
71:41 said this ball was 2,000 miles in
71:44 diameter then you'd have something with
71:46 your hundred sixty five thousand foot
71:48 view of the earth now there are a
71:51 million other proofs of this planet
71:57 being a flat disc that are not part of
72:00 that particular observation but for me I
72:03 if I were to go back on to this Flat
72:06 Earth thing I would be filtering
72:07 everything that counteracts what I
72:10 believed to be the basic altitude that
72:13 you'd have to be at you know I hear
72:16 people all the time say I was in a plane
72:18 and I saw the curvature of the earth I
72:21 was I have a friend of mine who was a
72:25 group fairly privileged and she said
72:28 that she was always allowed in the front
72:29 of the plane because a lot of times it
72:31 was a private situation or because of
72:33 the alkaloids of her family she was
72:36 always able to go to the front and she
72:38 said she saw the curvature of the earth
72:39 well it's impossible if you're seeing
72:42 curvature you're simply seeing it
72:43 because the windows that make up the
72:45 cockpit are distorting the Earth's
72:47 curvature and you think you're seeing it
72:50 but you're not seeing it the the redbull
72:53 guy that jumped out of that pod really
72:55 high up in the sky everyone's run the
72:58 anti star sorry fisheye lens filters on
73:04 it and it's as flat as could be well it
73:06 should be he's not high enough to see
73:08 the curvature of the earth as high as he
73:09 was even though he had to jump out with
73:11 the spacesuit on he's not high enough
73:14 so we have to be careful when we want to
73:17 believe something stick to the things
73:19 that are absolutely as conclusive as you
73:22 can possibly find and again the best
73:25 piece of evidence that anyone can put
73:27 out there for a flat disc or any type of
73:29 disputed shape of this planet would be
73:32 that nASA says they have a ton of
73:33 geocentric orbit satellites and no one's
73:36 sending us a direct feed of Earth from
73:37 space again
73:40 we should have at least a hundred
73:43 satellites up there that we should be
73:46 taking pictures every few seconds any
73:48 time we want a picture of the earth we
73:49 should be able to picture of Earth from
73:51 space whole thing not just a part of it
73:55 there was a point in my life when I had
74:00 a very good friend of mine who was
74:02 probably to this day one of the smartest
74:06 software engineers in the world and I
74:09 mean that 1000% he might be you know if
74:14 there's a if there's a top 100 coders in
74:16 the world now he's not a John Carmack
74:18 that makes you know video game engines
74:21 and can drag out every single piece of
74:23 processor power that's a whole different
74:24 level of utter genius but he was talking
74:28 to me for a few years about the
74:32 spherical projection technology
74:36 Asajj algorithms that rap flat plane
74:40 data around a ball and in his opinion
74:45 this is probably 1990 he was saying that
74:48 that's at the time was some of the most
74:51 gnarly code in the entire world to do
74:54 that accurately take a thousand
74:56 photographs from high-altitude planes
74:58 and stitch it all together such that you
74:59 might have like a weather system which
75:02 is very chaotic and sparse and a lot of
75:05 pixels that create all the clouds and to
75:07 stitch it all together so it doesn't
75:08 look like a bunch of different squares
75:11 being linked together and of course time
75:15 of day is a big thing you have to take
75:16 all the photos pretty much within the
75:18 same split-second otherwise the clouds
75:20 will move in 10 minutes and you're not
75:22 going to be able to stitch it together
75:24 so I just want you guys to be resilient
75:28 against con people it doesn't mean you
75:32 don't dive in it doesn't mean you don't
75:34 live in these rabbit holes for months
75:36 and and it doesn't mean that you won't
75:37 have moments in your life perhaps weeks
75:41 of your life where you're like is this
75:43 true oh my god you know like I told you
75:45 guys when I got into Flat Earth my way
75:48 of processing the information was to get
75:50 into it
75:52 and there was so much I should say
75:56 there's so much data and so many claims
75:58 of how we know this place is flat you
76:02 know what it was that Eric Dubay hold
76:04 200 proofs he had to go through the
76:05 hundred proofs that were written down in
76:08 the 1880s and then his extra hundred
76:10 that are on top of that and it takes a
76:12 long time to connect the dots together
76:16 and go oh wait a minute this one
76:18 contradicts that one and science would
76:20 contradict this and so it takes a while
76:24 but I actually spent I don't know how
76:26 many weeks just letting it be true in my
76:29 mind just letting Flat Earth be true in
76:31 my mind and thinking about it and
76:32 thinking about it until I finally
76:34 connected enough dots where I was like
76:36 okay now wait a minute this is so easy
76:38 to prove why isn't anyone proving it
76:41 because all these out the two claims are
76:43 bunk again Space Agency saying they're
76:46 up there they're proving that they
76:50 haven't done what they've said they've
76:51 done because they can't produce the
76:52 evidence to confirm what their claims
76:54 are that's also really important for us
76:57 but in the end we have to live on this
77:00 planet we got to live with each other
77:02 whether the earth is a tetrahedron disc
77:07 whatever a ball it doesn't matter
77:09 I got banker problems don't you I got
77:12 political problems don't you we got gun
77:15 control problems and freedom of speech
77:16 problems none of the earth shape is is
77:20 necessarily contributing directly to
77:22 this channel being shadow man like crazy
77:24 I got a ton of you know the last two
77:28 episodes I just released was determinism
77:30 and intellect was that emotional
77:34 intelligence was the last two I just
77:35 published at the time of this recording
77:37 both of them got demonetized really
77:43 determinism got demonetized the only
77:46 thing I can possibly assume because it
77:51 was then manually reviewed they do this
77:53 automated every one of my videos gets
77:55 automated out of D monetization I have
77:57 to petition them to be viewed manually
77:59 you know the overwhelming I think 95% of
78:02 my videos if between 90 and 95% of my
78:05 video
78:05 are monetized so it's not like I'm
78:07 hurting but it's frustrating to say I'm
78:11 talking about the most benign things
78:13 when it comes to world agenda but
78:15 everyone's smile throwing a little jab
78:18 at you know this this lunatic crazy crap
78:22 we've gotten politics going on the
78:23 United States and I think if any reason
78:25 whatsoever these videos are getting
78:27 nailed is because I'm putting out the
78:29 other agenda and I'm fully willing to
78:33 take that sacrifice right but the
78:35 subscriptions have just leveled off
78:39 it's like 4047 as of today but it used
78:44 to grow by hundreds a month now it's
78:48 just off and I understand that my my
78:51 last probably twenty videos are very
78:53 cerebral very much the kind of thoughts
78:55 that I like to have and the
78:56 conversations I like to have so I
78:57 understand there's nothing organic about
79:00 determinism there's nothing or gaining
79:02 about emotional intelligence but there's
79:06 moon missions one moon missions episodes
79:08 out there this episode alone should
79:11 probably grab a lot of eyeballs because
79:12 of its title my moon mission ones are I
79:16 think all monetized which is pretty
79:19 amazing but they're definitely not
79:21 showing up in the organic you know
79:23 suggested videos anymore I get constant
79:27 reports in the comments the people have
79:29 been unsubbed from the channel well
79:32 there are obviously active users it's
79:33 not like there are fake accounts I mean
79:37 what I assume is going to happen is a
79:38 bunch of fake accounts get created by
79:40 the five eyes and then those accounts
79:43 listen to the videos they're all being
79:45 digitized into transcripts to try and
79:48 weigh the overall public consciousness
79:51 and they'll look at the counts and so
79:53 they know okay
79:55 for instance 165 the episode 165 is my
79:59 second moon conspiracy video it was the
80:02 fastest it's the highest viewed video
80:04 and the entire channel but now it went
80:07 from like eleven thousand views to
80:09 twenty nine thousand views because
80:11 someone referred it somewhere and it was
80:15 just blowing up now the one it's
80:16 currently blowing up is the Neverland
80:19 and leaving Neverland part 2 where I
80:22 defend Michael Jackson against these two
80:24 kids that are accusing a bunch of stuff
80:26 that's been demonetised both the
80:28 neverland ranch things a bit demonetised
80:30 well that kind of makes sense we're
80:31 talking about pedophilia whether or not
80:34 he did it or not and that subject matter
80:36 is intense but it doesn't you know go to
80:38 go to HBO and ask HBO how how many
80:43 subscriptions did you get on HBO after
80:47 you release this Neverland thing
80:49 it's got to be tens of thousands of
80:52 subscriptions they're monetizing the
80:53 crap out of that content I mean imagine
80:56 like I don't know pick pick pick Game of
81:01 Thrones
81:02 I just finished episode 5 of the last
81:05 season here which is probably the best
81:07 season best show I've ever seen of the
81:08 whole series but they have carnage on a
81:10 level that is unbelievable I mean the
81:15 way they kill people is just so violent
81:17 and so unbelievable it's crazy now ask
81:21 me error let's ask the question
81:25 coca-cola gets offered by HBO hey how'd
81:29 you like to run an ad in the middle of a
81:31 game of Thrones episode they're gonna
81:36 jump on it in two seconds but what's in
81:38 the show
81:38 full frontal nudity which they've kind
81:42 of calmed down and out a little bit but
81:43 now it's got violence on a level that's
81:45 unbelievable
81:46 the last episode I saw women and
81:48 children are getting killed so all I'll
81:52 say about that of course they're gonna
81:55 run ads on that
81:56 of course it's ad appropriate if they if
81:58 the you know the folks want to see it
82:00 but what they're trying to do is has
82:02 nothing to do with ads they're using ads
82:04 as a mechanism to censor us so are we
82:07 over some target is it
82:10 Planet X I mean we'll see if this one
82:11 gets monetized well it should but all
82:15 these other videos I have my video on
82:18 small town values totally demonetized
82:21 what does that have to do with any
82:23 problems you mean you got documentaries
82:27 on Adolf Hitler getting monetized on TV
82:29 like crazy doesn't make any sense
82:32 anyway I think you feel me it's good to
82:36 be filming in the Sun it's good to get
82:38 some Sun to be honest if you have been
82:41 to defaults radio.com please go it's
82:43 where you can change from audio to video
82:44 there's a lakh Facebook group with some
82:46 of the coolest people on the planet
82:47 there's a Twitter account there's a
82:48 patreon page a PayPal account and a link
82:52 to the ever growing fully remastered
82:54 season one so again if you're a fan of
82:57 the show not every single episode of
83:00 season 1 will be available because I've
83:02 retired some of them the information
83:04 just got out of date but probably 95 out
83:08 of 100 are gonna be in there but a lot
83:10 of you in Europe are unable to see those
83:12 videos because of some music disputes
83:14 because I was in trowing a show with my
83:16 personal catalog of music and so I'm
83:19 wiping all that out I got different
83:21 theme music for the season 1 so it's up
83:24 there we're also on bit shoot it's it's
83:27 a slow crawl [ __ ] shoot because it's a
83:28 lot of pain in the butt to get
83:29 everything uploaded but once we get
83:30 through the first 100 episodes of season
83:33 1 I will simply be able to sit at home
83:35 at night and just queue one show after
83:38 another from 200 to whatever the show
83:42 ends up putting out so anyway thank you
83:45 for joining thank you for following the
83:46 channel make sure you come back because
83:48 you'll probably be unsubbed at some
83:49 point let me know if you do get in sub
83:51 because I'd like to know this sort of
83:53 how aggressive their algorithm is anyway
83:57 take care of yourself in someone else
83:58 and I'll see you in the next deep
83:59 thoughts over
84:01 [Music]
