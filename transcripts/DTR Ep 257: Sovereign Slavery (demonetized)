00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:38 deep thoughts so I've had a request to
00:42 do a video on sovereignty and your civil
00:46 rights I've had on my own list of stuff
00:50 an episode I wanted to call making
00:53 slaves and I thought I would mash him up
00:58 so we're gonna call this one sovereign
01:00 slavery so what is slavery what is it
01:04 what's very interesting about slavery is
01:06 that when I was a kid I was young enough
01:09 to see roots on TV with Jodi playing
01:13 Kunta Kinte apologize for not knowing
01:16 that actor's name he is obviously an
01:19 extremely talented person and so my mind
01:22 slavery was shackles working on a
01:26 plantation getting whipped no religious
01:29 rights you know you had to bow down to
01:33 the white man and say yes I massa
01:35 no massa and I think that's a really
01:38 interesting
01:40 puzzle for the brain to decipher from
01:43 childhood up
01:46 because as you get older you start to
01:49 realize that slavery comes in all forms
01:51 and still even though I've kind of
01:55 fractured your definition and you're all
01:57 thinking any of you've started paying
01:59 bills in your lifetime you're all
02:00 thinking yeah yeah yeah I know this I
02:02 know this and you're probably going off
02:04 to corporate slavery may think of a car
02:08 loan
02:10 but then there's another tier above that
02:15 and that is the slavery of your
02:17 addictions of your vices and when I say
02:22 that most of you think and probably
02:25 drugs alcohol sex right
02:29 which are all sort of negative things
02:31 sex not being negative but if you get
02:33 addicted to it just ask that Duchovny
02:36 guy he'll tell you all about it a
02:37 Russell Brand are basically 99% of all
02:41 rock stars
02:44 but then there's other but then there
02:48 are are other things that are more
02:50 primitive that can make you a slave like
02:52 love companionship a good conversation
02:58 you can be slave to absolutely every
03:02 single element in life that you either
03:05 enjoy
03:07 or that you dislike so there's this
03:11 whole hemisphere of thought we have to
03:13 become aware of when it comes to slavery
03:17 and the counter weight to slavery is
03:21 usually something that we would call
03:23 sovereignty
03:26 your rights as a human being because you
03:29 exist and if we really go to most of our
03:33 episodes and the thought process that we
03:35 share on the show it's to go up to the
03:38 rights that you have because you have a
03:40 soul because you exist in this universe
03:44 I you know we've talked a lot about on
03:46 the show about what's after this life
03:50 you know in many episodes I just did one
03:53 right
03:54 could you imagine dying and going to the
03:56 other side and there's a bunch of pricks
03:58 you know like some government government
04:01 bureaucracy that tells you oh we can go
04:03 that part of universe you can't go you
04:04 can't talk to them because they're sort
04:05 of like the you know they're really high
04:07 up in this engineering thing they're
04:09 kind of like the Anthony Hopkins and
04:10 your West world series you had on earth
04:12 yeah we don't talk to them and if you
04:14 know if the King comes by of the
04:15 universe you can only speak I've spoken
04:18 to you don't you divert your eyes and
04:20 can you imagine that
04:23 all I gotta say is they got to keep us
04:25 Americans alive so we're gonna go other
04:26 side and change things now obviously I
04:31 have to preface this with I am an
04:32 American and this is gonna be completely
04:35 from an American point of view I don't
04:38 know how much that will affect the
04:39 conversation that'll probably put some
04:41 of you off we're not a big fan I
04:44 apologize I'll try to keep it as generic
04:46 as possible but there is just a bias of
04:49 who I am and where I'm from right we you
04:54 know it's just strange I think that the
04:57 one thing that people forget about
04:58 America is it's not any one culture in
05:02 America it's not the liberal Seattle
05:05 folks it's not the gun-toting Texans or
05:08 the snooty New Englanders I used to live
05:11 there trust me
05:13 it's none of that it's an idea based on
05:17 sovereignty based on freedom based on
05:21 the Republic it all goes back to Europe
05:26 to those that were fed up who created
05:28 Magna Carta please see my episode of
05:30 Magna Carta if you dig this subject
05:32 matter it is more laser-focus to that
05:34 particular moment in time and how that
05:36 came about and what happened so if we
05:39 have this thing where even if you're a
05:41 billionaire you're still a slave if
05:45 you're a billionaire it changes nothing
05:47 you're a slave to what you love you know
05:50 some folks you know love to eat cocoa
05:53 pebbles every single day but they don't
05:55 like being fat
05:57 and so they kind of get in and get out
05:59 as soon as they possibly can people who
06:02 are trying to get out of all addictions
06:03 they go in and once you realize you want
06:06 to be out of an addiction
06:09 you know I think what happens to all of
06:11 us no matter what it is is you're
06:14 getting this love-hate relationship with
06:15 your addiction where and it you know I
06:20 think it devolves to pure hatred after a
06:21 while you become disgusted with yourself
06:23 you're in this thing you want to be out
06:27 super frustrating you go in regretting
06:31 you're going in and I'm gonna give you
06:34 this example from especially my friends
06:36 who struggle with alcoholism I watch
06:39 them may go into it and they want me
06:43 away from them because they don't want
06:45 me to see them like that
06:48 I still have friends i text with once a
06:50 week if not half a dozen times a week
06:53 and they are alcoholics and we we do get
06:56 together like once every quarter or so
06:58 to have a dinner or whatever and it has
07:04 to be very quarantined
07:06 because they don't want me to go to
07:08 restaurants that they go to where
07:09 they're gonna bump into their other
07:10 drinking buddies and then we have an
07:12 issue where they're gonna say hey man
07:14 let me get you a drink let's go further
07:15 into this
07:17 but I know that inside them they are
07:20 loathing this dependency I mean I know
07:23 you guys all get this stuff but I'm
07:24 throwing this out there just to kind of
07:26 reinforce eyes.the the slow change in
07:31 the mind and the soul of being a human
07:34 being with these addictions Americans
07:38 are taught that America is an idea
07:43 but then it quickly turns into a bunch
07:46 of patriotic stuff that loses track of
07:48 the idea you know there's this whole
07:52 push for globalism which thankfully to
07:55 some brave Americans who voted for the
07:57 right person they put a hold on this the
08:00 secret societies of the world's the
08:02 pedophilia human trafficking groups of
08:05 the world have been paused global
08:09 warming scandal has been paused all the
08:13 elites that were recently elected in
08:16 Europe have no power anymore because
08:19 they need the America to play along some
08:21 you know previous countries that were
08:23 communist a communistic they are turning
08:28 into kind of controlled capitalism
08:30 countries and they're forming their own
08:31 gold and their own currencies that's
08:33 backed by gold so they're walking away
08:35 from globalism as well they're just
08:37 creating unified partnerships between
08:39 their national borders down from
08:42 globalism we have something called
08:43 nationalism where you are proud of your
08:45 country I am proud of my country and I
08:48 hope I don't give a crap where you live
08:50 that you're proud of your country too
08:51 even if you disagree with the way it's
08:53 currently being run get out there and
08:55 vote you know if you're being beat up by
08:57 your police you know what you got to do
09:00 you didn't know what you got to do just
09:03 go buy a US history book starting about
09:06 the time that the Mayflower landed on
09:08 you you know
09:09 Plymouth Rock as they say read up from
09:11 there read up to about I don't know 1776
09:16 and just do everything that we did yeah
09:19 it's on your watch you're gonna have to
09:21 get off your ass and risk your life and
09:23 a bunch of you're gonna lose your life
09:24 but in the end this reason why you want
09:27 to migrate to United States will
09:28 disappear I know my European folks most
09:32 of them want to stay in Europe and
09:33 that's great so make that country what
09:34 you want it to be
09:37 but I tell you right now Mussolini
09:41 what he was trying to do to his people
09:43 around the time of World War two is
09:45 exactly what the EU is trying to do to
09:47 Europe right now right but they're
09:51 losing they're losing for the very first
09:54 time so this message is actually fairly
09:56 important and I'm not sure I'm gonna do
09:57 it any justice but I will do my best
10:01 the reason why we have to go into
10:03 slavery because we have to totally
10:05 understand sort of the checklist of
10:08 things of what what do we have to
10:10 protect in the Civil Rights side of
10:11 things the rights themselves right now
10:14 when I say civil rights you think of you
10:17 know segregation and the black movement
10:20 in the sixties Martin Luther King god
10:22 bless him Malcolm X all those great guys
10:25 but it goes way beyond that has really
10:27 it's colorblind it's a human rights
10:30 thing that we have as human beings what
10:34 do you do when anything breaks in the
10:36 world what do you do you take it to a
10:38 place that can can look at it
10:41 and see what's wrong give you a little
10:45 bid hopefully and you make the decision
10:47 of whether or not you're going to get it
10:48 fixed and then you move from there
10:51 alright well that's what this whole
10:53 episode is about now here's the twist
10:56 the twist on this is that I believe that
10:58 we will always have a part of slavery
11:02 inside a sovereignty and some of that is
11:04 the internal stuff our internal
11:06 psychology that we won't be able to get
11:09 rid of because we are sentient beings
11:10 and we are alive but then there's a
11:12 whole other hemisphere of it which is
11:15 folks that are above us that we in our
11:18 brains okay we have bullshitted
11:21 ourselves through some super
11:23 concentrated super dense reinforced
11:27 Stockholm Syndrome which is I had
11:31 episode on this this is where you fall
11:33 in love with your captors right the
11:35 British people who worship the king and
11:37 queen Prince Phillip in the Queen they
11:42 are in a self-deluded self-policing
11:47 groveling state to a family that simply
11:51 was in the right place at the right time
11:54 and now they worship them worship them
11:59 not everybody as I've had it told to me
12:02 by my close friends in the UK anybody
12:04 with the brain thinks that the Royal
12:08 Family's a scum of the earth
12:11 that they should be absolutely
12:13 ostracized there well should be seized
12:15 and distributed back to the people of
12:16 England because it was on the backs of
12:18 the people of England they gave him that
12:20 wealth in the first place so it's all
12:22 ill-gotten gains but I'll let the
12:25 British people sort that out
12:26 I have no opinion personally I think
12:28 monarchs have monarch monarchies can't
12:32 be legislated away from our president
12:36 the United States we don't have him here
12:37 we we got out of that game a long time
12:39 ago so if you got them in your country
12:41 you're gonna have to mature and get out
12:43 of that thing you have to start having
12:45 conversations and living rooms and on
12:46 the streets of like why don't we have
12:49 these things anymore you know now here's
12:52 the here's one of these sort of
12:54 interesting themes of
12:57 these kind of shows when it's a guy like
13:00 me talking into the camera now for those
13:04 of you who live in worlds without
13:07 monarchs and worlds that are free and
13:09 you get a decent you know you know
13:12 decent I guess first stage balance
13:15 between you know government and the
13:17 people and the police and people
13:21 I have the privilege under one
13:23 circumstance to talk to folks that may
13:25 be in different worlds where they don't
13:26 have these privileges right
13:30 so it's sort of like smuggling it out
13:33 but you know I don't think people from
13:37 you know really repress terrible
13:39 countries they're getting a chance to
13:41 watch this they don't speak English
13:42 whatever so it's gonna have to get out
13:45 to you guys and remind you guys of the
13:47 issue and get you to be really poignant
13:50 about your own opinions especially if
13:52 they differ from mine that's great and
13:53 then you have to find relatives and
13:56 friends and whatever you can do to
13:57 inject it further so it spreads like a
14:00 virus of sovereignty right so you know
14:05 I've talked about on several shows and
14:07 again if you're brand new this will all
14:08 be new to you but we talk about common
14:11 law which in its most basic form is do
14:14 harm do no harm to others and really
14:19 that's that's all you really need to do
14:20 but you should probably not do harm to
14:22 yourself but I guess that's up to you
14:25 once you say do harm do no harm guess
14:29 you're keeping that backwards that's
14:30 awful you know do no harm to others then
14:33 you have to really think through your
14:34 day think through your cycle if you've
14:36 never contemplated that then contemplate
14:38 it and take inventory from the moment
14:39 you get up to the moment you go to bed
14:41 especially for all the various tasks did
14:43 you complete in a month a year a decade
14:46 whatever and do no harm to others is
14:50 probably the best statement the world
14:52 because the Bible in the Christian sense
14:55 puts out a phrase that doesn't work very
14:57 well which is do unto others as you
14:59 would have them do unto you that opens
15:03 yourself up to a bunch of a bunch of
15:05 problems basically like I'm very tough
15:08 on myself in a very fun way I love it my
15:11 buddies are guys that will flat-out tell
15:15 me I'm messed up right to my face and
15:17 sometimes you know they'll take the
15:19 liberty to yell it and even if they
15:23 catch me off guard I'm a little
15:24 surprised by it within microseconds so
15:27 I'm looking at him like this is a true
15:29 friend this is it
15:31 you know as long as they come back
15:33 around and go now get your [ __ ] together
15:34 love you brother see you later you know
15:36 that kind of thing that kind of rapport
15:38 my father was military so he was very he
15:42 was strict what the things that he
15:44 thought were really important and then
15:46 he could give a crap about all the
15:47 things that society gives a [ __ ] about
15:48 you know especially swearing swearing
15:52 among the boys he weren't a lot of
15:53 square in front of the ladies right but
15:55 it's a big complex mess nowadays isn't
15:59 it in 2018 men you have different
16:04 religions running around the world
16:06 trying to reinforce their dying
16:08 doctrines we have you know non-religious
16:12 folks just trying to figure out how to
16:14 balance society
16:16 we have scientists that have now through
16:19 global warming [ __ ] have been told
16:22 that yeah you get to you get to form
16:24 laws that govern human beings because
16:27 you're a scientist you're Bill Nye that
16:30 never had a science degree guy you some
16:34 civil engineer or something I don't know
16:36 yeah but that's right [ __ ] knowledge
16:38 from what 1979 but what I want to do to
16:42 frame this particular episode is to talk
16:45 about it from your own personal
16:47 standpoint
16:49 because you have some decisions to make
16:50 once you care about this whole paradigm
16:54 and I'm gonna try to but in the episode
16:56 up with a brief take on the straw man
16:58 the person which is gonna sort of be the
17:03 one of the mechanisms we got into this
17:06 in a global sense of the term
17:09 a lot of people try to make changes to
17:12 the world without understanding who they
17:14 are as a human being and there's an old
17:17 saying saying you don't know where
17:18 you're going you can't know where you're
17:19 going if you don't know where you've
17:20 been and a lot of people think of that
17:23 statement a more literal sense of well I
17:25 was in Toledo Ohio then I moved to
17:26 Kansas then I'm a bit cutting no does
17:28 anything to do with that at all it has
17:30 to do with who are you as a human being
17:32 and who were you and where are you going
17:35 with your personality and do you have a
17:37 high enough elevation view of the world
17:40 to understand this is what society looks
17:43 like down there and I'm one of the
17:44 little electrons in the circuitry down
17:47 there because you're playing a part in
17:50 the overall Bistro when it is the
17:53 computer in the douglas adams script
17:55 that is calculating something we are
17:57 this machine of you know moving
18:00 something from over here and make the
18:02 expresso I move it over there and you
18:03 drink it and then you order a steak and
18:04 boom boom boom everything has an
18:07 ecosystem to it and everything that we
18:09 do in the world is affecting everything
18:12 else the butterfly effect effect of
18:14 course now when you think of the
18:16 butterfly effect and it's a literal
18:18 translation you know what is it the
18:19 butterfly in Peru changes the tea in
18:23 China sort of thing but when you think
18:25 about the consciousness wave of human
18:27 beings if you become a serf a slave you
18:32 become docile because you you consume a
18:35 lot of fluoride you consuming a lot of
18:37 aluminum out of the sky you take flu
18:39 shots all the time then this sort of
18:43 you know bend over for it over the
18:45 barrel is the life you that you are
18:50 going to exude your halo of influence
18:52 when people get around you this meekness
18:55 it starts to infect and break down the
18:59 overall backbone of society so we as
19:03 human beings need to become become I
19:06 mean I think you have to become
19:08 extremely sentient to what you believe
19:11 are your rights
19:13 starting from stop messing with me and
19:16 go all the way up now because Society
19:20 has been made so complex right just
19:24 think about living in a house and by
19:26 yourself or with your family sorry I
19:28 mean but yeah actually go to yourself
19:29 you've just moved out of your parents
19:31 house and you're gonna start paying the
19:33 bills for some little shack no roommates
19:36 none I stuck because want to cleanse
19:37 this analogy as clean as we can you're
19:40 gonna need running water electricity
19:43 probably some form of internet depending
19:46 on if you have computers or you're just
19:47 using your phone but you need a cell
19:48 phone
19:48 you didn't clothing you need food you
19:51 need plumbing all this good stuff right
19:54 we're gonna get it all right
19:57 if you live out in the jungle and you're
19:58 crapping down a hill and you can hunt
20:01 and skin and all this other stuff then
20:03 maybe you can kind of get away from
20:06 dependencies on others but in this world
20:08 today no matter how third wheel you are
20:11 or first world you are you have
20:12 dependencies with the world and once you
20:17 have a dependency with the world then
20:18 you can be controlled and this is where
20:22 I've said many times that strategic
20:24 resources of the world are the resources
20:26 that society needs to survive North
20:29 Korea needs food it does it needs
20:32 whatever they use to generate heat in
20:35 homes whether it be oil or electricity
20:37 they need it if they don't get it people
20:41 start dying
20:43 on our little analogy you die and so as
20:47 soon as you need to get something from
20:49 someone else then the manipulation can
20:51 begin
20:52 and it's that dependency that turns on
20:55 the the sort of slavery spicket because
21:03 if I'm a nice guy and we and we have a
21:05 little island together maybe there's
21:07 like ten of us and each one of us takes
21:08 care of one of the utilities one person
21:11 is a great hunter one person is really
21:12 good at making electricity and so on and
21:15 so forth and we all agree to be good to
21:17 each other and there's no resource
21:20 crisis that's hanging over our head
21:23 right then Society will be fantastic
21:26 just as long as everyone gets up and
21:28 they have good health and no one's
21:29 getting sick and dying and we don't have
21:31 any deprivation of what we need but the
21:37 second it turns into a headless
21:39 corporation well then we have laws where
21:46 we start to say okay if the guy who
21:49 makes electricity dies we have to have a
21:51 back-up plan so he's gonna have to Train
21:53 somebody her--he whatever and making
21:56 sure that that resource is always
21:58 replenished and you know what once we
21:59 figure out how to store this stuff we
22:01 should probably store it in case we have
22:03 a bad season for electricity generation
22:05 whatever it is the gerbils can run in a
22:07 circle anymore Richard Gere's use it a
22:09 few now let's fast forward to keep this
22:13 interesting
22:15 one of the one of the things that pisses
22:19 me off the most about our and you know
22:22 we're all guilty of this is that we
22:24 allow paradigms of thought to absolutely
22:26 dominate control our existence one of
22:29 the key paradigms of thought that needs
22:33 to be absolutely erased more so than any
22:35 fabled Holocaust anywhere in history is
22:39 debt
22:42 this idea that we have debt and it's
22:47 easier to explain on a nation level than
22:50 it is on an individual level the scam
22:52 goes all the way down to you the Ponzi
22:55 scheme of fiat money creation is a joke
22:58 but one of the easiest ways to describe
23:00 it is the way that say a country like
23:03 America borrows money from the European
23:06 banking cartel to have it created into
23:09 our ecosystem it's been a very long time
23:11 since I describe lists so let me just
23:13 describe this one more time in case you
23:15 haven't caught all the other 200
23:16 episodes
23:19 if you want a dollar from me and I have
23:23 a dollar in my pocket and we sit at a
23:25 table just a big round table with
23:28 nothing on it a wooden table from the
23:30 1850s and I put that dollar on the table
23:33 and I say okay here's the deal you're
23:35 gonna pay this back to me whenever you
23:37 do at ten cents on the dollar interest
23:41 so when you pay me back you got to give
23:42 me the buck plus ten cents but you're in
23:45 this world and here's here's a contract
23:48 that we're gonna sign it's going to
23:50 guarantee that you agree to this ten
23:52 percent interest and you're like yeah
23:54 ten cents that's a little high but
23:56 10 cents what do you care you sign it
23:59 now that's called a bond it bonds you to
24:02 me you gotta pay me back now if I said
24:05 right after that pay me back right away
24:08 within an hour you know you haven't
24:11 spent the dollar yet so you give it back
24:12 to me and he could run rummage around
24:14 your ear you know your house and you'll
24:18 find 10 cents and a seat cushion you
24:20 bring it right to me
24:21 I go thank you very much I sign the bond
24:23 paid we're done we tear it up we burn it
24:25 whatever okay but if you are the United
24:30 States of America and I am the banking
24:33 cartel the World Bank the IMF hidden
24:37 banks did you have no idea exist when
24:39 you asked me for a dollar and we run the
24:42 same deal except that tabletop is now a
24:46 different object the tabletop is a
24:49 metaphor for your entire country if it
24:52 doesn't exist on that tabletop then the
24:55 forms of currency it doesn't exist at
24:57 all ever
24:58 and so I have this printing press on my
25:01 end of the table where I can make
25:03 monopoly money that you use
25:06 you asked me for a buck sorry well my
25:08 little printer there's the dollar here's
25:12 the bond the contract between you and I
25:14 that you're gonna pay me back a dollar
25:15 plus ten cents interest you sign it and
25:19 the second after you sign it I say to
25:22 you all right pay me back right now and
25:27 you're like oh okay well here's your
25:30 dollar back and I say okay go get me the
25:34 other ten cents you owe me now if you're
25:37 the United States of America and there's
25:39 no other money that's ever been made
25:42 because I control all of your money
25:44 creation there's not a penny in a
25:45 cushion anywhere there's no previous
25:47 currency that's ever going to be honored
25:50 you're going to look at me and go well
25:52 that's a screwed up
25:54 I don't have the 10 cents how am I gonna
25:56 pay you back how did I ever get this
25:58 contract in the first place because you
26:00 didn't there's no other currency in
26:02 motion and you didn't make the 10 cents
26:04 so how do I pay you back and I say
26:06 that's your problem what I will do
26:09 though is I'll loan you the 10 cents at
26:11 30 cents interest 3,000 percent interest
26:17 and you're gonna go actually it's a 300%
26:20 but you're gonna say well that sounds
26:23 illegal that sounds weird this isn't in
26:25 this is an impossible scenario so what
26:27 we call the Ponzi scheme all of the
26:30 money created in the United States of
26:31 America from 1913 and up after the
26:34 sixteenth amendment was forced into
26:36 motion
26:38 is basically criminal money it is as
26:42 counterfeit as it could possibly get and
26:44 the only reason why the money of America
26:47 isn't considered to be counterfeit is
26:50 because our brains are defective
26:52 we have been convinced that the
26:56 artificial is real and the reason why
27:00 America has a giant national debt to a
27:04 bunch of banks in Europe
27:07 is because our brains have been
27:10 institutionalized into slavery into
27:12 thinking that that's a real debt to top
27:15 it off when we do pay back the debt
27:19 they've got a printing press on their
27:21 end that has nothing that backs it
27:23 there's no goal there's no nothing that
27:25 backs it but oftentimes well in almost
27:28 every case when we labor in America to
27:31 use our dollars to manufacture something
27:34 sell something we actually are giving
27:36 back to the bankers real product
27:38 something actually has value so imagine
27:40 I print a hundred-dollar bill out of
27:43 monopoly I just give you $200 bill out
27:46 of the Monopoly game and I say you owe
27:48 me not only 100 bucks but you owe me
27:50 interest but I want you to pay it back
27:51 in a gold wafer a gold coin you're like
27:56 what I'm taking a fake piece of paper
27:58 it's freaking he it was it orange a
28:01 yellow and Monopoly and you want me to
28:03 go off and find gold somewhere what do
28:06 you mean dig in the ground and fine gold
28:08 and I'm like yeah I am the European
28:10 banking cartel I want you to go find
28:14 gold in Deadwood South Dakota go dig it
28:18 out melt it down I don't care who you
28:20 have to rape beat pillage to get it you
28:22 bring that back to me now
28:25 no Meah let me give you a little
28:27 question here a little rhetorical
28:29 question on one side the table you have
28:31 this pasty bastard from one of those
28:34 royal families whether they be honored
28:38 as royalty officially as monarchs are
28:40 whether or not they are royalty merely
28:42 because they're part of the oligarchy
28:43 that has banking cartels of Europe but
28:46 there's some guy on the other side table
28:49 and you're a hard-working American on
28:51 the other side of table or German our
28:55 Frenchman or Italian or Spaniard or
28:58 Polish person or Norwegian and you
29:03 simply said [ __ ] you been
29:07 why she card try to come get it if at
29:11 the very beginning we wouldnít it in the
29:13 button
29:15 and just said either take this crap back
29:18 tear up that bond this was
29:20 misrepresented as a fair deal this is a
29:23 Ponzi scheme by the way I'm gonna tell
29:25 the rest of the world that you're a
29:26 Ponzi scheme if it had never gone to the
29:30 next stage and ever been implemented in
29:32 any country around the world this
29:33 wouldn't have happened but it happened
29:36 thousands of years ago you know there's
29:41 a passage in the Bible where Jesus turns
29:44 over the money changers in the temple
29:45 you know it's a fictitious event but the
29:51 reason why it was written into the story
29:52 and it was written to a story that was
29:55 supposed to be highly accessible to all
29:58 the people of Europe at the time meaning
30:00 they understood it was because they
30:02 understood it they knew that money
30:04 changers existed which is to say someone
30:07 says they have gold in a vault and they
30:08 write paper notes against that gold but
30:11 they know that they can issue way more
30:13 paper notes ten times is the minimum
30:16 amount they can issue into the public
30:17 where there's no problem because nobody
30:20 wants to carry around the big bars of
30:21 gold
30:22 and then it turned into well we don't
30:26 have any go but let's just pretend we
30:28 have gold I mean these they're willing
30:29 to exchange those papers real really
30:32 yeah they never come for the gold look
30:35 at America these [ __ ] think they
30:37 have a bunch of gold something called
30:39 Fort Knox named after Philander Knox and
30:41 not the Navy Knox guy it was the guy
30:44 that helped write the 16th amendment get
30:45 it passed goddam are these people
30:48 absolutely gullible it's painted
30:51 tungsten if there's anything in there at
30:53 all
30:53 I think most Americans understand that
30:57 Fort Knox has no gold in it but nobody
30:59 is willing to say that the emperor has
31:02 no clothes on so every time I hear some
31:05 news report about addressing national
31:08 debt in the United States of America
31:11 it sort of infuriates me that we're
31:14 still so absolutely stupid that we
31:16 believe it's real some of you may have
31:19 heard of the story of the gentleman
31:21 which I think was in Illinois I could be
31:23 wrong he was being foreclosed on his
31:27 house it was about twenty-five thousand
31:29 dollar house it wasn't a huge loss to
31:30 the bank but this was several years ago
31:32 and they were trying to foreclose on
31:34 because he couldn't pay his loan and he
31:35 walked in there and said look the bank
31:38 never owned my house so I don't have to
31:41 pay back the debt and he caught the
31:44 judge I don't know what circuit his case
31:46 was being tried in but the judge is like
31:48 what are you talking about he's like the
31:50 bank never had the money that they said
31:53 they loaned me but they were able to use
31:55 fractional reserve banking to create the
31:57 money from scratch and in hopes that I
32:00 would go labor in my life and create
32:02 real money and give it to them and then
32:05 they would have the real money with
32:06 which they would loan 10x against that
32:09 money to someone else creating ten times
32:12 the fraudulent loans that they already
32:14 gave me and somehow somehow justice was
32:19 served the bank was told he's right
32:22 you can't take his house and I think the
32:27 bank just said you know what this is a
32:28 really volatile situation here to
32:31 themselves let's not get this any more
32:33 press than it already has received it's
32:36 only 25 grand we can write this off in
32:38 two seconds let the old bastard have his
32:39 house hmm well that's the same exact
32:45 formula on US micro scale that we can do
32:48 to the debt of pretty much every single
32:50 country in the world it's ever borrowed
32:53 that kind of money
32:55 and I mean not that kind of money in
32:57 terms of overall number but that kind of
33:01 money in terms of fiat currency right if
33:04 you came to someone's house and they
33:08 were a big giant hoarder
33:10 you know like Sanford and Son times 10
33:12 they got cars in the back their houses
33:15 filled to the brim with filled up
33:17 diapers or whatever they have was a
33:19 problem and you had the job of cleaning
33:22 it all up
33:23 you know that there's not one thing you
33:26 can do to clean it all up
33:28 you're gonna have to do hundreds
33:30 hundreds of things different strategies
33:33 for different things if you have 45 cats
33:36 in there you're gonna have to bring in
33:37 veterinarians to pull them all out and
33:39 check them take care of dispose of the
33:40 dead bodies of cats you're gonna have to
33:42 get some health agency in there to get
33:44 rid of all the the excrement some
33:47 salvage yards you got to take all the
33:49 cars and it's going to take time even if
33:53 you could get everyone there on the same
33:54 day well there's logistics of getting in
33:56 and out of the house
33:57 not everybody can use the doorway at the
33:59 same exact time and you don't have time
34:01 to orchestrate everything right that
34:04 example applies to us trying to clean up
34:08 our country he's trying to clean up our
34:09 brains and so it's all gonna have to go
34:13 in stages you know the first thing that
34:16 was going on when the internet blew up
34:18 was 9/11 people are trying to people
34:20 were finally figuring out that this
34:22 whole thing was a fraud and even that
34:24 continued through ten stages of
34:26 refinement where physics and aviation
34:28 started proving that certain things
34:30 couldn't have happened now before that
34:33 there was you know all kinds of other
34:35 conspiracies JFK moon missions all kinds
34:37 of stuff Jimmy Hoffa whatever
34:40 Dorothy Kilgallen but now what's
34:43 happened
34:45 we've had a monumental coup from the
34:50 globalism and because America is such a
34:53 huge player economically in everything
34:55 which may change that like we don't give
34:59 a [ __ ]
34:59 honestly we can make every single thing
35:01 we need on this continent we have every
35:03 single resource that we need to make
35:06 televisions stereos cars military
35:09 everything we need to borrow anything
35:11 we got uranium trust me well we you know
35:14 whatever
35:15 but there's been a huge change in the
35:20 [ __ ] that's been going on all around
35:21 the world right and it's going in layers
35:24 and it's getting more and more complex
35:26 and sadly although thankfully darker
35:31 meaning the issues that we are fixing in
35:33 this planet are getting darker because
35:35 we're getting to the minutia the sludge
35:37 that is the black blood that runs
35:40 through people like Lady gaga
35:41 and John Podesta people go to spirit
35:44 cooking rituals bill look up Lady Gaga
35:48 and spirit cooking and tell me how she
35:49 should host the next Super Bowl halftime
35:51 you got to ditch these people by the way
35:54 let me just you know there's not going
35:56 to be a way I could put this in an
35:57 entire episode so let me make this very
35:59 clear you we have to ditch musicians and
36:04 celebrities of all kind actors that are
36:08 trying to perpetuate and sell out to
36:11 globalism they show up at these parties
36:15 they get in sights satanic rituals weird
36:19 you know just weird events that the
36:25 other photos taken it's crazy people who
36:28 criticize folks that are trying to help
36:30 the rest of the world starting with
36:32 their own country don't bother music
36:35 that I would even say D yourself a favor
36:39 and destroy their music you know the
36:42 Pharaohs had this philosophy that as
36:44 long as their name was spoken they still
36:46 lived in in reality so if we say you
36:50 know Ramses the first Ramses is still
36:52 life we say King Tut King Tesla but what
36:55 if we stop saying any of those words we
36:58 erase them
37:00 from the history of our world then they
37:03 cease to exist and their bad influence
37:05 goes away and as long as we carry the
37:09 lesson that we learned by their crappy
37:13 existence in our life meaning there used
37:16 to be people that used to act like this
37:17 and we got rid of them we didn't kill
37:20 them we didn't bury him in the ground
37:21 early or anything but we just basically
37:24 excommunicated them because they wanted
37:26 to turn the world into a piece of [ __ ]
37:29 they wanted to take away all of your
37:31 rights and make you the biggest slave on
37:34 planet Earth you lost your sovereignty
37:37 because of these people we did and
37:39 you're not living in that world but
37:42 hopefully we'll we will have figured out
37:44 ways to put in regulations to keep that
37:46 from happening right imagine a bunch of
37:49 artificial intelligence that preserves
37:51 freedom instead of taking it away what
37:54 if we built governments that actually
37:56 preserve freedom instead of taking it
37:58 away and what's beautiful about what's
38:01 going on right now is you have a bunch
38:03 of you know military guys that have
38:06 given their life for this or they have
38:09 they've given their lives in the way
38:11 that they're still alive that they've
38:12 sacrificed time they've seen their
38:13 friends die and
38:16 they're livid that someone like De Niro
38:24 could essentially you know pull down his
38:27 pants and take a huge crap on their
38:30 deeds
38:32 because that's what he does these guys
38:35 taking nice right what a [ __ ] joke
38:37 that is right you got these guys worth
38:40 hundreds of millions of dollars taking
38:41 these right mm-hmm
38:44 yeah tell me how brilliant this is you
38:46 have hundreds of millions of dollars you
38:48 could actually make a commercial with
38:50 your money
38:50 help it wouldn't have they could
38:52 probably get paid to make the commercial
38:54 they could actually exploit their own
38:55 [ __ ] agenda
38:58 but they take this silently because
39:00 really they have IQs the size of [ __ ]
39:02 acorns and so you don't really know what
39:04 they're doing they just want to be a
39:05 part of something that sounds profound
39:06 because [ __ ] man you know football in my
39:08 life it's not profound it is most it is
39:12 probably the most unprofessional a play
39:20 well with the politics of the world with
39:21 the people that want to see football
39:23 played instead of paraded around in some
39:26 political bunch of [ __ ] and so then
39:29 they shift it to something else that
39:30 they think matters what do you what do
39:33 you kneel in for well today it's because
39:35 lemonade doesn't have enough lemon in it
39:38 you know if you really cared you'd make
39:40 change happen and you would do through
39:42 some [ __ ] technique like taking a knee
39:46 right oh you controversial heavyweights
39:50 of society and then for every
39:52 Neanderthal who thinks they're gonna you
39:55 know muscle people like me into
39:58 submission there's a guy with the from
40:01 Delta Force that's got a [ __ ] laser
40:03 on your forehead so you just knock
40:04 yourself out
40:05 well the best ways you can affect change
40:08 to preserve your civil rights and
40:10 prevent slavery is to make every action
40:14 that is against your civil rights and
40:17 for slavery stick out like a sore thumb
40:22 all right that's pretty much the way you
40:23 can make effect change in anything in
40:25 life make it stick out you know imagine
40:30 if every parent slept with you know the
40:34 neighbors children know and they say we
40:37 have a pretty good era in society where
40:39 everyone's you know being honest about
40:41 it and they're protecting these children
40:43 all kinda stuff but then you have a John
40:45 Podesta coming in some Harvey Weinstein
40:49 coming in who and Harvey's never been
40:52 accused of the child thing but some
40:55 weirdo and he's taking advantage of this
40:58 moment to to do things he's not supposed
41:00 to do no we have a problem on our hands
41:03 well do you really need to sleep with
41:04 children no you don't you don't
41:09 so we all stopped we saw something we
41:12 don't need to be doing in the first
41:13 place another guy that does it or wants
41:17 to do it start sticking out like a sore
41:18 thumb really quickly when we can start
41:21 identifying the individuals that need to
41:23 change one of the things that pisses me
41:26 off about the Secret Service
41:30 is that you know we've had I think we're
41:34 up to at least a dozen blowhard
41:36 celebrities who have threatened to
41:38 either blow up the White House or they
41:40 have enacted in many ways Snoop Dogg
41:43 shooting Donald Trump with some faux gun
41:46 Kathy Griffin's you know holding a
41:48 severed head the president
41:51 and no one is getting put in jail all
41:56 right so when a bunch of crazies start
41:59 planning to kill the president for real
42:01 how do you discern the difference
42:03 between a Kathy Griffin whose careers
42:06 have been over for a really long time
42:07 and you know trying to pull a stunt here
42:11 and a kid who's really plotting to do it
42:14 some nutbag
42:17 well you said it was okay Secret Service
42:20 you said it was okay to threaten the
42:22 President of the United States and you
42:23 blow it off because you you think it's
42:26 not well Madonna's not really gonna blow
42:27 up the White House she's not really
42:28 gonna rig it with explosives and push a
42:30 plunger
42:31 yeah probably not but what if you gave
42:34 her a plunger and said you know she's in
42:37 upstate New York at some spirit cooking
42:39 ritual Lady Gaga and some elite guy
42:42 walks into illnesses you know it's funny
42:43 I
42:44 this plunger right here it just looks
42:45 like a toy it's actually rigged to the
42:47 White House you don't think Madonna
42:49 would turn that [ __ ] thing as quickly
42:51 as possible and high-five everyone in
42:54 the room
42:57 you're delusional if you don't think
42:59 that would happen in two seconds it's
43:02 really funny how the the old passages in
43:05 the Bible talk about you know times when
43:09 society had completely deteriorated and
43:11 God did a reset because everybody was
43:13 behaving just horribly we had lost track
43:17 of why we exist on this planet
43:19 you know raping and pillaging was not
43:22 even raping and pillaging it was just an
43:24 it was just a weekend even though it's a
43:28 very small group of society they get a
43:30 lot of press the folks that are trying
43:32 to make sure that your kids have no idea
43:34 what gender they are right they want
43:37 your kid as pregnant as fast as possible
43:39 in their life completely upside-down
43:41 they want to uneducated and dependent on
43:43 the state they like it that Mexico has
43:48 it been helped by a foreign country and
43:50 that these people have to migrate
43:52 because it's so messed up down there
43:55 they love it the Democrats love it they
43:57 get their voting base I think one of the
43:59 biggest problems with looking at the
44:01 history of freeing your country is that
44:03 there's bloodshed
44:04 there's effort there's risk and there's
44:07 loss
44:09 who the hell wants to read that manual
44:10 and accept that that's the way you're
44:13 gonna have to behave if you're to ever
44:15 give your children and all their
44:18 children down below a good life you can
44:22 actually have to nut up get organized
44:28 and coo coo slavery coup the
44:33 government's that would have you be in
44:35 some slave nation
44:37 one of the sad realities of the world is
44:39 that there are definitely more than a
44:41 dozen nations where the population has
44:43 been so dumbed down by its leaders
44:46 formerly not so dumb and they've been
44:49 dumbed down there's a big you know
44:50 Schwab of people here in America that
44:53 are getting very close to that level or
44:55 if they're not already there but they
44:57 don't have any idea how to run a country
45:00 this has happened several times over you
45:03 know in almost every major region I
45:06 think America is one of the only
45:08 countries because we were a late bloomer
45:09 built out of European intellectuals to
45:13 not have this problem but the Wild West
45:15 of America was very similar to this
45:17 people form towns I got a couple good
45:19 people and then the you know the
45:21 scallywags go in there and and they
45:23 start just dominating it with force you
45:26 know I come from Kansas be of Dodge City
45:27 which is more notorious than tombstone
45:30 tomb towns to tombstone ha toontown or
45:35 am I going was law of the jungle for a
45:37 little while when the rumored although
45:42 contradicted and not verified by a
45:44 single soul a statement of Donald Trump
45:47 saying [ __ ] for Haiti and and and a
45:50 couple countries in Africa which again
45:53 when I thought was very interesting
45:54 about this is one you have at least
45:55 three senators said they never heard
45:57 that in the room and you didn't have a
45:58 single Democrat in the room that
45:59 confirmed the other guy's claim which
46:01 would that be pretty easy fire to say it
46:04 three other people say I heard him say
46:05 you didn't hear a single person confirm
46:07 it but whatever most my friends are
46:10 hoping he did say it
46:13 I think it was a guy from Ghana
46:17 I could have the country wrong but an
46:19 african gentleman sat in his car who's
46:22 not an American citizen he is a very
46:23 profound African accent and he said you
46:26 know what my country is a [ __ ] and
46:29 he goes it needs to be recognized as a
46:31 [ __ ] because if it's not recognized
46:32 as a [ __ ] no one's gonna ever do
46:34 anything about it if you don't recognize
46:36 Haiti as a [ __ ] then who's gonna go
46:41 down to fix it the Hilary foundation
46:43 stole billions of dollars from them and
46:46 for those of you who missed it Haiti had
46:48 a big hurricane the hurricane destroyed
46:50 the crap out of that country it was
46:51 already horribly bad off it always has
46:53 been it's been it's been engineered to
46:56 be this way okay the Hilary Foundation
47:00 moved in and said give us all of the
47:02 billions of dollars worth of donations
47:04 to fix this place and we'll fix it up I
47:06 think they built six homes little tiny
47:10 shanty shacks and took the rest of the
47:12 money and ran with it and so the country
47:14 didn't receive any of the aid that was
47:17 given billions of dollars these people
47:20 would live in mobile homes they would
47:22 live in ten by ten shacks if it just had
47:24 a light and some plumbing the amount of
47:27 money they raised would have turned that
47:28 place into a true registered potentially
47:35 I don't wanna see necessarily
47:36 flourishing right away but it would have
47:38 been pining in the right direction
47:40 country
47:42 unbelievable now what I don't want to do
47:45 in this episode and I haven't done
47:46 hopefully is really just lecture you
47:48 about what you already know
47:50 the challenge of being a quote-unquote
47:54 first world citizen right now is that we
47:57 have so allowed the educational system
48:00 at least in America due to deteriorate
48:02 so badly that most of the protests that
48:05 have gone over the last two years I've
48:08 been jam-packed with these quote-unquote
48:10 students and graduates of college that
48:13 when you ask them why are you here they
48:17 can't give you any details they give you
48:20 you know slurs and name-calling they
48:24 have no idea why they're there they
48:26 don't like themselves in the mirror
48:28 because they have been completely
48:29 compromised by social conditioning you
48:33 know TMZ has been their church their
48:35 entire lifetimes right Instagram is
48:38 their world
48:39 they want something to change and they
48:41 know something is horribly wrong
48:44 but they're so absolutely uneducated
48:45 about anything and I mean anything that
48:49 they are being had by these cult leaders
48:53 like George Soros Hillary Clinton Bernie
48:57 Sanders into believing okay that their
49:03 captors are their saviors and their
49:06 saviors are their captors one cool thing
49:10 about smoking cigars I've said this a
49:12 couple times in different context but
49:15 so you go smoke a cigar at two o'clock
49:17 in the afternoon at a good smoke lounge
49:19 you are if there's anyone in the room
49:22 you usually not dealing with anyone
49:24 unemployed because the art costs too
49:26 much so usually in the room with fairly
49:29 successful business people taking a
49:31 break waiting for a phone call doing a
49:33 little bit of work on their laptop
49:35 before they go off to the next thing in
49:38 LA you're dealing with millionaires and
49:42 billionaires and I know money is been
49:45 this supposed
49:49 sort of oil and water thing between us
49:52 and society right here them and society
49:54 I should say right the one percenters
49:57 what you don't find is you know you
49:58 don't go into these smoke lounges to
50:00 find an English teacher in there who
50:02 knows how the world works one of the key
50:05 things that you can do and I've said
50:07 this once before is if you have someone
50:11 who is you know toting this fascism with
50:15 the t-shirt that says they're not a
50:16 fascist is ask him how a dollar bill is
50:20 created in the United States of America
50:22 how is it created how does it get value
50:24 what is the exchange a paperwork that
50:27 goes back and forth how has that dad
50:28 ever paid back they have no knowledge of
50:32 how the world works and I mean zero
50:35 and that's how slavery grows in the bad
50:38 way there's been this gigantic push for
50:41 you know equality for women and black
50:46 lives matter
50:49 and for the female side of it I just
50:51 recently heard this brilliant statement
50:54 which is if someone were to ask you do
50:56 you believe in equality for women you
50:58 have to say define equality you have to
51:03 define it oh well she does the same job
51:05 as a man hmm that's that's a
51:09 generalization does she have the same
51:11 exact experience can't you get it done
51:13 just as well as he would if that's the
51:15 case then absolutely in fact can she do
51:19 it better than he does wasn't perhaps
51:20 she should make more money than he does
51:22 it's all about making money if you work
51:24 for a company you were responsible for
51:27 making money either by saving money or
51:30 making money all right
51:34 let's just look at the bottom line how
51:36 do you affect the bottom line who cares
51:38 what's between your legs it doesn't
51:40 matter
51:41 equality shouldn't even come up what
51:44 gender you are it shouldn't come up
51:46 there are so many lies about the way
51:49 that the world used to work it's
51:51 ridiculous I've been talking to my
51:52 friends from Kansas and coming again
51:54 from a really small town what is
51:56 apparent and again
51:57 you know everyone in your hometown
51:59 almost and you know a lot of people from
52:01 all the surrounding towns you can walk
52:04 up to somebody from a town of 10,000
52:06 like mine
52:08 and say you know were the women
52:10 ceremoniously beaten by their wives back
52:12 in the day because that's what Hollywood
52:13 wants me to think were the women stupid
52:16 and weak no they weren't you can watch
52:22 shows on TV where you have normal people
52:27 I've been addicted to this old 50 showed
52:30 actually went way into the 60s called
52:32 what's my line and it it's not line as
52:36 in something you would say line is the
52:39 synonym for work what's your job what's
52:41 your trade today it would be called
52:43 what's my job and the way the show works
52:45 is you have these four sort of panelists
52:48 to female-to-male that's the formula and
52:51 then a random person comes out signs a
52:53 blackboard they say their name they get
52:55 a good look at them and the rules
52:57 matured over time but they they have to
53:00 guess that person's profession through
53:02 20 questions every time they force the
53:05 contestant to say no they flip this
53:08 little panel over and you have 10 knows
53:10 you can basically do 10 knows and then
53:12 the panelists loose so they can get it
53:14 before 10 knows so someone asks a
53:16 question question question it's yes yes
53:17 yes yes yes they can keep asking
53:19 questions
53:22 Dorothy Kilgallen and I forgot the other
53:25 lady's name were on the show almost from
53:28 start to finish Dorothy was murdered
53:30 because she was a journalist and
53:31 uncovered some stuff they're probably
53:33 gonna do a show on everyone who's ever
53:35 been famously murdered because they were
53:39 smart and uncovered something it's gonna
53:41 go all over time it's gonna go between
53:43 genders it's gonna be pretty interesting
53:45 my point mentioning this show is that
53:48 the contestants that come on that are
53:50 female they're trying to hide what they
53:53 do for a living and then the two women
53:55 that are always rotated through the show
53:57 or always at least up until 65 when it
54:00 was all in black and white are see lost
54:02 the patent in black and white on the 65
54:04 and see start seeing Gilligan's Island
54:06 turning to color and all that kind of
54:07 stuff
54:09 they're brilliant women and they're the
54:12 exact kind of women that were in my
54:14 family all over my town my first job
54:18 first software job in California the CEO
54:20 was a woman and we had 40% women in the
54:23 company and they all held senior
54:25 positions senior coding positions senior
54:27 sales and marketing it's been made an
54:31 issue to distract you from the human
54:34 civil rights the human pay structure
54:37 right everyone's worried about a woman
54:40 getting the same money as a man well how
54:42 about just humanity making a living wage
54:45 to hear some goddamn celebrity go up and
54:50 grab a piece of gold for some you know
54:53 performance they did reading someone
54:55 else's lines right they get all the
54:56 credit for the director the special
54:59 effects the lines that were written for
55:01 them their wardrobe they're getting the
55:02 full gamut of credit for a bunch of
55:06 stuff they have nothing to do with and
55:07 then they get their performance credit
55:10 telling you how the world works
55:13 when they no longer know what anything
55:15 costs in this planet besides their 14
55:17 million dollar home
55:20 I don't fear any one of the listeners of
55:22 this show being addicted to that but
55:25 it's something we have to remind people
55:26 of black lives matter all right
55:30 I haven't I mean I live in an area
55:33 that's predominantly white I hang out
55:36 with white people and I hang out with
55:39 everybody but I I spend plenty of time
55:41 in closed doors with white people
55:46 and I'm not sitting in a pool of people
55:49 going well everything was good until
55:51 that black person showed up make it say
55:55 that to me they could if they wanted to
55:56 I don't hear that I have to go all the
55:59 way to the Midwest and find some guy in
56:00 his [ __ ] 60s to hear a statement like
56:03 that and he's like the one weird guy in
56:05 the whole town that says something like
56:06 that the blacks in America I think
56:09 represent what something like 11 percent
56:12 of this country
56:14 now I want you to pick any time of day
56:16 in primetime on television cruise
56:20 through the channels write down the sex
56:24 and the race of every person on TV
56:26 especially go through the sports games
56:29 right it's a little bit of basketball
56:31 football baseball and write down
56:34 everyone's race and gender
56:37 everyone on TV is making a damn good
56:40 living trust me and tell me if you don't
56:43 have more than eleven percent of the
56:45 people you see on TV being black or some
56:50 other race right if this is such a huge
56:54 upside down poundcake of racism in this
56:58 country then why is that the case why
57:01 isn't basketball still a white sport
57:03 right why is it music all white it's not
57:12 it's a distraction so that they can go
57:16 around the crowd fighting each other
57:18 these two people finding each of these
57:20 two groups fighting each other
57:21 scapegoating all of their personal
57:23 problems again something phantom and
57:27 find out that everyone in the room of
57:30 every race and every gender no matter
57:33 how bent your gender might be you've
57:35 lost all your rights because you were
57:38 paying attention to the wrong target do
57:41 we have racism yes of course we do is it
57:45 more cultural based yes as we melt our
57:48 pots together the cultures melt together
57:50 and we have less cultural differences
57:52 right you always give black guys a
57:54 problem and I haven't seen this in black
57:57 females but you know if a black guy
57:59 becomes a cop a police officer law
58:01 enforcement guy and he starts to abide
58:04 by the rules of the state and starts to
58:06 serve and protect he'll get a lot of
58:08 Uncle Tom comments from his fellow black
58:10 people even white person well that's the
58:13 widest black guy I ever met that's like
58:14 this little sort of backhanded you know
58:18 insult being penalized because he no
58:20 longer whether or not he ever did it
58:23 changed his cultural alignment to a
58:25 different culture than the one perhaps
58:27 he was born in or the one that's more
58:28 typical in their particular race
58:32 he's being penalized for potentially
58:35 upgrading you know getting out of the
58:39 ghetto not protecting a street block
58:41 because you sell drugs on it you know
58:44 again I grew up in a rib joint where I
58:49 was one of the only white kids in the
58:50 whole room and there were no kids that
58:53 was a weird thing there was all grown
58:55 black men playing billiards the amount
58:59 of wisdom in that room was off the chain
59:03 there was no stereotypical stuff going
59:07 on at all that I remember right and I
59:11 remember being there quite a bit we're
59:14 in a very very exciting time in history
59:16 right now the sovereignty is something
59:19 that we even know like when I was
59:21 honestly I mean I probably completed my
59:24 20s without knowing what the word
59:27 sovereignty meant I didn't know what
59:31 tyranny meant serfdom I didn't know what
59:35 these words meant so how the hell could
59:37 I have a consciousness that would defend
59:40 it and these protests that are going on
59:43 all over the United States of America
59:45 are devoid of these terms
59:49 the fact that they were actually George
59:51 sorro's and his moveon.org with the help
59:53 of Bernie and Hillary were able to form
59:55 a gigantic collective of kids that are
59:58 fighting for pure fascism naming
60:02 themselves as the European Organization
60:03 called an Tifa NT fascism is [ __ ]
60:08 hilarious and also sort of disturbing at
60:11 the same time but because they are a
60:13 tiny little collective that happens to
60:15 get a lot of press from the fake news we
60:17 feel like they're held a lot bigger than
60:18 they are
60:19 there are a tiny [ __ ] dot on a tiny
60:21 [ __ ] dot trust me
60:24 now promise that would end on the straw
60:26 men and I'll probably do a whole episode
60:28 on this but let me give you a bit of the
60:30 precursor and a bunch of you already
60:32 know this and if you think I'm skipping
60:34 stuff you better believe I know I'm
60:36 skipping stuff and when we do a full
60:38 Episode on it we're gonna get into it in
60:40 a heavy way one of the legal constructs
60:44 that is used to control your life is
60:46 that when you're born you're the
60:49 sovereign being right you're a baby in
60:52 this world as much as you have parents
60:55 and they are responsible for you and
60:57 legally until you're 18 before your
61:00 birth certificate is signed you are the
61:04 most free creature on this planet and no
61:06 agency in the world perceptively legally
61:09 has any connection to you at all until
61:12 your name is written on a birth
61:13 certificate in all caps
61:16 I was born in Germany on I'm on an army
61:18 base and an Air Force Base and
61:24 Margaret Thatcher was stamped on my
61:29 birth certificate matter of fact and I
61:32 have a big pyramid with us you know
61:34 seeing I on the top of it because that's
61:35 how they built those birth certificates
61:38 it was actually processed through the
61:39 state of California
61:42 which means I have a California social
61:44 security number just kind of funny
61:45 considering I finally moved here
61:47 we have a legal entity that's created in
61:50 your on your behalf that then you are
61:52 sort of unvoluntary assigned to take
61:55 care of that entity on paper the reason
61:58 why your name is in all caps is that
62:00 anything in the legal document in all
62:01 caps is considered a legal entity
62:05 you'll find this in all contracts where
62:08 you're reading a paragraph at the top of
62:09 a contract and the participating parties
62:12 are all in caps and then they are
62:14 aliased to mix character things that
62:17 will be referred to later in the
62:18 document it's legally aliasing you know
62:21 a smaller thing that way they can create
62:24 boiler plates so they don't have to
62:26 write your name and every paragraph
62:27 every time you're referenced right it
62:28 says client or vendor or whatever
62:31 but this has carried your entire life
62:33 this is carried into your driver's
62:35 license social security number
62:37 every time you buy property every time
62:40 you engage the state on any level or the
62:42 government you are this legal entity you
62:46 for those of you've never heard of this
62:47 you might find it really fascinating
62:48 that we we live in the United States of
62:51 America Corporation all in caps that the
62:54 Supreme Court is ruling from some bylaws
62:58 which are basically made-up rules that
63:01 govern a corporation like if you created
63:03 a bakery and you call it best best
63:06 pastries on earth Inc it's all in caps
63:10 you then have to you then have the
63:12 option of writing a bunch of rules of
63:13 how your company is run you have to wear
63:15 red shirts and blue white pants and you
63:17 have to be is that the other thing if
63:20 you're if you have shares in the company
63:21 and you're you die your wife or your
63:24 husband only gets certain access to
63:27 those shares and blah blah blah then you
63:29 sign the dotted line you agree to follow
63:30 those rules so every single entity in
63:34 the world every state city county fire
63:38 department library all have corporations
63:42 that govern them and it's to turn them
63:44 all into legal entities so they can be
63:46 controlled by this grand corporation the
63:51 Supreme Court which we go to as the
63:52 final finale of any final litigation in
63:55 America rules down in in the layman's
63:59 mind from the Constitution down to us to
64:02 say this is constitutional this is
64:03 unconstitutional okay what they are
64:07 really doing is they are employees of
64:09 the District of Columbia which is its
64:12 own sovereign country just like the
64:13 Vatican
64:15 and just like I believe Buckingham
64:17 Palace or what have you there's a little
64:19 sovereign piece of land over there which
64:21 means has its own rules but they're
64:23 actually not ruling from the
64:24 Constitution down to you they're at the
64:28 level where they follow the bylaws of
64:30 the United States of America Corporation
64:33 which could give a [ __ ] about the
64:35 Constitution they are interpreting your
64:39 life down there as it relates to the
64:43 Constitution that you accept as your
64:45 rules of how you think you should be
64:47 living your life and that's why crazy
64:51 things happen in the world where people
64:54 get away scot-free because there's legal
64:56 precedents to protect these individuals
64:58 right I've said it a couple times you
65:02 know the Queen of England cannot have
65:03 legally any charges put against her it's
65:09 illegal you can't do it
65:12 hmmm interesting those four I think the
65:17 whole royal family sir they'll parade
65:20 around some things out there to make you
65:22 feel like people are getting prosecuted
65:23 but that's all just a show to make you
65:25 feel like you're sticking it to the man
65:27 but they're not they will do their own
65:31 punishment if you embarrass the family
65:33 you run off with a bunch of little girls
65:34 to Monaco like with the relatives of the
65:37 Windsor Fran we did it'll say you made
65:40 us look bad we're taking away your money
65:42 we're taking away your authority you
65:44 don't get the mansion anymore for maybe
65:46 a year or two or maybe your whole life
65:47 you really did a really bad thing so
65:50 it's not like they're completely
65:51 escaping it but if I wanted to just blow
65:53 the whole thing off they could and the
65:54 people unless they rise up and gain
65:57 sovereignty and really enforce some
65:59 rights all the way across the board of
66:02 humanity about allowing one last name to
66:04 change someone's privileges in this
66:06 world right it's gonna continue to be
66:09 this way and one more thing on this kind
66:12 of faux note because this is another
66:14 subject that's real important to me and
66:16 you see it all the time and it's not
66:18 enough to put a whole episode on top of
66:20 it this is one you need to learn and
66:23 when you need to pass around to your
66:24 friends these Senate hearings that are
66:27 going on in America right now to try and
66:29 find all the corruption in our
66:30 three-letter agencies when they bring
66:34 someone in like for instance the woman
66:36 that ran the IRS and did a bunch of sort
66:40 of predatorial things using the IRS to
66:43 go after the tea party and everyone is
66:45 Republican and everybody that you know
66:47 it was basically against the current
66:48 administration and that woman goes in
66:50 there and boy they breed her the right
66:52 act and they she I think she pleads the
66:55 fifth like 50 times you know when you
66:59 watch trey Gowdy go after that guy's a
67:01 monster

67:14 been pulling probably since the McCarthy
67:18 era McCarthy was serious he was trying
67:21 to put people in jail right and little
67:24 the whole time I was growing up as a
67:26 child I was a nut case and then later I

67:31 time but they pull people in and they
67:34 yell at them on c-span
67:37 and you watch it in your you feel
67:39 vindicated in your heart like oh my god

69:16 out this episode when Donald Trump
69:18 became president a bunch of my friends
69:20 you know who are absolutely the voids of
69:23 intellectual ''tis going to take us back
69:26 40 years
69:28 I guess they were referring to like
69:30 segregation and racism and all those
69:33 other crazy stuff when the guy employs
69:34 more minorities in the United States of
69:36 America is a single business owner than
69:40 any other human being in the entire
69:41 country okay and they loved him by way
69:46 I remember America 40 years ago hell I'd
69:50 say take us back 60 years let's go let's
69:54 go seven years back let's go back to the
69:56 1950s right after a rock and roll was
69:57 invented because we had single income
70:01 households every kid got a degree in a
70:04 trade skill that was immediately
70:05 employable and yet those degrees don't
70:07 necessarily work today in the age of
70:09 robots and computers but we'll just find
70:11 the ones that do and yank all this other
70:13 crap out of there
70:15 so spare me spare me the attempt to be
70:19 deep you have no [ __ ] clue what
70:22 you're talking about if that's the kind
70:24 of thing you're saying proverbially
70:26 talking to around you to the people that
70:28 you have to listen to on a daily basis
70:30 this country was amazing and it got so
70:34 amazing the Europe moved in in the 70s
70:38 and destroyed our education system go
70:40 read the book the deliberate dumbing
70:42 down of America by Charlotte is Ruby her
70:45 father was the skullenbones guy she saw
70:47 all the corruption on a family level
70:49 could not handle it and she got out of
70:52 it as soon as she was sentient of it
70:56 she tried to warn us and the the
71:00 deliberate dumbing down of America is a
71:02 huge reengineering of the educational
71:06 system in America to destroy the family
71:08 to destroy education to destroy small
71:11 towns by moving big giant corporations
71:13 in like Walmart's and destroying all the
71:15 merchants sales that were going on
71:16 taking the money out of America and
71:18 sending it to European banking cartels
71:20 instead of leaving it in the small
71:22 little town because everyone could
71:23 resell shoes and boots and groceries my
71:27 little town was the most thriving Norman
71:30 Rockwell painting you have ever seen in
71:32 your life
71:34 and now it struggles it has plenty of
71:37 citizens that have no clue what's going
71:39 on and they they like the Walmart page
71:42 and they they they say you don't rhyme
71:44 such a douche
71:46 not knowing anything about the Podesta
71:48 brothers about the huge body count and
71:52 the Clinton family
71:53 Seth Rich being murdered

72:09 this month excuse me is the calm before
72:11 the storm and let's hope that storm is
72:14 ferocious in the name of your
72:17 sovereignty and your civil rights
72:21 because we're all going to be slaves to
72:23 something
72:25 but let us just let it be the personal
72:28 endeavors of our of our heed our insides
