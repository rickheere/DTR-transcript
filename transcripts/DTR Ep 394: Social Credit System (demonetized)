00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen oh what a beautiful day here
00:38 in Southern California
00:39 we got no clouds to rain tomorrow but my
00:43 god you wouldn't know so today we're
00:47 gonna talk about this new Chinese social
00:50 credit system social rating system
00:54 because it is sort of scary we live in a
00:59 world now where trends of the way that
01:01 people find their value and they find it
01:05 really quickly right we've always had
01:07 trends but now it's out of control and
01:11 you know trends really are sort of the
01:13 poor man's idea of being cool you know
01:17 they can't think of anything of their
01:18 own so they trend they go who's doing
01:22 and then they run off and copy someone
01:24 else and you become a complete [ __ ]
01:27 tool really really quickly and the funny
01:30 thing is is that you have individuals
01:34 that will group together because they're
01:38 so undereducated non create uncreated or
01:40 whatever non creative living in their
01:43 cell phones student [ __ ] so the crap
01:45 that they just sort of like all the
01:47 losers get together okay you know it's
01:52 almost like watching the Titanic sink
01:54 and then you're on a different ship and
01:57 you got a bunch of life you know life
01:58 savers and life vests and floaty things
02:01 and you're like okay let's get them out
02:04 of the ocean holy crap you know only one
02:07 to have any fatalities or harm but the
02:12 reason why I'm going off on that just a
02:14 little bit right here at the beginning
02:15 of a social rating system is that that
02:18 is the group of people that are going to
02:22 [ __ ] all of us with this social rating
02:24 system they're just people who hang on
02:28 to the tail in front of them and the
02:30 problem is is if you allow those
02:32 individuals to make up your society as a
02:34 whole and all societies have a lot of
02:37 these people
02:39 then your society collapses because
02:42 those individuals have really no
02:44 knowledge of how to exist because all
02:47 they do is copy the person in front of
02:48 them well eventually they demonize the
02:52 person in front of them because that's
02:53 the leader and they don't get along with
02:57 leaders they get along with followers
02:58 and so they kill off the brain nervous
03:02 system of their very existence and
03:04 ecosystem therefore losing all of the
03:08 talents of how to do something and I'm
03:11 afraid the China who is pushing this
03:16 [ __ ] on their people and I do not
03:18 approve of it because China is a
03:21 communist ik regime it's a dictatorship
03:25 and they're already using this rating
03:28 system to silence their dissenters so
03:32 about them we're back to Mount Saint
03:33 Tong [ __ ] where they're killing off
03:36 all the intellectuals in the entire
03:37 country which stunts the entire country
03:41 that's what matsing Tong did he became
03:45 the dictator the single leader that was
03:47 okay to follow it he you know again he
03:51 had the landlord's murdered and then he
03:53 had the intellectuals murdered Pol Pot
03:57 had everybody cut cut down and had
03:59 glasses I mean you get this has been a
04:02 huge trend in history kill off any one
04:06 who could descend against you kill
04:07 anyone that says you don't have any
04:09 clothes on and then you get to do all
04:11 this weird stuff but now the social
04:14 rating system is you know officially on
04:19 the books it's only happening in China
04:22 unofficially the globalists are trying
04:26 to push it into the minds of all of our
04:28 kids they're trying to sell it as some
04:30 Robin Hood and formula of like don't you
04:32 want everyone to be nice what if we just
04:34 kept track of who's nice and he was bad
04:36 yeah and you know the idiots are like
04:38 yeah after 18 I mean kids you can't
04:40 blame them because they don't know
04:41 anything better but an adult should be
04:43 able to look at this and go oh right and
04:46 when that journalist reports against the
04:48 government because the government is
04:50 screwing these citizens what happens to
04:52 that
04:53 reading it'll be interesting to see if
04:56 the Chinese ever wake up to the point
04:59 where they actually rate someone up for
05:01 reporting corruption in the government
05:03 thus giving them more privileges instead
05:05 of left with less privileges because
05:07 right now there's a guy in house arrest
05:09 over there there's probably thousands of
05:12 people in this situation but there's a
05:13 guy over there that reported on bribery
05:16 bribery is one of the worst problems
05:18 inside the country of China and it's
05:21 probably a situation all over the United
05:23 States we see all these you know
05:25 smollett [ __ ] get off right you
05:27 know they literally arrange two guys to
05:30 beat him up and and yell a bunch of
05:32 racist stuff they drag all these cops
05:33 into this search for these two white
05:36 guys with Magga hats on turns out it's
05:38 too like gigantic Jamaican dudes beat
05:39 him up and when they have all the proof
05:42 of the fact it's mullet
05:44 did this this George Soros chick lets
05:50 him off and everyone just sort of wipes
05:54 their hands I mean I hope that they can
05:55 go back and nail this guy hugely nail
06:00 everybody involved with that so we got
06:03 issues all over the place but now
06:04 imagine that's sort of pay-to-play
06:07 mentality that were too rich to fail
06:10 right we're too powerful to ever have to
06:13 follow the rules [ __ ] is then self
06:17 controlled by the rating system this is
06:20 a literally one of the most incredible
06:23 pornographic wet dreams of the
06:25 globalists to have social rating
06:27 dominate the world it is going to be
06:29 literally the bane and in the the single
06:34 thing that we need to fight the most in
06:36 this world at least the way that it is
06:39 being implemented and I don't think
06:41 there's any way that you can implement
06:42 technology to enforce privilege that
06:45 can't be corrupted by the few ever it
06:50 just will not be possible if we can
06:54 create an AI that we could seriously you
06:57 know just surrender the whole world to
06:58 and the AI is good and it's got all this
07:01 stuff I mean Jesus so many thousands of
07:03 years away were we from that right Rick
07:07 you've been under a rock and you haven't
07:08 been paying attention you the whole time
07:10 you're going what the hell's this guy
07:11 talking about I mean it sounds
07:12 interesting but I have no idea what he's
07:13 talking about here's what I'm talking
07:15 about
07:15 this was portrayed in a black mirror
07:18 because they simply read the press and
07:21 it's been portrayed in a Norwell episode
07:23 but it's it's a new application on your
07:26 cell phone it's also physical people on
07:29 the ground and it's also a cloud
07:30 computer system owned by the Chinese
07:32 government
07:33 what they're doing is ranking individual
07:39 behavior either up or down and based on
07:43 you getting an up vote you get
07:45 privileges too many downs you have all
07:48 your privileges taken away what do I
07:51 mean by privileges I mean you can't
07:54 travel outside your town your block your
07:57 neighborhood your country you can't
08:00 travel on a subway you can't buy a plane
08:02 ticket you can't get a rent-a-car you
08:05 can't buy certain food well what could
08:09 justify this negative thing you buy too
08:12 much alcohol at once wonder how do you
08:16 throw a party at your house without
08:18 buying alcohol if that's what kind of
08:21 party you're having just even an
08:22 intellectual party your bio and all the
08:25 mixer's stuff all the core drinks how do
08:30 you do that but there was a documentary
08:32 that will someone post it on our page
08:34 like it might have been Tim on our
08:37 Facebook page which is locked go to deep
08:40 thoughts radio com2 get in there just
08:42 make sure you answer the question say
08:44 something human otherwise you're banned
08:46 for life no exceptions but it was a
08:50 three-part documentary there was a the
08:55 first group was a woman who works for
08:57 the state and she is all for the social
09:02 rating system social credit system I got
09:06 keep saying credit here then the second
09:08 guy is the dude on house arrest because
09:09 he's a journalist who has a history of
09:12 exposing bribery in the country and for
09:16 those of you haven't done business with
09:18 China or in China
09:20 you have to understand that bribery in
09:22 China is the most unbelievably
09:26 bold-faced thing that they require that
09:28 you do in order to get anything done I
09:30 mean it is it is absolutely a mainstay
09:35 you want to open a company there you
09:38 want to get them to manufacture
09:39 something someone is bribing someone to
09:43 get this stuff to go through all permits
09:46 are absolute bribery first then official
09:49 cost second it's just the way it is and
09:50 everybody agrees to it and instead of
09:53 just formalizing some sort of payment
09:55 system
09:56 you know that's aboveboard it's like
09:58 okay this isn't really bribery anymore
09:59 but we just required that you pay me for
10:01 my time to listen to your [ __ ] and
10:03 then I get you whatever permits you have
10:05 and that's another charge I'm just a
10:08 consultant to get you that thing it's
10:10 all bribery I mean it would be like the
10:12 United States where all the mobsters
10:14 used to pay off the judges and have all
10:16 the jurors scared to death it's just
10:19 like that in China constantly very very
10:22 very corrupt right and so this is the
10:25 group of people building this system
10:26 just just so we're clear about this the
10:29 criminals are building the system so the
10:32 third get second guy was this journalist
10:34 who's now an under house arrest which
10:36 and China basically means that you can
10:39 move around in a really small area it
10:42 almost looks like he gets about a city
10:44 block that he can move around and he
10:45 lives in sort of looks like he lives on
10:48 a high-rise of some sort and in the
10:51 third guy is actually very surprising to
10:55 me which I didn't realize there's a huge
10:56 Turkish community in western China and
10:59 he's a Turkish descent lived in the city
11:02 that was actually Ram sacked by the
11:04 system and there was a bunch of
11:06 prejudice and repression and just
11:09 absolutely draconian racism racist stuff
11:13 going on and we'll defend that in
11:15 China's position in a second on that he
11:18 moved out of country before this thing
11:21 really started to
11:22 to have a long-term effect on he and his
11:24 family now Before we jump into the
11:27 specifics of this documentary which is
11:29 sort of gonna be the framework of this
11:31 episode I need you to understand that
11:34 it's starting to happen here in the
11:36 United States of America wikipedia has
11:39 some paragraphs about how it's spreading
11:42 in Germany and Spain and England and a
11:46 few other places so definitely go up
11:48 there and take a look because honestly
11:52 out of all the agendas in the world this
11:54 is one of the top brand new agendas that
11:57 is going to threaten the very safety of
12:00 freedom on this planet because it is
12:03 going to disguise itself just like
12:04 Christianity did right rome was about to
12:07 fall because rome didn't have enough
12:08 military centuries to put into every
12:10 town to extort taxes and beat the [ __ ]
12:13 out of local citizens and so they
12:15 resurrected this old archetype of the
12:18 virgin birth death and resurrection
12:20 story called it Jesus and then had Jesus
12:24 say in the Bible give on to Caesar we're
12:26 gonna give unto Rome what his new room
12:28 we're givin to Caesar what it's to
12:29 Caesar all that kind of [ __ ] and so they
12:31 convinced tried to convince you know
12:34 Europe that they should tax themselves
12:36 and send the money to Rome without
12:37 centuries being present when they didn't
12:39 want to do that they gathered up a ton
12:42 of cash that they were collecting from
12:44 local regions and then paid for
12:45 mercenaries to go out there and start
12:47 the Inquisition's for 900 [ __ ] years
12:49 forcing this religion into people's
12:52 minds so that they did it's almost a
12:54 thousand years people think about it
12:55 America is not even remotely 900 years
12:58 old and if you think of 1776 God were
13:02 nothing this Inquisition went on for
13:05 nine hundred years because the church
13:06 knew they were full of [ __ ] and they
13:08 made all this crap up and they just
13:09 repressed Europe into giving Rome all
13:11 that money you wonder why they can
13:14 launder pedophiles forever you paid for
13:17 it Rome I mean you paid for Europe you
13:19 paid for the whole thing my relatives
13:20 paid for it
13:21 you know Italy it's on your soil meet
13:24 your God with a clear conscience get rid
13:26 of that place clocks a-tickin
13:30 so this social rating system is a way to
13:34 smuggle in globalist big bro
13:37 control as the thing that the people
13:39 want because they found this little nook
13:42 and cranny about how we actually behave
13:45 in the public without this system and
13:48 they are using it as the sheep's
13:54 clothing around the wolf now the first
13:57 woman they talk to in this documentary
13:58 which I I don't know if it's a vice
13:59 documentary just go to our Facebook and
14:02 you can scroll down a little bit and
14:03 you'll find it was the woman that works
14:06 for the country and she is just loves it
14:09 man she is but she's also just sitting
14:11 there you could just see the tenseness
14:13 in her body as she is trying to make
14:18 sure she says all the right things so
14:20 that she doesn't go to jail that night I
14:22 mean it's already you could just if you
14:24 have any ability to read a human
14:26 reactions she's got it she's living in a
14:32 prison planet convincing herself that
14:36 she is free but what she says at the
14:41 very beginning is going to be the line
14:42 you're gonna hear as they try to smuggle
14:46 this [ __ ] into our country every country
14:49 she says look society has used a social
14:52 rating system slash credit system in
14:56 fact it's been called a credit system I
14:57 think is hilarious but we've been doing
14:59 this for ever since man existed we find
15:01 out that guy's a jerk that girls of
15:03 whatever and then we don't associate
15:06 with those people until they clean up
15:08 their act okay your face value you're
15:13 like well yeah you guess you're right
15:15 but at the same time what's interesting
15:18 about it is that is what we've been
15:21 doing and it's been working great so we
15:23 don't need to digitize the whole
15:24 experience but in that social system
15:28 that she is referring to prior to the
15:30 digitization of the whole event we
15:32 choose the rules we choose how intense
15:35 the punishment is not a couple [ __ ]
15:38 at the top who say in order to protect
15:40 my corruption my lifelong presidency my
15:45 lifelong you know government
15:48 participation in
15:50 bribery but bribery is bad because
15:54 you're not just paying for legitimate
15:56 services with bribery you can pay for
15:58 illegitimate services for bribery hey I
16:01 want those kids kidneys well you mind if
16:04 I kill him and take his kidneys well
16:05 course not that's a kid well here's a
16:07 bribe oh well yeah there he is right
16:09 there go kill him
16:10 that's how bad bribes get once you sell
16:15 out for money and unfortunately the age
16:17 of community prioritizes money over love
16:19 it's it's it's crazy once an Asian
16:22 community comes over here and lives and
16:24 breathes they start to switch they start
16:26 to switch the American Way or the
16:27 European Way or the rest of the world
16:29 wait I don't know what it is but they
16:31 eventually get to a point where it's
16:33 it's just I love you dad me too dead or
16:35 done but I've got too many friends over
16:38 here here first generation and they
16:40 literally live in that bubble where in
16:42 order to impress their parents it's
16:44 money money money money so once you live
16:48 for money bribes can buy anything right
16:50 sad but true
16:52 and I just got the balls to say it so go
16:56 ahead and shave me
16:57 see if I give a [ __ ] mm-hmm but that's
17:02 okay that's how their culture built up
17:03 it's a much it's a completely
17:06 overpopulated country at one point four
17:08 billion so they've got problems that we
17:10 don't have over there so this woman I
17:14 think is looking at it and the
17:15 government's looking and the kids are
17:17 looking at it everybody who's sort of
17:18 has good intentions with the system and
17:21 they're saying look we got 1.4 billion
17:22 people it's hard to keep track of
17:25 everybody and so we need a system to
17:28 keep everybody in check otherwise will
17:30 devolve back down to caveman era because
17:32 we can't control everybody now what you
17:35 have to understand too is it's not just
17:37 an app on your phone
17:39 China has over 200 million cameras
17:43 installed in China and these cameras
17:48 have all kinds of facial recognition
17:51 body recognition chip recognition
17:55 they'll identify your phone using GPS so
17:58 if they can't figure out who your face
17:59 is but you're carrying a phone and it
18:02 says this zone zone by
18:03 whatever and he's a 5 foot 8 male China
18:08 Chinese man who's got you know general
18:12 type of build and it's being held by a
18:14 guy that looks like that they'll just
18:15 immediately say we think he's here but
18:17 if it's held by a little girl because
18:18 mom you know dad loaned his phone to his
18:20 daughter it'll start trying to reconcile
18:22 family members and all kinds of wild
18:24 stuff it's going to get intense but it's
18:28 already intense over there once a system
18:31 like this gets in place and turns on and
18:34 all other e-commerce and government
18:38 services are attached to the backbone
18:40 the cloud backbone the database it's
18:43 basically just a database on a computer
18:44 that you don't know that's what we call
18:47 cloud you won't be able to buy a ticket
18:50 to on us on a bullet train a cab you
18:54 won't be able to get a hotel you won't
18:56 be able to check into a restaurant or
18:57 whatever because all of these systems
19:00 will have to do a check first to see if
19:03 they can sell you the bills those are
19:05 the goods and services off the global
19:07 database if that database were to go
19:10 down the internet has a little burp no
19:13 one will be able to do anything besides
19:16 perhaps do it cash but then if there's a
19:19 bunch of laws to say if you serve
19:21 someone with a low credit you're going
19:24 to jail then no one can eat in the
19:26 neighborhood because the restaurant
19:28 doesn't want to take the risk that
19:30 someone is smuggling a bad credit system
19:34 with a fake app that might just have
19:36 like you know 750 on it and they're
19:40 really at like 540 is interesting they
19:44 do at 800 point credit system in most of
19:47 China but later we're going to talk
19:50 about what they're doing in western
19:51 China because what they're doing there
19:52 is wild and I recorded this entire
19:57 episode and then I met a contact here
20:01 locally that's has spent a year over
20:04 there and he's filled me on some
20:06 different things and so I decided to
20:11 rerecord this but China has issues that
20:14 no one knows about
20:18 let's solicitous myth a few myths that
20:20 I've had dismissed to me
20:22 number one myth is that China has ever
20:25 had a single born or you know single
20:29 child policy that is the line of
20:31 [ __ ] they told the rest of the world
20:33 how the hell do you think they put
20:34 another half a billion people in their
20:36 population after telling us they had a
20:38 limit one-child policy means you are
20:43 reducing your world population they have
20:45 done nothing more than increased the
20:46 world population thus burdening the
20:48 planet with their existence not being
20:51 responsible I talked to my friends from
20:54 China and they said look nobody has that
20:59 limitation on their family they said the
21:01 only people that have that limitation
21:03 are government workers which there are a
21:05 lot they said if you have a second child
21:07 you pay about a hundred and fifty dollar
21:09 fine and then you're fine we we take our
21:12 kids and smuggle them around to the
21:13 grandparents so that no one knows the
21:15 kid even exists until they get older but
21:20 there's no penalties there's never been
21:22 a limit to the amount of people that you
21:24 can have in China all these stories
21:27 about taking girls out and slaughtering
21:29 them it's all [ __ ] for the Western
21:31 world to belief again they're 1.4 it
21:35 wasn't it yesterday they were 1.1
21:38 there's a lot of talk you know that
21:40 they're moving to a more in a free
21:42 market system which is fantastic a more
21:45 capitalistic government which is again
21:47 capitalism is you have an idea for a
21:50 business but you don't have the money
21:51 so someone capitalizes your company and
21:53 your idea in exchange they get a share
21:57 of your company that's all capitalism is
21:59 what are you gonna do you don't have the
22:01 money to do it so nut up and save up if
22:05 you hate capitalism because that's
22:07 something we're gonna start your
22:08 business but if you need to ten million
22:09 dollars and you're just some
22:11 fourteen-year-old kid in the Midwest and
22:13 you know that there's someone else is
22:14 going to figure out your idea in five
22:15 years you better borrow money you're
22:17 never gonna have the opportunity to do
22:19 anything it's just the way the world
22:22 works and then when you sacrifice a few
22:24 of your good ideas and you give up some
22:26 shares maybe even 50% maybe even more
22:28 than that
22:29 but you make a few million bucks then
22:31 you boil that five you know that a
22:32 couple million bucks to five to ten then
22:34 you're the old guy vesting a new ideas
22:37 do you want to be big big and moral and
22:40 all this other stuff than fine give away
22:41 more your money doesn't matter the air
22:44 in Shanghai is so bad and the
22:48 construction is generally so bad that
22:51 the individual I talked to you said that
22:53 even though you're inside buildings
22:55 they're not sealed from the outside very
22:57 well so he said he woke up in his
22:59 apartment which was a fairly nice
23:01 apartment which had an exterior window
23:04 inside if his interior walls like that
23:06 gets great so between two bedrooms they
23:08 had an external window inside I think I
23:10 mentioned that previous episode but he
23:12 said he woke up and he couldn't breathe
23:13 his air was so bad he's inside his place
23:16 he said he had to get his emergency
23:18 oxygen mask and and attach it to his
23:20 face for five hours just to feel normal
23:24 so that's our big eco-friendly partner
23:28 named China which is supposedly I think
23:32 they're number one in world pollution
23:33 and the United States is supposed to be
23:35 number two which is a joke because
23:37 there's no place in America where you
23:38 need an oxygen mask to survive
23:40 I heard Tokyo is cleaning up too but
23:43 they had that oxygen mask thing as well
23:47 the other big one is that they have
23:49 beggar pimps
23:50 so most major cities have thousands and
23:54 thousands of beggar's which is kind of
23:56 strange because again I just said in the
23:57 previous episode that there aren't there
24:00 aren't homeless Asian people here in
24:02 America at all we seem to be getting a
24:05 good batch that wants to work and and
24:07 and have wonderful things and we welcome
24:11 them you're just like a pimp runs
24:13 prostitution least these beggars have to
24:16 take their money bring it to their
24:19 Overlord the Overlord lives in a
24:21 beautiful multi-million dollar condo and
24:24 it's just known this is the way it works
24:27 and so it makes the city look like crap
24:28 because you have a bunch of homeless
24:30 people out there this socialistic world
24:33 is supposed to be like this communistic
24:35 socialistic system where poverty and
24:37 begging shouldn't be possible because
24:40 the give all your money to the state
24:43 they give you a home they give you a job
24:45 if that's what you need and you should
24:47 be okay
24:48 so I don't know how beggars exist but
24:49 they do and they don't tell you tell you
24:51 that at all but yeah the construction
24:54 techniques are inferior to a point of
24:57 absolute danger Australia is finding out
25:00 that as they are using this exact labor
25:04 force to build skyscrapers they built
25:05 this really plush famous skyscraper I
25:07 forget the name of it I don't know if
25:09 it's in Melbourne or Sydney I think it's
25:13 in Melbourne but they they pump this
25:16 bund building up as this big luxury
25:18 place built by oversea workers right
25:21 sold it to oversee these folks it's
25:25 pretty pretty much like an full-on
25:26 Chinese building they built it and they
25:29 rent it and now they're finding out the
25:31 thing is falling apart and when they
25:33 start pulling away some of the sheetrock
25:34 they're finding out that ceiling joints
25:36 don't even connect there's no true
25:39 firewall system in the building
25:40 and the place is just waiting to catch
25:44 on fire and kill everybody inside so
25:47 those are some standards so the reason
25:50 why I mentioned all this is this is the
25:52 civilization that is pledging the social
25:54 credit system on top of their people so
25:57 there probably is a positive and there's
25:59 a negative going on the positive is is
26:02 that maybe they need it maybe they need
26:05 this sort of draconian control because
26:08 for whatever reason they can't behave
26:09 without it maybe I don't know the other
26:14 side is is that these are the folks that
26:17 are actually allowing it to occur so
26:20 they're allowing this this horrible I
26:23 mean we're talking 1984 [ __ ] here to
26:26 spread on planet Earth it would be as if
26:28 the earth was an organism and all human
26:31 life is part of this organism we have a
26:34 deadly virus starting in China with this
26:38 social rating system Social Credit
26:40 System and that virus needs to be
26:43 extinguished or it needs to be
26:45 quarantined go ahead and do it it ain't
26:49 it ain't coming over here where there is
26:50 a constitution with there the word
26:52 socialism and communism is a dirty word
26:55 that is our immune system against ever
26:57 taking that on the stuff is being
26:59 smuggled in to all of our countries
27:02 what's kicking off the re-recording of
27:05 this episode as a friend of mine just
27:08 brought to my attention an article that
27:10 is talking about how doctors in America
27:14 prepare for the Robin Hood formula I'm
27:17 gonna say is something that sounds good
27:19 but if you think about it turning into
27:21 this Social Credit System it's super bad
27:24 now we have Yelp in America
27:27 I assume it's in Europe it's where you
27:29 rate restaurants it's a little app on
27:30 your phone you know there's one through
27:33 five stars somehow people are having
27:35 one-star experiences at restaurants I
27:37 don't how the hell would they [ __ ]
27:39 dump a bucket of [ __ ] on you and set you
27:41 on fire I mean how do you have a
27:42 one-star experience of it but just
27:44 literally be the most horrific
27:46 terrifying sickening thing I mean I
27:49 guess if you want home with some food
27:50 poison you can hand out a one-star
27:53 nobody got people are like either 501
27:55 501 501 it's not reality folks so we
28:01 have this new system that's gonna start
28:03 raiding professions in the United States
28:04 of America and one of the very first
28:05 ones are gonna put on the barbie our
28:08 professors at colleges students are
28:12 gonna be able to rate their professors
28:14 now you might think Ralph the bet I I
28:16 literally did this in in college when I
28:19 took computer courses in De Anza I had
28:22 this teacher it was fantastic took two
28:25 courses from him I think I just
28:26 mentioned this as a non-academic level
28:29 but the third guy I took was trying to
28:33 assert he had a big ego and so he was
28:35 trying to say how amazing he was and he
28:38 was teaching crap that was 10 years old
28:40 in 1991 I'm spending my entire day doing
28:46 this professionally I'm on my second
28:48 accredited multi-million dollar product
28:50 and so I'm in the classroom just just
28:53 being nice and going hey you know we
28:54 what that's interesting that's cool but
28:56 you know what we do today in Microsoft
28:58 Windows as we do this in the Mac we do
28:59 that and this guy with just his ego
29:02 couldn't listen to it so it was like no
29:03 they don't know uh that's wrong he'd say
29:05 that's wrong he wouldn't say anything
29:07 that was
29:07 just being an [ __ ] well unfortunately
29:10 for that second guy his tenure review
29:13 came up and the students had to write an
29:15 essay and answer a bunch of questions
29:16 about the guy and I just was very honest
29:19 in my essay I assumed it it may have
29:23 stunted his growth hopefully the college
29:27 isn't a complete jerk and they just go
29:29 if this is true this isn't good and you
29:33 need to prove to us that you are beyond
29:36 this that you're going to soften your
29:38 delivery it's not a make a break
29:40 situation but this new app is gonna
29:43 allow students to rank their professors
29:45 I don't know what their restrictions are
29:48 maybe there's quite a few restrictions
29:49 with Yelp you have to be within GPS
29:52 coordinate range of the restaurant
29:54 before you check in but you can go home
29:57 and put a review in anytime you want
30:00 but maybe the kids have to prove that
30:02 they are part of the college that
30:03 they've actually taken that professor
30:04 but imagine all the losers of the world
30:07 failing the course and then just going
30:10 in and saying well I you know this is a
30:12 horrible teacher that's why I failed
30:14 sometimes that's actually the truth but
30:17 what has been the current ranking system
30:19 for teachers prior to a ranking system
30:21 that's subjective human opinion we look
30:25 at the passing grade of the students
30:27 because that's all you need to know if
30:31 the teacher can engage the students and
30:33 be dynamic right she got the loser kid
30:35 over here who's being forced in by his
30:37 parents he's a rich snobby little
30:39 bastard because his [ __ ] aventador
30:42 outside but he doesn't want to take his
30:43 homework home he's coked out of his mind
30:46 but everybody else is pretty with it and
30:50 if the teacher can change their you know
30:53 they change to try to approach that kid
30:55 he was a complete loser and again if the
30:57 kid doubles down triples down on being a
30:59 loser then screw him he moves off and
31:01 goes to his other world and probably
31:03 never needs money anyway but all the
31:05 other kids graduate and they had fairly
31:07 decent grades then that teacher has a
31:09 good ranking so a passing student with a
31:12 high GPA grade point average is going to
31:16 be the ranking system that we need for a
31:18 teacher
31:19 but they'll sneak it in like that
31:21 they'll sneak it in like that so that
31:24 you have to capitulate down and I've
31:27 stood in front of hundreds and hundreds
31:30 of students I don't know if I should
31:32 probably have stood in front of a
31:33 thousand students teaching them all my
31:35 private courses I've taught at
31:37 corporations but there's always a way to
31:39 wake up the crowd there's always a way
31:41 to be dynamic for folks there's a way to
31:42 engage people that are forced to listen
31:44 to you who don't want to listen to you
31:46 and you get them excited and laughing
31:48 and make them feel a part of the things
31:50 so there's all kinds of ways to get into
31:51 it but they're gonna be selling this to
31:55 us on a bunch of different levels like
31:57 that and we're all gonna jump on it and
31:59 it's going to be a disaster because it
32:02 will eventually end up into the Social
32:04 Credit System now again if the
32:07 government was completely gutted the
32:09 swamp was drained there are no bad folks
32:11 and you would literally call any person
32:14 on the hill a mentor an inspirational
32:18 beacon then you you could have this
32:20 system but the minute that that starts
32:22 those people start to die off and the
32:24 the ruling class who are a bunch of you
32:26 know conniving manipulating devil
32:30 worshippers get in there and put their
32:32 people in there then immediately the
32:35 system that was fantastic becomes a
32:37 system of complete control and if it's
32:40 enforced because there's the first layer
32:42 of this would be denying you services so
32:44 you can't legally purchase anything if
32:47 you have to eat something's gonna have
32:48 to part with their meal and go hungry
32:50 one of those kind of situations that's
32:52 an extreme example hey but you just wait
32:55 man you give China ten years of this
32:57 stuff and there's gonna be situations
32:59 like that but then if you have a human
33:03 police force that will come pick you up
33:05 which is what China does constantly
33:07 right they harass their people
33:08 constantly physically dragging them into
33:12 police precincts and you know tear
33:15 gating them for a year beating them up
33:18 stabbing them in the gut with you know
33:20 batons and it's brutal and this guy is
33:23 in house arrest in this documentary has
33:26 had that happened to him he was Tara
33:28 gated 70 times in 365 days now he
33:31 survived he's
33:33 dead but they wanted him to confess on a
33:38 video that what he said about these
33:41 political officials that are taking
33:43 bribes was all fake and so the guy
33:46 reports the truth the head of the
33:48 government wants him to lie to the
33:50 people to clean his his record right
33:55 think about it it's a social credit
33:57 system based on the fact that you're a
33:59 good person and you don't lie in you're
34:00 polite to people and all this other
34:02 stuff but the government itself makes
34:05 you cover up crimes so that you can get
34:08 a good credit system and if you so much
34:10 as report the crime which is what should
34:12 get you a double point score on this
34:14 credit system they want you to double
34:16 down and again it's a good thing they
34:20 don't believe in God because of they did
34:22 they're sitting there in front of their
34:24 Creator giving you know what forcing a
34:27 guy to give a bad confession so that
34:29 person's gonna have a bad credit rating
34:32 system with God and then the person
34:34 sitting there lying to protect his body
34:36 and to keep the government going man
34:41 there's kind of a margin in there if you
34:42 can escape the country you know what I
34:44 would do is I'd play that [ __ ] system
34:46 to the point I got 750 I go on a
34:49 vacation I'd never come back screw that
34:52 place then there's this third group now
34:56 there's a piece of news that you should
34:57 be aware of which is most of you have
35:00 probably read who watch this show these
35:04 crazy stabbings that happen in Shanghai
35:07 Shanghai's got you know a lot of places
35:09 in China have these big plazas right
35:11 just tons of concrete and it's where all
35:14 the crazy stuff happened 89 was the
35:20 beijing massacre massacre and all that
35:22 but there's a turkish group of folks
35:25 that live in western china i don't know
35:29 their history but because guns aren't
35:31 allowed they have turned to knifes and
35:34 they have had several x' like mass
35:37 stabbings with the turkish people are
35:39 frustrated to the point where they just
35:42 are randomly stabbing people and i
35:44 remember this happening like five or ten
35:46 years ago
35:47 just I'm really confused I didn't know
35:49 anyone was that angry in China but I
35:51 didn't talk to the gentleman who just
35:52 came back from there
35:54 he said all those are Turkish people
35:55 doing that so he goes Chinese people
35:59 hate them consider them terrorists and
36:01 so that explains the second or the third
36:05 part of this documentary which is that
36:07 they addressed a Turkish community
36:09 that's on the western region I forgot
36:11 the name of the town because it's some
36:12 obscure mean that we don't pronounce in
36:15 America but what they've done is they've
36:18 revised the Social Credit system to be
36:20 very different
36:22 this one town supposedly I think got
36:26 over a hundred thousand cameras in it
36:28 because every nook and cranny of this
36:30 place is completely photographed but
36:32 instead of having the 800 point credit
36:34 system they have three levels of credit
36:37 system three levels of privilege based
36:39 on this quarter system you have below
36:44 average meaning you're a bad person
36:47 average which means you just kind of
36:49 have the basic amenities of life and
36:51 then you have above average if you are
36:55 Turkish in China
36:56 check out this racist [ __ ] you can't
37:00 achieve above average
37:03 you are just permanently racially
37:06 profiled into average who gets above
37:10 average in these Turkish communities
37:12 well the Chinese folks that live there
37:15 who keep the Turkish people under lock
37:20 and guard right they they have a Gestapo
37:23 around the Jewish camps basically what's
37:26 going on here and there are all around
37:30 this this this western region as tracked
37:33 by believe it or not the UN through spy
37:36 satellites there are all these prisons
37:39 everywhere and all these Turkish people
37:42 are like yeah our relatives are being
37:43 captured in the middle of the night and
37:44 taken away and we never see them again
37:47 and the rumor is they're dying in these
37:49 concentration camp prisons just like
37:51 North Korea North Korea is supposedly an
37:54 access to evil until the shuttles
37:55 crapped down
37:56 China's got preferred trading status
37:59 because of the Bill Clinton
38:00 now the Trump is trying to get them to
38:02 pay their fair share
38:04 he's an [ __ ] to all these liberals
38:07 right so who knows who drew the first
38:10 blood
38:11 maybe the Turkish people have been
38:13 completely rude to the Chinese people
38:15 from the very GetGo maybe the Chinese
38:17 people tried to control the Turkish
38:19 regions which then set off this first
38:21 blood where they're like we will destroy
38:24 you blah blah blah
38:25 hey the Chinese haven't completely
38:28 genocided the Turkish people in western
38:30 China so there's kind of doing something
38:34 there but the bottom line is is that
38:38 China is its own country and they're
38:40 very very different than us we'd like to
38:44 think that people can be just like us
38:45 but perhaps they can't but the problem
38:49 is is if they get this system working
38:53 perfectly in their country and they can
38:55 repress everything we already know they
38:57 censor the internet and you know I kind
39:00 of have a mixed feeling about that
39:02 because we know that America is lied to
39:04 by every single press agency out there
39:06 including Fox News it's all fake people
39:09 does some truth slip through sure if it
39:12 doesn't matter it slips through who
39:14 cares you know someone of royalty had a
39:18 baby oh let's put that on the front page
39:19 of every newspaper because there's
39:21 special human beings that we need to
39:22 worship still right yeah
39:24 those babies do exist but who's bad and
39:27 who's good who's corrupt who's not
39:29 corrupt all that's fake all the
39:31 narratives and agendas that they're
39:33 trying to push on us are coming in
39:36 through fake organizations so China may
39:39 just be saying look we want to control
39:41 the fake news we want to control the
39:42 propaganda I haven't talked to a single
39:46 citizen of China that thinks that the
39:48 news if they get is anything other than
39:49 propaganda you know they read it because
39:53 what else you gonna do you got to try to
39:55 find some sort of you got to try to sift
39:56 through the information to find out
39:58 what's going on a particular country at
40:01 the same time some things I love about
40:03 China is that they do have this
40:06 prioritization for family I mean
40:08 obviously they know how to procreate
40:10 really really well their population is
40:13 expanding like crazy
40:14 and because they've got the horrible
40:15 social security system that we have like
40:19 social security has to be outlawed and
40:21 turned into some other mechanism because
40:24 it promotes population explosion you
40:28 have to have more kids at the bottom
40:30 paying a fraction of the amount of money
40:32 that they pay attacks to pay for all of
40:35 the folks at the top who are older so
40:37 China just released this myth that they
40:41 kill every child after the firstborn
40:43 which has been allies since the very
40:44 beginning because they don't have enough
40:46 people to pay for the older folks I
40:48 think Japan has the same thing but Japan
40:51 is depopulating for the same reasons
40:53 that a lot of countries in the first
40:54 world sector depopulating because girls
40:58 and guys are figuring out they want to
41:00 destiny more than they want a whole
41:01 house full of children so if we're lucky
41:04 they might have one or two kids either
41:06 reducing or maintaining the population
41:08 worldwide now one of the reasons why I'm
41:11 taking it fairly forceful tact in this
41:14 particular episode towards China is that
41:17 we need to do this with every single
41:19 country that exists on planet earth and
41:20 have a very frank sort of the whole the
41:23 whole idea except for won't with one
41:27 exception that the Bilderberg meeting
41:28 came up with a 1954 into Bilderberg
41:30 Hotel in Holland their whole thing was
41:34 we need to put everyone in a
41:36 non-transcribed room where everyone can
41:38 say what they feel because this is where
41:39 we get down to brass tacks and actually
41:41 make progress it's Joe Jack Welch's like
41:44 his book like the third chapter
41:46 something about being candid it's very
41:48 important you can speak your mind
41:49 because if we don't we're gonna sit
41:51 around doing the wrong thing for a
41:53 really long time
41:53 while everyone gets their [ __ ] together
41:56 when you have the most people in your
41:59 country or you have the biggest country
42:01 on planet Earth you've got extra
42:02 responsibilities and need here some
42:04 frank talk when you're with the one of
42:06 the biggest polluters in the world
42:08 doesn't matter global warming is fake or
42:10 real that crap should be ejected into
42:13 the air
42:13 period
42:16 toxic waste should not be dumped into
42:18 rivers and oceans that is then going to
42:20 diffuse and spread all over the world
42:22 polluting fish very close by in the
42:26 Japanese seas and all that stuff
42:28 remember bluefish tuna goes in a
42:30 gigantic Pacific Rim route routine he
42:32 goes all the way over to Japan and China
42:35 comes all the way down to places like
42:38 Hawaii comes all the way over to Mexico
42:39 goes all the way up the coast and
42:41 someone's catching that stuff cutting it
42:43 up and serving it to you as sushi you
42:46 don't test it for precious metals and no
42:48 one else does but the CDC excuse me the
42:51 FDA has said several times and used to
42:54 have a calculator of the sushi that was
42:56 super bad for you and it was like you
43:00 know one serving of tuna sushi bluefin
43:03 tuna sushi was just horrid for your
43:05 brain putting mercury in your brain for
43:07 the rest of your life and where mercury
43:08 removes the coax around your neurons and
43:11 then your neurons die because they're
43:12 being eaten up by the normal immune
43:14 system in your brain because there's no
43:16 protection they're now largely in 2019
43:21 America has changed a lot of policies
43:23 that have been pissing off the entire
43:24 world like one leaving the Middle East
43:26 almost entirely demanding the fair share
43:30 of tariffs and what-have-you exports and
43:33 imports that's a good sign limiting all
43:36 these aids and crazy packages to
43:38 warlords and intelligence agencies that
43:41 are stealing the money once it gets
43:43 donated to a particular country so those
43:45 things are good so hopefully we're on
43:47 the right track here as long as we keep
43:49 all the good people alive and get all
43:50 these swamp rats the hell out of the
43:52 country but okay so let's take this as
43:55 let me switch your mind over to an
43:57 investor mind and look at the social
43:59 credit system the social credit system
44:02 operates on a few pieces of technology
44:05 and then a bunch of a doctrine ation the
44:08 indoctrination is the easiest part the
44:10 hardest part which isn't that hard
44:12 anymore is to come up with an apples
44:14 contributing to this in a big way and
44:16 foresee an arrest the tech industry just
44:18 say they got the buzzword which is
44:19 horrible which is face recognition stuff
44:22 when you look at your phone it checks
44:23 your face I mean how [ __ ] stupid are
44:25 you to allow that [ __ ] to be on on your
44:28 phone
44:30 Facebook it's it's intelligence DARPA
44:35 platform to steal your face that's why
44:37 Zuckerberg is a part of the five eyes at
44:39 least he wishes he was but this is a
44:43 technology platform you've got a cloud
44:45 server which just basically means a
44:47 server hooked to the Internet it's in
44:50 some warehouse somewhere and all the
44:52 data is coming to that particular data
44:54 center to be processed it's fairly quick
44:56 so cameras are all over the geographical
45:00 locations they want them inside the
45:02 homes as well as outside the home so I'm
45:03 taking a while to get them inside the
45:05 homes the TVs have cameras game consoles
45:10 have cameras your phones have cameras
45:12 your computers have cameras so there's a
45:14 [ __ ] ton of cameras in your house
45:15 constantly in a free country they're not
45:19 supposed to look at that stuff even
45:21 though they do from time to time but in
45:23 a communistic socialistic country they
45:27 just have to say this is what the case
45:29 is and you got no choice in it so sorry
45:32 fella freedom was just something you'll
45:35 never know about until you nut up and
45:39 put some heads on pikes but they're
45:43 gonna get this system completely honed
45:45 out over the next 10 years and then what
45:48 it's going to be a turnkey system for
45:51 other countries to control their people
45:55 I think Chile is on the list to of
45:57 countries that are turning this kind of
45:59 stuff on and so you might not have the
46:02 first one country's jump in next but I
46:04 wouldn't put it past anyone in the EU
46:07 anyone who's for the EU is probably for
46:10 the Social Credit System and wants to
46:12 live in a tyrannical world they just do
46:14 because they're just absolute
46:15 intellectual losers right but
46:18 third-world countries they're all
46:19 dictatorships and so they just have
46:22 their overlord presidents say this is
46:24 the way it is
46:25 they divert all that money and believe
46:27 me you're gonna have world banking
46:29 systems loan countries whatever amount
46:32 of money it takes to get them under this
46:33 Social Credit system once it's turnkey
46:35 out of China you could expect over the
46:39 next five to ten years if we don't shut
46:43 liberal press organizations and we can
46:46 hope right CNN's laying off people but
46:48 if we can't completely bankrupt them or
46:50 put them in jail because of the far of
46:51 violations AFA are a look it up then
46:56 they're going to continue to promote
46:57 these success stories in China as a
47:00 result of this Social Credit system and
47:04 so you can have a bunch of people raw
47:05 rying the whole thing see see how great
47:09 their world is they have no corruption
47:11 anymore
47:12 no one ever kills anybody anymore and I
47:14 want to get rapes anybody anymore and
47:16 everyone's just living on [ __ ]
47:18 eggshells constantly right I want to
47:21 bring you back to the Twilight Zone
47:24 where the little boy could wish people
47:26 into the cornfield it was the kid from
47:30 lost in space was the main actor and he
47:32 played a seven-year-old kid and the kid
47:34 just nailed this role I mean he's in a
47:38 few Twilight zones but the world had
47:41 turned into this place where this little
47:43 boy had had been born with superpowers
47:45 and in his superpowers he whatever he
47:47 thought in his mind could happen and
47:50 because he's a child he hated the rest
47:54 of the world and so as the episode
47:56 starts there's no other place but his
47:59 town that's it most the people are gone
48:03 because at one point they pissed him off
48:05 and so he did he does what is called
48:08 wishing them into the cornfield
48:09 which means he turns them into a monster
48:11 first he punishes them and then the
48:15 adults his father and his mother say you
48:18 know that's really good what you did
48:21 please wish him into this the cornfield
48:24 now and everyone is walking around
48:27 eggshell we're gonna excels around this
48:29 kid because if they so much as piss him
48:30 off he mutates them kills them or
48:33 mutates them at least and six him in the
48:35 cornfield that is the world the China is
48:40 headed towards everyone on eggshells and
48:44 if someone just so much as gets this I
48:48 mean imagine this being offended
48:50 [ __ ] that's out there I'm in an
48:51 episode on it right being offended is
48:53 extorting emotion out of another human
48:55 being is one of the most vile
48:57 reprehensible behaviors that man can
49:00 impose on man
49:01 being offended is a bunch of [ __ ]
49:04 you're either angry are you happy with
49:06 someone's dialogue towards you and then
49:09 you have to self-assess and say am I
49:11 being sensitive or is this person really
49:13 being a racist or a jerk or whatever if
49:15 anything you're learning about the other
49:16 person and not about yourself if
49:19 anything as long as you can recognize
49:21 and empathize with someone being upset
49:25 for a day because something else is
49:27 going wrong in their life maybe you go
49:28 well what's wrong you know you're you're
49:30 yelling at me in a weird way you never
49:31 done that before or you're yelling at me
49:34 in such a way that I don't think you
49:36 could probably live day to day like this
49:37 so what's wrong but instead of that we
49:40 get offended and it's always you know
49:41 between couples it's I get a massage I
49:44 get dinner I get a diamond ring or I get
49:47 this or out of this
49:48 it's extorting [ __ ] out of people now
49:52 some people jerks yeah yeah they are
49:54 they need to have the other thing just
49:56 an absolute you know disciplinary
49:58 situation occur but if you're in this
50:02 Social Credit System someone just has to
50:04 have a day where they're gonna play the
50:06 system how many people go into companies
50:09 I mean in the Bay Area was a big deal we
50:11 had people would go in and claim sexual
50:13 harassment even though nothing ever ever
50:15 happened one of the women at Electronic
50:18 Arts walked into a cube once and saw a
50:21 Sports Illustrated calendar shot and it
50:24 had the bottom part of this woman's
50:26 breasts revealed in her cut off tank top
50:29 she sued the company for almost a
50:31 million dollars
50:32 it's a [ __ ] calendar you can buy at
50:35 the grocery store it's not hidden in the
50:37 Playboy section so she had such a bad
50:40 self-image of herself she wanted to
50:42 punish women that take care of their
50:44 bodies and she sued a third party for a
50:48 green with that mentality
50:51 I worked my girlfriend worked at a
50:53 company where a woman came in got this
50:59 job never worked a day in her life at
51:02 the place and then when they tried to
51:04 fire her she claimed racism because she
51:08 wasn't white
51:10 she tries to sue them and then this
51:12 company was smart enough to check her
51:14 whole background out and she had worked
51:15 at Microsoft before she worked at this
51:17 other company in the Bay Area they found
51:19 out that she had sued them for the exact
51:21 same thing and then they took a one step
51:23 further and found out that she
51:24 completely lied about her credentials
51:26 and she didn't have a computer science
51:27 degree so why was she not working
51:29 because she didn't know what the hell
51:30 she was doing in the first place but she
51:32 was a good manipulator of the system but
51:35 there's a ton of people like this in the
51:37 world that want to gank the system they
51:39 don't want to work like the rest of us
51:40 and so when the Social Credit system is
51:43 as attached to the world
51:45 well they might do their job but they
51:48 always want to siphon a little bit out
51:49 of the system where they hate themselves
51:51 so they gotta hurt other people with the
51:52 Social Credit System hopefully the
51:55 system has a has a little regulator in
51:58 places as if you're constantly reporting
52:00 other people to be negative maybe it
52:02 starts to look at you I don't know but
52:07 the funny thing about this an
52:08 interesting thing about this as I've
52:10 seen a couple documentaries about the
52:12 people that work for the government
52:13 walking around China already what am i
52:17 saw was just a moment with the clipboard
52:18 and imagine that here comes the goddamn
52:22 Gestapo man with their with their
52:24 clipboard looking at you looking at you
52:28 it's like being in basic training you
52:30 know you're your sergeants trying to get
52:32 you to to dress properly and put your
52:34 stuff where it's supposed to be and have
52:36 your shirt tucked in and your bed made
52:38 and all I guess that has a purpose your
52:40 being a soldier you're being trained to
52:42 be responsible and to pay attention to
52:44 detail because those are life-and-death
52:46 qualities that you'll need on the
52:48 battlefield right this chicks walking
52:50 around with a clipboard and she is in
52:56 control baby you're like oh hi miss Elsa
53:00 how are you oh oh we're in a Twilight
53:02 Zone now it's good that you did that
53:04 it's good that you've reported that if
53:08 the insanity of this [ __ ] system
53:09 isn't dawning on you then the push
53:12 rewind until it does like I always tell
53:16 you on the show
53:17 the ruling class of the world is
53:20 constantly hatching the
53:22 [ __ ] constantly constantly up our ass
53:24 trying to find a way to screw us over
53:26 and that's why we have to care and
53:29 that's why I have to keep our mind open
53:31 because they're never going to stop
53:35 until they are literally genocided off
53:38 this planet those people who do that
53:42 must have their DNA [ __ ] put on a
53:44 spaceship as what my friends Dollywood
53:47 said mail their DNA to the Sun and have
53:50 it just obliterated and this is why I
53:54 think deep thoughts radio is actually
53:56 very special because they go out there
53:59 and I see that you know I see those
54:01 channels out there with millions of
54:03 subscribers it's all ass-kissing
54:06 channels out there we're no one's
54:09 everyone's like that I can't see you
54:10 know a Qi double hockey sticks you know
54:12 and it's like really is the world made
54:16 out of that [ __ ] childish way of
54:18 communicating no we're talking about the
54:21 world is sort of like the wild wild west
54:23 it's abroad you know baby and it's like
54:26 you know it would be like you know you
54:29 take a millennial and the skinny jeans
54:31 and or the capri pants and the and the
54:35 big beard and the old [ __ ] seventies
54:37 glasses and you say okay I'm gonna give
54:39 you a time machine where you want to go
54:40 I think I'd like to go back to the Wild
54:43 West
54:43 oh really weird you like to go well I
54:45 think I try like to go to Dodge City or
54:46 dead wood or tombstone or something like
54:48 that because just to see what it's like
54:49 and then because I think I can fix all
54:51 this stuff no oh really okay you want a
54:54 sidearm or something no I don't believe
54:56 in guns
54:57 oh okay all right so kid goes to Dodge
55:00 City Kansas pops through those saloon
55:04 doors in some fashion or former fashion
55:07 and immediately gets himself in trouble
55:10 he's too soft right he's got the assless
55:14 chaps on and you know somebody's gonna
55:18 get out of here you know I'm gonna seat
55:19 you or whatever and they Oh guys guys
55:22 you just don't understand let's love
55:25 each other and these guys are like
55:29 here's a couple holes in your body boom
55:31 boom boom
55:33 you can't fight fire with good
55:38 intentions yet can't what's absolutely
55:42 phenomenal to me in this day and age of
55:44 2019 if you really think about it this
55:48 Social Credit System is gonna take off
55:49 and shine it's already done it's gonna
55:51 be mandatory by the government I think
55:53 by 2020
55:54 which is like a few months away or any
55:56 means are good eight months away seven
56:00 months away as of this recording pretty
56:06 fascinating isn't it we are going to
56:08 have I mean it put it this way we've
56:11 lived through most shalini we've lived
56:13 through Hitler we've left through just
56:17 tons of dictators if you keep going back
56:20 on world history I mean there's just
56:21 tons of crazy slave labor societies that
56:25 we've had America back in the day and so
56:28 we've seen all these archetypes before
56:29 these horrible events in history and so
56:32 the social credit system being launched
56:34 in China is sort of like watching the
56:37 next version of this tyrannical crap
56:40 right in front of our face as if it's
56:42 not exactly not actually happening and
56:44 for the folks that can't be bothered
56:46 with progress because their life is so
56:51 important that you know it's like the
56:54 neverending story the nothingness that's
56:56 coming at them they're just not paying
56:58 attention to it because if they feel
56:59 like they don't pay attention to it it's
57:01 not happening if they close your eyes no
57:04 one can see them that's sort of
57:06 mentality right until eventually they're
57:09 absolutely overwhelmed by it they're
57:11 destroyed by it their lifes are you know
57:13 they're kids I mean how many adults
57:15 right now in China are gonna go along
57:18 with this and all these cops in China
57:21 man I don't know if it's a low IQ thing
57:25 or if it's a just a terrorist thing
57:28 where they're like they're afraid
57:30 because there's always one guy that will
57:31 do what the government says and so one
57:34 [ __ ] goes along with it because the cop
57:35 next to him will blow his brains out if
57:37 he doesn't go along with it you know
57:40 they've got some brutal prisons in China
57:42 brutal and yeah you won't catch me in
57:45 China time soon
57:46 especially after this video airs I don't
57:49 need to leave America I'm fine
57:51 I think until the five eyes are
57:53 completely poked out you got to be
57:54 careful traveling around the world
57:55 depending on what you say how do you
57:59 stop it how do you put a hole in this
58:01 right I think that exposing all of the
58:06 algorithms for people already being
58:07 repressed by it is probably the number
58:09 one thing but again you know it's just
58:12 like when I asked my buddy in the UK I
58:14 said you know how is it that you guys
58:16 have universal health care and your
58:19 public accepts it and then in America
58:21 it's so horrible right away that we just
58:23 know that we've been had you know and he
58:26 said look we got ours right after World
58:27 War Two and the politician want to burn
58:30 us corrupt back then as they are today
58:31 and so even our system screwed up and
58:33 we're getting rid of it for me the
58:35 correlation is almost exactly the same
58:37 China has not proven that it can create
58:40 a lawful you know greater good
58:46 layers of leadership you know our
58:50 president says you know good things
58:51 about China and you know he has two men
58:54 but he would totally redo China would be
58:58 a completely different country if our
59:00 leadership went over there and said look
59:01 by the way you have a Constitution now
59:04 you got a first amendment and a second
59:06 amendment that's the first two things
59:08 you have and then we're going to give
59:10 you the right not to harbor soldiers in
59:12 your house you're not going to have you
59:14 could have a no eavesdropping you're
59:16 gonna have right to due process an
59:17 expedient process can't be held out
59:19 forever no double jeopardy etc except
59:23 you're down the line like the first half
59:26 of our Constitution is pretty much what
59:28 most countries need to have a lot of
59:30 amazing progress because luckily in the
59:33 world
59:33 other than you know what is it Libya and
59:36 in Egypt where you can buy people again
59:39 unbeliev it's human trafficking the
59:41 second you can sell a human being for
59:43 labor it's human trafficking that's
59:47 still going on in this world but I would
59:50 implore you to bring this particular
59:53 conversation up to every single human
59:55 being you can bring it up to even to
59:58 teenagers you know
59:59 you decide when they're capable of truly
60:02 understanding what's going on but you
60:04 have to mention the fact that the
60:06 dissent that we inspire in our citizens
60:09 in the United States of America to say
60:11 that something is wrong is the backbone
60:14 that is being broken by a social credit
60:16 system it becomes an enforceable penalty
60:23 against citizens who have a social
60:25 credit system human beings have a social
60:29 credit system like the woman in China
60:31 said the very first one who's trying to
60:34 appease her handlers who lives in
60:37 probably a state of fear worse than the
60:40 other two guys the one guy that escaped
60:41 the country now lives I believe in
60:43 California I think but then the second
60:47 guy that's in house arrests he at least
60:49 has been true to his soul when he meets
60:51 his creator he doesn't have to apologize
60:53 for anything but the first girl is like
60:56 you know desperately trying to follow
60:59 the rules so that she gets a high credit
61:01 system they said that her husband
61:04 actually has a higher credit rating than
61:06 she has she has a 753 I believe and he's
61:09 got even higher which 800 I guess is the
61:11 very top how lucky are they you
61:15 surrender your very humanity so that you
61:17 can do what have a child and raise them
61:20 into an inhumane world because that was
61:24 their big thing is I want my kid to have
61:26 access to great schools and great this
61:28 and that because again the country is
61:30 extorting privilege ain't you know
61:34 freedom less privilege if you comply
61:36 with the draconian world that is
61:38 whatever they want for that particular
61:40 day but let's take it a step further
61:44 right now China is experiencing some
61:47 pretty interesting transformations
61:49 becoming more independent people are
61:52 demanding higher wages hopefully that
61:54 continues I mean whatever they need for
61:57 their particular areas whatever they
61:58 need they don't need our wage bracket if
62:01 they can live for less than great they
62:02 don't need as much money whatever it's
62:04 all proprietary it's not it's very
62:07 localized right but so they turn this
62:11 thing
62:12 and in the government has an idea we
62:16 want more power we want to do more stuff
62:19 that's completely illegal and slowly but
62:22 surely they erode the quality that is
62:24 the social rating system the credit
62:26 system right now it's like well you have
62:28 to let a politician have your child for
62:31 an evening otherwise your credit rating
62:34 goes down and that sounds insane right
62:36 and maybe that is a complete extreme
62:38 thing that'll never happen over there
62:39 but they could they could and if you had
62:43 tried have tried to fight back they just
62:45 take your credit rating system and zero
62:47 that [ __ ] out and you have no privileges
62:51 and then what do you do make the
62:54 decision I mean what are you trying to
62:56 do they know you're gonna try to escape
62:57 the country
62:58 everything is so computerized if you
63:00 move through the town again in you know
63:03 you'd have to leave your cell phone
63:04 behind and that's gonna show a criminal
63:08 intent because if the cell phones always
63:10 moving and it doesn't move anymore and
63:12 the people that are carrying it don't
63:14 match the physical profile that's
63:15 attached to the face recognition of the
63:17 phone they're gonna know someone else is
63:18 trying to throw them off the scent
63:21 anywhere you go in the world if you
63:23 covered your face they'd be on you in
63:24 two seconds if your face recognizes
63:26 they'd be on you in two seconds you're
63:28 totally a rat in a cage
63:30 now take it thirty forty years up where
63:33 we have robots as cops
63:35 straight up thx 1-1 3-8 robots it's not
63:38 quite the fascist bald-headed wearing
63:40 white sheet world but they put that on
63:43 top of it because maybe you know Boston
63:47 Dynamics figures out the robot China
63:49 just buys a [ __ ] ton of them or Japan
63:51 does it or Korea does it South Korea
63:54 where all these robots are being built
63:56 and they just put that layer on top and
64:00 now you don't need to worry about a cop
64:01 having a moral fiber because it's all
64:03 robots having the moral fibers in fact
64:05 they could potentially erase all their
64:07 cops get rid of them one robot cop could
64:11 take out you know however many people
64:14 they've got arounds in their little guns
64:16 or whatever you know I mean it's like
64:19 brace yourself this is the first layer
64:23 on the layer cake of complete and utter
64:26 dystopian tyranny so the good thing is
64:30 is that we're ahead of this curve in
64:33 terms of figuring this stuff out they
64:34 haven't even made it mandatory well it
64:37 seems like it's mandatory but they
64:39 haven't made it mandatory to exist in
64:41 China just yet that's a little less than
64:43 a year away and we can already start
64:47 having the discussion in our countries
64:49 now just released an episode last week
64:52 called exponential change and that is
64:54 about the idea that robots are coming to
64:56 replace a lot of our jobs artificial
64:59 intelligence is going to replace a few
65:01 of the jobs and so we're going to have
65:04 to figure out whether or not we can
65:07 allow that to happen or whether or not
65:08 we can I mean literally we are a species
65:10 on this planet we can't we can't engage
65:13 in exercises of replacing humanity
65:15 without thinking about whether or not
65:16 it's the right thing to do
65:17 versus the capable thing to do which is
65:21 like the Triads on I mentioned in the
65:22 episode one of the perspectives I push
65:25 forward which mate some of you will jump
65:27 on this right away and you'll get it and
65:28 others will row their eyes but it's one
65:30 of these things of in the eyes of God
65:34 how is this all perceived and even if
65:37 God is just a figment of our imagination
65:41 or if God is us this notion that you've
65:44 got a human right next to me right here
65:47 whatever age typically older but
65:51 whatever right here next to me and
65:52 somehow that human being has more rights
65:55 than I do we know that's complete nutter
65:59 [ __ ] right from the very beginning
66:00 that human being has the rights to
66:03 instill control over me is insane it's
66:08 not the way this world should ever work
66:11 now that's if I'm a law-abiding you know
66:14 do no harm which is the law I'm talking
66:17 about here I'm doing no harm to anyone
66:19 in my life
66:21 construed any way shape you want to
66:23 construe harm I am NOT in any of the
66:25 algorithms I don't I don't burden people
66:28 with spending their money to take care
66:30 of me
66:30 I don't borrow things and you know don't
66:33 bring them back I mean I mean borrow I
66:35 mean I don't do anything but try to help
66:36 people around the world period that's
66:38 all I ever do
66:39 okay so I'm clean for the most part but
66:43 the lazy of the world create this system
66:45 of needing a human beings to be in
66:47 control of them and most of it has to do
66:51 with a lack of education and maybe
66:55 there's a genetic intelligence that
66:58 makes this happen it does seem like
67:00 there's gigantic regions of the world
67:02 that have you know like the Russians for
67:05 instance got blossom and they're not
67:07 this way today so what I'm saying is an
67:09 old thing but you go back a hundred
67:12 years and the Russians would always go
67:14 send off to the Europeans to provide a
67:17 Tsar to run Russia because they thought
67:20 they didn't have the native bloodline to
67:25 run their a country they didn't have
67:26 that bloodline that knew how to do it
67:27 there's probably more than a hundred
67:28 years back but once they got linen
67:31 installing you know Khrushchev and all
67:34 these guys all the way up to Putin they
67:37 realized they had the genetic they can
67:39 do it and Putin has done amazing things
67:41 for that country heard an article that
67:44 said he was worth 200 billion or 300
67:46 billion that kind of makes sense to me
67:49 he's worked his ass off so today it's
67:52 not a big necessity and Russia found out
67:54 they didn't need to subjugate themselves
67:57 to European control well what's
68:01 happening in China is sort of the same
68:04 thing they don't think that they can
68:06 control their country with their human
68:08 brains they can't control it so they've
68:11 got to create a machine world on top of
68:13 themselves to control themselves now
68:17 here's here's the rub that we don't talk
68:20 about because it's sort of unpopular to
68:23 say these sorts of things and I would
68:24 say what I'm about to say about China is
68:26 something that we can apply to every
68:27 country including every first world
68:29 country in the United States of America
68:31 so don't take personal offense to this
68:33 but China is a big piece of land and
68:38 that you have people there are all
68:41 levels of different sophistication and
68:44 intellectual 'ti that doesn't mean
68:46 spirituality spiritually you might have
68:48 a farmer that knows nothing more than
68:51 how to make you know
68:53 how to grow rice for the country and
68:56 that guy or gal might have more
68:58 spiritual brilliance than president
69:00 cheat the ruler of the country the
69:03 forever president of the country Putin's
69:05 the same way right but people sitting in
69:10 Shanghai or Beijing or even Hong Kong
69:13 now that's been recaptured they're
69:15 looking at these beautiful sky rises and
69:17 this amazing technology that they have
69:19 Hong Kong is completely different I mean
69:22 it's lightyears ahead of the rest of the
69:24 country but someone might be sitting at
69:28 the top of the country and saying look
69:29 man we got to get everybody on the same
69:30 page man and we can't just go to the
69:36 farmer and say you need to be educated
69:39 up to this level you have to have a bare
69:41 minimum of this education which really
69:42 is ridiculous and I'm not I don't even
69:44 know that that's even occurring but
69:45 someone might say to balance everybody
69:47 in the country we're gonna have to have
69:50 a more brute force policy on top of the
69:53 citizens such that this can get all
69:57 unified so we can approach our citizens
70:00 in one voice and everybody gets it
70:04 because if you've got people on the
70:05 stone Age's in your country as well as
70:08 people sitting on the very precipice of
70:10 technology doing great things for the
70:13 rest of the world and China is doing
70:15 some really cool things for the rest of
70:17 the world
70:17 in some fashion they're mostly you know
70:21 they take other people's ideas and they
70:22 generate them but they're starting to
70:24 create their own ideas now and I can't
70:26 wait for them to get clear up to the
70:28 point where they're demanding freedom
70:30 and looking at these cameras and just I
70:32 mean I hope it one day there's just a
70:34 frenzy to destroy all the cameras in
70:36 China I do sorry guys so it might be
70:41 that China feels like they have to do
70:43 something that wouldn't be appropriate
70:44 for the Western world but it's
70:46 appropriate for them and so I'm trying
70:49 to be sensitive to that as well
70:51 but the journalist that reports on crime
70:54 and bribery which is something everyone
70:56 knows about it's okay that again they
70:59 don't mind if you know about it they
71:01 just they just don't want you to mess
71:04 with it right it's like it's like what
71:05 Alex Jones said a long time
71:07 he said look you can watch the poker
71:09 game of life all these elite people
71:12 messing around with everyone's lifes
71:14 destroying lives and all that kind of
71:15 stuff
71:16 and you can call them names all you want
71:18 and they'll just laugh and go yeah it's
71:20 like that aristocrat joke you know call
71:22 them anything you want they love it but
71:24 if you reveal a card such that someone
71:27 else beats somebody else or you mess up
71:29 their game in general that's when they
71:33 stop the game and everybody looks at you
71:36 and you see you cease to exist they get
71:40 you out of their algorithm you are
71:42 eliminated and so I think that's very
71:46 very true for the world the ruling class
71:50 don't care unless you make a difference
71:52 and that's why the 17 movement gets
71:55 attacked so much online this is the end
71:58 of the deep state this is the end of the
72:00 five eyes this is the end of tyranny on
72:02 planet Earth because once this
72:04 experiment happens with the internet to
72:06 spread the news
72:07 I dare say it'll be a really hard thing
72:10 for all these corrupt factions to
72:12 continue to exist because what we are
72:14 doing inadvertently or intentionally is
72:16 we're trying to make all of the bad
72:18 people in the world stick out like a
72:19 sore thumb because everyone else has
72:23 adopted a more free-spirited world now
72:29 before I close here I have to admit that
72:34 and I think what someone's asked me this
72:36 in the comments a long time ago but
72:38 there's this whole thing about filming
72:41 public places not filming your backyard
72:43 not filming inside your house and your
72:45 private businesses the filming any
72:48 public place a street a parking garage
72:51 someplace is public and then using that
72:54 as information to track down criminals
72:57 we don't have a lot of cameras inside
72:59 cars which reduces the insurance
73:01 policies and so you are watching them
73:05 all the time you know I get bored I'll
73:06 put those on at the lounge I'm just kind
73:08 of programmed watching these you know
73:09 these these accident compilations
73:12 because it's fascinating to see sort of
73:14 what are the species of accidents we
73:16 have in various parts of the world
73:17 because they're very different Russia
73:19 can't turn left with
73:20 killing people it's crazy America were
73:23 texting and driving off the [ __ ] Road
73:25 it's crazy but there's a lot of hit and
73:27 runs caught on these cameras and what's
73:30 funny about these cameras is they're
73:31 catching these guys red-handed
73:33 there's no litigation in court as to
73:35 who's responsible except for someone
73:37 could maybe see I wasn't driving the car
73:39 and then you grab the cell phone GPS no
73:41 yes you were in that car but you can
73:43 only subpoena the phone records because
73:45 the car license plate matches the owner
73:47 of the car the owner of the car is gonna
73:49 be responsible for the accident if they
73:51 can't find the driver I had a friend of
73:54 mine loan his car off to a buddy and he
73:56 did a hit-and-run and my friend wouldn't
73:59 turn his buddy in and he lost his
74:00 license for a year and had the strike on
74:02 his license for hit-and-run when he
74:04 wasn't even in the car right and so
74:08 there's this thing of like well it's a
74:11 it's an incredible service for the
74:15 justice system of the world to have
74:17 everything recorded in the public you
74:20 know we've had these horrific
74:21 kidnappings you know the one that's
74:23 burning in my mind is some guy grabbed a
74:26 girl's hand she's walking home from
74:27 school and she's walking by a gas
74:29 station and this creep just walked up to
74:32 her and grabbed her hand and she kind of
74:36 pulled away from him for a little bit
74:37 but then she just sort of went with him
74:39 then she ended up dead somewhere though
74:42 because they had that guy's face on
74:44 camera at least we know who did it
74:46 now that's trying to solve the the
74:51 symptom and not the cause right the
74:54 causes that we've got a bunch of [ __ ]
74:55 up people who watch too much goddamn
74:57 porn and turn into these goddamn rapists
74:59 because they just developed this this
75:01 need for sex and they don't get their
75:04 life together because they have a bad
75:05 education or they're just weird
75:06 sociopaths and so they take it and then
75:09 they punish girls because normal girls
75:11 wouldn't hang out with the weirdo so
75:14 solving the problem of being a weirdo
75:16 solving the problem of demoralizing our
75:19 society which is the liberal agenda just
75:21 go look at TMZ man they worship every
75:23 vile [ __ ] behavior on planet Earth
75:25 that is that is the whole agenda of the
75:27 left it's that you know we're a free man
75:30 we can do whatever you want I want to
75:31 sleep with your kid
75:33 No well okay I'll steal them then you
75:35 know and then all these corrupt law
75:38 enforcement people and government
75:40 officials will protect me in court so
75:42 it's a two-step process unfortunately we
75:45 do have to go for the symptom and not
75:47 the cause
75:48 so cameras in the public well it's sort
75:52 of one of these unfortunate solutions
75:54 because we've lost control of our own
75:56 country you know at least in the United
75:59 States and I'm sure other countries
76:01 could benefit from this the amount of
76:04 video cameras inside of businesses in
76:07 China that I've seen and this happens
76:09 everywhere it's not just China but
76:11 they're starting to solve this problem a
76:12 little bit and we have it in the ice
76:14 States all the time which is really
76:15 there's some funny algorithms where
76:17 these guys come into stores and they're
76:20 trying to hold up a cell phone repair
76:21 place you know any place that's got a
76:24 kind of a cash based business which
76:25 blows my mind there's any cash that's
76:27 worth stealing anywhere but these thugs
76:29 will come in there like last when I saw
76:31 it was in America but these two thugs
76:32 come in they try to hold up this guy the
76:34 guy's like hey man you can have
76:35 everything let me just leave the guy who
76:37 walks out the back door hits the
76:39 security button which locks the gate on
76:41 the front so the back is locked the
76:44 front is locked and these guys are on
76:45 video camera screwed out of their mind
76:48 right they can't escape the place then a
76:53 bunch of people for the last one I saw
76:56 they were all piled up outside looking
76:58 in the window with all the cage bars you
77:00 know and these two dudes are like trying
77:03 to get the door open they're trying to
77:05 take things and crowbar it open you know
77:06 but nothing's really a crowbar so they
77:08 can't get the door open they're begging
77:10 to be let go and the second guy's just
77:13 like we're screwed man we're screwed and
77:14 he's just kind of certainly both know
77:16 they're going to jail for armed robbery
77:20 maybe even attempted murder charge who
77:22 knows then you got the scumbags that
77:25 walk into places I mean he's [ __ ]
77:27 draconian just Neanderthals should say
77:30 individuals that walk into convenience
77:32 stores and just shoot the person behind
77:34 the counter that person would have given
77:37 them every dime in the whole place but
77:39 they start off with capital punishment
77:42 with a full-blown first-degree murder
77:44 charge
77:46 because they're idiots I mean they're
77:48 just morons right so we got them on tape
77:51 and now we could put them in jail again
77:54 with cell phone tracking car tracking
77:56 all this other stuff we can find
77:57 criminals so do we keep a part of this
78:01 technology to assist law enforcement you
78:05 know I guess in this day and age the
78:07 answer is probably yes and I know what
78:11 gun control people are saying you know
78:12 that's because you have legal guns you
78:14 know you Americans are so stupid it's
78:16 like okay I'm watching this [ __ ] in
78:18 China two men and guns are illegal in
78:19 China but somehow there's no shortage of
78:23 guns over there so that's not gonna work
78:26 you have to educate people really early
78:32 in life really early in life so if a
78:36 government wants to impose certain
78:38 behaviors on folks it's raise your
78:40 goddamn kids you know if you're caught
78:43 having a kid and you try to run away
78:45 from the family maybe your prison
78:47 sentence is to go through parent
78:49 training and be forced to raise your
78:51 child there's no jail sentence you've
78:53 just got a nut up and take care of that
78:56 kid next time you have sex you're really
78:58 thinking about the rest of your life is
79:00 it really that I'm you know that much of
79:03 a necessity maybe you get your tubes
79:06 tied or you know whatever you need to do
79:09 so in my opinion this Social Credit
79:11 System is a big-boy conversation that
79:13 we're not willing to have because again
79:16 we're so repressed by all this h e-- l
79:20 double hockey stick [ __ ] delivery of
79:22 things right I just recently saw this me
79:26 just further that we're gonna disengage
79:28 from the credit rating system thing and
79:32 there was a video leaked about Joe Biden
79:36 he was at a fundraiser I think in 2006
79:39 or seven somewhere in there he's trying
79:40 to raise money for the presidential run
79:42 with he and Obama and he's in this room
79:46 you can't understand everything he's
79:48 saying but a bunch of it you can and
79:50 he's screaming at the top of his lungs
79:51 about the issues that he's passionate
79:54 about it's actually if the guy was a
79:57 good guy and he wasn't a pedophile
79:58 touching children and stuff that would
80:01 have been a really good campaign thing
80:02 for him back in the day but he's sitting
80:05 there saying he's talking about the
80:08 problem with the border in Mexico and he
80:11 is letting it loose man he is yelling
80:14 and he is saying look we have a country
80:18 that is very wealthy but it's only in
80:21 the 1% we have metric tons of cocaine
80:24 and marijuana and heroin coming across
80:27 the border and we need to build a wall
80:30 and he says he says in this thing he
80:33 would build a 700-mile wall ask him
80:37 today if he would support the wall of
80:38 course not so he's a two-faced [ __ ]
80:42 liar right I mean the guy's like he
80:45 brags about all these laws that he was
80:47 you know contributing to as a senator he
80:50 brags about knowing everyone in the
80:52 world because he's been in office for 40
80:54 goddamn years and he says I'll get
80:56 things done because I know who to call
80:59 it's funny that none of that [ __ ]
81:00 happened on his watch even the Obama
81:02 said we had a crisis at the border and
81:04 we had to build a wall just amazing how
81:08 these people talk out of their ass and
81:10 then when they get elected you get to
81:12 see what kind of scumbags they are and
81:14 they never come in and say well you know
81:15 I thought we had to do a wall but then
81:17 had this specific thing explained to me
81:19 which I'm gonna share with you and it
81:21 changed my mind let me know if it
81:23 changes your mind and then we can all
81:24 have an intelligent conversation but we
81:26 don't now one of the other tactics at
81:30 least from the left right now is that
81:33 you have people that passively
81:35 aggressively threaten you from your
81:37 position trying to scare you away from
81:39 being logical and I just saw it in this
81:43 Believe It or Not Fox Peace you know and
81:46 again please understand I'm not swayed
81:48 by any fake press organization but you
81:52 had a guy from the right on this side
81:54 and a guy from the left on this side
81:55 with the host in the middle and the
81:58 woman was the host and she was tossing
82:00 it back and forth doing a really good
82:02 job at it and the guy from the left
82:04 sorry for the guy for the right one
82:06 first and he was just mentioning some
82:08 basic low-hanging fruit things that we
82:10 know are happening and
82:12 with this declassification of the
82:16 Mueller
82:16 you know investigation all the
82:19 treasonous T's [ __ ] that's gone on the
82:21 background and of course the guy on the
82:24 left side of the politics he then on air
82:29 threatens the guy on the right and says
82:31 you better take back which you said
82:33 being a [ __ ] bully right on air and
82:36 of course he's a big giant [ __ ] in the
82:38 first place right he's just some
82:39 spokesman he's paid to you know go
82:42 around threatening people and of course
82:45 the guy on the right doesn't back down
82:46 because he knows he's right and this is
82:50 sort of what the world's devolved down
82:51 to President Trump was up talking about
82:56 the the new farm bill 19 billion dollar
82:58 farm bill which has got a bunch of other
83:00 things in it as well and the subject of
83:03 declassification came up the subject of
83:05 the fact that this is going to reveal
83:07 members of the Intelligence Agency and
83:10 potentially the DOJ that have acted in
83:12 mostly intelligence agency who have
83:14 acted in a treasonous manner so one of
83:17 the leftist press agents gets a question
83:20 and starts to threaten the president
83:22 that what he's saying is you know
83:26 punishable by death because treason is
83:28 punishable by death are you sure you
83:30 want to use the word treason trying to
83:32 make the president back down from what
83:34 something he's already analyzed do you
83:36 think this guy's gonna say treason and
83:38 accuse someone of being it because he
83:40 starts naming names Ben who was awesome
83:43 and Trump just looks at this guy is like
83:46 you know in one way or that noted that
83:48 another he's like [ __ ] you man I know
83:50 what I'm talking about you're some
83:52 piddly squat piece of [ __ ] leftist
83:54 journalist who's probably violated a far
83:56 act in your lifetime publishing foreign
83:58 articles and not telling the State
84:00 Department you're doing so to sway the
84:02 opinion of the American people through
84:03 foreign propaganda that's what kind of
84:07 person you are you know I'm a person
84:10 who's for the American people and really
84:12 sort of for the entire world but we got
84:13 to start somewhere
84:15 and he didn't back down I'm not sure any
84:19 president would back down that situation
84:20 but this is clearly someone in the right
84:24 and clearly someone in the wrong
84:25 I mention this because this is the basis
84:29 that we have to have for having these
84:33 conversations we have to be honest with
84:37 each other about what's going on in this
84:40 plant because let me say this is
84:43 probably way too late in this episode to
84:45 say this but the idea is someone could
84:47 be brutally honest with me back and
84:49 changed my mind
84:50 like I said look maybe China needs to do
84:52 these things because they've got an
84:53 issue that we don't understand it's
84:55 never been communicated to the rest of
84:57 the world if they have huge behavioral
85:00 problems that we don't know about but
85:02 again this turns into a turnkey system
85:04 it's going to be in your backyard before
85:05 you know it it's a fact that in 2016-17
85:12 you have the corrupt factions in the FBI
85:17 the James commis the Brant was abandoned
85:23 what is it clapper maybe even Muller but
85:29 definitely McCabe and Strock and the
85:31 whole Hillary foundation all her people
85:34 in her campaign the DNC and the
85:36 president of United States Barack Obama
85:39 Barry Santoro's right conspired in a
85:44 treasonous t'k fashion it would seem to
85:48 prevent Donald Trump from becoming
85:50 president and then after he became
85:51 president
85:52 they had their quote unquote insurance
85:54 policy which was in the text messages
85:56 between stock and page that they were
85:59 going to engage in treasonous - behavior
86:01 to overthrow the vote of the American
86:02 people
86:03 you know the vote in any country I don't
86:06 care what country and is the most sacred
86:07 thing that you can potentially give your
86:10 life for the Democrats are are right now
86:14 boldface right in your face corrupting
86:18 the value of that thing every single
86:22 we're about to go through our there's a
86:25 Memorial Day weekend here we're gonna
86:28 celebrate the soldiers that have given
86:30 their lives to preserve the Constitution
86:31 of the United States and at the same
86:33 time you have a political party saying
86:34 that they are gonna take a piss on every
86:37 single one of these graves because
86:39 what they died for isn't important that
86:42 illegal immigrants can vote in this
86:44 country illegal [ __ ] people in this
86:46 country can vote they're being given
86:48 social security cards and and driver's
86:51 license to walk into voting booths in
86:55 fact last time I voted they didn't want
86:56 any identification this white old lady I
87:00 don't need any then I don't want any
87:02 that as if it's like oh so you think
87:05 you're some liberal that wants to make
87:06 sure all the illegal [ __ ] immigrants
87:08 walk in about ten times they don't
87:10 [ __ ] care mmm people who migrated
87:15 here are welcome to vote one time in
87:18 their local district I support them a
87:20 thousand percent and if their vote is
87:23 different than mine so be it that's the
87:26 way the system works my team doesn't
87:28 always win every single time but people
87:32 that are running away from their country
87:34 instead of fighting for it no thanks man
87:37 if you're not willing to fight for your
87:39 own country you sure as hell ain't
87:40 fighting for my country so this is one
87:43 of those hardcore episodes that we have
87:45 to do every once in a while
87:46 again I don't like going out on these
87:48 limbs but you know what it's all about
87:50 having skin in the game that episode is
87:53 recorded already you go get that one out
87:55 before I put this one out let me know
87:58 what you think in the comments let me
87:59 know what you think we could do to fix
88:01 this thing
88:01 what sort of catchphrase that can we
88:05 that we can create that goes to the
88:07 heart of man to make sure that the words
88:10 that we pick and a statement that we
88:11 might say in mean form and conversation
88:14 like the things that people say to
88:16 become alcoholics well life's too short
88:18 man no one gets out of this place lives
88:21 I'm gonna become an alcoholic and a meth
88:23 addict because [ __ ] man I can't think of
88:25 anything else better to do with my life
88:26 right those kind of phrases that take
88:30 people down dark paths we need those
88:31 exact phrases for the good paths of life
88:35 if you've got stories inside China that
88:38 are like yeah this thing is turning on
88:40 but there's this other movement going on
88:42 that's counteracting that let me know
88:44 that if you've know something about a
88:47 reason why you think they need to have
88:49 this it's not applicable to the rest of
88:51 the world
88:52 we know that if you know where this is
88:55 happening in other parts of the world
88:56 other rating systems against human
88:58 beings from human beings to human beings
88:59 like the one for the professor's let me
89:03 know what you think about that if you've
89:05 had this conversation several times with
89:07 your family members or friends and
89:08 you're finding some weird empathy for
89:09 this situation let me know about that if
89:12 we're talking about people that don't
89:13 like it let me know about that we need
89:17 to advance this conversation and boil it
89:18 down to its very essence so we can
89:20 control it no man has authority over
89:24 another man and that's just the way it
89:27 works as long as you adhere to do no
89:30 harm you not hurt anybody else
89:33 then good then you should be left alone
89:37 if you have them into deep thoughts

90:25 dramatic what's kind of funny about
90:26 season one is that I've said this once
90:28 before is that it's going to be sort of
90:30 the reflection season to say I dig all
90:33 the other seasons but I want to get back
90:36 to the fundamentals of how to improve my
90:37 life for me and that's what season one's
90:41 really aimed at initially it's just a
90:43 bunch of self-improvement things not all
90:46 of them but a lot of them will help you
90:47 kind of manage your mind and your soul
90:50 according to your standards but it will
90:53 highlight the issues that you can make
90:54 the decisions about so just know if
