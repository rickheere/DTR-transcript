00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 this garage edition of season four this
00:40 will be our first garage edition of
00:42 season four it's raining outside and I'm
00:48 on a schedule
00:48 so I gotta pound this baby out this
00:51 one's gonna be one that I've anticipated
00:52 quite a bit moon hoax evidence so I've
00:59 released
00:59 you know half a dozen episodes regarding
01:02 the moon directly we talk about it all
01:05 the time how NASA faked admissions to
01:07 the moon and I mentioned various facts
01:10 here and there and I you know I've
01:11 pumped up stuffs this is gonna semis the
01:14 stuff I've mentioned to date but it's
01:16 really gonna try to venture off into
01:17 some areas that not only you'll see on
01:21 the internet but areas that I think have
01:24 not been brought up at least any in any
01:27 big forum but I'm not foolish enough to
01:30 think that someone hasn't covered these
01:32 issues so let's just put them all
01:34 together and it'll equipped you an arm
01:38 you to be able to have this conversation
01:42 a little bit productively if you're
01:43 struggling let's shed some layers there
01:46 it's not so freakin hot out or cold out
01:49 here so there's a couple you know
01:53 probably dozen ways we could come at the
01:55 particular evidence of the moon I think
01:58 what's important is to go for things and
02:00 as we mentioned them we have to be very
02:03 honest with whether or not this
02:04 particular piece of evidence that we're
02:07 discussing is strong or weak because to
02:11 hold up every single idea
02:12 the cooter could not prove that we
02:15 either landed on the moon or was a hoax
02:17 as all even-steven smoking guns is not
02:22 good for the movement so that's why when
02:26 I try to discuss it with other people I
02:28 try to be as dead-on as possible about
02:32 the stuff that I think would prove it
02:34 one way or another now what's
02:37 interesting is is that you have two
02:40 defectors of the moon missions that I
02:45 think is very interesting Buzz Aldrin
02:47 being
02:48 probably the very first one who said
02:50 look this thing is a woman
02:51 it is never going to the moon it will
02:55 barely achieve a low orbit now things
02:57 were improved from when he passed away
02:59 it was murdered and a gentleman by the
03:02 name of bill casing who was really the
03:05 catalyst behind bart sibrel personally
03:08 doing his two movies a funny thing
03:11 happened to the weight of the moon
03:12 before anything happened on the way the
03:13 moon and astronauts gone Wild Bill
03:17 casing was an employee at NASA at the
03:20 very tippy top he was handling all the
03:22 documentation they kept coming into the
03:24 organization based on the research that
03:27 they were doing in various areas of
03:29 everything you know from booster rockets
03:31 to environmental systems to propulsion
03:33 systems to everything in casing said
03:36 look I had a document that came under my
03:39 nose it said this is ten thousand to one
03:42 chance that this technology is ever
03:45 going to get us to the moon let alone
03:46 back safely I don't know about you but
03:49 those are pretty bad pretty bad odds
03:52 I mean it's slightly better than playing
03:53 the lottery in California but not very
03:56 good right now obviously someone was
03:59 just probably winging some analogy and
04:02 not really doing the probability and
04:04 statistical analysis of the technology
04:07 is probably more like a billion to one
04:09 or or just simply comes up divided by
04:12 zero this will never make it right
04:16 but what I thought would be healthy is
04:18 to really start at the launch pad of the
04:21 morning of this Apollo 11 launch
04:25 supposedly to the moon I just start
04:29 looking at the evidence
04:31 now the Saturn 5 as I say in most the
04:34 episodes is a technological wonder it
04:38 really is right it's a gigantic rocket
04:42 it is according to my research it's like
04:45 one of the biggest Rockets we've ever
04:46 made if not the biggest right because
04:49 now we've got better boosters we don't
04:50 put so much stuff in it and we can do
04:53 more with less right but it did take off
04:57 we all saw the footage so you know not a
05:01 couple
05:01 los the biggest outward thing about the
05:08 Saturn 5 before you get into the objects
05:10 that are inside the lamb and the and the
05:12 capsule are the f1 boosters those of you
05:17 are completely new the f1 boosters
05:19 simply referred to the engine that was
05:22 duplicated multiple times around the
05:24 bottom of this craft to create enough
05:27 lift to get it to escape Earth's orbit
05:31 to get it into the slingshot theory and
05:34 get to the moon
05:36 now the schematics for that engine have
05:41 never been released to the public and I
05:43 believe the current claim from NASA is
05:45 that those schematics have been lost
05:48 the engines were connected to the bottom
05:51 section which broke off floated
05:53 backwards and fell back into the ocean
05:55 within the last two years I have seen an
05:57 article with scuba deer scuba gear guys
06:00 who supposedly found some of the f1
06:02 boosters and again this launched several
06:06 times okay seven pure Apollo missions
06:09 that were supposed to go the moon 13 not
06:11 making it so reduced to six actually
06:14 stepping on the moon according to the
06:17 official story the challenges I always
06:19 say on this show is that kids in
06:21 engineering schools across the world can
06:23 take the schematics of that engine fill
06:26 it with fuel turn it on and watch what
06:28 happens and then do all the other
06:30 mathematics to prove whether or not it
06:32 can make it so this thing launches I
06:35 personally believe it went into low
06:37 orbit I think when they were faking the
06:39 footage of leaving Earth's orbit it's
06:43 proof that they didn't go but it's also
06:46 proof that they were in low orbit now
06:49 what is the theory of how they can get
06:52 this vehicle which has a very temporary
06:55 rocket system right I mean it's got big
06:57 giant stages to get out of the thicker
06:59 atmosphere and then another tiny stage
07:01 and then it's pretty much it's it's
07:03 going the speed is going to go and it's
07:06 going to somehow get to the moon now you
07:09 can't launch with our current technology
07:11 straight to the moon no matter what
07:15 scientific community comes up the debut
07:18 technology to the public I doesn't allow
07:20 that tech to occur there's not enough
07:23 power so they've come up with the
07:25 slingshot theory
07:26 what's the slingshot theory well in
07:29 short they say that if you can get
07:31 further out from the earth and you need
07:33 to be the earth is gonna pull you back
07:36 and then they get a pressure of ether
07:38 and my definition of gravity and it's
07:41 going to start elliptically increasing
07:43 the power okay of this orbit of Earth
07:48 and then I guess with a little bit of
07:50 retro they're gonna break that orbit and
07:52 it's gonna slingshot them directly to
07:55 the moon and then they can grab ahold of
07:57 the moon's orbit go down to the moon
08:01 come back up two of them go down one of
08:03 them stays up then they rendezvous and
08:05 then with one rocket in the back haul us
08:10 back to earth gained orbit into Earth
08:13 again and then ease down into the
08:17 atmosphere at a very specific angle with
08:19 an object shaped like a bullet that's
08:21 gonna go backwards with its butt first
08:23 hit a blast shield release these
08:25 parachutes of which we don't know where
08:27 they exist on the vehicle splash landing
08:30 all good the interesting thing is is
08:33 that in 1969 we didn't have video games
08:37 with physics engines and so this
08:42 slingshot theory is actually a part of
08:44 several things that you've actually
08:46 already played it has been my experience
08:49 that when you have a limited amount of
08:52 force right your engines are off you're
08:54 simply in this slingshot you're
08:57 literally just a a prostitute to gravity
09:01 that if you have an elliptical path that
09:07 you're gonna take and you want to
09:08 elongate it okay to then create you know
09:12 more and more force but eventually the
09:16 you can either make it longer or thinner
09:18 or are you gonna have to introduce more
09:20 power to this process to keep increasing
09:23 in the elliptical orbit and there's none
09:26 in the fuel in the Saturn 5 and the
09:28 ancillary fuel
09:29 this module to do what we're talking
09:33 about here in my opinion okay my
09:36 research so I think that once you start
09:39 to expand the rubber band shape you
09:42 start to collide with earth because you
09:44 start collapsing its overall thinner
09:49 angle we accept these things without
09:52 getting into them right without ever
09:56 questioning them and I want to say early
09:58 on the more outrageous some of this
10:00 stuff is the more the public is apt to
10:04 believe it because for them it feels
10:06 like a movie right you watch Star Wars
10:09 you know it's not real but you love it
10:11 because it's not real and so anytime
10:13 they introduce some weird [ __ ] that they
10:16 can't explain then the more outrageous
10:20 the better it feels familiar to them of
10:25 accepting something that's not real but
10:29 what's the first big problem with the
10:31 moon missions that most of us quote it's
10:34 the existence of the invisible Van Allen
10:36 belts now again they say it's true they
10:41 say they're lethal they greenlit
10:43 Project Orion two years ago to go out
10:45 and test to see how lethal these things
10:47 were because they don't know but they've
10:49 been through them so many times it's
10:50 ridiculous they did an unmanned mission
10:53 first because they don't want to risk
10:55 lives but supposedly they've done it a
10:57 bunch of times and then they were gonna
10:59 manage and you know if they could figure
11:01 out what's going on but they got the
11:02 data back from the first launch and they
11:04 cancelled the project and when bart
11:08 sibrel asked them for the data of the
11:10 radiation levels they didn't say oh you
11:12 know it turns out they're not even that
11:14 radioactive it's gonna be very easy to
11:17 insulate humans and that's why we
11:19 canceled it no they said that the data
11:20 was classified meaning so goddamn lethal
11:23 that they can't admit it to the public
11:26 because that will absolutely undo the
11:27 moon missions ever happening whoopsie
11:32 but there are astronauts that have taken
11:36 the interviews in bart sibrel movie
11:38 astronauts gone wild which again i don't
11:40 really like that name of that movie but
11:42 it's a powerful
11:44 you have astronauts that don't know what
11:47 the Van Allen belts are right in the
11:48 middle of an interview one of them goes
11:50 well I don't know well they obviously
11:51 didn't hurt us we went through them okay
11:56 these radiation belts are supposedly so
11:59 incredibly powerful that all of the
12:02 radiation coming off the Sun which is
12:03 very lethal okay
12:04 bounces off of them everything that
12:07 tries to penetrate our you know
12:09 atmosphere gets burned up by them before
12:12 it even hits the atmosphere it's an
12:15 amazingly powerful force field and it is
12:17 created in my opinion by the plasma core
12:20 of Earth leaking out on the spin and
12:25 then it goes out and comes back in the
12:28 most lethal areas on earth to experience
12:32 this would be in the atmosphere above
12:34 the North Pole and the atmosphere below
12:36 you know above the South Pole because
12:38 that is where it is most condensed and
12:41 has the highest velocity of popping out
12:42 and then it spreads out and diffuses and
12:44 becomes less lethal and then it
12:47 compresses at the bottom again but when
12:49 artists draw this thing they draw what
12:52 the sort of kind of v-shaped you know
12:55 out point and a v-shaped endpoint at the
12:57 bottom and so someone at NASA got a
13:00 really funny idea as I've said on the
13:05 show several times they used it against
13:07 Joe Rogan who happened to appear on
13:08 Coast to Coast AM radio Joe Rogan used
13:11 to know that we had to gone to the moon
13:13 and he was interviewed and he held his
13:16 own he was very polite and then they had
13:19 this guy call in from NASA who was the
13:23 most condescending and guy you've ever
13:29 heard if you want to call him that and
13:31 he's laughing and he's saying oh well
13:34 the Saturn five actually steered the
13:39 modules through the North Pole the hole
13:43 that's inside of this Van Allen belt and
13:45 that's how it missed all the lethal
13:49 radiation this guy is representing
13:52 himself as an employee of NASA no one
13:55 can confirm
13:56 okay well one the whole ease talking
13:59 about doesn't exist it's just an artist
14:01 rendering issue because artists don't
14:03 draw in 3d at some point you need to
14:06 show an aperture of exit and an aperture
14:09 of entry and that's how they've been
14:11 drawing it for years but it's not a void
14:15 same thing when you draw the electron
14:17 cloud around an atom you draw usually
14:20 some combinational paths with one little
14:22 electron on the path when it's actually
14:25 a cloud I think it's a horrible cloud of
14:30 ether but anyway the other thing is that
14:35 the santur five has absolutely no
14:37 capability of doing what they're talking
14:38 about
14:39 at some point exerting such force that
14:42 it can essentially do I don't know a
14:45 thirty degree turn a forty-five degree
14:46 turn to get through this hole why the
14:49 [ __ ] does the hole exist how would you
14:50 know the hole exists right and how was
14:53 this manoeuvre part of the plan but one
14:57 of the asteroids has no idea that this
14:58 manoeuvre occurred or that it was
15:00 important lies lies lies lies lies
15:05 so the Van Allen belts you know I think
15:08 we know very little about them I think
15:10 we've theorized them to exist I think
15:12 that the astronauts in 1998 we were on
15:15 the space shuttle went into it had a
15:17 huge problem that's why it was published
15:19 in CNN that you know the fan Allen belts
15:22 are more lethal than NASA first thought
15:25 I think was a paraphrase of the title of
15:28 the article I have attempted to go back
15:30 into CNN's archives and find that
15:32 article I can't find it I looked up the
15:35 mission details of all the space shuttle
15:39 missions in 1998 can't find any missions
15:42 that talked about any redirection of any
15:45 kind but okay so they make it to low
15:48 orbit right that's about 200 miles up
15:51 amazing achievement if they actually did
15:53 that and actually coincides with the
15:56 even-steven thruster issue of having
16:00 really one payload to push into orbit
16:04 the earth is perfectly round you
16:06 automatically just get over the edge
16:09 of the orbital requirements which is to
16:12 fall outside of the surface area of the
16:15 earth and you're there you're there for
16:17 a little while now figuring how reentry
16:20 worked and all this stuff it's it's
16:23 amazingly brilliant if they were able to
16:25 accomplish that but you know Buzz Aldrin
16:29 was rotating a tunic and so it looks
16:33 pretty convincing could be in a barf
16:35 what is it vomit rocket right but they
16:38 do that that classic shot out the window
16:41 which you beat up in several episodes
16:42 but we're here now so we'll do it one
16:44 more time they're inside this pyramid
16:49 conical craf they have one round
16:53 rectangle window with it all filled in
16:56 with latches and bolts and stuff but
16:59 inside that closed up the window area is
17:03 a perfectly circular window they want to
17:06 falsify evidence of leaving Earth's
17:09 orbit because that's what they said was
17:13 happening the problem is that the
17:16 astronauts were filming way back oh you
17:18 know like maybe I don't know five feet
17:21 or so away from this round window it
17:24 turned out the lights in the cabin they
17:25 said that the walls which were black now
17:27 were actually space Neil Armstrong said
17:31 to the public on air that he had pushed
17:33 the camera against the glass so you
17:35 should see the Milky Way serious hell
17:38 maybe maybe the moon is rotating
17:42 [Music]
17:44 [Applause]
17:46 and [ __ ] through a up number one
17:50 window under any reflected light no such
17:55 thing someone is holding a little Jill
17:59 it kind of floats around but it ends up
18:01 on the right side and they filmed the
18:05 Far Away shot first so they hold the
18:08 camera way back from the window making
18:09 earth it's outside the window look
18:11 really really small as they are
18:13 supposedly approaching the moon and
18:15 leaving the earth ears should be getting
18:16 smaller from being bigger to smaller
18:18 right so what happens you go away from
18:19 something but they shot the footage
18:22 backwards because they're perfecting it
18:24 far away and then they get closer and
18:26 closer and closer well as it's been
18:29 communicated to me every time that they
18:31 stopped and started this footage it has
18:33 a chronology to it when they develop
18:35 their reel and then duplicated it for
18:37 people to see it has a chronology to it
18:40 right it's a piece of tape so the first
18:44 thing is first and the last things last
18:46 and it's stamped with timestamps on it
18:49 so they can edit the footage properly
18:52 standard Hollywood 70 timecode stuff
18:55 right at the end they turn the lights on
18:57 inside the cabin and pull the gel off
19:01 the window you know in intermediate
19:04 shots - they've got arms in front of the
19:06 window which again Neil Armstrong said
19:09 he pushed the camera lens against the
19:10 window so nothing can be between the
19:13 camera and the shot of Earth because he
19:15 said that the inner cab was actually
19:17 outer space again with no stars at one
19:21 point you can see the red lights that
19:22 they used right just like when you're
19:23 developing film red light doesn't expose
19:28 film and so you can see what you're
19:29 doing and you doing exposure you can
19:31 move film around you can push it through
19:33 the development solutions and get it
19:35 done so they really screwed that up it's
19:38 a I think it's a 54 56 minute reel that
19:41 was sent to bart sibrel when he was
19:43 shooting his or cutting together
19:45 his first film funny thing happened on
19:48 the way to the moon when I interviewed
19:51 him about this he said you know look I
19:52 looked at this footage and I couldn't
19:55 really understand what it was and then
19:58 eventually it dawned on him
20:00 what he had discovered and it was the
20:03 Epiphany that we hadn't gone I mean it
20:05 was the most definitive evidence in the
20:07 planet on the planet that at least in
20:09 Apollo 11 we didn't go okay then we have
20:13 this approach to the moon and oddly we
20:17 don't have any shots of the moon you
20:19 don't have any shots you know they're
20:20 gonna say they couldn't probably get the
20:22 shot or whatever but we don't have the
20:24 moon getting closer all seven missions
20:28 plus a couple others before that there's
20:31 no shots like that what we have is
20:34 really bad clay models of the moon that
20:38 they then they have built gigantic clay
20:41 models you know big giant steel spheres
20:44 that they have put material on the the
20:49 measurement of relief okay versus what's
20:52 probably the actual relief on the moon
20:55 is completely outrageous you know like
20:59 again if you take the the earth and you
21:01 were to dry it off with a big towel it
21:04 is smoother at its most outrageous
21:07 points like Mount Everest or the deepest
21:10 seas off the coast of Indonesia it is
21:14 still smoother than a cue ball that's
21:16 how unbelievably smooth that we are and
21:19 the moon is no different than that and
21:21 so when they fly a camera okay over
21:26 these big clay models they have stacked
21:28 up so much clay to have the visual
21:30 effect of a shadow and a really small
21:33 object that they've blown their cover
21:35 you go back and look at that footage of
21:38 the moon rotating underneath the camera
21:40 and it is absolutely laughable if your
21:45 kid said hey mommy daddy I made a fake
21:47 moon and I shot some footage only the
21:50 youth of your child would insulate you
21:52 from thinking that this was a really
21:54 crappy piece of footage that is being
21:57 tried to be pawned off as a real image
22:00 of the moon right so what's the theory
22:03 at this point they have developed two
22:08 vehicles
22:09 one is the Lunar Lander and it is
22:14 married to this module this comb thing
22:17 with this big engine on the back which
22:20 makes sense ok the size of this thing
22:22 and behind this this this cone tip makes
22:26 complete sense to hide the motor and the
22:29 fuel on all that good stuff but the limb
22:32 the lunar module that is going down is
22:35 there you know catch backwards and
22:38 people are starting to realize now that
22:40 we've gotten past some of the most basic
22:42 evidence that's the screwball footage on
22:44 the surface of the Moon that this thing
22:46 is the most pathetic pathetically
22:48 designed thing considering all of the
22:54 amazing sci-fi designs that have been
22:56 out for 30 40 years in Buck Rogers
22:58 episodes and just every sci-fi thing
23:02 from Star Trek and and what-have-you
23:09 I missed a couple things last time I
23:12 touched on the the limb going down the
23:14 lunar module one we know that the tests
23:18 on earth of this thing retro landing
23:21 backwards categorically failed NASA has
23:25 never been able to really get this what
23:27 the SpaceX people say that they're doing
23:29 which is you know land backwards this
23:31 was the thing that was in a lot of
23:32 Twilight zones and old 50s movies of a
23:35 rocket shaped you know thing coming back
23:38 down and landing on its fins very famous
23:41 old-school thought process right the
23:45 lunar module has four extremely rigid
23:49 non actuated non hydraulic legs and of
23:54 course with the temperatures in space
23:55 being you know
23:56 again according to them 280 plus
23:59 Fahrenheit 280 negative Fahrenheit
24:03 hydraulics don't like that kind of stuff
24:05 ask anyone who's trying to be a trucker
24:06 or a big earth mover in Canada during
24:09 winter that doesn't work well so thing
24:13 is stiff as a board
24:14 and when you see all the tests on earth
24:15 that's one of the biggest problems is
24:18 that when it came down it would hit the
24:22 ground
24:23 because it didn't absorb any of the
24:25 pressure from Earth
24:26 it actually would tip over really fast
24:30 so we have a bit of an issue here
24:32 because we've all seen the footage of
24:34 this thing coming down to the surface of
24:36 the Moon I mean out the window that's
24:39 shot because we don't have like
24:40 obviously a camera on the surface of the
24:42 Moon watching the whole thing although
24:44 they probably try to fake that today
24:45 right when this thing is coming down a
24:48 few things are happening one we have
24:51 this cone that is below the astronauts
24:57 supposedly living in the environmental
24:59 area and it is a 10,000 pound thrust
25:02 engine with very little fuel just enough
25:07 to slow this thing down from landing on
25:09 the moon okay you look out the window
25:13 tons of dust is flying like crazy right
25:18 when we look at the Hasselblad shots
25:20 especially of Apollo 11 underneath the
25:22 lunar lander well we've got the sheath
25:25 to the motor to the to the cone that
25:29 distributes the fire sitting right there
25:31 underneath it it's not burned and it's
25:34 not been blown you know a few hundred
25:36 feet away especially one-sixth gravity
25:38 just think if you threw a frisbee at
25:40 one-sixth gravity just think how far
25:42 that thing would go same thing with the
25:45 sheath on the bottom of this motor but
25:46 they're trying to complete a scenario in
25:48 your head without thinking straight well
25:51 one none of the dust is moved to the
25:54 sheath is still on the ground three
25:57 something I've missed in all my episodes
25:58 before the paint job on this cone was in
26:04 effect at all by being boiled in fire
26:07 every single one of these cones that
26:09 you'll ever see around the world if they
26:12 ever do an engine test even for 10
26:15 seconds you have baked off anything
26:20 that's there you've created soot you've
26:22 created a change in the metal that is
26:24 visible but the fourth thing is that the
26:28 engine that's required to run one of
26:30 these cones is too big to fit in the
26:33 base part of this of this lunar lander
26:37 remember we didn't have like 42
26:40 different designs of boosters we had one
26:42 design and we barely made it to the
26:44 finish line in 69 the Russians were
26:47 perfecting a more turbo boost design
26:51 which was to route some of the unspent
26:54 fuel back into the explosive chamber to
26:57 burn it again it's like a turbo right
27:00 when you watch this weird-ass 50 minute
27:04 special for 45 15 minute special which
27:06 my don't know if it's still up there on
27:07 Netflix about the Russian boosters that
27:10 we in 1995 bought off the Russians all
27:15 these boosters were supposed to be
27:16 destroyed when they cancelled their
27:17 bloom project this one guy was smart and
27:20 stuffed them all inside of a Siberian
27:23 warehouse they detail the engineering
27:28 feat of creating these engines and they
27:29 stressed that the very degree and angle
27:34 of a pipe routing fuel was absolutely
27:38 meticulously calculated so taking the
27:42 engine and making it smaller why you
27:44 don't get the boost that you need to
27:45 turning it sideways wouldn't work and
27:48 we're getting all those fuel because you
27:50 have a ton of crap in the bottom of this
27:52 lunar lander right you can pile these
27:54 rocks in there the next mission up and
27:56 the Apollo 12 they took a [ __ ] car up
27:58 there in the same spot so where's all
28:00 this space coming from right well
28:03 Hollywood never needs to really make it
28:06 make sense do you do they you know right
28:08 but the fifth thing that I've never
28:11 heard mentioned and maybe someone's done
28:12 it but I haven't heard it is that you
28:16 know the part of it you know I should
28:17 say with the dust that it didn't move
28:18 you also don't have dust on the feet
28:20 right so that's part of the the equation
28:22 with that problem of the set where
28:24 they've Lou they've lowered this thing
28:25 down on a crane to the set but we have
28:29 rigid legs with no hydraulics of any
28:32 kind and this thing is landing and one
28:36 of the listeners told me that it landed
28:38 approximately four miles an hour
28:40 okay the shock wave of landing at four
28:47 miles an hour is actually pretty intense
28:49 there is a contraption out
28:51 that teaches you to wear seatbelts in
28:52 America and they able to come to malls
28:54 every once in a while to put them in
28:56 parking lots and it's a steel chair you
28:57 sit in and it lowers you down on this
29:00 ramp and it hits you at five miles an
29:02 hour it goes BAM but it hits you it's
29:04 made of steel so it's it's really
29:06 transferring a lot of kinetic energy to
29:08 your body so you know that's not great
29:10 but these legs hitting a dusty surface
29:15 at four miles an hour you're going to do
29:19 a number of things okay if it doesn't
29:21 have a shock system to it it is going to
29:24 transfer that that impact directly to
29:27 the vehicle itself which is then going
29:30 to bounce the energy back down to the
29:32 ground and you're going to get a bounce
29:34 just like all the tests that we saw on
29:37 planet Earth which made the vehicle tip
29:39 over okay
29:42 there is no skid marks of any kind on
29:45 any of the landings underneath the
29:48 little pads supposedly slammed into the
29:51 bottom of the earth sorry slammed into
29:53 the surface of the moon at four miles an
29:54 hour another problem now a lot of people
30:00 have questions about how Neil Armstrong
30:02 was actually filmed coming down the
30:05 ladder I have heard the official story
30:09 is that there was a camera on one of the
30:11 legs that was pointed at this area of
30:13 the ship and they merely trigger it with
30:15 electronics and he comes down and does
30:17 his thing you should know something okay
30:22 and it by the way it's transmitting it
30:24 back to earth okay with the audio in the
30:26 video and all this stuff I think is an
30:29 amazing effort considering that in order
30:33 to push waves across you know vast
30:36 spaces you need a lot of energy right
30:40 radio stations are always rated in their
30:43 their watts right how many watts these
30:45 old radio stations used to blast it
30:47 really heavily and from New York you
30:49 could hear New York and you know
30:50 potentially California but they don't do
30:52 that anymore because they sanction the
30:54 watts to make sure it's all nice and
30:55 local so you drive away from the radio
30:58 station you don't hear anymore I'm not
31:00 sure there's enough power on the lunar
31:02 lander to
31:04 something clear through space back to
31:06 earth we love to hear the science behind
31:09 that one but space has radiation
31:13 everything has radiation right a light
31:16 bulb in your house has radiation it's
31:18 the rate of which electricity is being
31:20 pushed to that bulb that determines how
31:23 much you're getting hit by the radiation
31:25 but in space when I talked to an
31:29 employee whose responsibility was to
31:31 mitigate the the normal radiation from
31:34 the Sun he said it was extremely lethal
31:39 like six times over the normal lethal
31:42 level of what we experienced here on the
31:45 surface of Earth and that's just ambient
31:47 radiation coming off the Sun well the
31:49 moon has no atmosphere according to NASA
31:51 so floating in space and being on the
31:53 surface of the Moon is the same exact
31:55 thing
31:56 according to NASA so all the film inside
32:01 every device the Hasselblad a movie
32:03 camera for all the missions would have
32:05 been completely exposed simply entering
32:08 space let alone getting to the moon
32:10 trying to claim that you're taking a
32:13 shot so the very idea that we've got
32:17 footage from the moon with 1969
32:20 technology is bogus now an electronic
32:26 camera from 69 which supposedly is what
32:29 you know is being used to transmit these
32:30 latter situations I'm not exactly sure
32:34 what the analog-to-digital sensors were
32:39 like in those cameras whether or not
32:40 they would be okay or whether or not the
32:42 whole thing would just be white the
32:43 second they turned it on because again
32:45 electrons are gonna be smashing into
32:48 this plate inside the camera potentially
32:50 making you feel like it's getting bright
32:53 you know sunlight directly to the lens
32:55 not sure but now we're on the surface of
32:58 the Moon and this is where it gets
33:00 really interesting one of the things
33:03 that bart sibrel has pushed for years
33:05 and he's absolutely correct is that when
33:08 you have a light sources 93 million
33:10 miles away and you have several objects
33:13 in a room or several objects in a park
33:17 park telephone poles trees the urinal
33:20 whatever swing set all the shadows are
33:24 gonna be parallel because you have one
33:26 light source that's so far away that
33:30 when you were to draw a line this is how
33:31 you do a perspective right you take the
33:32 light source you put a line directly
33:35 inside the center of the light source so
33:37 you take the Sun as a circle put a line
33:39 directly in the middle and then you draw
33:42 a line to the object that's in the room
33:44 and you cast a shadow by continuing the
33:48 line behind the object and that's the de
33:50 angle of which the shuttle will arrive
33:52 right so the closer you bring the light
33:55 source to objects you're gonna get more
33:57 of a fanned out shadowing but when it's
34:02 really far away everything it's not a
34:04 you know precisely parallel in the eyes
34:07 of God but in the eyes of human beings
34:09 it's as parallel as it gets now NASA is
34:13 trying to combat this by suggesting that
34:17 okay well the surface of the Moon has
34:20 got craters in it it's got all kinds of
34:23 different shapes and you know it's hilly
34:25 so that's why you're getting shadows
34:28 that converge or go away from each other
34:31 right depending on how the cameras set
34:34 up with the shadows that we're paying
34:36 attention to our shadows of the legs of
34:40 the lunar lander the shadows of the
34:43 astronauts standing straight up without
34:46 getting into the contour shadows or the
34:49 rock shadows brock's are actually pretty
34:51 good too because they're popping up off
34:52 the surface right you can't have a rock
34:55 over on your left and a walk rock way
34:58 over on your right and have two shadows
35:00 that if you drew them if you continued
35:02 the shadows the lines are gonna touch
35:04 each other it's not gonna happen on the
35:07 moon but it will happen in a soundstage
35:10 where you're using big giant light erase
35:13 a bunch of different light bulbs
35:14 creating a big giant single light and
35:18 then you've got five of them in the room
35:20 to keep everything beautifully lit
35:22 because how would you do it let's say
35:25 you took a gigantic football field and
35:28 you push it inside of a soundstage
35:30 and you're simulating the Sun now the
35:33 Sun is everywhere right the Sun is gonna
35:35 completely blanket the area where the
35:37 astronauts are well what kind of light
35:42 do you bring how do you light the room
35:43 how do you light your big giant living
35:46 room you can't do it with one single
35:48 light kanya you got to put a bunch of
35:50 lights you have lights in the ceiling
35:51 you don't like those you put lamps
35:53 everywhere and if you really paid
35:55 attention to your room
35:56 you got converging shadows everywhere
35:58 because you're multiple light sources
36:00 one of the tricks that Hollywood has
36:04 done for years to figure out footage
36:08 that's been brought in from life action
36:09 so they actually shot it in the real
36:11 world they bring it into special-effects
36:13 companies this is before special
36:15 software was invented to figure this
36:17 stuff out as you take an image and you
36:21 adjust the contrast and lighting levels
36:23 on the image that has light on it and
36:26 what you'll start to see is there's
36:28 halos that start to come into focus
36:33 signifying a light above my light far
36:35 away and you can start seeing all the
36:37 multiple light sources okay and then
36:40 when they do Jurassic Park stuff like
36:42 back in 1993
36:43 but two years before it actually came
36:45 out 91 to 93 they use that information
36:48 to figure out where in the CG world -
36:50 like the dinosaur model to make sure it
36:53 matches the kitchen vollis other stuff
36:56 now we've invented all kinds of
36:59 techniques of taking thirty
37:01 five-millimeter shots back in the 90s of
37:03 objects in the room they have white
37:05 spheres that they would put in the room
37:06 and they'd take a picture of the white
37:08 sphere in different locations and then
37:10 take that data back to the
37:11 special-effects outfits so they could
37:12 figure out where the light is then the
37:14 automated the software that checks it
37:17 does this automatically lowers the light
37:20 and checks for all these hot spots every
37:24 single shot and every single mission has
37:27 a ton of hot spots it might be that the
37:29 whole area is beautifully lit once you
37:32 start adjusting the contrast and
37:33 brightness you start seeing a big
37:35 hotspot show up it's not the way the
37:37 sun's gonna work on such a small patch
37:40 of land on the moon now if you were out
37:43 in orbit
37:44 and you take a shot of the moon with the
37:46 sun shining yes
37:48 a gigantic 1,200 mile ball diameter
37:52 you're gonna have a couple hots you're
37:53 not one excuse me one hot spot that is
37:56 closer to the Sun it's more reflective
37:57 and you're gonna have this effect but
37:59 not in a tiny little football field of
38:01 which these guys were roaming around
38:03 it's not going to happen
38:04 so the converging shadow thing is very
38:07 real but people don't understand it so
38:10 when you explain it you're gonna have to
38:12 have people sitting down really excited
38:15 to listen to that particular piece of
38:16 information otherwise they're gonna bail
38:18 on you so don't try to bring that one up
38:20 unless you have someone who's excited to
38:22 listen to the details this is my advice
38:25 well then we have the set the set that
38:30 is the moon landing and there are
38:33 several theories about how this is done
38:35 we've had some listeners come in I think
38:38 Tim who's a visual effects guy who has
38:41 an amazing background if you read his
38:44 replies you're gonna learn a lot I
38:45 definitely did especially on the
38:47 Facebook page but he posted a beautiful
38:52 video that showed how they used
38:54 something called rear projection or
38:56 front projection excuse me to create the
38:59 movie 2001 a Space Odyssey but they
39:01 would build small versions of the set
39:03 and then the background with all the the
39:06 beautiful landscaping was actually being
39:07 projected I think from behind onto this
39:11 stream so it doesn't get on the actors
39:13 right but boy is it convincing and
39:16 you've seen this for years you've seen
39:17 someone run in front of a movie screen
39:19 and the old Twilight zones or the old
39:21 fifties movies and you know this you
39:23 know the backgrounds moving or monsters
39:25 chasing them like the old Sinbad shows
39:28 same kind of theory but slowed down and
39:31 upgraded to the point where it is
39:33 utterly convincing to the eye well every
39:37 single thing that you need to project
39:38 and all these assets cost money take
39:41 time and you're keeping it a big secret
39:43 from everyone and so I think they had a
39:45 limited amount of resources or moments
39:49 in which they could actually develop
39:50 this or maybe someone just simply
39:51 thought well we can use it again can't
39:53 we let's at least on two missions
39:57 we have the same landscape in the
39:59 background they changed the set they've
40:02 moved rocks around big giant rocks and
40:04 then they'll they'll take the rocks out
40:05 and put the lunar lander in its spot
40:06 because the ground isn't quite as
40:08 pristine as it was because they moved a
40:09 big rock out of the way they did an
40:12 amazing job but then we have one little
40:16 rock that's suspect and because of Tim
40:18 I'm now back on the bandwagon of this
40:21 being a beautiful piece of evidence that
40:23 we didn't go there's a rock with the sea
40:29 on it now NASA's official story is that
40:35 this rock when it was developed the
40:40 negative had a little hair on it little
40:44 Clarence Thomas hair on if you will
40:45 tight little sea but Tim reminded me
40:48 that if something is actually on the
40:49 negative that's going to expose as a
40:52 white sea not a black sea because it's
40:54 going to be blocking the exposure on to
40:57 the film film is white and when you
41:00 expose it you're creating burn marks in
41:02 the film when you process it through the
41:04 chemicals so the sea would be white and
41:06 not black but the rock also has an
41:10 anomaly in one of the corners that is
41:12 very atypical of rocks and for those of
41:15 you who've just played in the wilderness
41:16 or been on a camping trip you know what
41:19 rocks look like the older that they are
41:21 the more smooth that they are but even
41:23 those of you have played with lava rocks
41:25 and off the coast of Hawaii or so your
41:27 cousin brought you some or you use them
41:29 for landscaping
41:30 there's certain things that rocks don't
41:32 do and they don't make little folded
41:34 corners but when you're folding
41:36 newspaper around an object to make it
41:40 look more Moony right textured and all
41:42 this other kind of stuff I think felt
41:44 like it was gonna be like that I don't
41:45 know but there's no water on the moon
41:48 which is where we get a lot of smooth
41:50 rocks that have rolled around inside
41:52 streams or oceans for millions and
41:54 millions of years it's not one of those
41:57 kind of rocks very suspect why is see
42:01 well the theory is is that there's a B
42:04 and C level rocks
42:05 perhaps a is really small and C's really
42:08 big or the other way around but this
42:11 is a fairly big rock on the set again
42:12 not a super-duper smoking gun but I
42:15 think it's actually worth mentioning now
42:19 the hot spot thing I want to make clear
42:21 to you have hot spots all over landscape
42:25 shots but jealous I have Buzz Aldrin
42:27 climbing backwards out of the lunar
42:29 lander and he is just lit up like a
42:32 Christmas tree in terms of lights the
42:35 company invidia that makes you know
42:38 fantastic video cards did this
42:40 presentation and it just shows you how
42:43 desperate they are to keep this
42:44 narrative going they did a presentation
42:47 to debunk the idea that this shot is
42:49 indeed a fake by playing with physics
42:52 okay when you make a surface inside of a
42:57 3d rendering package you determine how
42:58 reflective the surface is so they
43:02 reconstructed Buzz Aldrin they
43:05 reconstructed in an astronaut suit of
43:07 course they reconstructed the lunar
43:09 lander they reconstructed the surface of
43:12 the moon where this was and then they
43:15 have a single light that's supposedly 93
43:18 million miles away which I'd love to see
43:20 the software that can pull that [ __ ] off
43:21 and then they turned it on and he had
43:25 this massive reflection off the rear of
43:28 his shoe but the rear of his shoe is not
43:31 very reflective to begin with so to get
43:33 a big hot spot on the rear of the shoe
43:34 you're talking about
43:36 a lot of light so for people in
43:41 Hollywood that again I've presented
43:43 these shots to I said just give me your
43:45 opinion man I'm not trying to tell you
43:46 it's one way or the other just give me
43:47 your opinion they just you know one of
43:49 my friends who is absolutely a God the
43:52 visual effects looked at this thing he
43:53 goes well Jesus I can see a five light
43:55 sources right now here here here here in
43:58 here is this [ __ ] this is completely
43:59 fake he goes I never even thought about
44:01 it because I don't really care but he
44:03 goes yeah this is fake so I guess we
44:05 didn't go maybe you're the expert he
44:08 said yeah in a discussion this guy it'll
44:12 spin like you know three months working
44:13 on five seconds worth of footage and I'm
44:15 not joking he has statues okay what
44:20 other things happened on the moon that
44:22 are really suspects
44:24 well there's the flag pounding which was
44:28 mysteriously left out of the last movie
44:30 was the first man or whatever it is
44:33 every mission that made it to the moon
44:37 which is six but an American flag into
44:39 the ground so the maritime law thing we
44:42 own this land be a hell of a thing to
44:45 get up there and not see him right but
44:48 the flag was flopping in the wind in
44:52 several of the shots they got a little
44:54 bit more control over it as they moved
44:57 on but a lot after they realized this
44:59 was a gigantic problem they stopped
45:02 broadcasting it in such a complete form
45:06 now the official story from NASA about
45:09 the flag is that which just gets more
45:13 [ __ ] absurd every time I tell a story
45:16 in the case of Apollo 11 Buzz
45:20 accidentally hit the flagpole with his
45:22 foot which created a transverse wave of
45:26 energy that goes up and transfers into
45:28 fabric and starts kicking the flag all
45:31 over the place there's a few problems
45:34 with that but the the easiest one is the
45:37 physics of that the physics don't work
45:38 on that right like I said for those of
45:40 you who have ever whipped them bedspread
45:43 on your bed you know that transverse
45:44 waves don't travel through fabric at all
45:47 very well you know you have to really
45:49 whip the [ __ ] out of that thing just to
45:51 get the wave to hit the other side of
45:52 the bed we're talking about bumping it
45:54 with your foot if in Tessa Mille even it
45:58 1/6 gravity it ain't gonna do [ __ ] but
46:01 the other problem for NASA and that
46:03 claim is that we've got full body shots
46:07 of this flag just flapping around
46:09 completely following the physics of wind
46:11 and no one's hitting the pole you can
46:16 see it with your own eyes so again NASA
46:18 wants to lie to your face over and over
46:21 and over again insults your basic
46:24 intelligence as a human being you don't
46:25 need a physics degree to low to know
46:27 that a bedspread doesn't transfer energy
46:30 that well why was there wind there's
46:34 wind because the actors inside of these
46:37 costumes
46:37 these astronaut costumes are not Buzz
46:40 Aldrin they're not Neil Armstrong or any
46:43 of the other astronauts they are agents
46:46 actors inside these suits with this
46:50 shield in front of their face that is
46:52 blocking their face was the caveat to
46:55 this I need to mention though
46:57 and so that conceals who they are they
47:01 can run footage all single all day long
47:03 they're actually talking to the
47:05 astronauts in low orbit now they found
47:07 out that this was a bit of a liability
47:09 timing all this and a live broadcast was
47:12 just and again we're not quite sure if
47:15 the moon footage even in Apollo 11 was
47:17 live or if it was actually pre-recorded
47:19 and then stitched in with life back and
47:22 forth between the astronauts I think
47:25 that by the later missions I have seen
47:28 footage where I think they allow us to
47:30 see the faces of the astronauts which
47:32 means it was pre-recorded and why
47:34 wouldn't you pre-recorded then you have
47:36 no mistakes to the degree that you have
47:38 your forgery up to a certain notch of
47:42 imitation the facsimile of the reality
47:44 that you think is going to be occurring
47:45 on the moon surface so the air
47:48 conditioners that are cooling these guys
47:50 down inside these suits because remember
47:51 they're inside essentially a Mickey
47:53 Mouse outfit it's really warm they can't
47:56 have the environmental pack that they
47:57 actually design into the object into the
48:00 suit because it weighs 100 pounds any of
48:02 you ever been in basic training and
48:04 tried to run around the 50-pound sack on
48:07 your back you know what running around
48:09 on high wires which we're gonna get to
48:13 in a second with 100 pound pack it you
48:15 would see it you would see the stress
48:17 marks in the chest just trying to hold
48:18 that thing up these it have to be burly
48:20 you know Navy SEALs to pull this off
48:23 with big ass Marines but no the
48:27 astronauts matched that physique so you
48:29 can't really do that either
48:31 so then you have this simulation of
48:34 one-sixth gravity what's fascinating
48:37 about saying that to you guys as I'm
48:41 saying an equation to you one-sixth
48:44 gravity hmm well what is that
48:48 hmm
48:49 ten seconds is one sixth of 60 seconds
48:52 okay so when you look at all the Moon
48:56 footage and I mean all of it from the
48:58 rover to the astronauts hopping around
49:00 kicking up dust and what have you
49:03 if you roll that footage to X inside
49:06 your local movie player either you're on
49:08 Macintosh and you're using QuickTime or
49:11 you're on a Windows using the Windows
49:13 Media Player and you just hit 2x you're
49:15 immediately looking at real-time footage
49:18 of actors on a moon set hopping around
49:22 you are sorry so how does this work how
49:28 do they fake that well if you pay
49:30 attention to all the shots on the moon
49:33 there's no stars now there's been a you
49:36 know what's really funny is that there
49:38 is a whole new sect of cosmologists
49:41 which these are people that determine
49:43 how the universe works right and they
49:46 have determined that you can't see stars
49:48 unless you have an atmosphere to bounce
49:49 the star light off of okay so if you
49:54 have a camera that's taking a photograph
49:55 of something and there's no atmosphere
49:57 between the actual light and the actual
50:01 receiver whether it be film or some was
50:06 it called LCD or whatever it is the
50:08 analog to digital converter you're not
50:11 going to see stars NASA doesn't
50:14 subscribe to this that's the most recent
50:18 cutting-edge cosmology in the world so
50:21 we have to stick NASA with their own
50:22 science we should be able to see those
50:24 stars if we adjust our camera properly
50:26 they say you can't see them because the
50:29 the aperture of the camera is so tight
50:31 then one little tiny bit of sunlight
50:33 come or sorry start light comes in it
50:35 doesn't register on the film now again
50:38 go look up the lumens of the star Sirius
50:41 and they go look up the lumens of the
50:43 moon Sirius is extremely bright
50:46 brightest star out there right you might
50:50 see that there's also Venus Mars Jupiter
50:52 and all these other stuff in the
50:53 background this should punch through on
50:55 the lumen scale but if nothing else
50:57 you've got the Milky Way on the Milky
50:59 Way as a combined tapestry in space
51:02 we show up in one or two of the shots
51:04 the other one is that why not adjust the
51:07 camera once to get this composite shot
51:09 of the two right they never did that but
51:12 why did they need no stars in space well
51:16 for several reasons one of the biggest
51:18 reasons was their hiding the cable that
51:20 is going between the astronaut the actor
51:23 on stage and the guy he's probably doing
51:26 it by hand in the background okay very
51:29 planned maneuvers I'm sure they
51:31 practiced their ass off right now I saw
51:34 David Copperfield in the Flint Center in
51:36 Cupertino California I think about 1992
51:40 or three and his thing was he had this
51:43 flying routine we all know he was on
51:47 wires of course he has a beautiful black
51:50 curtain in the background with all these
51:52 sparkling like amazingly sparkly
51:57 sequences sewn into the Sun into the
52:01 curtain and so they're flickering on and
52:04 off and so as the wire is going in front
52:06 of these stars these you know things
52:09 that have been sewn into the to the
52:11 fabric it's flickering anyway because
52:13 it's constantly moving so the solution
52:15 worked perfectly but now if he were to
52:18 do this in a controlled lighting setting
52:21 with a full black background with black
52:23 wires the only thing that we would ever
52:25 see is if he were to get his hands
52:26 behind the wires we would see the
52:29 obstruction but he's flying in a very
52:31 carefully orchestrated way it was
52:33 beautiful was amazing
52:34 well that's sort of what they had done
52:36 on the moon set and this technique of
52:39 flying on wires our fly-by-wire on a
52:41 stage had been done for over a hundred
52:45 years before that so it's not a
52:48 perfection not a technique you have to
52:49 perfect but like I said in my last
52:52 episode there are moments when
52:55 astronauts fell down and so the other
52:58 astronaut has to come over and help him
53:00 get up or they do this really bizarre
53:02 thing where they push on their feet push
53:03 on their hands push on their feet and
53:05 the guy in the background is
53:06 coordinating the wire and pulling them
53:08 up when a couple of the cases they
53:12 hadn't tried that technique they were
53:14 trying to push off something before
53:16 there
53:16 even touch the object that they're gonna
53:17 use whether the other astronauts Han or
53:20 a rock or some piece of prop they're
53:22 getting lifted up because the guy is
53:24 pulling them up too soon
53:25 it's a very tough thing because the guy
53:27 pulling the wire doesn't have a 360 view
53:30 of the astronaut all times
53:32 if the astronaut was facing him and the
53:34 object of which the astronauts gonna
53:36 push off of is in the eye side of the
53:37 guy you're doing the wire you could get
53:39 a nice you know coordinated effort but
53:42 they'd have to run all kinds of video
53:43 cameras all around this set just to give
53:46 in in the Rope guy would have to be
53:48 looking at monitors constantly trying to
53:49 figure out what the hell the astronauts
53:51 doing so for the most part they did an
53:54 amazing job with this illusion but they
53:56 made a few mistakes but running the
53:58 camera at 48 frames per second and then
54:01 running it back at 24 frames per second
54:03 which is the average frame rate of a
54:05 movie in 1969 was perfect it slowed
54:08 everything down it slowed down the dust
54:10 falling off their feet etc now the dust
54:13 in many of the shots as soon as these
54:17 astronauts jumped the dust at their feet
54:20 created in the air was being blown by
54:22 those air conditioners eight ten twelve
54:25 feet away instantaneously but no
54:28 atmosphere that's not gonna happen okay
54:32 highly suspect again I believe I have
54:36 captured a frame that shows the wire and
54:41 it was the wire was visible the entire
54:44 time an astronaut was crossing this path
54:45 to help his buddy get up this is one of
54:48 those bad scenes where the guy pulled
54:50 too soon but there's one frame where it
54:54 just lit up straight perpendicular shot
54:57 into the air down to the astronauts body
55:00 and it's not to be confused with
55:01 six-inch antennae that's over the left
55:03 shoulder which is parallel with the
55:05 torso this is going perpendicular to the
55:08 ground that's what the wires do now if
55:11 you fast forward we're gonna take a
55:12 split second and go to 12 where they
55:15 brought the car again the car has a lot
55:18 of problems the main problem is is that
55:20 NASA bragged that they couldn't bring
55:26 again their their terminology is
55:28 probably a facetious
55:30 emphasis was as you couldn't bring a
55:32 paperclip up because it would offset the
55:36 vehicles thrust now obviously that's not
55:37 true but they certainly couldn't bring a
55:41 700-pound car that was a way over the
55:45 allocation of f1 Boosters there was no
55:47 improvement to the f1 boosters from 1969
55:50 to 1972 same engine same array same
55:53 counts of array at the bottom they did
55:56 not reengineering five in any
55:58 significant way for all the missions so
56:00 this car shouldn't have been possible to
56:03 lift into space so the car arrives in
56:06 a12 and they don't assemble it with any
56:09 video footage don't even take a still
56:12 photograph of assembling it it magically
56:15 appears on the surface of the moon I got
56:19 the actual region of the car wrong in
56:21 one of my episodes right I thought it
56:23 was the front left coronal it's actually
56:25 the rear right quarter panel the back
56:27 right wheel is one of the first shots
56:30 ever taken of the lunar lander I'm sorry
56:33 that the moon car moon buggy on the
56:35 surface of the Moon and there's no
56:36 tracks there's no track in front there's
56:39 no track of back yes this thing folds
56:42 out okay so you might be able to say it
56:44 fold it out but there's no footprints
56:46 there's no Wiggles there's no nothing
56:48 okay because the thing was lowered down
56:50 I took a shot of it like let me get some
56:52 shots before we start messing around
56:54 this thing okay if you go and play every
56:57 single piece of footage of the moon
56:58 buggy running around on the moon I've
57:01 now since reconfirmed this okay you will
57:04 discover something the passenger sorry
57:08 the driver inside there's no passenger
57:10 but the driver inside the vehicle never
57:12 moves his body he never torques the
57:15 steering wheel
57:16 you never waves he never moves like a
57:19 human being it is a dummy that has been
57:22 put into this car why I could only
57:25 speculate that the vehicle would have
57:27 been stuck had it had the full weight of
57:30 human being on it in this set it happens
57:32 all the time I live in un'ytu beach just
57:34 go to the beach if you go over you know
57:37 every weekend on the in the summer time
57:39 somebody gets a vehicle stuck there cars
57:42 stuck even the
57:44 guards will get stuck sometimes it just
57:46 happens they wanted to avoid that
57:49 problem but a lot of people have studied
57:51 the rooster tail that comes off of the
57:54 back tires because it was hurling this
57:56 stuff in the air right get the car
57:58 itself is an ingenious design is very
58:00 simple but the the metal tires something
58:03 they're just ingenious a lot of amazing
58:05 stuff occurred to make this hoax happen
58:08 you can see that people really wanted to
58:10 go let's just put it that way and
58:12 probably people designed it had no idea
58:13 didn't go you know but they did the
58:16 physics on one-sixth gravity and the Ark
58:18 of which this plume comes off the back
58:21 of the tires a one-sixth gravity this
58:24 stuff will be flying behind that car and
58:26 probably not hit back to the surface for
58:29 quite some time but again roll at 2x
58:32 it's just like real-time footage that
58:34 you would have taken at some desert
58:37 retreat with your ATV right going back
58:41 to 11 now some of the stuff obviously is
58:44 most of it goes throughout all the
58:46 missions they have cameras on the moon
58:50 but again would be overexposed the
58:52 second that they went into deep space
58:54 let alone to the moon surface the
58:58 cameras are some of the biggest pieces
59:00 of smoking-gun evidence that you have
59:03 one Neil Armstrong has a Hasselblad
59:06 wired to his chest or mounted to his
59:08 chest
59:09 okay Hasselblad czar cameras that you
59:11 have to look down into the top to see
59:13 what's going out the front well he can't
59:15 look down because of the spacesuit and
59:17 won't let him look down he's got it
59:19 chin thing against an actor on a set but
59:22 even if he was really there he couldn't
59:24 look down in now back in 1969 not
59:29 everybody was a camera enthusiast okay
59:31 it was special today every phone on
59:36 planet Earth has a high-def 4k camera in
59:39 the front and in the back and you guys
59:41 have taken thousands of selfies now
59:45 without a visual preview of what you're
59:47 taking a picture of how good are your
59:48 shots gonna be how do you do a selfie
59:51 when you point the camera at yourself
59:52 you hold it up and you're looking you
59:55 know you see all these
59:57 all these composite all these shots
59:58 excuse me of these people it's like
60:01 there's you know the vein composite of
60:02 people taking pictures of themselves
60:04 okay
60:05 well we all do it and it's hard that's
60:08 ready to get it right Neil Armstrong
60:11 took time life cover life magazine cover
60:15 after cover after cover legendary shots
60:19 perfect
60:20 they said they trained him okay I know
60:24 people who are graduates of Brooks
60:26 Brooks Institute who if I gave them a so
60:29 blodd wired it to their chest and said
60:32 you can't look down I go to Disneyland
60:33 and take a bunch of great shots go to
60:35 the grand can take a bunch of great
60:36 shots but you can never look down on
60:37 this camera even with a PhD from Brooks
60:41 you ain't coming back with a full roll
60:43 of anything but crap okay I mean you
60:47 might be able to get some sterile
60:48 landscape shots but not the cool stuff
60:50 that Neal got right
60:51 you wouldn't even know ya what's on the
60:54 right and what's on the left I mean it's
60:56 just insane I grew up with the
60:57 photographer father it was a
60:58 professional I grew up with hostile
61:00 bloods my house anyone pointing to him
61:02 had two or three hostile buds in the
61:04 house so I'm extremely familiar with how
61:06 to use them got a load them out unload
61:08 them etc now the other problem is is
61:11 that the camera is going to be hot and
61:13 cold in the shadows according to NASA's
61:16 official story 280 degrees below zero
61:19 Fahrenheit in the Sun 280 degrees above
61:23 hey let's bring it down to 250 they
61:26 interviewed the guy that made the camera
61:27 that went to the moon or at least a
61:29 couple of them right Hasselblad stick
61:31 one year to assemble back in the day
61:32 maybe it's a little bit faster today
61:34 because they're like Swiss watches right
61:35 they're amazing
61:36 you cannot take metal and they took all
61:40 the leather fitting off it's a big metal
61:42 one but you can't take that heat it up
61:44 cool down eat it up cool down and use it
61:46 because the shutter inside is an
61:48 extremely delicate piece of steel the
61:51 Zeiss lenses what's gonna happen when
61:53 you heat it up that much and cool it
61:54 down in a split second it's going to a
61:57 rough shirt it's gonna break it's going
61:59 to expand and contract in the opposite
62:00 directions and you're gonna have a huge
62:02 problem on your hand the other thing too
62:06 is it I don't know if they account for
62:07 this but
62:09 there was any moisture at all in the
62:11 atmosphere inside the camera you're
62:13 gonna have huge issues one you'd see the
62:14 stars but two that's gonna do
62:16 condensation most likely because that
62:19 that heating that colds gonna transfer
62:20 directly into the camera through the
62:22 least busy salons at least from that
62:25 side of the camera right but there was
62:28 also a video camera wasn't there video
62:32 camera pretty much on every single
62:33 mission alright one Apollo 11 we have a
62:38 very interesting thing that goes on when
62:41 they're faking the footage of Earth
62:42 going away through this aperture window
62:46 this round window I should say it's a
62:49 beautiful color camera isn't it
62:51 beautiful when they film Neil Armstrong
62:54 coming down the ladder what do we have
62:59 we have the graininess crappiest piece
63:02 of footage you've ever seen in your life
63:03 like I showed you one of the previous
63:05 videos they broadcast it on a wall
63:07 inside Houston control and you had to
63:09 film it on a wall it's like a like a
63:13 screen it was horrible
63:15 you weren't allowed to have the original
63:16 feed because that would expose an earth
63:17 to earth transmission you could have
63:20 studied signal strength you could study
63:21 all kinds of stuff so they're creating
63:23 the crappiest footage they possibly can
63:25 in case anything goes wrong it's my
63:26 assumption right but why didn't buzz at
63:30 least out the door shoot another angle
63:34 with this beautiful color camera I
63:37 suppose they left it up in the module up
63:39 there right most important moment in the
63:43 history of man besides discovering fire
63:45 and the wheel and we're not shooting
63:47 that thing in the best color we can
63:48 possibly find
63:49 I called bogus [ __ ] on that but
63:53 that's not the biggest smoking gun one
63:55 of the best smoking guns you could ever
63:57 mention to anyone with half a brain is
63:59 it with this video camera you are
64:03 missing a shot from six successful
64:06 missions it would be the first shot
64:10 without being told by NASA you would
64:14 take this shot I don't care if it wasn't
64:16 on the list you would point the video
64:19 camera while it's running okay you film
64:22 the lunar lander you
64:23 film your buddy whoever that is and you
64:26 would point the camera at earth right
64:31 you'd point the camera at earth and say
64:33 holy [ __ ] there's our planet did they
64:35 ever do that no why didn't they do that
64:39 because they're in a set people and they
64:42 can't fake it the amount of effort it
64:45 would take to fake that shot one you
64:47 have to have a shot of the Earth from
64:48 space already developed in Earth's
64:52 possession to then blow it up and light
64:55 it somehow right so it's just gonna look
64:57 like a real Earth
64:58 but they never attempted it once because
65:01 it was a technical impossibility for
65:03 them to do so running tell your mom
65:07 about that now there are other missions
65:10 to the moon where they've shot a lot of
65:12 shots of solar panels and there's a
65:18 couple videos about this but the solar
65:20 panels are what they're sort of
65:22 reflective glass and closed membranes
65:27 that will take sunlight and use the
65:30 force of sunlight to metabolize up
65:32 electromagnetic waves that turn into
65:35 electricity so they can charge things on
65:37 the moon surface brilliant idea we would
65:40 do that if we went there the other
65:42 problem is is it's really reflective at
65:44 certain angles and there's a couple
65:47 images that were released before they
65:50 really thought it through and it's
65:51 reflecting the lit set in the other
65:54 direction now I've looked at these
65:56 photographs I really can't make anything
65:58 out but it's not reflecting the
66:01 blackness of space now if they're up
66:04 next to a mountain or a big rock it
66:06 might explain something but in future
66:08 versions of that footage of those images
66:10 someone has gone out and blacked out the
66:13 actual reflection to make sure that that
66:16 doesn't come up in any conversations
66:17 right hmm one of the other areas of
66:22 contention which was raised by a believe
66:24 a nephew of one of the astronauts were
66:27 the doors to the lunar lander the
66:31 measurements have never been taken but I
66:34 believe that he was able to get rid of a
66:36 get
66:37 excuse me the original schematics which
66:38 say that the doors are approximately 2
66:41 feet are a little bit less than 2 feet
66:42 in diameter and just so that you
66:45 understand your average hallway is about
66:48 3 feet wide okay that you and I could
66:52 definitely crawl through a two-foot door
66:53 now my shoulders are shoulder I'm not a
66:56 gigantic you know 6 foot 5 guy that's
66:59 probably about 2 feet okay now imagine I
67:03 put on an astronaut outfit that is
67:05 inflated so I'm much bigger than I am
67:09 I'm probably gaining at least 3 inches
67:11 on both sides about two and a half to
67:14 three inches at least
67:15 right I could have all kinds of padding
67:17 and shielding and also there's stuff to
67:18 fend off radiation hot and cold right
67:24 but they figured out that you can't get
67:26 through these doors fully inflated
67:29 inside one of these suits and there's
67:30 never been any footage ever not even a
67:33 picture of anyone coming out of the
67:36 actual door itself the hole that is the
67:39 door this nephew went to a museum with
67:43 an escort because he's a famous you know
67:45 nephew of a famous astronaut he doesn't
67:48 quite say that what he's doing so
67:50 they're just like do P do but they're
67:51 kind of suspect this guy you know
67:53 chaperoning him around looking out I'm a
67:56 little bit funny there's a video of this
67:58 not of all the looks and stuff but
68:02 there's a pretty exact replica I believe
68:06 this is in Florida and he says do you
68:09 mind if I get closer to it
68:11 and get on top of it and because there's
68:14 a ladder right there everyone if I just
68:15 measure the door at the top and the guy
68:18 shuts the whole escorting situation down
68:21 and says I think it's time for you to
68:23 leave so I think the guy walked away and
68:27 the guy actually got some measurements
68:28 I'm not quite sure but it proves a point
68:30 they couldn't fit through these doors
68:32 fully inflated now there's a famous shot
68:35 of Buzz Aldrin taken by Neil Armstrong
68:37 with his hand it's the most famous shot
68:40 you've ever seen he's got his hand and a
68:41 shirt his arm bent and they took the
68:45 shot buzz has got the you know this is
68:48 an actor it's not buzz but you know
68:49 whoever's in this thing's got the
68:51 gold-plated glass reflecting the
68:53 beautiful environment plus neil ticking
68:56 the shot supposedly and there's two two
69:00 big things with this particular shot
69:01 there's there's a light sourcing thing
69:03 as well which is a third factor to it a
69:06 lot of people believe that he wouldn't
69:09 be able to bend his hand a bit his elbow
69:12 excuse me as acutely as it is in the
69:13 shot
69:14 due to the inflation of the suit I don't
69:16 know anything about whether or not
69:18 that's possible or not I would imagine
69:19 they wouldn't make the suit so tight
69:22 that you couldn't bend your arms you
69:24 know like a c-3po problem
69:26 well John McCain problem don't know but
69:31 the other one is is that some people
69:32 think that the reflection in the glass
69:34 the you know the reflective chrome are
69:37 sorry not chrome but gold plated glass
69:39 shows an arm it's not as bent that it's
69:43 actually further out in the shot as if
69:45 they composited the glass after they do
69:48 the actual shot now one of the very
69:53 first documentaries I ever saw on this
69:55 other than Bart's probably after Bart's
69:58 movie funny thing happened on the way to
70:00 the moon you have a great documentary
70:05 out there I have no idea where this
70:06 thing is now but they they taught you
70:09 the history of counterfeiting money and
70:13 the experts that were then hired into
70:15 the alphabet agencies to protect against
70:18 counterfeiting but their major skill set
70:21 is microscopically splicing negatives
70:25 together to create composites if any of
70:28 you've ever seen the bug a shot of Lee
70:29 Harvey Oswald standing in his backyard
70:31 but the [ __ ] newspaper on one hand I
70:33 shot Kennedy or I'm gonna shoot Kennedy
70:35 and and his rifle on the other hand and
70:37 the shot under his neck is different
70:39 than the shadows on his face
70:40 they've composited a head on top of this
70:43 body pretty pretty smoking gun proof
70:47 there that that shot it's at least a
70:49 forgery so this these documentaries and
70:54 these with is the primary documentaries
70:56 for probably two or three years where
70:58 they went through every single shot and
71:00 they they looked at anomalies that are
71:04 a direct result and a classic result a
71:06 very well understood result of spicy
71:08 negatives together which is that you
71:10 will eventually lose part of the
71:12 original thing that you're splicing and
71:14 that some people believe that the
71:16 shadows on Buzz's body the actor playing
71:19 buzz are different than the shadows are
71:21 on the ground you know that's a little
71:23 meticulous for my money and my time but
71:26 if you're into that sort of thing you
71:28 might want to look into it but one of
71:30 the things that the Hasselblad had built
71:33 into the camera was a piece of glass
71:36 that actually had cross little plus
71:38 signs in certain intervals throughout
71:41 the fit photo so they could actually put
71:43 a camera on a tripod and rotate it and
71:46 they could stitch together all of these
71:48 images using these plus signs because
71:50 there's they're at the same level and
71:52 figure out you know might get a bunch
71:54 bigger shot or what-have-you right well
71:57 a lot of these plus signs because they
71:58 are so meticulously tiny they're
72:01 probably smaller than a human hair if
72:03 not the size of a human hair right when
72:06 they were slicing these things according
72:08 to the theory they just you know every
72:10 once in a while didn't get the full plus
72:12 sign in there and it was a lot of the
72:13 shots that actually have the the moon
72:16 buggy in the foreground and some stuff
72:17 in the background they're losing some of
72:20 the plus sign legs okay it's just a
72:24 matter of you know skillsets now NASA's
72:30 big claim is that that particular part
72:32 of the plus sign was overexposed the
72:35 only problem with that theory of over
72:37 exposing the plus sign is that this is
72:39 inside the camera it's it's sheet of
72:42 glass with the plus signs and then the
72:44 film is pressed up against the glass
72:46 with basically a shutter between it or
72:48 in front of it I'm not quite sure
72:50 exactly where it goes but it's extremely
72:52 close we're talking microns away from
72:53 the actual film so how light does Bend
72:57 because it's a wave of verbal reaction
73:00 it can wiggle around things but I'm not
73:03 sure if the frequency is so if it's if
73:06 it's the far apart to actually wiggle
73:08 around if that's the case then all these
73:09 plus signs should have disappeared the
73:11 second they took a shot you don't have
73:13 light behaving one way for the bottom
73:15 part of a plus sign and not for the
73:17 top in the sense that if that particular
73:19 part of the film was overexposing then
73:21 the whole plus sign is gonna disappear
73:22 but you're probably going to also have
73:24 damage to the actual exposure of the
73:26 film that you're never gonna recover
73:28 from like when you over expose shots in
73:31 in your camera you have a hot spot on
73:34 your forehead you'll never get that part
73:36 of the forehead back the information has
73:37 been lost forever because you
73:39 overexposed it right now the moon rocks
73:42 are another point of contingency what's
73:46 the theory you go up there you have a
73:49 big space in the bottom of your lunar
73:51 lander to put rocks I believe they said
73:53 that the total amount of rocks with a
73:55 brought back was somewhere around 600
73:57 pounds with all the missions together
73:59 and again it's not part of the Saturn
74:01 fives problem of launching because the
74:03 compartments empty so falling back to
74:06 earth with this you know a few rocks you
74:08 know about a hundred pounds worth of
74:09 rocks and each one of the landings
74:11 shouldn't be a big deal if you had the
74:14 Chrysler with you the car you pull it
74:16 out there's your chamber to put your
74:17 rocks in it's actually not really true
74:20 cuz it the cars on the bottom you have
74:22 to take the rocks out at the top the
74:25 theory behind the rocks is the following
74:27 if you have an object not from Earth we
74:31 can study its vibrational frequencies
74:34 and determine it's not an object from
74:36 this planet because everything on this
74:37 planet has one frequency and everything
74:39 from somewhere else as a different
74:40 frequency
74:42 well there were a lot of missions all
74:45 over the world prior to 1969 by NASA you
74:49 know a lot of it was oil worth looking
74:50 for the most hostile conditions that
74:52 would match what we believed the moon to
74:54 look like hey I'm sure that took place
74:56 too but what do deserts have and what do
75:03 scientists herbed earth and when you're
75:06 out there and undisturbed earth you
75:09 might you might walk into a desert
75:10 outside of Vegas that no human being has
75:12 walked on for a hundred years a little
75:15 bit in the settlers that came out here
75:16 are the Native Americans I'm talking
75:19 technically every square foot in the
75:21 desert right but there are clubs they
75:24 got in the desert and they find meteor
75:26 rocks usually pure iron
75:29 I'll have little residuals of other
75:31 things mostly pure iron and they sell
75:34 them go look it up it's all over the
75:36 place the Egyptians they they determine
75:40 that because a lot of people take
75:41 Egyptians are from outer space and when
75:44 they start looking at the bombing tools
75:45 of the Egyptians they said oh my god
75:47 these things are outer outer planetary
75:50 frequencies they were from space but
75:54 they also realized that all these tools
75:56 a lot of them are pure iron so someone
75:59 put two and two together and said you
76:00 know what they probably did they went
76:01 out in the desert and found these rocks
76:03 but they were bizarre melted them down
76:06 like that you know learned they were
76:08 very pliable and strong and so they were
76:10 making things out of meteorites in the
76:13 deserts of Africa it seems plausible but
76:19 when NASA needed to come up with a bunch
76:20 of rocks that will register as being not
76:24 of this earth they take all their
76:26 expedition expeditions to Antarctica to
76:28 the North Pole to Iceland Greenland
76:30 what-have-you and they pick up these
76:34 rocks buy them off people and hand him
76:37 in his space rocks there's a big kicker
76:40 to all this in the end of course now
76:43 NASA accidentally donated a rock they
76:48 turned out to be petrified wood nASA has
76:52 later said that it was just a miss
76:56 classification someone labelled
76:57 something wrong yeah because that one
77:00 NASA collects lots of petrified wood and
77:02 too they keep it right next to boom
77:05 rocks right complete and utter [ __ ]
77:09 okay don't buy that for any split second
77:11 it's just as bad as the metric two
77:13 standard conversion of the was that the
77:16 1998 probe that crashed into the surface
77:18 of Mars just an excuse because the
77:21 photos to fake that mission weren't
77:22 ready just as simple an ISO 9000 or
77:26 above manufacturing facility slash
77:30 methodology does not make a mistake
77:32 between metric and standards and there's
77:34 no way that you do a mission test and
77:36 not find that bug really quickly okay
77:40 now like I said just
77:42 recap real quickly they did reuse sets
77:44 at least twice they had the same
77:47 mountains in the background and all they
77:49 did was they rearranged the stuff on the
77:51 surface there's a lot of meticulous
77:53 versions of this but that's the very
77:54 best one where you can see the same
77:56 mountain scape in the background
77:57 NASA's cover story is that all those
77:59 mountains are way way out there in the
78:02 distance and they're so far out the
78:03 distance it's like being in eastern
78:05 Kansas looking at the Rocky Mountains
78:07 and then maybe you're in the southern
78:09 Colorado seeing the same mountains and
78:11 they're gonna look exactly the same from
78:13 the same angle complete and utter horse
78:15 crap right you know that's not true they
78:19 were saving money in hell the population
78:22 bought it so again the population bought
78:24 all this stuff they wanted to believe in
78:27 those you know a lot of people that
78:28 still want to believe some people
78:30 believe they don't care and once you
78:32 present this to them like oh yeah I
78:33 guess we didn't go all right whatever
78:35 what's on TV you know but now the thing
78:39 has to leave these guys have to get home
78:43 the top part of lunar lander the limb
78:46 was gonna pop off and go back up and
78:49 rendezvous with a module that's going
78:51 around the moon poor Michael Collins
78:54 never got to go down to the moon and
78:56 again I will say I accidentally said
78:58 that he passed away in Ojai in my first
79:01 episode I believe in episode 26 he is
79:04 still alive and well is the astronaut of
79:06 whose name escapes me who died in Ojai
79:08 it was coming up on the 40th anniversary
79:12 of the moon landing and there was a
79:14 rumor that he was going to blow the
79:17 whistle that he had told his friends
79:19 he's gonna blow the whistle not
79:20 realizing he was under heavy
79:21 surveillance and he died in a motorcycle
79:23 accident shame on me for not know his
79:26 name now the Apollo 11 take off back to
79:30 the lunar orbit was not filmed that was
79:34 a later one that you see the the big
79:37 blast underneath it you know these
79:38 particles come off and this thing pops
79:40 up and the camera tracks it up right now
79:43 the idea is how did that camera track up
79:45 who was operating the camera well I'm
79:48 gonna go with whatever theory they want
79:50 to go with remote controlling that thing
79:52 timing it it's just like taking a camera
79:54 and setting the timer and running
79:55 with your family getting in your own
79:56 shot right I think they could have
79:58 figured that out I don't think that's a
80:00 smoking gun
80:00 I wouldn't recommend telling anyone that
80:02 one as I understand it it's just an
80:05 explosive that's going off underneath
80:07 this thing that's their theory to blow
80:09 it up into outer space but if you really
80:11 think about it okay you have a 1200 mile
80:16 diameter ball it is not a lightweight
80:19 thing it does have one-sixth gravity of
80:21 Earth and that means that a you know a
80:26 60 pound child still gonna weight 10
80:28 pounds well if I take 10 pounds right
80:30 now and drop it it's gonna hit the floor
80:31 pretty damn hard right let's take an
80:34 adult to adults a bunch of crap 100
80:37 pounds of rock I don't know 5 or 600
80:41 pounds of the vehicle around you maybe a
80:42 ton around you half a ton it's not an
80:45 incidental amount of explosion that has
80:47 to go off underneath this thing to
80:48 jettison is so far into space but it
80:51 goes into orbit and rendezvous is with
80:52 no problem falling back down to earth
80:54 and it is not going in a orbital path
80:57 like most of our Rockets this is
80:59 actually technically speaking going
81:01 straight up into the air right that
81:06 entire manoeuvre is the most hocus-pocus
81:08 bunch of [ __ ] you've ever heard in
81:10 your life and it is one of the biggest
81:11 smoking guns but the unfortunate thing
81:14 is your average citizen doesn't know
81:16 enough about physics to see it for the
81:18 fraud that it is and so they get to lie
81:20 to everyone else now before we do the
81:24 rendezvous I need to track back here
81:27 one if the heliocentric model is true
81:30 and the Earth or the moon is a ball
81:33 duplicating these two sets in my
81:36 previous example doesn't work because
81:37 those mountains would have been way over
81:39 the edge okay especially from two
81:41 different angles it would have been two
81:42 different sets completely on such a
81:44 small surface but the other one that
81:48 you'll have thrown your face a lot is
81:49 this mirror that was left behind okay
81:54 now for those of you who aren't big
81:56 enthusiasts you might be like Mir what
81:57 the hell is the mirror all about the
82:00 mirror was to be the sort of the
82:08 pinnacle achievement of us measuring the
82:10 distance between us and other bodies in
82:12 space if you look at Pythagoras theorem
82:17 if you have so many sides of a triangle
82:20 you can start triangle eating how far
82:23 away things are especially what the
82:24 angles and what have you and so the idea
82:27 is if we can shoot a laser at the moon
82:31 and get it to bounce back and then we
82:33 study the angle of which we're looking
82:36 at the thing in space we can somehow
82:38 triangulate generally how far things are
82:40 with redshift and all kinds of things I
82:44 ran into a very detailed article online
82:48 that talked about the fact that we have
82:50 been bouncing light off of the moon in
82:52 laser form prior to 1969 it takes a
82:55 really long time to find the place that
82:56 bounces back everyone's looking for the
82:58 same place because it's one of the few
83:00 places that actually does it today you
83:03 have agencies that are talking about
83:05 advertising on the moon surface by
83:07 projecting massive lasers at the moon
83:08 and you'd see an advertisement on the
83:10 moon let's hope they don't do that right
83:12 it's already bad enough everything else
83:14 has got a sponsorship on it so for me
83:16 the mirror doesn't exist it never has
83:19 existed and that experiments worked
83:21 before the mirror ever happened to be
83:23 there now if you think about the idea of
83:25 this mirror okay again if you have a
83:27 crater like surface that's all
83:30 reflective white you should be able to
83:32 get that beam to come back to you pretty
83:34 quickly I mean it takes supposedly takes
83:36 universities meet weeks and weeks and
83:38 months to find the spot that bounces
83:40 back okay but you have a mirror on the
83:43 surface of the Moon there's rotating
83:46 around Earth were spinning its spinning
83:50 and even though we do see the same side
83:53 of the moon
83:54 it still waxes and wanes doesn't it the
83:57 idea that you can hit this thing and
83:59 bring it back from a mirror you're
84:01 increasing the difficulty of the
84:03 reflection algorithm by trying to hit a
84:05 stationary mirror object as opposed to a
84:08 gigantic flat spot of the moon and just
84:11 simply having the light bounced back
84:12 again if they can advertise on the moon
84:14 surface it's the same exact thing if my
84:16 eyeballs can see laser on the moon
84:19 surface well then I've already got
84:21 the triangle is a ssin I need where's
84:23 the laser at oh it's in Tokyo okay great
84:25 so I'm on the Pacific Coast here I'm
84:28 looking at the moon my distance
84:30 Tokyo back up to that light back to my
84:32 I've got triangle I'm good to go
84:34 right Tokyo certainly could do it right
84:38 New York LA whatever it's a it's a
84:41 flimsy piece of evidence that this
84:42 thing's happening but now you have this
84:45 maneuver the lamb is coming back up to
84:48 the lunar module up there this capsule
84:51 thing one it doesn't have enough thrust
84:56 to pull this off people it simply
84:57 doesn't okay to even though they push
85:03 this limb out in the orbit of Earth and
85:05 plate play with it in previous missions
85:07 and make sure it moves around a little
85:09 bit the trajectory coming up from the
85:12 earth and rendezvous with this unit is
85:15 never recreate able especially from the
85:19 moon so that is one of the most suspect
85:22 pieces of the mission that has the
85:25 highest level of volatility meaning
85:29 things could go wrong you you realize I
85:31 don't know do you realize if this thing
85:35 we're to miss that module bounce off of
85:39 it
85:40 never lock on those guys are lost in
85:43 space forever
85:45 and six out of six times you work
85:48 perfectly hmm right mm-hmm
85:56 just go look at all of NASA's failures
85:58 with first time things it's catastrophic
86:01 rockets exploding on the tarmac the
86:04 SpaceX rockets exploding on the tarmac
86:07 this is mm you know 21st century
86:10 technology still takes tests to get it
86:13 right no element of this mission is
86:15 going to go perfect the very first time
86:17 now sometimes things will go wrong but
86:19 it's not a life-threatening situation
86:20 what if they got the cameras out what if
86:23 they really went to the moon got the
86:24 cameras out took a bunch of pictures
86:25 came back and they're all overexposed
86:28 sorry folks other than the live feed
86:31 from the moon which is super easy to do
86:33 of course in 1969
86:35 the 35-millimeter footage isn't coming
86:38 back which is not 35-millimeter in a
86:40 household odd but you know what I mean
86:43 then there's the phone calls from the
86:45 surface of the Moon
86:47 some people have chimed in and I love it
86:50 this is what you guys are so awesome
86:54 what if listeners chimed in on the
86:55 comments I believe and said you know and
86:57 I was alive as a kid watching them the
87:00 the call from the moon he was
87:03 immediately in my gut I felt like this
87:04 was impossible now according to my
87:08 interviews with bart sibrel who's spent
87:09 his entire last 20 years studying this
87:12 at I'll probably last 30 years to be
87:14 honest studying all of this right he was
87:16 a believer when he was a kid and had his
87:19 mind turned by this Kingsley guy our
87:22 casing guy excuse me
87:24 Kingsley the actor it's a two second
87:27 delay to send a signal to the moon's
87:31 surface with it especially 1969
87:33 technology this is not light waves right
87:35 and then it takes someone to hear it in
87:39 their brain process of reply transmit it
87:44 back two more seconds so every single
87:47 thing you would say to Neil Armstrong
87:48 and back would be four seconds at a
87:50 minimum for any of you that were alive
87:53 in the 70s in the 80s and he ever did a
87:55 long-distance phone call especially
87:58 overseas there were delays
88:00 okay because the the transmission
88:04 technology on the surface of the earth
88:06 was slow so you're going to get more
88:10 delay than just the four seconds two
88:14 seconds up two seconds back and again
88:15 that's not accounting for someone having
88:17 to listen you see it all the time on
88:19 newscasts right where people are still
88:21 going well you know what do you see in
88:23 the hurricane whatever and this guy's
88:25 like sitting there going it's dead time
88:28 right as they listen and then they go oh
88:29 yeah well this is the thing and then
88:31 there's dead time back you know now
88:33 let's get into some of the big kickers
88:35 at the end of this story here you guys
88:38 know this if you're already on part of
88:40 the choir right this is good to remember
88:43 all this stuff nASA has now claimed that
88:47 they have lost
88:48 lost all of the evidence that got us to
88:54 the moon what does that mean that means
88:58 all of the footage all of the moon rocks
89:00 all the schematics for all of the
89:02 hardware that's the coveted f1 booster
89:05 typographer hmm now we still have
89:09 replicas of the lunar lander luckily
89:11 right I'm gonna get back to reinsurer in
89:15 a second what are the odds that they
89:17 lost this stuff how do you lose
89:19 something you can see all this crap in
89:22 my garage right that's an iMac right
89:26 there that Steve Jobs gave me that's why
89:29 I still have it now if I lose that right
89:32 there well how do I lose that I lose it
89:36 because I move it or I move I leave this
89:40 house and I forgot it was there and what
89:42 the hell do I put my Mack oh [ __ ] it's
89:43 still in the garage okay so how do you
89:48 lose all this footage well if you guys
89:51 can hear this rain but it's coming down
89:53 baby you lose it because you move it was
89:57 NASA moving around the most coveted
90:00 evidence in the entire world and every
90:04 single bit of it hell no they're not
90:07 moving it they know exactly where all
90:10 that stuff is there's iron mountains all
90:13 over the world right these mountains
90:14 that are all dug out and we have all of
90:16 our art in there I think Bill Gates
90:18 stuck all his art in there right you
90:21 mean to tell me this stuff isn't in some
90:23 really safe bunker
90:26 well obviously the truth of the matter
90:28 is they didn't lose it they still have
90:30 it but now we have enough engineering
90:33 know-how again to reconstruct the f1
90:36 booster and probably autocad and run it
90:40 what's one of the other telltale signs
90:42 we didn't go oh yeah we'd never been
90:44 back we've never been back don't you
90:48 think someone would we go if we can get
90:51 there 1969 technology okay what have we
90:55 mastered 1969 that we can't do today oh
90:59 wait nothing
91:02 nothing nothing that we can still do the
91:04 goofy dances that we used to do back in
91:07 the day we can play the music from back
91:08 in a day we can do anything that they
91:10 did back in that day if we wanted to
91:12 film a film in Technicolor we can still
91:16 do it
91:16 get out the old 35 millimeter cameras we
91:18 can still do it there's nothing that we
91:20 can't do except for go to the moon now
91:23 somebody say someone might say it's the
91:25 cost I really don't think so
91:29 you mean to tell me we can take a rover
91:32 to Mars a fuckload further away than the
91:35 moon safely but we can't take a person a
91:40 fraction of that distance an
91:41 infinitesimally of a fraction of the
91:43 distance when the rover weighs probably
91:46 four times as much as a human being I
91:48 don't buy it only China has claimed to
91:53 put a rover on the moon and it lived for
91:56 a lesson I think 48 hours the pictures
91:58 were absolutely laughable with brown
92:00 dirt everywhere hell maybe it's real no
92:03 but you know it died really quickly
92:05 again when China announced that they
92:08 were going to put a man on the moon in
92:09 2020 I believe it was around 2000 was
92:14 between 2003 and 2005 when they
92:15 announced Dick Cheney and Donald
92:17 Rumsfeld who are commanding the theater
92:20 of our retaliation for the strikes in
92:23 New York and other places that day they
92:28 stopped what they were doing to have an
92:29 emergency meeting with NASA why guys
92:33 what are you worried mmm we had to set
92:36 that one up talk to their partners over
92:38 there figure out what they think they're
92:40 going to simulate right but bart sibrel
92:44 brought up an amazing example that we
92:46 all need to be able to repeat so I'm
92:48 gonna try to do this really slow so you
92:50 guys can totally get it we announced
92:54 that we were going to go to the moon
92:55 what in 1961 Kennedy gave the speech put
93:02 a man on the moon bring him home safely
93:03 all within decades time okay
93:07 we've never done that before been right
93:09 Sputnik was up there roaming around we
93:11 had barely put anything up there in fact
93:13 underneath America you had accomplished
93:15 anything by that time
93:16 and here we make this outrageous goal
93:18 we're going to the moon back it was cool
93:20 I I support him a hundred percent but
93:24 the 747 took sixteen years I believe to
93:29 engineer we already had 30 40 years of
93:33 aviation experience if you really want
93:34 to go back to 1903 when the Wright
93:37 brothers flew I think 40 40 some feet in
93:41 the air
93:41 took a picture of it Patent Office
93:43 cock-blocked him in till 1907 they had
93:47 to fly their plane in Paris to prove it
93:49 worked and then all the sudden there's
93:51 all this [ __ ] to get it patented in
93:52 America it was an earlier time zone to
93:55 say we got it first I mean it's just
93:56 stupid writing 13 or 16 years somewhere
93:59 in there for the 747 but how many
94:02 attempts did it take a pushing the 747
94:05 down a runway before it actually took
94:06 off and could sustain flight according
94:10 to Bart over a hundred and sixty
94:12 attempts I think it was almost 170
94:15 attempts Wow we already had jets right
94:21 747 was just a bigger one so weird he
94:24 had this technology patented I mean
94:25 figured out but we couldn't figure out
94:28 how to get the 747 off the ground a
94:29 sustained 30,000 foot flight and the
94:34 time it took us to engineer the entire
94:37 moon missions successfully and execute
94:39 them in fact we were done with all of
94:42 our moon missions before the 747 from
94:44 inception to flight could take place
94:47 with pre-existing platforms and
94:49 technologies hopefully that's easy to
94:54 remember and easy to repeat so here
94:56 comes the lunar module and back to
94:59 Earth's atmosphere
95:04 the theory is is that getting back is
95:06 way easier than getting there and then
95:07 there's probably some truth out due to
95:09 the gravitational differences between
95:13 the two bodies in space okay so here
95:17 comes this thing I just beat this up
95:19 recently so here we go again they shaped
95:22 like a bullet isn't it remember the old
95:24 1905 movie wasn't oh five or Oh eight
95:27 where was and I apologize for not
95:30 knowing the name I guess I could pause
95:31 and look it up but it's the old movie
95:33 silent movie of them building a rocket
95:35 multistage rocket it goes to the moon
95:37 and the bullet lands in the eye of the
95:40 face of the moon and then they hop out
95:41 and they do some [ __ ] and they come back
95:42 really famous director they had at least
95:46 the wherewithal to say that the the
95:48 pointy thing is gonna go into the eye of
95:50 the moon because every time you fire a
95:52 gun or a piece of ordnance or a bomb
95:54 what part goes first the pointy part
95:58 because that's just the way it works you
96:01 can't get a bullet to turn around and
96:03 put its ass first
96:04 and at least hold that position you'd
96:05 have a really screwed up gun barrel and
96:07 maybe it rotates but you can't get it to
96:09 hold its position for the blast shield
96:11 that's what now still want you to
96:13 believe path of least resistance would
96:16 be the cone going down first be less
96:19 friction less of a problem you just
96:22 adjust your angle to be a little more
96:24 acute to create the resistance that you
96:26 need to stop the vehicle naturally using
96:29 the atmosphere or you pop those
96:32 parachutes out from a nice big round
96:36 circle in the back which could actually
96:38 house the actual parachutes poof you're
96:41 good
96:43 once you slow it down you can switch
96:45 parachutes jettison those switch to
96:47 another pair that turns it upright
96:48 whatever the wrath pops up in the bottom
96:50 and so it turns up and it's okay but
96:52 again the whole shape is kind of
96:53 ludicrous for the mission designing to
96:55 begin with so you don't only have to
96:57 correct a big design flaw but you saw it
97:01 didn't you the capsule falling out of
97:03 the sky three giant parachutes usually
97:06 coming down one of our listeners has
97:12 done a deep dive on these parachutes I'm
97:15 going to quote the the listener because
97:17 I have not done the
97:18 but apparently NASA's claim was that the
97:20 parachutes were compressed to the
97:23 consistency of wood being so compress
97:26 right if you held the parachute in your
97:28 hand it's a solid brick a parachute and
97:32 I don't know how they you think you know
97:34 it was a little rocket that kicks it
97:35 into space to unfold this thing and
97:37 supposedly this fabric is gonna survive
97:38 being super compressed and then super
97:41 expanded sounds like a bunch of hokey
97:43 [ __ ] doesn't it because the idea is you
97:48 can't have these parachutes out before
97:50 this reentry of the official story takes
97:53 place the big blast shield on the bottom
97:55 big Burnie blast shield you just saw
97:57 this thing recreated for the latest Mars
98:00 landing here in November of 2018 the
98:05 notion is was not enough room on the top
98:08 of this thing to house these parachutes
98:09 because they're gonna have to be housed
98:11 inside of the steel enclosure to keep
98:15 them from burning up but even if they're
98:18 inside of a steel steel enclosure I
98:20 don't know how many of you but I
98:22 wouldn't want to hold a steel pot Maul
98:25 one side of its being heated up because
98:27 it does transfer excited vibration which
98:31 is called heat directly inside the the
98:35 capsule of the container what's weird is
98:38 I do currently believe he went into low
98:41 orbit now I've heard outrageous theories
98:45 okay I should say or I should say
98:47 controversial theories but the
98:49 astronauts actually never left and that
98:52 they were actually put inside the
98:54 capsule taken up in a jumbo jet pushed
98:57 out parachutes are right there boom and
98:58 they land I don't know maybe I think
99:02 that they did fake images of the earth
99:06 out of a portal window that for me puts
99:09 them at least in the orbit
99:10 I had actually mentioned that you would
99:13 need a fisheye lens to really get them
99:15 the majority of Earth from 200 miles up
99:18 I still pretty much hold to that theory
99:21 because I think you're only about two
99:23 and a half percent off of the Earth's
99:25 surface according to its diameter so I
99:28 still believe you would need some sort
99:30 of
99:31 exaggerated lens to capture more light
99:34 left and right to really grab the world
99:37 in the shot but um Paulo I believe 17
99:40 coming back they took this shot of the
99:43 Earth from space proof right proof we
99:46 went they call it the blue marble shot
99:48 just cover this in one of my previous
99:50 episodes I have analyzed the original
99:53 shot that came from the Apollo 17 and
99:55 they have screwed up a couple things one
99:58 all the proportions of Africa and
100:01 Madagascar Madagascar is far far further
100:05 north on the map than it is on Google
100:07 Maps now we also know that Google Maps
100:10 isn't right because of the Peter
100:11 projection map which proves that the
100:14 continents are actually not the right
100:16 proportions still the same shape but not
100:19 the right proportions everything's a
100:21 little more vertically stretched in real
100:23 life this was petitioned as I have seen
100:28 it in multiple locations it's even been
100:30 written into sitcoms and shows on TV
100:33 that in the early 50s the people that
100:35 actually determined the true shape of
100:38 all the continents petitioned to have
100:39 all of the globe's around the world
100:41 swapped out for these adjusted
100:43 proportions and they were denied because
100:46 that would reveal that the authorities
100:48 don't know what they're talking about
100:49 which i think is an exaggeration if
100:51 there ever was an e but the big problem
100:55 with the blue marble shot is it
100:57 originally was portrayed in coffee-table
100:59 books all over the world is that the
101:02 black sea is completely screwed up in
101:05 its composite it is zigzaggy that
101:08 actually terminates and then restarts
101:10 and terminates and restarts they have
101:13 since corrected this shot so if you go
101:15 look up the blue marble shot today you
101:17 have to scroll way down in google images
101:19 to find the original I'm assuming that
101:22 in a decade if we don't change this
101:23 planet
101:24 the original will disappear and they'll
101:26 be like you're mistaken
101:28 so I'm baking it in all my episodes I
101:30 would highly recommend snapshotting that
101:34 and sending it around the planet so that
101:36 you don't lose it but that's another
101:38 gigantic smoking gun it was a composite
101:41 shot from high-altitude planes taking
101:44 shots of the earth the last shot
101:47 composited by NASA of the earth from
101:49 space was indeed a composite the artist
101:52 who was interviewed by some you know
101:55 NASA fan interviewed the kid who did the
101:58 work and he showed you how he did all
102:00 the layers and at the very end of the
102:01 interview he said she was well it's a
102:03 composite then right it's not a shot
102:05 from space yes it's a composite it has
102:07 to be it's a composite it has to be what
102:10 she was repeated and I believe a
102:12 journalism video okay well if we have
102:16 all these geocentric orbits a satellites
102:18 all around the planet one of them should
102:20 have a live feed of Earth from space but
102:24 that doesn't exist because it can't
102:26 exists and that's the problem now there
102:30 were a lot of missions to the moon but I
102:32 think that this particular episode will
102:35 tidy up the very fundamentals of the
102:39 forgery that is then repeated over and
102:42 over and over again they got better at
102:44 the forgery and some of those areas and
102:47 some of those areas they had to repeat
102:48 the mistakes because in order to correct
102:51 the mistake acknowledges at the very
102:53 first mission Apollo 11 was the complete
102:56 forgery now again there's a lot of
103:01 disinformation going around suggesting
103:03 that they really did go to the moon they
103:05 found a bunch of aliens and therefore
103:07 they had to use Stanley Kubrick's fake
103:08 footage of the moon landing to cover for
103:11 the fact that these aliens existed the
103:13 [ __ ] behind that is very simple
103:15 there's no way in hell they had all this
103:18 ready in a soundstage and could have
103:22 anticipated supposedly finding all these
103:24 spaceships which were drawn by some
103:26 ancient artifact who's now passed away
103:28 god bless him at 94 who was selling the
103:31 book at the last second of his life to
103:34 push forth this big bunch of
103:36 disinformation there's no way they'd
103:39 have everything ready right with his
103:42 anticipation that would work again
103:44 having much of fake footage on the side
103:46 just in case the missions don't go well
103:47 doesn't make any sense because what me
103:50 what does it mean that it doesn't go
103:51 well it means that all the astronauts
103:55 died
103:56 what do you do you've broadcast all this
103:59 pristine great footage of everything
104:01 going great and then you say up they
104:02 died three fathers erased from history
104:07 America would have failed and then what
104:09 would have happened to all the other
104:10 missions they would have disappeared
104:13 wouldn't they
104:15 we've got telescopes that can see the
104:17 surface of the Moon at incredible levels
104:20 of detail there are no spaceships flying
104:22 around as much as you've got what is it
104:25 John Lear trying to tell you every
104:27 single bump and nuke and cranny is a
104:28 Space Station up there I don't buy that
104:31 for a second one of the most fascinating
104:33 things that I've mentioned in previous
104:35 episodes is that the people that
104:36 believed he went to the moon
104:38 most often effortlessly believe that
104:42 there's aliens on the moon that it was a
104:45 big giant cover-up that there were you
104:49 know space bases up there that we were
104:51 escorted in subsequent trips but then
104:55 we're told not to go they contradict
104:58 themselves left and right you know we
105:01 could add a couple more hours of
105:02 meticulous analysis of photographs of
105:06 the science but I think that with this
105:09 amount of knowledge you've got pretty
105:12 much all the arrows in your quiver to
105:15 win a good argument against the fact
105:17 that we went it doesn't look like the
105:21 government is remotely ready to admit
105:23 that we didn't go
105:25 since the recording of my last moon
105:27 episode in today Russia has appointed a
105:31 council to validate whether or not
105:34 America went I am sure that is an
105:37 outward threat to our country but
105:40 they're gonna prove we didn't go they
105:42 had the better boosters their boosters
105:45 were two-and-a-half times more powerful
105:46 than our f1 boosters they had several
105:50 rocket designs and they said it under
105:52 all circumstances with I think fair
105:55 level of integrity they couldn't make it
105:58 they couldn't begin to make it and they
106:00 hadn't remotely dealt with the Van Allen
106:03 belts the atmospheric problems the heat
106:05 and the cold all these different
106:06 theories that are supposedly true
106:08 I take my hat off to them in that
106:11 respect we do believe that the Russians
106:14 faked perhaps we know they faked one of
106:18 their missions and got one of their guys
106:19 killed they have one guy they said was
106:22 an astronaut that never went up I mean
106:23 there's all kinds of [ __ ] you know
106:26 before you get to the actual attempts to
106:28 go to the moon there are issues before
106:32 Apollo 11 that we think a lot of the
106:34 spacewalks might have been animated
106:37 models you know like stop action maybe
106:42 I'll let you guys make up your own you
106:45 know opinion about that for me we don't
106:47 need that level of forgery to get to the
106:50 real deal will we go hopefully if the
106:57 current organizations that are
106:58 responsible for such a thing are left in
107:00 charge and intact I can tell you that
107:03 the likelihood that we will go is slim
107:05 to none because they don't have to why
107:10 risk it
107:10 it can take all of our money do better
107:12 CG better footage and there's no way for
107:16 us to know now they said that they have
107:18 taken photographs of the lunar landers
107:20 and various locations on the moon using
107:22 you know reconnaissance satellites and
107:24 what-have-you the problem with that is
107:26 that the lunar lander size on the
107:29 surface of the moon is actually four
107:31 times larger than it was in real life
107:33 and we know that because they tell us
107:35 what every single pixel in a photograph
107:37 is worth in terms of cubic footage on
107:39 the ground and when they we do those
107:41 translations and we see the four feet of
107:43 the base that's left behind it's four
107:46 times bigger than it really was so those
107:48 are complete forgeries being an expert
107:51 in several graphical products but
107:53 definitely Photoshop I can tell you that
107:55 what I was presented as proof that those
107:57 landing sites are really there I could
108:00 forge in less than half an hour
108:03 especially looking at the original no
108:06 more than half an hour if I'd never seen
108:08 one of these I could have done it in
108:11 less time but then I would have asked
108:12 the basic question well how big is this
108:15 ground well let's do some scale well
108:18 you're not gonna be able to see it if we
108:19 do true scale well so what
108:21 then we put a little er dot we don't put
108:24 four extra dots to say that this is a
108:26 feat but they know their audience they
108:31 know how to sell product to their
108:33 audience
108:34 it's a wishful thinking group of people
108:36 we know that this world worships fiction
108:41 we have people that or I could say
108:46 better way to say it is that in in
108:49 history in this planet we have had
108:51 mythical characters written into our
108:54 past like King Arthur right
108:57 like all of the the gods of Egypt
109:01 sheera the god of destruction all these
109:05 mythical characters Buddha so I guess he
109:10 turned into a snake at one point right
109:12 and every single one of those according
109:17 to our country never existed because
109:19 those are laughable myths right Anubis
109:22 the guy with a anteater head Yeah right
109:25 just instantaneously write them off but
109:30 in this country we still worship at
109:33 least one mythical character that never
109:34 existed on the face of this planet and
109:36 that should show you the the temperament
109:39 and the suspension of disbelief that the
109:43 population that holds the pride that we
109:47 went to the moon is still willing to
109:49 engage in on a daily basis so because we
109:51 are able to hang on to ridiculous
109:55 ridiculous assertions to manage our
109:59 life's by right I mean it's okay to take
110:02 it as allegory and say this person
110:04 taught me how to be a good person that's
110:05 perfect that's great that's what you
110:06 take you learn lessons from the greatest
110:09 writers that ever lived
110:10 inspired by probably some central
110:12 consciousness right so some truth to it
110:15 I'm not mentioning names for a very
110:18 specific reason I thought it was really
110:21 strange like 10-15 years ago and I
110:23 started waking up that I would hear
110:27 someone critically think about various
110:30 conspiracies in recent history last 20
110:33 years of our life and have
110:34 all the meticulous science and details
110:37 to say this didn't happen the way the
110:39 official story said the boon is just one
110:42 is 50 years old I think we have to have
110:45 the courage as human beings because
110:47 we're the top game on this planet to be
110:49 able to to look at some of this stuff
110:52 and go come on guys we need to give it
110:55 all up take what is good about it and
110:57 leave behind the fiction acknowledge it
111:00 for what it exactly is so that we can
111:02 actually start start the tires gripping
111:06 the ground so we can move forward if we
111:09 continually lie to our children that we
111:10 went to the moon those children will
111:12 lose any mysticism about going to the
111:15 moon yeah whatever I don't go back there
111:17 and everybody been there I'm gonna go to
111:18 like Alpha Centauri or whatever and
111:22 they'll die trying because they haven't
111:24 conquered the most basic thing which
111:26 would be our moon I don't know if it's
111:28 important that we go you know seems like
111:31 a fun thing to do more than anything
111:32 right who knows if we could survive up
111:35 there one-sixth gravity without losing
111:37 all of our bone density and you know
111:39 getting acid reflux or something right
111:41 we have robots Boston dynamic robots
111:45 right we should be able to put those
111:47 things up there first
111:49 we have Rovers we should be able to put
111:50 those things up there first for real
111:52 right anyway I think you feel me if you
111:58 have been a deep thoughts radio please
111:59 go there's audio video a lakh Facebook
112:01 group and a patreon page we're gonna do
112:04 a short bumper today if you made it to
112:05 the end there's an intellectual trophy
112:08 for you for me to you thank you so much
112:10 take care of yourself in someone else
112:11 and I'll see in the next deep thoughts
112:13 over down
