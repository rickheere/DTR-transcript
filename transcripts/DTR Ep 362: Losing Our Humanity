00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen so you know I've made a lot of
00:38 shows and it is not easy coming up with
00:42 shows that interest me all the time so I
00:48 takes me a little while sometimes some
00:52 weeks I could think up a million ideas
00:54 some weeks I'm like I Who am I
00:57 but today I've actually discovered one
01:00 that is near and dear to my heart and it
01:03 has to do with our humanity it's funny I
01:07 always think of that scene in Super
01:08 Troopers the guys he's on a cell phone
01:11 calling his girlfriend
01:13 he's hypo she's police and he says oh
01:17 the humanity for those of you know the
01:21 scene you'll laugh what I'm going to do
01:24 in this episode is try to illustrate the
01:26 fact that I think that our humanity is
01:31 being turned off it used to be the
01:35 absolute cornerstone of our every second
01:38 of existence and I think it's through
01:41 story that it's being turned off for
01:46 instance I think Humanity is being
01:49 replaced with exhibition in my eyes I
01:53 can't give you a better example than the
01:55 remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate
01:58 Factory there's a 1973 version and then
02:03 there's whatever Tim Burton's version
02:06 now I understand remaking that movie
02:09 technically speaking because the kids of
02:11 today may or may not be mystified by the
02:16 old movie they might see through the
02:19 props thus killing the illusion I
02:22 actually don't think that if you raise
02:27 your kids with it to begin with that
02:30 they're ever gonna notice anything I
02:31 raised my daughter in that movie and by
02:35 the way I mean she just adored that film
02:38 plus Wizard of Oz three amigos
02:43 explorers those kind of movies and now
02:47 I've given this example several times
02:48 but I think here's what's gonna be
02:51 really cool about this episode we're
02:56 always trying to figure out where they
02:57 are disembodied and it's kind of this
03:03 abstract target well I felt like yeah
03:05 there was more that and that's annoying
03:07 but I don't know that we've actually
03:09 said why is that annoying why is that
03:12 less than what it was before why am i
03:15 coming away totally unsatisfied now I
03:19 guess I should say there's gonna be a
03:20 spoiler for either movie if you haven't
03:23 seen it I've seen the movie I've seen
03:26 the 73 version I don't know 50 60 70
03:28 times if I watched it right now
03:31 I would there's a little tiny part of me
03:34 that would choke up inside when I see
03:35 the finale simply because we've lost
03:39 this humanity so the plot of the first
03:41 movie is very similar to the plot of the
03:45 second remake of it but it's missing one
03:47 thing it's missing its humanity Charlie
03:50 Bucket is obviously a really poor kid
03:52 and he wants a golden ticket he lives in
03:55 a [ __ ] his grandparents are stuck in
03:59 the beds at his house or he's got two
04:01 couples his mother's just slaving away
04:05 he's throwing newspapers and doing
04:07 whatever he can do to raise money to buy
04:09 a loaf of bread for God's sakes and so
04:12 he really wants this ticket so his
04:14 grandfather helps him I mean he earned
04:16 some money his grandfather like pulls
04:19 out a coin he's been saving forever so
04:20 can go buy these candy bars to see if he
04:22 can have the golden ticket meanwhile
04:24 there's like four other kids out there
04:26 see two girls two boys yeah four other
04:30 kids out there that are rich as hell and
04:33 their parents are just opening hundreds
04:35 of boxes so eventually when we think
04:39 he's lost down and out someone's already
04:41 claimed to have the last ticket we find
04:43 out that that with ticket last ticket
04:44 was a fraud and he ends up finding some
04:48 money and a rain drain runs in grabs the
04:50 damn thing and gets the ticket
04:52 unbelievable right but each time in the
04:56 first
04:56 film that a kid gets a ticket they're
04:59 yelling and screaming I got the ticket I
05:01 got the ticket but there's this guy
05:03 named slugworth he supposedly owns the
05:06 competitive chocolate company so he's
05:10 you know he's uh Willy Wonka's nemesis
05:14 and he goes up to each one of the kids
05:16 and he's whispering in their ears and
05:18 the deal he's making them is if you get
05:21 inside Willy Wonka's factory he makes
05:24 something called the Everlasting
05:25 Gobstopper I want you to steal one bring
05:28 it to me
05:29 and I'll give you so much money you
05:32 won't know what to do with it right so
05:35 will we go into the park or we go into
05:39 the Chocolate Factory
05:41 gene Wilder plays the first one he does
05:45 a phenomenal job I mean Johnny Depp did
05:47 a phenomenal job - he just had a but I
05:48 think a weak script but he took the
05:51 lines that he had and he blew him up
05:52 fairly well but it goes all the way
05:55 through the movie where each kid is you
05:57 know not knowing what they're told and
05:59 four out of five kids have to leave the
06:02 factory because they're literally
06:03 physically transformed in some way that
06:05 they need help one chick turns into a
06:09 blueberry one kid gets stuck in the
06:11 chocolate piping but ghostess gloom rook
06:18 assaults drops through a bad egg chamber
06:21 and Mike teevee gets turned into a
06:23 little tiny version of himself and
06:26 Charlie Bucket almost dies at the fizzy
06:29 lifting drink machine but they managed
06:32 to kind of get themselves down but when
06:35 they get to the end of the film the
06:38 whole idea is that you get a lifetime
06:39 supply of chocolate just having woman
06:42 the ticket but the very beginning of the
06:45 movie when they first go into the fact
06:46 that they have to sign this gigantic
06:47 contract of which the writing is
06:49 comically getting teeny aren t near at
06:51 the bottom to the point you can't read
06:54 it at all so they've signed it to some
06:58 terms that they have no idea about it
07:01 gets to the end and the grandfather says
07:04 we'll do we get our lifetime supply of
07:05 chocolate now and he says no you you
07:07 touch the fizzy lifting drink machine
07:10 which now has to be clean and sterilized
07:12 she didn't follow the rules screw you
07:15 you get nothing and the grandfather's
07:18 like just shocked he's like you're a
07:24 monster how how could you do that to a
07:28 child he says come on Charlie we don't
07:34 need a lifetime supply of chocolate but
07:38 Charlie knows there's something else
07:39 going on here
07:40 well the grandfather says - if slugworth
07:43 wants his thing we're gonna give it to
07:45 him but Charlie just sees the point of
07:51 the moment he sees what kind of person
07:55 Willy Wonka really is he sees himself as
08:00 being a an amoral rule-breaker he's a
08:04 thief he is literally conspired to steal
08:07 something out of the chocolate factory
08:10 and he walks up to Willy Wonka who's
08:14 sitting in a half desk it's pretty funny
08:16 everything's half piece papers half the
08:18 pins have everything's half fact he's
08:20 even whiter Perry glasses I think it's
08:21 just half [ __ ] hilarious men and his
08:25 little hand reaches up and drops off the
08:29 Everlasting Gobstopper
08:31 and then Gene Wilder delivers probably
08:34 one of the best lines ever written in
08:36 any movie ever he says so shines a good
08:40 deed in a weary world he places his hand
08:44 on it
08:45 and Charlie sort of in tears as he walks
08:48 away and then Willy Wonka spins around
08:53 he says Charlie you did it and then the
08:59 grandfather was like you know what are
09:00 you talking about you were just being a
09:02 real big jerk just a few seconds ago he
09:05 says you did it
09:06 and then this door opens up just like
09:10 closet door opens up and out walks this
09:12 actor who was playing slugworth he says
09:17 this is slugworth you know they're all
09:18 like whoa what the hell's going on he's
09:19 like he works for me I needed to know
09:24 that you wouldn't stab me in the back
09:28 with this thing I needed to know that
09:30 given an amazing opportunity and you're
09:32 the poorest kid out of the whole bunch
09:34 of the five I needed to know that you
09:38 wouldn't take something from me and then
09:42 he gives the kid the whole Factory and
09:43 he says you can against life's a
09:45 lifetime supply of chocolate cuz you're
09:47 taking over I had to do this stunt to
09:50 filter kids to take this over all right
09:58 think about the multiple levels of
10:01 humanity moral of ticks lessons in life
10:05 that are just in the last probably three
10:07 to five minutes of that movie I mean
10:09 there's more beyond that point when they
10:10 fly the glass elevator run but just in
10:13 that scene everything built up to pop
10:17 all those items it's absolutely
10:22 masterful storytelling and supposedly
10:26 that last line I just told you about
10:28 they didn't have that line in the script
10:32 realize they had just an emptiness to it
10:35 called the writer from England he was in
10:38 some mother set in New York and just on
10:41 the telephone he just makes it up and
10:43 there it is I mean that's where you just
10:45 let the universe go through you right
10:46 the philip k dick river of truth or a
10:48 river of knowledge or whatever the most
10:51 beautiful thing just happens when you
10:52 just listen to the universe but now what
10:56 about the remake do you remember
10:59 anything you like that in the remake do
11:00 you remember a slugworth do you remember
11:02 the kids not you know kids trying to
11:05 steal something do you remember do you
11:10 remember it being about Charlie at all
11:12 cuz I sure as hell don't
11:14 I remember being all about Willy Wonka
11:16 and his weirdo dad who's the dentist and
11:20 it's all about getting cavities and his
11:22 father disappears it's all about his his
11:25 situation and then his situation is
11:27 really just a psychopathic abusive
11:29 father that he has to get over okay
11:34 where's the demographic in that
11:36 well we got a bunch of kids that are now
11:38 we don't you know we don't have good
11:39 kids trying to remain good in a
11:41 beautiful mr. Rogers Ark we have a bunch
11:45 of parents completely strung out on
11:47 materialism consumption and they are
11:50 beating their kids at night so this will
11:52 really appeal to the masses on that
11:53 level it's the most unfocused
11:58 film and of course they say oh it's more
12:01 like the original book hey I haven't
12:06 read the original book but the cast and
12:11 crew and the writing team of 1973 did
12:14 you a huge favor all you needed to do
12:15 was take it which is to recreate in your
12:19 own way what was going on there we don't
12:24 have to have every square ounce of the
12:25 world injecting humanity into it but it
12:31 used to be like that think about all of
12:34 the fables that came out of the
12:36 Babylonians all of the tales that came
12:40 out of the Egyptians when you truly read
12:42 their storytelling hieroglyphs the
12:43 prodigal son is an Egyptian hieroglyph
12:46 all the Greek plays the famous Greek
12:49 plays all of Shakespeare's work all of
12:54 it
12:54 our Francis Bacon however you like to
12:57 think about that all the musicals that
13:00 ever really were famous up until maybe
13:03 this the 80s that starts to fracture
13:08 everything had a super-duper point of
13:12 impacting the hearts of the audience and
13:16 today everything is so [ __ ] diluted
13:20 meaning watered down so exhibition
13:24 you've got scenes you watch and you're
13:26 like oh okay it's another 15-minute
13:29 robot fight scene now you can have a
13:34 robot fight scene go for half an hour
13:35 with everyone crying their eyes out in
13:38 the theater as long as you link that
13:41 what's at stake to something that is
13:44 absolutely [ __ ] huge beyond just save
13:48 the planet
13:50 singing bad but you know puppy dog dies
13:53 over there and a kitty cat dies over
13:55 there so something's gonna go down here
13:57 and it's gonna break your heart in the
13:58 end it's a horrible example for what I'm
14:02 trying to say here but we are losing
14:05 ourselves the more that we feed some
14:10 fiction into our minds now some things
14:13 on TV are so unbelievably rhetorically
14:18 retrospectively deep that it's
14:23 potentially causing us to expand our
14:26 thinking to be enlightened I think the
14:29 writing in HBO's West world is some of
14:33 the finest storytelling ever if you
14:38 don't come out of that series even just
14:41 the first series the first season excuse
14:43 me capable of thinking of yourself more
14:47 as a machine than a than this spiritual
14:50 human you have to go through that cycle
14:52 you know you will probably return to
14:54 being a spiritual being but they do such
14:58 a masterful job illustrating the
15:02 functionality of a host versus the
15:04 common understanding of a guest which is
15:07 a human Anthony Hopkins has some lines
15:11 where he is reflecting on his former
15:14 partners philosophies of how to build
15:16 the mind of these robots and Anthony
15:19 Hopkins is playing the beautifully
15:22 written he's playing the secular side of
15:24 the game there is no consciousness
15:26 consciousness is absolutely an illusion
15:29 you have no soul we are simply these
15:31 instinctual robots the golden loops
15:33 where as Arnold his previous partner
15:39 that he's always referring to really
15:43 noticed that he was bringing these
15:45 creatures to life I mean that the hosts
15:47 actually achieved by any definition true
15:52 artificial intelligent to intelligent
15:56 life the one thing about West Road
16:00 that's interesting is that
16:02 you know this is written by michael
16:04 crichton god bless that guy he died I
16:07 think 50 years old just horrendous loss
16:10 we lost Rod Serling at 50 and we're
16:14 losing Michael Crichton it we lost
16:16 Michael Crichton at 50 but the
16:19 low-hanging fruit that you understand
16:21 about the show when you just get to the
16:24 very first show I mean you be halfway
16:26 through the very first season one
16:27 episode one and you will realize the
16:29 people that are getting off this train
16:30 to visit this virtual world I mean it's
16:33 a real physical world but it's obviously
16:36 built out of a bunch of androids that
16:39 they call hosts that the humans are
16:42 there to do things that they could never
16:44 do back in the real world such as be
16:47 someone like Total Recall to be
16:48 something that they've never been before
16:49 but they've always felt they had the
16:51 capability of doing it inside there
16:53 inside their hearts right so they dress
16:55 them up like Cowboys some of them come
16:58 stag so I'm going to come with their
17:00 buddies some of them come with their
17:01 wives or I guess you could say husbands
17:05 and they're just there to sling guns and
17:10 have sex and drink do it all over until
17:14 they have to leave like $40,000 a day
17:17 but you see this carnage that's coming
17:21 out of humanity they are walking into
17:23 bars having a - couple drinks and losing
17:26 their [ __ ] and blowing people away
17:27 shooting women shooting prostitutes you
17:31 know shooting other guys in the room and
17:35 that is something that in the real world
17:37 even if it was the wild wild west you
17:41 probably wouldn't do that because of the
17:43 ramifications one or breaking the law
17:45 but two you have to live with those
17:47 choices but supposedly in this virtual
17:51 West world they can kill a human being
17:53 slaughtered them basically with bullets
17:55 and go back home and sleep fine I think
17:59 West world's a very valuable gift to the
18:02 mind to sift through a bunch of
18:04 different things and then their take is
18:07 an again first episode they're saying
18:09 look you know you're gonna come in here
18:12 and you're going to shoot people you're
18:15 going to drink
18:16 I have sex or whatever but the deeper
18:20 game is that you end up finding out who
18:22 you really are
18:23 over time do you really have the guts to
18:27 do this long term because anyone could
18:30 do a crazy thing one time you could jump
18:34 out of a plane one time you could take
18:37 it dare that's just insane one time but
18:41 in West world you find out if that's
18:42 actually a part of your inner clock you
18:45 know back in the day when I was a kid
18:48 you know the smallest sitcom on TV had
18:52 the biggest lessons of all time you know
18:54 like Leave It to Beaver was really just
18:57 kind of a moral playbook for kids to
18:59 watch as they would make bad decisions
19:01 to lie and hide things and steal or
19:04 whatever whether it be accidental or
19:06 intentional at the end of the game at
19:09 the end of the you know 25 minute
19:10 episode or whatever it's all resolved
19:12 and we learned not to do that and that's
19:15 cool then you're getting the 70s we got
19:19 the Jeffersons we've got good times we
19:22 have three Three's Company which a
19:25 little lighter right through so that's
19:26 where we start getting lighter but we
19:28 had just a ton of them right different
19:30 strokes all these things eight is enough
19:32 most of the shows was heavily dramatized
19:36 towards a particular moral uptick then
19:40 things just got circumstantial things
19:44 are occurring in episodes that are kind
19:46 of entertaining your brain but at the
19:48 end you don't care it boils off by the
19:52 90s
19:52 you got the WB network cranking out show
19:55 after show after show and it's just it
19:59 was just boring because there was no
20:02 intellectual food for your mind and
20:04 whether or not you can sense it
20:06 consciously or unconsciously you're
20:09 sensing it you know scary movies get
20:14 ridiculously popular after after
20:16 Halloween after John Carpenter's
20:18 Halloween again there were scary movies
20:20 allow me back to Ed woods era but boy
20:23 after Halloween we got Friday the 13th
20:26 we got Freddy Krueger we got all these
20:28 you know
20:29 Texas Chainsaw Massacre is in the 70s
20:31 but yeah those words like back there but
20:36 those are heavily exhibitionistic right
20:38 I mean there's not a lot of even The
20:40 Exorcist
20:41 it's an amazing film it is an amazing
20:44 film but what's the moral uptake don't
20:49 get possessed by the devil
20:50 I don't think so a little girl didn't go
20:53 into some satanic ritual so you just
20:56 happened to come down with this and then
20:57 the preachers work really hard to save
21:01 her but now some of you may live your
21:04 life and understand more life takes you
21:06 may be older than me and so you grew up
21:09 with them so you exude them but it's not
21:12 easy to live an archetype of moral
21:16 uptick is it what do I mean by that so
21:20 you're a grandfather grandmother and
21:22 you're participating in the raising of
21:25 your grandchildren let's just say and so
21:30 usually it was a situation where you
21:32 would have a life that was formatted to
21:36 have the kids behave inside of some
21:38 envelope and nowadays more often than
21:40 not that I see it's well these kids are
21:44 completely out of [ __ ] control
21:46 because we're not raising them at all
21:48 and so we're gonna dump them off with
21:50 Grandma and Grandpa and they are gonna
21:51 just have to control them just like
21:55 Tasmanian Devils boy when it wasn't that
22:00 way when I was a kid it wasn't that way
22:04 one we behaved back in the 70s we had
22:09 something called spankings and boy are
22:11 they effective
22:13 and this whole thing about not spanking
22:15 your kids jeez man yeah maybe not with a
22:18 goddamn belt maybe not with a foreign
22:20 object but your hand your flat the flat
22:23 part of your hand
22:23 I mean my God how many times you have to
22:25 spank a kid in their entire lifetime 3
22:28 or 4 tops and those babies you just pop
22:30 their diapers and they just go whoa and
22:32 then they're totally ready for
22:34 programming right what did I do you know
22:36 don't put your finger in there told you
22:38 have to do that you're gonna shock
22:39 yourself and you're gonna die okay and
22:41 you give them a big hug
22:43 like let's go do something fun okay it's
22:45 like okay but I'm not touching that damn
22:46 thing again but today parents seem like
22:49 they want to let the kid electrocute
22:52 themselves because they wanna hurt their
22:53 feelings right
22:55 [ __ ] me I tell you but when you went to
23:00 your grandparents when I was a kid they
23:01 were the super uber adults they were the
23:05 ones that knew all the rules they had
23:07 experienced more life they had topped
23:10 out into near retirement or retirement
23:13 and they were just Oracle's like that
23:16 lady in the matrix making cookies so you
23:19 sat and you talked with them and you got
23:21 all this history of your family you
23:26 extra behaved around your grandparents
23:29 you would never let your grandparents
23:31 hear that you don't hear you swear or
23:33 you wouldn't want them to hear you know
23:35 maybe you losing your [ __ ] some other
23:37 place like you just don't want there
23:39 that your image of your from a view to
23:41 your grandparents to be tarnished I'm
23:45 speaking from a small town you know I've
23:48 talked about the electoral Electoral
23:50 College in respects to this but
23:53 electoral college is all about
23:55 maintaining humanity but it's never
23:58 described like that what am I talking
23:59 about well okay and I don't know if
24:02 Europe has this here we have this thing
24:04 where for for your geographical
24:08 footprint on the United States of
24:11 America you proportionately get votes on
24:13 any federal law that might impede you
24:17 and so you know let's just say that
24:20 Kansas doesn't have that many people I
24:22 don't know how many people Kansas has
24:23 let's just say 20 million or something
24:25 like that whole state where Ellie's got
24:27 20 million and with the surrounding
24:29 regions so this one cities got as many
24:33 votes technically speaking of people
24:35 votes as the entire state of Kansas but
24:39 the Electoral College says none and you
24:41 occupy this space and therefore you get
24:43 so many electoral votes now California
24:45 is the biggest state in the Union so we
24:47 get the most votes Texas I think me
24:50 number two I'm pretty sure it's just
24:53 slightly bigger than Texas but Kansas
24:55 gets so many votes okay
24:58 if they were to let the coastal regions
25:01 determine what this country was gonna be
25:04 like it'd be a bunch of sirens going off
25:07 the Midwest has a moral code it is built
25:12 into the way that they live and it's
25:13 it's the the exact cause of it is simple
25:17 to understand when you live in a teeny
25:19 tiny town everyone knows who you are and
25:21 you cannot be a jerk because there's
25:25 repercussion so you hear me talk about
25:26 all the time in the episodes but what
25:30 ends up happening is there's a standard
25:33 that you that you grow up with it has
25:35 just morals all over it and honestly
25:39 it's not exactly biblical or anything
25:42 the Bible does help an individual figure
25:46 out if they're completely you know
25:47 without any self guidance it will
25:50 completely teach you how to behave
25:51 so that's cool do it but these people
25:55 are voting on how the country is going
25:57 to be run and there's a gigantic chunk
26:01 of the country at least 60% of the
26:04 country that's considered a Midwestern
26:05 region of the country and virtually all
26:08 of those states have these little tiny
26:10 towns more little towns and big towns
26:12 and they're controlling this vote
26:15 they're controlling this electoral vote
26:17 if you were let the East Coast in the
26:20 West Coast run this country think about
26:23 all of the crazy pedophilia that would
26:26 just become legal crimes have become
26:31 legal and I'm not saying that everyone
26:34 in the big cities immoral but I could
26:38 tell you by having lived here now for
26:40 over thirty years in California I'm
26:43 being up and down between San Francisco
26:44 and Los Angeles
26:47 you either have I mean you have mostly
26:50 normal people but they don't really get
26:53 out and vote as much as the people that
26:54 are batshit crazy doing things to
26:57 humanity I mean just think about it you
27:01 take somebody's going to commit the most
27:04 egregious crime against humanity
27:07 touching kids or something trafficking
27:10 kids
27:11 and you say you got an opportunity to
27:13 take some of your money put it here vote
27:15 for this candidate for this particular
27:17 party and they're gonna run back to the
27:19 hill because there's no electoral
27:21 college and they're gonna get what you
27:24 do that is absolutely illegal to be
27:26 legal hurrah
27:30 you don't think they'll jump for it so
27:34 this has been put in place to stop that
27:37 from occurring so when I see writing on
27:41 television or writing in the film and
27:44 this is this methodology helps me
27:48 explain it to people that want to share
27:50 projects near are sorry share
27:52 experiences with me hey let's watch this
27:54 movie if I'm watching a movie for 10
27:58 minutes and there is no introduction of
28:00 humanity being at stake a moral that's
28:03 going to be violated or a you know a
28:06 rule that's going to be crossed that
28:07 relates to humanity my my siskel and
28:16 ebert rating goes way way down now again
28:21 there are some things that we just do
28:22 because it's fun I don't eat a peanut
28:25 Buster parfait to feed my body nutrients
28:28 I just eat it cuz it tastes good right
28:30 so say I'm watching Pacific Rim the
28:35 first one the only one that's worth
28:37 watching it's an amazing Odyssey of CG
28:42 really nice science fiction storytelling
28:46 it's funny at times so I know what I'm
28:50 doing I'm just eating a peanut Buster
28:52 parfait when I'm watching Pacific Rim
28:54 Michael Bay movies that's sort of what
28:56 you do and we can't blame these people
28:58 for being extremely good at what they do
29:01 but what would we be if we just sat
29:05 around eating peanut Buster parfait is
29:06 all day as delicious as they are I wish
29:10 they'd sponsored the show I think Warren
29:13 Buffett would get into that probably not
29:16 but we turn into big fat versions of
29:20 ourselves we'd be those fat people when
29:22 the third act of the movie
29:24 riding on those scooters with though
29:26 bone density so you don't do that at
29:30 least most of us don't do that most of
29:32 us aren't gonna get cut out of our homes
29:34 at one point by some you know talk-show
29:37 guy like dr. Phil trying to exploit your
29:39 illness for ratings prayers out to
29:42 Shelley Duvall we have all these heroes
29:46 in the world right now that can't get
29:49 the time of day julian assange this poor
29:56 guy has been stuck somewhere in the
29:59 world at any point in time unable to
30:04 come outside at times cuz he thinks he's
30:07 gonna get sniped he can't leave because
30:10 he might get arrested and put in jail
30:11 for the rest of his life but what was
30:13 his crime he got DN C emails leaked to
30:17 him by Seth rich who was murdered
30:21 another hero who was murdered do we give
30:25 a [ __ ] no is there even an investigation
30:28 into him no everybody who knows the Seth
30:30 rich was killed said that it wasn't a
30:33 robbery at all in fact there's a there
30:35 was an intern at the hospital or a nurse
30:38 at the hospital he was brought into and
30:39 he said he wasn't dead when they brought
30:41 him in he was fine he was gonna
30:43 completely survive he got grazed by a
30:45 bullet but by the next time the next day
30:47 the guy came to work he said Seth was
30:49 gone and then there's this alternate
30:51 rapport and who the hell knows what's
30:52 true right that he was found tortured
30:57 and killed some other location
30:59 yikes but Julian Assange simply reveals
31:03 corruption he's not giving out launch
31:06 codes he's not giving away military
31:08 secrets he's merely showing you what the
31:11 Democratic National Convention did to
31:15 potentially kill Supreme Court Justice
31:18 Scalia with a Wetworks project as John
31:21 Podesta said in email I believe however
31:24 I have those facts right again he
31:28 exposed the fact they were calling all
31:29 minorities some horrible little
31:31 catchphrase but then pretending to be
31:33 the the party of tolerance when they're
31:35 the party of absolute races
31:38 so here we have Julian Assange has
31:41 completely performed the duties of a
31:43 hero but he is locked up and were
31:47 watching him being locked up how the
31:50 [ __ ] is that possible
31:52 remember that Robinson guy or something
31:55 named like that he got he posted some
31:57 things online he protested out in front
31:59 of some place then he got yanked into
32:01 jail and everybody realized that he was
32:03 doing the right thing trying to expose
32:05 stuff and so they went and marched
32:06 against the police station just like
32:08 those whole movies and he gets let out
32:11 ok there are probably over a million
32:15 people calling for Julian Assange's
32:17 release to be exonerated to be given
32:21 asylum in America we're giving these
32:24 [ __ ] people from South America sign
32:27 them here and there we're giving people
32:28 all over the world asylum in America why
32:32 not this guy if he needs witness
32:35 relocation plastic surgery whatever
32:37 Salman Rushdie survived his fought wah
32:41 he'll just put him in the White House
32:45 for the first few years I don't mean his
32:49 president but just you know some
32:51 information guy he seems to be pretty
32:53 good at that have him sift over the
32:56 30,000 Hillary Clinton emails and
33:00 whatever else they found against her
33:01 he's really good at that
33:02 had him do a service force it's what he
33:05 loves to do and it's what he's good at
33:06 but I think the reason why we can sit
33:09 idly by as the masses and watch a Julian
33:13 Assange have his entire life pissed away
33:16 I mean he's still very very valuable
33:18 asset but he's not allowed to do
33:20 anything I think they've got him
33:23 sanctioned in that place that he's a
33:25 dude there's a bunch of debate of
33:26 whether or not he's still in the
33:27 consulate in England or London or
33:28 whatever it is he's not allowed to touch
33:31 the Internet I don't think he's allowed
33:32 is the phone anyone I mean he's not
33:35 allowed to do anything they've stripped
33:37 him of his humanity of his freedom he's
33:40 actually in jail he's in he's in the
33:44 hole he's in solitary confinement I
33:47 think the reason why he's allowed to be
33:49 there's because
33:51 we are losing our humanity what happens
33:54 if you consume a bunch of fake news a
33:57 bunch of crappy television shows bunch
34:00 of crappy movies a bunch of useless
34:04 videos on YouTube that's the majority of
34:09 your intellectual diet let's just say
34:11 and I'm not saying you did this on
34:12 purpose so if you find yourself in this
34:14 it's just like we're victims of the
34:16 situation here so we're trying to wake
34:18 up and take action against it but we're
34:22 losing the triggers in our minds that
34:25 says hey one of these things is not like
34:28 the other but they should be meaning
34:33 Jony science doesn't have freedom and he
34:35 should the guy told the truth and
34:37 exposed criminal actions that you
34:40 realize if judge Scalia who we believed
34:44 was suffocated with the pillow at a
34:47 lodge his body was cremated before his
34:51 family was even notified of his death
34:54 against their will to hide all of the
34:56 blood vessels that blew up in his face
34:58 when you get suffocated there's all
35:00 kinds of telltale signs to make way for
35:03 Loretta Lynch to take his place
35:06 I mean this is like this is high treason
35:09 I don't know I mean I would think that
35:13 this is even over that you killed a
35:15 Supreme Court justice judge whoa it's
35:21 just as bad as Sasson aiding a president
35:24 he has the email the talks about this
35:28 Wetworks
35:29 has been a traditional term for killing
35:32 somebody
35:33 we got the from and two emails we have
35:36 people the co-conspirators the
35:38 instigators those that agree that this
35:41 needed to occur to send a message and it
35:44 was Seth Rich's thing too I should say I
35:46 probably have that little bit mixed up
35:47 there but it's it's the dialogue about
35:49 Seth rich as well you know there's the
35:52 old analogy boiling the Frog slowly
35:55 which I guess is not someone said it's
35:57 not true I can tell you it's definitely
35:58 true because I accidentally did it once
36:03 using a drain pipe by a creek we had a
36:09 really cool frog stuck in the pipe we
36:12 just wanted to look at the dude but
36:14 someone was running water inside and
36:17 ended up running really hot water
36:19 I mean someone must have taken a shower
36:21 or something or something because it was
36:23 going and going and going and he was
36:25 fine we're thinking he's getting a
36:27 little bath and then eventually he
36:29 transforms and dies because he got
36:31 completely overheated with about a
36:33 hundred and ten degree water but if you
36:38 believe the humanity out of civilization
36:41 because you simply cut it off it's like
36:43 cutting off the nutrition to a person's
36:46 diet and they go eat fast food every
36:48 single day and the GMO foods and
36:50 everything is filling up your belly and
36:52 making you feel like you're full and
36:53 you're satiated but in the end you're
36:56 turning into this emaciated version of
37:00 yourself your T cells start to
37:02 deteriorate down then you die when I was
37:08 a kid parents didn't have to watch
37:10 things before you watch them because it
37:15 was it wasn't the way they wrote it you
37:19 know there was in fact they knew that if
37:22 you went and saw you know like a scary
37:25 movie Friday the 13th or you saw Porky's
37:27 or something like that that there wasn't
37:29 gonna be a whole lot of like morale up
37:32 to up ticking in it but even Revenge of
37:34 the Nerds for God's sakes had a morale
37:36 up take several at the end you know
37:39 treating people badly and then finding
37:42 out that nerds are people too you know
37:43 sort of a fictional thing but in the end
37:45 it's a very true archetype in this
37:47 reality how do you think we get
37:49 Psychopaths because someone's a little
37:52 bit different and people don't want to
37:53 have to deal with it and so they keep
37:55 alienating a person a little micron
37:57 after micron after micron to the point
37:59 where they have no social skills now
38:02 they're in their 20s during the 30s
38:03 they're in their 40s and no one's like
38:04 man don't invite that guy but if we just
38:07 reached out to those kids that are a
38:09 little bit shy did they get off on
38:12 things you don't get off on you know
38:13 looking through a telescope turns them
38:15 on doing some math on a piece of paper
38:17 gives them the same stimulation as you
38:19 get having sex with somebody all right
38:21 any more for you right and you know this
38:24 guy they can solve problems for you so
38:28 for those of you listening to the show
38:29 regularly which will probably be the
38:31 folks that will listen to this
38:32 particular episode because doesn't have
38:33 moon in it you know I'm pretty brutal on
38:37 organized religion I'm encouraging
38:40 everyone to take a step out of it but
38:43 I'm not telling you to throw away the
38:45 moral imperatives to the moral lessons
38:47 within the Bible I wouldn't worry about
38:50 the definition of God in the Bible which
38:54 may make some of you confused worried
38:57 about the definition of yourself when
39:00 you read the Bible and I apologize I
39:03 don't have any massive knowledge of
39:06 other books so perhaps the the writings
39:11 of Buddha the little book called the
39:14 Prophet when I see what's going on in
39:18 the world today and these organized
39:21 movements by people like George sorro's
39:23 the Democratic Party that are just utter
39:26 divide and conquer mentality mantras
39:30 they're trying to [ __ ] start they want
39:32 Wars they want civil wars they want
39:34 world wars they're old school deep
39:37 Staters and then I see an evangelist
39:40 knock on someone's door I see a group of
39:43 people go into a church a Christian
39:46 Church here in America
39:47 I see the Mormons who might come to my
39:51 house once a year until they give up I
39:54 see this force of good whether I agree
39:59 with their interpretation of reality and
40:02 whose God and in the whole mechanism of
40:04 Jesus and all that stuff it's okay
40:07 they're not bothering me and they're not
40:09 hurting me there's no Crusades going on
40:12 right now but it really is a group of
40:17 people that are the the only organized
40:20 force on this planet that could save
40:24 humanity from losing its humanity the
40:28 human race
40:30 and because we don't have any formalized
40:32 mechanism to teach people this stuff
40:35 outside of religion we're kind of
40:38 screwed
40:40 obviously a bunch of people figure out
40:42 how to be really nice to each other
40:43 without touching a Bible at one point in
40:46 time but as I absurd several times you
40:48 might check your history be very honest
40:50 with yourself did you learn morals from
40:53 a relative or a parent a grandparent
40:57 someone they who worshiped the Bible and
41:01 they got their morals from the Bible and
41:03 they passed it to you and you were able
41:05 to hold on to those rules in a secular
41:07 bubble versus a religious bubble if
41:10 you're like that then you should be a
41:14 little afraid as to what's gonna happen
41:16 when you have kids and they have kids
41:19 and they have kids who's gonna be there
41:21 to keep them from turning into a brave
41:23 new world or worse yet some 1984 a war
41:29 Orwellian world you see the deep state
41:32 always goes for your kids they don't
41:34 give a [ __ ] about you I mean they will
41:37 manipulate you for a vote here and there
41:39 but they really want your kids because
41:40 what they want to do is create an army
41:41 of humans that have absolutely no
41:44 resistance no original thought they
41:48 can't think for themselves they get on
41:51 in Tifa things I mean just think about
41:53 the poor ignorant [ __ ] who join
41:56 antifa
41:58 seriously we're talking about hopeless
42:02 kids that if they get their [ __ ]
42:05 together before they die my god it'll be
42:08 a miracle because the level of utter
42:10 stupidity of becoming the most fascist
42:14 group in the United States of America
42:15 and Europe but naming themselves
42:19 anti-fascism antifa Wow
42:23 right it's as crazies that Dave
42:26 Chappelle Epis I think it's his first
42:28 episode on his Dave Chappelle show where
42:30 he plays a blind black guy who's a KKK
42:34 member and when he finds out his wife is
42:37 actually white he divorces her because
42:40 what she likes black guys and he
42:43 have that in his in his world that was
42:47 funny because that was just so insanely
42:49 upside-down was one of those brilliant
42:51 skits he ever wrote
42:53 well that's these kids and thank God
42:56 they're just a microscopic little bit of
42:58 scum on the tub and they've obviously
43:01 lost a lot of their fuel except for on
43:04 Berkeley University I don't want to say
43:07 too that I've actually spoken at
43:10 Berkeley once and that makes Berkeley
43:13 look horrible and Berkeley's not that
43:15 type of organization yeah they're a
43:17 bunch of liberal kids up there
43:18 what-have-you they become liberal once
43:20 they go there because they don't have
43:21 any they don't have any choices that
43:24 they've already made before they're 18
43:25 and so they go into those liberal
43:27 bubbles and they feel accepted if they
43:30 go liberal and there you go but honestly
43:33 there's a reason why it stopped and it
43:36 hasn't continued over and over I mean
43:38 the kid punched the guy that was about
43:40 it but that's not happening every single
43:41 day as far as I know if I was at college
43:46 I would clean that crap out right away
43:48 you get caught dressing like that
43:50 instead of calling the cops off we're
43:53 gonna call the cops on you we're gonna
43:55 pull that [ __ ] [ __ ] mask off your
43:57 face photograph you put you in the
43:59 newspaper try to get you in the national
44:01 news and then just dis bar you from life
44:04 and say you can repent so if we go a
44:08 little deeper before we close this off
44:11 and we look at it and we say okay how
44:13 does all this stuff get started do
44:17 little kids start these devices groups
44:21 no they're started by deep state
44:24 organizations who find a bunch of
44:25 undereducated gullible people who for a
44:32 lack of a better term they don't have
44:34 any purpose in life and so they're given
44:36 this purpose hey do this thing it really
44:38 matters oh god I want to really matter
44:41 and oh there's a paycheck too okay but
44:47 how is that person so easily swayed into
44:49 this divisive group well as a bunch of
44:54 little tricks they do don't they
44:56 one son will just do it for the Paycheck
44:59 because they're greedy others will do it
45:01 for that
45:02 psychopathic thing where they don't
45:04 really have any integration with society
45:06 they hate society because they were
45:08 treated bad and now they just need
45:10 something to give them you know a
45:13 direction but the other one is the the
45:16 probably the biggest one is they play
45:18 the scapegoating card your life sucks
45:21 because of them your have-nots there
45:25 have now let's go kill him you know it's
45:29 really kind of what what it turns out to
45:31 be the poor kid that the Mormon kid that
45:34 had the fake Native American soldier and
45:37 he was a Native American but he's not
45:39 he's not a Vietnam vet which he tried to
45:41 insinuate that he was man I hope that
45:44 kid wins at two hundred fifty million
45:46 dollar lawsuit oh I hope the jury comes
45:48 back and goes now we think you deserve
45:50 half a billion you know just one of
45:51 those beautiful cases like the Monsanto
45:53 case that was lost to the gentlemen here
45:56 in California or they gave him more
45:58 money just was amazing beautiful but you
46:01 had this group of black guys that were
46:04 and this was not a racist thing but that
46:07 particular group of guys they were just
46:10 shouting the most visceral violent
46:14 scapegoating crap you've ever heard in
46:16 your life everything that came out of
46:19 their mouth was a scapegoating thing and
46:22 obviously they didn't write all the
46:23 doctrine they got it given to them it
46:26 was developed someplace else to
46:27 instigate divided they read it they
46:30 obviously don't have any perspective on
46:32 history and they're not enlightened to
46:36 the way that the human mind develops
46:37 over centuries to understand that okay
46:41 when you're 20 years old the likelihood
46:44 that you're going to be the exact same
46:45 person when you're 50 is nil there are
46:48 some people that can pull it off but you
46:49 know Christ are one in 10,000 people or
46:51 something like that but they're dragging
46:54 out all this history and they're
46:55 misconstruing all of its intent gotta
47:00 kill whitey to fix everything
47:03 those guys are victims and it's one of
47:08 these things of you know let's just say
47:09 my
47:10 hometown has 10,000 people roughly and
47:15 you want to know okay
47:16 which out of these 10,000 people are
47:18 SuperDuper gullible for whatever scam
47:21 we're gonna pull and they go into my
47:23 hometown and pull scams all the time and
47:25 they have recently pulled some doozies
47:28 that are costing my town tens of
47:31 millions of dollars that there's paying
47:33 for it's it's horrible but they just
47:37 fish the amount of people that come
47:40 through you know it's really funny when
47:41 you watch those old Midwestern westerns
47:44 from the I should say the westerns from
47:46 the I don't know 40s through the 70s
47:49 where they made those
47:52 they reenacted the snakes snake oil
47:54 salesmen who goes into town he's got
47:56 this little carriage and he's got
47:58 everything in there you know oil that
48:00 fixes everything the guy just has to sit
48:03 there downtown start his spiel start his
48:07 thing do you have aches and pains do you
48:08 have hair loss pop up I'll take this
48:10 snake oil bum ba-bum and it's gonna
48:11 bring it all back in fact I know a guy
48:14 in Omaha Nebraska that took this and
48:16 there's so many hairs he had to stop
48:18 taking it you know ba ba ba ba ba felt
48:20 so good she had to stop taking it such a
48:22 powerful thing and and you just watched
48:24 who in the crowd is gullible and how do
48:27 you find out they buy it the other ones
48:29 just walked by but even back then there
48:33 was a code that started the town started
48:37 watching these guys come through sell a
48:39 bunch of crap that didn't do anything
48:41 and then after about the third or fourth
48:44 time they go through that town the
48:45 sheriff's on their ass in two seconds
48:46 with the posse you take your goddamn
48:49 cart and get the [ __ ] out of here and
48:51 we're gonna we're gonna send telegrams
48:52 to every single town in this area to let
48:55 them know you're coming and not to let
48:57 you sell your wares because your pet
48:59 you're peddling crap to people you're
49:01 stealing money from people who need
49:03 their money let's go with that archetype
49:07 the whole black lives matter thing was
49:11 was developed by the Obama
49:13 administration to hate the cops people
49:16 like Maxine Waters going and lied to
49:18 people in the ghetto to see if you vote
49:19 for me I'll get you 40 acres in a mule
49:23 Bellary Chris was a Chris Rock or David
49:27 Chappelle did a an amazing ass kid on
49:31 that but the thing is is the Maxine
49:34 Waters goes down and says she's gonna do
49:36 a speech if you show up and you're
49:39 rootin tootin for maybe you should go
49:43 back to school maybe because the
49:45 chickens only lied to you the entire
49:47 time she's existed absolutely psychotic
49:50 you want to pick on a white lady put
49:52 Pelosi in there on if you want to do a
49:54 racial divide thing I can't remember
49:57 Donald Trump's name for God's sake she
49:59 keeps calling the guy Bush hilarious
50:01 she's losing her [ __ ] mind and she's
50:04 in charge of the super PAC on the
50:05 Democratic house sign Wow and Tifa I
50:09 don't even know where this group starts
50:11 and Tifa feels to me just like Nazi
50:14 Germany you know what was this story
50:16 behind Hitler Hitler is told by a
50:19 handler probably a was it Club 300 Paris
50:24 handler to be here give this speech do
50:28 this and everything's gonna go right and
50:30 he did and it did he kept raising money
50:32 he kept because they're feeding it to
50:35 him Dennis Hopper did an amazing
50:37 Twilight Zone where he he was a Hitler
50:40 and it really illustrates what I'm
50:42 talking about with these Antipa things
50:44 it was like somewhere somehow there's
50:46 this little secret group we got the
50:47 secret mean you're gonna come to secret
50:49 meeting what is it oh this is thing
50:50 called antifa we're gonna change the
50:52 world
50:52 oh well [ __ ] my life sucks so yeah sure
50:55 change the world absolutely and then it
50:59 turns into mob rules I mean you know it
51:03 strikes me during this episode that what
51:05 if you had that same kind of thing and
51:07 this is this is a little corny but it's
51:10 sort of the antithesis that we would
51:13 sort of laugh and shake our heads at
51:15 because it would never happen
51:16 what if somebody said are you gonna come
51:17 to the secret meeting what's the secret
51:19 meeting what we're gonna form this new
51:21 group where everyone gets along we're
51:23 gonna break down the barriers between
51:24 people we're gonna help people
51:25 understand each other's perspectives oh
51:27 sure that's never gonna happen
51:30 right we have double speak like crazy
51:34 today
51:36 you know the democratic party is this
51:38 party of Tolerance right we'll look at
51:40 all the plain the videos where people
51:42 are sitting on jets trying to take off
51:44 and people are like I can't sit next to
51:47 you if you were a maggot I can't sit
51:49 next to you if I even know that you
51:51 liked the president the United States
51:52 and they'd become rude I'm talking about
51:57 in any other light the people they're
52:00 losing their [ __ ] on these planes
52:02 they're getting yanked off thank God
52:04 oh my god it's just that's the most
52:06 celebratory thing I've ever seen in my
52:07 life when these old [ __ ] start
52:12 running that [ __ ] and start treating
52:14 someone like a piece of [ __ ] just
52:16 because they believe different thinking
52:17 that of course that the two of them even
52:19 think the same on whatever the hell they
52:20 believe and they just get yanked off
52:22 that thing there cuz you're not gonna
52:24 touch me and the marshals like you know
52:27 what I've touched a lot of people
52:29 stronger than you and I got them off the
52:31 plane so watch this
52:32 let's break your hip let's go do that
52:37 but they show you they're a party of
52:39 intolerance I mean you know it's it's
52:43 interesting you always hear the phrase
52:46 moral fiber and I heard that my whole
52:49 life I was a moral fiber woman yeah
52:51 whatever is unlike some old forty word
52:53 farty phrase or whatever there is a
52:55 moral fiber is there not and it's it's
52:59 essentially you know we talk about the
53:01 universe all the time and what it's made
53:02 out of and I'm always telling you guys
53:04 ethers real it's a particle makes up the
53:07 soup of the universe it accounts for all
53:09 gravity just like water around a bubble
53:11 blah blah blah all right well you know
53:13 what the ether particle is of morality
53:17 it's common law do no harm do no harm is
53:22 the most fundamental particle in the
53:26 moral fabric of society but what's a
53:28 moral fabric didn't why do you need a
53:30 moral fabric if you've got this do no
53:31 harm thing well sometimes people can't
53:37 understand the higher construct of
53:38 humanity what do we do when someone
53:42 mistaken something and gets really
53:44 offensive maybe even violent
53:48 well we construct out of this little
53:53 ether a particle of morality this do no
53:55 harm
53:55 particle a more complex story a willy
54:02 wonka show and it provides a context for
54:06 those really complex situations where we
54:09 have to mathematically define to the
54:11 person who is disputing their behavior
54:14 such that they can see where the harm is
54:16 actually occurring and then look inside
54:19 themselves and go okay and then we try
54:21 to provide sort of this reservoir to say
54:24 okay you're out of gas this is why
54:28 you're so cantankerous right now so over
54:30 here is a reservoir where you can
54:31 actually place your mind and fill back
54:34 up again and relax and we're all gonna
54:37 respect the fact that you've gotten to
54:39 this heightened state of disarray in
54:41 your mind and maybe there's some good
54:44 reasons why you're pissed off but
54:45 they're not reasons that are going to
54:46 equal this reaction that you're having
54:50 you know how many road rage incidents
54:52 happen where someone cut someone off on
54:55 a car and then they end up killing the
54:57 other person really
54:59 so they accidentally cut you off or even
55:03 they've had a bad day themselves and
55:04 they're intentionally just being dicks
55:06 in the highway yeah some of us might
55:09 think that they need to go to jail for a
55:11 little while for doing that kind of [ __ ]
55:12 and they need to calm the [ __ ] down and
55:14 get some education but capital
55:18 punishment removing a soul well that
55:20 goes on your permanent record doesn't
55:23 matter if you even hide it with humanity
55:25 and you never get charged as soon as you
55:27 die you're gonna get charged you're
55:32 gonna have to face the most omnipotent
55:34 brilliant being that exists and there
55:38 will be no concept of the capability of
55:41 lying and if you've ever felt a little
55:47 palpitations in your heart in your chest
55:49 because you're about to get caught doing
55:53 something wrong
55:54 this is gonna be a [ __ ] supernova in
55:57 your soul of regret remember regret is
56:01 the
56:02 a mistake that you made that no matter
56:04 that what the circumstances are moving
56:06 forward through time the solution of
56:08 time you'll never be able to take it
56:11 back now just to loop back before I quit
56:14 here the other two movies that were
56:18 essentially assassinated by Hollywood
56:21 although I don't think it's stuck which
56:23 is beautiful is that the the old movie
56:25 rollerball from 1975 with James Caan had
56:29 an amazing epiphany I did a whole
56:31 episode on if you want to watch that but
56:34 it's I got a lot of great feedback too
56:36 from that from people who've seen the
56:37 movie and understand what I'm talking
56:39 about it's a film you need to see if any
56:42 of this subject matter appeals to you I
56:44 don't care if you're a girl or a dude at
56:48 the end in fact if you have any problems
56:50 understanding it then watch my episode
56:52 maybe after and then we watch it again
56:57 but they remade it in the 90s and it was
57:03 a prequel so they weren't trying to
57:04 retell the old story they were trying to
57:07 do a prequel to it and it just came and
57:08 went but the problem is is when you go
57:10 in the search words in the Internet's
57:14 you will find a lot of effect it's
57:16 actually it's actually gone back to the
57:18 original which is beautiful beautiful
57:19 but for ten years maybe even 20 years
57:23 you couldn't find anything about the
57:24 original movie you'd be like 30
57:26 photographs of the new one in like two
57:28 of the old one or the Wizard of Oz
57:32 Wizard of Oz has not been remade but
57:35 they also made a movie called Oz and you
57:38 would find for a long time the finding
57:42 Wizard of Oz content was a little tough
57:45 because odds was pounding the other one
57:47 out of existence because the studio
57:49 bought all the key words now everyone
57:53 involved in making films is a some evil
57:55 person or anything like that it could be
57:57 a couple people providing the money for
57:59 a film where Studios like oh you're
58:02 gonna pay for it we're just gonna
58:03 distribute it and you're actually going
58:05 to cover even the marketing costs we'll
58:07 share well why wouldn't we take that
58:08 money out of your hands so it doesn't
58:11 have any reflection on the studio at one
58:13 particular point in time or anybody it's
58:15 just there's a couple
58:15 people that want to do this directors
58:19 aren't necessarily directly responsible
58:21 for it either people like Tim Burton
58:24 have multiple concert multiple film
58:27 contracts with studios so he might sign
58:29 a deal to say I've got three films I've
58:31 got to do for Sony or something like
58:33 that I'm making that up and so he wants
58:37 out of that contract as quickly as
58:39 possible because for those three films
58:42 they're gonna have a say in what the
58:44 film is and he has such a style he
58:46 doesn't want to green-light everything
58:47 that comes through he's gonna have to
58:49 make it a Burton film he's got a thing
58:51 he does the scripts just like Wes
58:56 Anderson Wes Anderson makes all his
58:58 films look like his stuff the West
58:59 writes his own stuff which is why it's
59:02 utterly phenomenal most of the time we
59:05 have been in the remake reboot era now
59:08 for how long
59:10 Tron Legacy destroyed Tron's original
59:14 push which was to the metaphor of users
59:19 were gods to programs we are the users
59:22 we use them we use programs we write
59:25 them we invent them we create them it's
59:27 one of the most brilliant metaphors
59:30 between God and man I've ever seen in
59:32 the film before what happened in Legacy
59:35 in two seconds when Sam goes in the
59:37 computer he's marched in front of all
59:39 the programs this is a user right here
59:41 guys was like what and they're just like
59:44 puh the original writers of that film
59:48 just missed the complete boat or someone
59:52 said I don't want any that user [ __ ] in
59:53 my movie the force was a mysterious
59:58 thing until Lucas retold his own story
60:02 they made these chlorophyll or
60:04 Floridians or whatever the [ __ ] they
60:06 were now the sudden it's just something
60:08 in your blood it's not this mysterious
60:11 thing that nerds can fantasize about you
60:15 know drawing out of the universe and
60:16 becoming a person who can maybe shine
60:18 you know so you can't get it through
60:21 enlightenment you have to get it through
60:22 a blood transfusion that hobbles the
60:26 power of those metaphors of those power
60:29 streams to the mind so what do we do
60:33 what are we doing a daily basis to
60:36 regulates our humanity I think it's
60:40 interesting you know I have several
60:41 friends in Los Angeles and a couple in
60:44 other places that are huge animal
60:46 activists and there's something
60:48 extremely unique and beautiful about
60:51 their souls because they have an empathy
60:55 bone that is you know it's off the
60:59 charts the needles floored they look at
61:02 a animal and they can see it's suffering
61:04 and I've got friends who you know most
61:07 of us have friends that can see
61:08 suffering in a cat or a dog because
61:10 that's our domestic choice here in
61:11 America but I've got a friend who yet
61:15 eclis saw the pain of snakes they're
61:22 special humans and most of them have
61:26 this extra equipment to see humanity for
61:31 what it really is because they have this
61:33 external animal sympathy and empathy in
61:39 the world I do think that people who
61:42 have cats are introverts and people have
61:44 dogs or extroverts no one walks their
61:48 cat on the beach we have to look at what
61:51 we're ingesting more so now than ever
61:55 before I do not envy someone who is a
61:58 fresh parent or even worse yet your your
62:03 kids 10 years old and you're just waking
62:05 up
62:06 you're becoming woke and now you're like
62:09 oh my god I have allowed into my home
62:12 all of this crazy stuff and my kids
62:15 having attention span problems
62:17 behavioral problems I've been giving
62:21 them vaccinations I've been feeding them
62:22 horrible food and you think to yourself
62:25 oh my god I've been a horrible parent my
62:30 advice to you is don't spend any time
62:32 punishing yourself for that kind of
62:33 event if that is occurring to you
62:35 rejoice in the fact that you now know
62:38 how to change things but you're gonna
62:41 have to sit down a little child if
62:43 they're going
62:43 if they have to change their ways
62:45 drastically and you're gonna have to
62:47 give them some education you may have to
62:50 teach them what diabetes is you may have
62:52 to learn how insulin wraps around
62:54 glucose and delivers it to the human
62:56 cell so that we can have energy and you
63:00 might have to get on a on a kitchen
63:01 table with your kid and get a pen and
63:04 paper and draw it all out for them draw
63:06 it chronologically from the moment they
63:08 eat candy to the what your body does
63:10 inside and then teach them when you eat
63:12 too much sugar there's not enough
63:16 insulin in the body to grab all that
63:19 sugar and so the sugar goes all over the
63:22 body and in flames you horribly and
63:24 causes a bunch of problems and let them
63:26 know that you made the mistake say I
63:28 just learned this and this is a good
63:31 piece of information now you can have
63:33 hell you could even teach your friends
63:35 and all kids like to be that you know
63:37 kid who knows something so I make it fun
63:40 for them I mean if you use truly if you
63:43 were like a normal parent and you find
63:46 out oh my god that you know vaccinations
63:49 are bad and and fluorides bad for you
63:51 and GMOs are bad for you and eating too
63:54 much damn sugar is bad for you and all
63:56 this other stuff you find it all out at
63:57 once so what you might need to do is
64:01 simply make a game out of it with your
64:02 kids you're gonna do a bullet list if
64:05 you get a white board in your house it's
64:06 awesome put it in your kids bedroom they
64:08 get the drawn at the meantime but make a
64:10 bullet list of all the things that
64:12 you're gonna have to change in the house
64:13 and then spend one day at a time
64:15 explaining it to your kids make it fun
64:18 go together and buy the toothpaste
64:21 without fluoride you know but just go
64:24 through each one of the things on the
64:25 bullet list make it a game go through
64:29 all the bullet items on the list and
64:31 make it a game take your kids to the to
64:35 the grocery store to buy the non
64:36 fluoridated toothpaste make it a game
64:38 let them pick the flavors when it goes
64:42 to buying food it's non-gmo make it a
64:44 game make it fun for the kids hey kids
64:47 look for this little label on your
64:49 cereal then we can buy it we can eat it
64:51 and this is not going to happen to us
64:54 when it comes time to prying soda
64:57 out of their hands teach them the
65:01 insulin rule you can bust your insulin
65:04 index and you will always be out of
65:07 whack in your body always that makes you
65:11 a diabetic show them what it's like to
65:14 be a type-2 diabetic
65:15 showing pictures of those machines that
65:17 inject insulin into the thigh of a human
65:19 being so you get to have a needle in
65:22 your leg all day long to take your
65:24 insulin levels and then inject insulin
65:27 into you you get to have sores all over
65:30 your legs the rest of your life
65:31 I don't by the way you'll live 30 years
65:33 less unless you do everything to do the
65:38 less you do everything right right
65:40 unless you do everything right exercise
65:44 eat well all that stuff in terms of cell
65:48 phone use teach your kids the more they
65:50 use a cell phone
65:52 the shorter attention span they have
65:55 anyway I think you feel me do what you
66:00 can to regain your humanity make sure
66:03 that what you're ingesting is humanity
