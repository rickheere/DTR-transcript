00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen I
00:38 forgot to say Happy New Year's last few
00:42 episodes so happy 2018 here we bring
00:45 this camera down a little bit I never
00:48 adjust my stuff that when I took it to
00:49 the smoke shop I had to move things
00:51 around a little bit
00:52 alrighty today is gonna be a subject
00:56 that I've mentioned just briefly in a
00:58 couple sentences and out of the 250
01:02 episodes that are out there but today
01:05 we're going to hone in big time as they
01:09 spray my beautiful blue sky with a ton
01:12 of chemtrails as I watch a high-altitude
01:15 plane fly over those chemtrails and one
01:17 fly under and no one has it true I think
01:20 I'm gonna call this lottery life's and
01:23 what that means is that people will base
01:29 their lives off of lottery ticket odds
01:32 all the time and in Southern California
01:37 it is so prevalent because people want
01:40 to dream right when you want something
01:44 really really bad you've got to and it's
01:47 difficult to get I should say when you
01:50 want something really really bad
01:52 sometimes you have to play games with
01:54 yourself in order to get it if that goal
01:58 is very hard to get and so you do play a
02:01 certain level of games with yourself but
02:05 there becomes a point where you cross
02:06 the threshold where you are you are
02:08 injuring your mind
02:10 with what some people call blue sky
02:15 which is your your assuring yourself of
02:19 something that isn't going to happen
02:21 why should say this you're assuring
02:23 yourself of something that's gonna
02:24 happen using rationales that will derail
02:28 you off of your journey I'll give you
02:32 one that's not a lottery life slash
02:35 lottery ticket model archetype
02:39 some people think that opportunities
02:41 come to them willy-nilly out of thin air
02:45 some people understand that you have to
02:48 create opportunity right you have to
02:51 talk to people and once you talk to
02:54 people you'll find someone that will
02:56 give you the opportunity but if you
02:58 don't get off your ass you're never
03:00 going to get it right and so some people
03:03 will sit around telling themselves that
03:06 I don't know God's gonna make the phone
03:08 ring and it's not that it's not that
03:10 that doesn't happen but that's more of a
03:12 of a lucky situation and that's what
03:15 this is all about is that people
03:16 cannibalize situations from other
03:20 people's lives that are one-offs there's
03:25 a ton of webinars and YouTube videos or
03:29 sorry YouTube ads that start off with a
03:33 lottery ticket model and I want to it's
03:35 I want to kill it and I want you to say
03:39 oh you know you're talking about the
03:42 lottery ticket model of life right if
03:45 you have kids you have to make sure that
03:47 when they start spewing this crap and
03:49 they will they will unless you sit them
03:52 down ahead of time and tell them they
03:54 will absolutely bring you a lottery
03:56 ticket win cetera and I'm gonna explain
03:58 this in great detail because it's
04:00 important that we take this out of our
04:03 own lives right that's probably quite a
04:07 few of you or hip to this but this is
04:09 going to be a good refresher course
04:11 right back in the 80s and 90s there was
04:15 a lot of 1-800 number sort of
04:18 correspondence courses you could take
04:19 online buying big cassette tape cake
04:22 courses with books and you know
04:24 they would spread it all over a table
04:26 looks so cool and it would teach you how
04:28 to sell real estate and I'm not saying
04:31 all of them are bad I'm not saying any
04:33 of them are bad necessarily but the way
04:35 that they'll sell it to you inside the
04:36 infomercial is they will take you
04:38 through case study after case study of
04:41 people who've used the course and have
04:42 made a ton of money now in some cases
04:45 there have been some some people that
04:48 were busted for loading those first
04:53 customers those first students with
04:55 deals they knew exactly where to
04:57 purchase they know exactly how to move
04:59 the money they even provided the
05:00 investment money and then gave the
05:02 profit to the couple or the individual
05:05 such that they could report on a
05:06 commercial without telling a lie that
05:09 they had made X number of dollars from a
05:11 particular deal okay now a lot of people
05:15 who sell and buy or buy and sell real
05:17 estate it does work but it's a hell of a
05:20 lot of work it is a hell of a lot of
05:22 work one of my best friends in the
05:23 entire world brother from another mother
05:26 he's an expert at this and I'm telling
05:28 you he's up at 4:30 in the morning using
05:31 the MLS list and going out there and
05:33 scouting all the homes and checking out
05:35 you know the neighbors and see if it's
05:37 quiet at night checking out the car cars
05:39 to see if they're you know messed up or
05:42 not looking up police records in the
05:43 area making sure it's a good place to
05:45 buy a home and flip it and that's before
05:48 he even goes in that's before he sits on
05:51 the steps and does a bid for it an
05:52 auction for it right so what this is
05:56 about is the opposite of that the
05:58 opposite of working hard the opposite of
06:01 accepting the fact that life is
06:02 difficult okay I just ran into this in
06:07 my personal life today in the last 12
06:10 hours which is why I'm sitting there I'm
06:12 getting triggered to make this episode
06:15 because it's very near and dear to me
06:17 and the second to explain it to someone
06:19 they usually pull out pretty quickly
06:20 okay but the one I'm gonna crescendo
06:24 with is the one that happened today
06:25 because it was classic classic classic
06:29 and I didn't have any resistance
06:31 necessarily for my advice it was just
06:35 I had to give it right now let's the
06:41 reason why I think it's very common with
06:44 where I am today is because no matter
06:46 where you are in Los Angeles you are
06:48 typically going after some outrageous
06:51 dream well they're not you admit it to
06:53 anyone or not you know as people want to
06:55 be actors and directors and they want to
06:58 be you know real estate moguls they want
07:01 to drive the Lamborghini they want to
07:03 have the house on the on the hill all
07:05 that good stuff and the thing is is they
07:08 realize it's tough eventually you know
07:10 and they will not want to accept the
07:14 fact that the people that are there that
07:16 because you can drive right down to the
07:18 beach he's getting your car I could get
07:21 in my car right now and drive right down
07:22 to Newport and drive all the way to San
07:26 Clemente San Juan Capistrano and just
07:31 look down the hill about this time of
07:33 day all the garage doors start opening
07:34 up and there'll be a Bentley next to an
07:37 Aventador Lamborghini right and the kids
07:40 got some you know rotted out BMW right
07:47 and so those people exist and then you
07:51 just see the next house the next house
07:52 the next house and they're all full of
07:54 these amazing cars they're all doing the
07:56 big you're keeping up appearances thing
07:59 right keeping up with the Joneses and so
08:02 you look at it and you think to yourself
08:04 this is crazy
08:04 they've got it there's dozens of them
08:07 here there's hundreds of them here go up
08:09 in the hills it's just a different type
08:11 of rich person up in the hills and you
08:13 start to ask yourself well where did all
08:15 this money come from man it must be easy
08:17 to make this kind of money if you just
08:18 live in this area it must be easy not
08:22 realizing that a little bar probably a
08:24 good 25 to 30% of the people who live
08:27 down here made the money someplace else
08:29 and decided to move here once they got
08:32 to the point they could live anywhere
08:33 they wanted to in the world I know some
08:36 people that got here in their 60s and
08:38 they're just trying to have fun for the
08:41 last years of their life you know
08:43 they're exercising they're walking up
08:46 and down the beach now because they have
08:47 something to live for
08:48 right but then I come down and I hang
08:52 out with some of my buddies and my
08:55 acquaintances and we'll be having a
08:58 drink or something or eating some dinner
08:59 or we're just smoking cigars and I start
09:04 to hear the lottery ticket model because
09:07 it goes around what are you doing what's
09:09 up with you man how's your business
09:11 doing whatever I'm pretty
09:13 straightforward you know I'm pretty much
09:15 like yeah this is going well over here
09:17 this investors a dick over here this
09:19 guy's a backstabber
09:21 but this one's great this guy is amazing
09:23 honorable we're making money right here
09:26 I got this other three things I'm
09:27 working on over here that I totally
09:28 control so I'm pretty straightforward
09:31 because I don't have any love for
09:33 delusions they don't work you know they
09:36 just don't work but then I'll start
09:39 hearing these amazing stories from some
09:41 of my friends right more of the
09:43 acquaintances my close friends know the
09:45 game but it's usually like a 1-2-3 punch
09:48 and they're gonna be rich right and
09:51 they're usually you know one of the big
09:53 things is to get into a market late but
09:56 feel like you're getting into it when
09:58 it's in its peak because the people
10:00 selling it to you have already got in
10:01 and they went out right but they know
10:04 how to resell the package to get a bunch
10:07 of people in right my hometown got had
10:10 with em use the ostrich thing that's a
10:14 little bit different than an ostrich
10:15 because emu meats actually really
10:17 delicious and wonderful and they try to
10:19 do the EMU farm thing in the middle of
10:21 Kansas and I don't know what happened
10:25 but it was happening just as I was
10:27 leaving in 1987 and I remember driving
10:31 by some of these kind of pastures what
10:33 t'see me running around and then it just
10:36 died off it just went away within the
10:38 first five years of me returning back to
10:40 my hometown all gone so someone said
10:42 something about the weather not being
10:44 right for them or whatever I mean we
10:45 have horrible winters and really hot
10:47 summers so go figure right the idea was
10:52 that people going to buy these emus and
10:54 60 and how did they get convinced to buy
10:57 something they totally don't understand
10:59 right I don't know if amuse come direct
11:01 from Australia or some other place in
11:03 the world but they are not native to the
11:06 Midwest of the United States of America
11:08 that I am aware of but the salesman does
11:11 the salesman thing they tell you about
11:14 someone who is making a tremendous
11:15 amount of money perhaps they give you
11:18 two or a dozen and it seems to make
11:21 sense well Marge you know I have to say
11:24 they said that this group of folks I
11:26 don't even know are making a tremendous
11:30 amount of money off these emia things I
11:32 think we should consider this we've got
11:34 land not doing anything let's do this
11:36 right there's been a zag going around
11:39 YouTube recently which just really calls
11:44 out this entire formula and it starts
11:49 off with like some douche bag and yes
11:51 we're gonna call him a douche bag
11:53 standing in some you know apartment door
11:57 jam and he's like I'm gonna tell you how
11:59 this guy made one hundred and thirty
12:00 five thousand dollars in one month and
12:03 then then he made a five hundred
12:04 thousand or he's got a picture of this
12:06 guy and he's circling he's never cease
12:08 showing you some [ __ ] metric some
12:09 [ __ ] diagram of this guy's income
12:12 it's not attached to anything all right
12:14 and he's like well you know in the next
12:16 two minutes at five seconds I'm gonna
12:17 teach you this thing and if you take my
12:19 course for nine thousand dollars or go
12:21 to my webinar he's selling you the guy
12:24 who won the lottery ticket right and
12:26 let's just go right into the why I say
12:29 the lottery ticket thing right it's a
12:33 little sketchy at the beginning of this
12:34 episode
12:34 it'll get better here the idea is if you
12:38 we're trying to make money and you
12:40 picked up the newspaper and you're
12:41 wearing it online the summon one lottery
12:43 somewhere we have one recently one
12:46 twenty year old one two hundred million
12:49 dollars or something here in the United
12:50 States they'll go oh my god you know how
12:54 you want to make you know how you make
12:56 two hundred million dollars you buy
12:57 lottery tickets that's what you do and
13:01 you run off and buy a bunch of lottery
13:02 tickets and you buy them and you buy
13:04 them and you buy them and you're never
13:05 freakin win because the odds are like
13:08 one in sixty five billion or something
13:10 right that you're gonna win and by the
13:13 way if you wanted a little bit of math
13:14 on your odds of winning the lottery okay
13:18 here's what you do you know lottery
13:21 tickets are made out of alphanumeric
13:23 characters right one through zero
13:26 usually the now they're double digits
13:28 right so one column is going to be in
13:29 the 60s only the 50s 40s whatever right
13:31 so you have to figure out how many
13:34 different combinations exist in slot 1
13:36 slot 2 3 4 5 6 7 right then let's just
13:41 say there was 20 slots in each one of
13:44 those rows 20 different symbols that can
13:46 exist that you get to pick from from
13:49 every one of the rows right and let's
13:53 say there's just to make a little easier
13:54 for our brains here there's only 4
13:56 columns now you know there's more than
13:58 that right but here's how the math works
13:59 if there's 20 out of 4 rows it's 20
14:04 times 19 times 18 times 17 to 1 but
14:08 you're gonna win with just a 4 slot
14:10 ticket it gets high really really fast
14:13 and when you add a 5th and 6th and 7th
14:16 column it's insane there's 26 letters in
14:21 the alphabet
14:21 plus there's 10 digits in the base 10
14:24 counting system that gets you 36 slots
14:26 and women's shot man but you don't run
14:29 out and buy tickets after you start
14:32 losing and losing and losing right you
14:34 start to realize it doesn't work you see
14:36 these you know these homeless people buy
14:39 scratch offs right and there's people
14:41 who aren't homeless who are addicted to
14:42 scratch offs right it's always a
14:45 diminishing return you always lose more
14:47 money than you make if that's why those
14:49 things exist who the hell would make a
14:52 scratch-off company where you paid out
14:54 more than you raised how was that how
14:57 would that even be possible it's not
14:59 possible okay
15:01 now you're more than welcome to buy
15:03 these things and have fun with it as a
15:05 fun entertainment thing get them for
15:07 someone further birthday or something
15:09 fun like that but it's not a mechanism
15:11 to rule your life by right it's a
15:13 mechanism of entertainment and we all
15:15 understand that if we win it's like a
15:16 Eureka moment it's like unbelievable
15:18 odds that you won and that's what's fun
15:22 about it right there's nothing wrong
15:24 with entertainment but some people take
15:28 that exact same
15:28 thing and don't realize that that's what
15:30 they're doing to their lives because
15:31 someone has told them a story about the
15:34 one guy in your neighborhood who has had
15:37 this miraculous success and you're the
15:41 next one if you just participate you're
15:43 the next one right there are definitely
15:46 members of my family at times who have
15:50 well let's put this way
15:51 I've got members of my family probably
15:53 the vast majority of them who understood
15:56 to build a business it's a slow going
15:59 process you have to get in you probably
16:01 lose a little money at first hopefully
16:04 in the next in the first 24 months you
16:06 can turn a profit and you keep going
16:09 I've done that right I've built video
16:12 game companies where I was a CEO I ran
16:15 it we made millions of dollars it's
16:17 fantastic right I'll even use my example
16:20 to you guys but to finish up my family
16:24 story
16:24 I've got other family members that got
16:26 into selling Herbalife all right if
16:30 you're my age you probably have some
16:32 family members that did that too in the
16:34 Midwest there's all kinds of products
16:35 that come through and they prey on the
16:39 average intelligence of someone in the
16:41 Midwest I remember there was one that
16:43 was a shampoo company okay the shampoo
16:46 was great no problem but we're you gonna
16:48 sell it
16:49 really you're gonna go door-to-door and
16:51 sell shampoo the only way you make money
16:54 selling shampoo is if you got a bunch of
16:55 salons around you or you have some
16:57 gigantic artery two people that go to
16:59 buy shampoo they aren't going to Walmart
17:01 or local grocery store right there was
17:06 one that was a paint scratch repair kit
17:09 thing and you know that guy would come
17:11 out and scratch his hood then he'd fill
17:13 it in and then he'd you know boys just
17:14 miraculous and pretty well sure I'll
17:16 take the starter kit you know now I
17:20 lecture
17:21 nearly every single month at a college
17:24 about getting into the video game
17:26 business and what's really funny about
17:29 it is is that when I go talk to my
17:31 buddies about getting into the video
17:32 game business everybody says it's
17:35 screwed it's over man the only ones that
17:38 are gonna ever make any money and they
17:40 usually don't are these big giant
17:41 companies
17:42 like blizzard or Activision or ei right
17:46 but some of those big companies are
17:49 losing huge money every single month
17:51 millions and millions of dollars because
17:54 they are pushing brands that aren't
17:55 making any money
17:56 there's too many platforms you got PC
17:59 mobile you have console tablet you're
18:04 getting into virtual reality stuff now
18:06 there's just too many platforms too many
18:08 choices
18:09 you can't compile one game for a billion
18:12 choices and how many PCs O's Mac and
18:14 there's windows there's Xbox and
18:17 PlayStation and the Wii thing right
18:21 you've got an HTC vive you got an oculus
18:24 you've got Android you've got iOS right
18:27 so I teach I was actually last time I
18:30 taught two years ago my presentation was
18:34 fairly cynical now I always spin it up
18:37 and say look you guys are the ones that
18:39 are gonna get this out of the dark ages
18:41 it needs to change we need to go back
18:43 into great games not these big cinematic
18:46 you know Odysseys that look good but
18:49 aren't any fun right but then the school
18:53 came to me and said well you know we are
18:55 trying to sell this as a course could
18:57 you please be a little more positive
18:58 about this right and of course for me
19:01 I'm sitting there going geez I don't I
19:02 don't mislead people no matter what you
19:05 thunders there's no money in teaching
19:06 I'll tell you that much but now take my
19:09 scenario with my video my video game
19:12 company now at the beginning we paid
19:15 ourselves a pittance right I've managed
19:18 to sign a few hundred thousand dollars
19:19 with the contracts that kind of got us
19:21 through you know before that we're
19:23 making nothing like five grand a month
19:25 we formed our company signed a deal we
19:28 made 50 grand in a month that was pretty
19:30 good next time next deal up was 300
19:34 grand roughly but it took two years two
19:41 years before it really started to blow
19:43 up fact I'll even go up three years at
19:45 the third year I was depositing over
19:49 half a million dollars in the bank a
19:51 month not to my bank account but to my
19:54 company's make it go we had 20
19:55 employee so don't get all excited about
19:57 my bank account but what if I had told
20:00 someone that and they ran off and said
20:03 hey let's say I have an average
20:06 conversation with someone who wants to
20:07 get in the video game business because
20:09 every kid that plays a video game
20:10 instantaneously wants to be in the video
20:12 game business doesn't matter if they
20:13 have any skills whatsoever all right you
20:15 say well you're gonna have to do
20:16 something when you get in the company
20:17 well won't be a game designer yeah and I
20:20 just want to be [ __ ] Steven Spielberg
20:22 on the first day at the studio but if I
20:25 said yeah you know I just deposited a
20:27 check for you know four hundred eighty
20:29 thousand dollars and coming from a
20:33 different source deposit in my office
20:36 okay kid runs off and tells his mom he's
20:40 dad oh my god you know I can make half a
20:44 million dollars a month mom and dad well
20:46 how's that son well Mike know a guy who
20:48 has his own game company you know he
20:50 just started it right here inside of his
20:52 living room took him a year to get an
20:56 office then he opened up a second office
20:58 and you know what he deposits this kind
21:01 of money yeah just happened just like
21:05 that man nobody worked their asses off
21:07 no one negotiated with CTOs all around
21:10 the world getting you know one deal
21:13 higher than the other than the other
21:14 saving projects that went on the fritz
21:17 you know because something they couldn't
21:18 figure out something I can say I've
21:21 never had in and I think my game company
21:24 was extremely successful I mean we we
21:26 replaced every casual online gaming
21:28 platform slash MMO casual platform that
21:32 was of any any notoriety we did them all
21:36 and then we sort of exhausted ourselves
21:39 from all of our clients and then of
21:40 course 2008 happened in November
21:43 December and one by one you know the
21:46 client started disappearing right well
21:49 we were highly successful but it still
21:51 took months and months and months to
21:53 close deals right and that's reality
21:57 that is reality but now there are two
22:03 forms of this formula okay there's
22:05 someone giving you those scenarios like
22:07 I just gave you oh you know my buddy may
22:09 I heard all right on the radio right on
22:11 the you know the Internet's that
22:12 somebody's making a gazillion dollars I
22:15 saw a webinar I saw a YouTube ad and
22:18 he's promising me this and that news you
22:20 know I had a friend of mine a childhood
22:23 friend he's like 12 years old and he saw
22:25 ed McMahon's whole thing about when he
22:29 used to do the old I forgot what the
22:32 hell they called it but you mailed you
22:34 this catalog and you apply and you could
22:36 win all this stuff and the kid was 12 so
22:40 the endearing part about it was he
22:42 thought because he had read the material
22:43 and he had watched it on TV a couple
22:45 times
22:45 his sweepstakes the sweepstakes thing
22:47 that's what it was and he literally sat
22:51 there and told us you know well I'm
22:52 probably gonna at least win it like a
22:54 VCR or something right
22:56 he just thought the guaranteed the win
22:57 was gonna be a guarantee and what's cute
23:00 and endearing about a 12 year old
23:01 reading this is that he's a child
23:05 he's a child so it makes sense that he's
23:08 having this but he's being swayed
23:10 because he has no cynical experience
23:12 with how things work he doesn't
23:13 understand the sweepstakes and what icy
23:15 sweepstakes even is right but even at my
23:20 age of 12 I was this good friend and I
23:21 was like dude do you not know how this
23:23 works no one wins anything man he's
23:26 gonna go to one person's doorstep and
23:28 that's about it
23:30 there's like an old-school lottery you
23:32 know but the other one if you go up one
23:35 level from selling shampoo and Avon and
23:38 Mary Kay and all this stuff right I mean
23:41 there is no end to network marketing
23:44 scams out there you know I've got
23:48 friends who do nothing but live inside
23:51 these things and you know one of the big
23:53 formulas is I hate to say it but you
23:56 ladies out there that have a man that's
23:58 pulling in you know most of the money
24:00 the women run off and these network
24:02 marketing schemes because they can they
24:04 don't have to succeed but the problem is
24:07 is that they become sort of these pseudo
24:09 authorities about how it works when they
24:11 never make any money they really don't
24:13 make any money they have to buy these
24:14 starter kits they have to constantly up
24:16 stuff and they don't make $0 but I've
24:19 known one person who sold jewelry then
24:21 they sold Jean
24:23 and then they it's just everything that
24:25 they get into is a network marketing
24:26 scheme a multi-level marketing bunch of
24:28 [ __ ] and they just don't realize
24:32 that hey if you had to survive on your
24:33 own you would be starving to death so
24:37 have fun with your little thing here but
24:39 don't recommend it to anybody who's
24:40 really looking for an income and what
24:42 they always say as a scam in this [ __ ]
24:44 is this is to supplement your income
24:48 what if I told you out of your living
24:49 room you could make $500 a day right
24:52 well what's the pitch $500 a day oh yeah
24:55 mm-hmm
24:56 hey if any of that crap worked I would
24:59 do it I'd sit in my house to make $500 a
25:01 day selling porcelain you know pugs or
25:04 you know pewter army characters to guys
25:08 you know it doesn't work because
25:10 everyone would be doing it everyone will
25:13 be doing it the marketing material is
25:16 telling you about a lottery ticket
25:18 situation to coax you into it okay so
25:23 let's go up one level to capitalism for
25:26 those of you out there who have an idea
25:29 and you need to raise money to fulfill
25:33 your business I have you know if you
25:37 watched all 250 episodes you're gonna
25:39 hear a bit of a repeat but you'd have to
25:41 watch all of them to get all these
25:42 sentences put together into one you know
25:45 I have been an entrepreneur since I was
25:47 a child you know like I said I sold
25:49 stuff at 7 years old and I have sold
25:51 stuff my entire frickin life all the way
25:54 up either a product or service all the
25:56 way up my entire life right so for me I
25:58 have this kind of you know I could smell
26:01 the gold and the ground sort of thing I
26:03 can sense without something's [ __ ]
26:05 or not I can sense when a company's
26:06 going out of business it's this weird
26:08 thing man if I say you're done you are
26:11 done and no one's ever survived my
26:14 instinct on that and I don't necessarily
26:17 have any pride on that but that's just
26:18 the way it is right the worst thing is
26:22 when you realize it's your company so
26:25 you gotta raise some money there's two
26:28 sides to this there's people who well
26:32 they're just like two or three sides of
26:33 this you can save up your own nest egg
26:36 episodes way back in season one that
26:38 nobody watches but it's really good
26:41 stuff about how to start your own
26:42 business and what have you a lot of
26:44 amazing you you never hear this kind of
26:48 stuff anywhere I lecture about it if you
26:50 come to my colleges but you have to be
26:52 taking a weird course to get it but the
26:56 best way to do it is obviously save up a
26:58 nest egg so you can fund yourself for
27:01 however long you're gonna give this a
27:02 try right and the golden minimum is 18
27:06 months you need to have 18 months of all
27:08 your bills and that is a very hard thing
27:11 to do in this crappy economy for those
27:13 of you in some successful high paying
27:15 job and if you haven't bought into
27:18 consumerism right and conspicuous
27:21 consumption and you get a you know some
27:24 $10,000 to $20,000 a month mortgage with
27:27 some $2,000 with the car payments and
27:29 all this [ __ ] you don't need on your
27:31 credit cards as long as you don't do
27:32 that you can do it
27:35 if you have a decent salary it might
27:38 take you a year to save up but the best
27:42 thing you have to do to get started is
27:45 to go off and get your clients ahead of
27:48 time and simply transition from taking
27:51 the paycheck and filtering it through
27:53 someone else's corporation where they're
27:55 going to take the majority of the money
27:56 and give you pittance right today's
27:59 episode word is Pitons and you transfer
28:03 to your bank account and you make all
28:05 the money and you have to get your own
28:06 healthcare and all this other stuff get
28:07 employees buy supplies perhaps get a
28:09 brick-and-mortar store or at least a
28:12 place to store your junk hopefully not
28:15 and you start logically right when I
28:17 started my video game company my buddy
28:20 and I on the outside had just replaced
28:22 Gamescom for Atari you know three dudes
28:25 did all the work
28:26 right we program a seven out of eight of
28:29 the games we tripled their traffic in
28:32 fact we maxed the traffic out and we
28:34 tripled their revenue because they were
28:37 having to lease the service from another
28:39 company that was taking most of the
28:41 money eighty percent of the money so we
28:43 reprogrammed it and they got a hundred
28:44 percent of the cash not only that but we
28:47 then tripled the traffic and tripled the
28:48 money
28:49 so we had this reputation and so when
28:51 the group broke up from Atari and went
28:56 to three different locations I landed
28:58 two of the three locations the other guy
29:00 went to go work for Walmart so there
29:01 wasn't anything we could sell that guy
29:03 but one of them went to Marvel and the
29:05 other one went to Yahoo games but it was
29:08 so powerful our job on Gamescom was so
29:12 powerful that one of the women who was
29:15 working at Atari junk ship and during an
29:19 interview just to interview on the way
29:21 over to yahoo games she caught us a
29:23 $55,000 gig that's that one I told you
29:26 about the first one out of the chute and
29:28 then we landed yahoo games right and the
29:31 other one went to Marvel we did tons of
29:33 Marvel games right so the idea is we
29:37 built a company up with clients we
29:39 didn't have any money in the bank and we
29:41 sure as hell didn't want to wait to save
29:43 it up and where were we gonna get the
29:44 money to save it up we were making
29:45 barely enough to survive right
29:48 I mean I went from making $200,000 a
29:50 year to making $5,000 a month okay do
29:54 the math on that one
29:57 now I have money in the bank of course
29:59 which floated me for about two years but
30:03 I lucked out with that I worked my balls
30:05 off at a year to get that money but the
30:09 opposite of that no I just gave you the
30:11 example of what you should do go get
30:13 your clients first transition out of the
30:15 job maybe even moonlight until you get
30:16 it all ice down before you go and quit
30:19 because you don't have you know if
30:20 you've never run your own business you
30:22 have no clue unless you've done your
30:23 homework on how difficult that is
30:26 because if you're the person in charge
30:28 there's barely enough time for you to do
30:29 any work remaining in charge if you get
30:31 any sort of staff and someone's got to
30:35 be landing new work that's the other big
30:36 one that people miss out on okay I met a
30:40 guy that wanted me to help it's just a
30:42 buddy of a buddy he's an acquaintance
30:44 best and he he wanted me to help with a
30:47 quick little website you know
30:49 programming video games and you know I
30:50 could do websites so big deal right so
30:52 it's gonna hook him up with some custom
30:53 thing WordPress was still not really in
30:57 existence yet so it was kind of a custom
31:00 job he was going to start a termite
31:02 company because this
31:03 citrus termite things in a house about
31:05 2003 as I sit down at this my buddy's
31:09 restaurant and we were starting to talk
31:10 and that's how I met the guy he's like
31:11 hey could you help my buddy I said yeah
31:13 sure sure whatever and he said I said so
31:16 do you have some clients do you do this
31:19 kind of work he said no no I do
31:20 pharmaceuticals I sell pharmaceuticals
31:22 okay so you don't have any clients no no
31:25 and I said well and then he goes to me
31:27 goes look but I got the t-shirts the the
31:32 magnet on the side of his truck
31:34 some hats some business cards and he's
31:37 gonna be getting the equipment no
31:40 clients he's gonna quit this
31:42 I don't know 100 and $50,000 a year job
31:45 with commissions right so I'm creating
31:47 this website I'm thinking damn I better
31:50 get paid quick because as soon as this
31:51 guy finds out he's full of [ __ ] and I
31:54 try to give him some advice about
31:55 getting clients ahead of time you wanted
31:57 taking him my advice put the website up
32:00 the do quit almost instantaneously after
32:03 quitting his big job problem was he was
32:07 in his late 40s and getting that job
32:09 back was gonna be really difficult he
32:12 hadn't done manual labor in a really
32:14 long time and doing termite spraying and
32:16 let me tell you man
32:17 you know he said it was in his family or
32:19 something like that but you don't start
32:20 a job like that in your late 40s it's
32:22 too much physical effort right but he
32:25 had bought a lottery ticket that this
32:27 citrus stuff was the bomb and it was
32:29 going to be replacing all of the the
32:32 other you know more toxic chemicals and
32:34 they still use it to this day for
32:35 whatever reason he couldn't get it to
32:36 fly you know it'd be like me going off
32:39 to be a tow truck driver all the sudden
32:41 you know at 48 years old my back would
32:44 protest profusely I'm sure let's say you
32:48 need to raise some money this is where
32:52 you can get had SuperDuper fast I'm
32:54 going to give you some personal
32:55 experience of my own if you have a good
32:58 idea if you do you're convinced you do
33:02 otherwise you wouldn't be doing it right
33:04 doesn't mean it's real a lot of people
33:06 don't do what's called discovery which
33:08 is to go off and find out what the
33:09 competition is to find out if anyone's
33:11 ever thought of your idea and you'll
33:13 waste a lot of money with investors if
33:15 you truly do have a great idea then you
33:17 actually more you're in a more dangerous
33:19 place than you could possibly imagine
33:20 talking to investors investors come in
33:24 to different categories and sadly a
33:26 large majority I have no idea what the
33:29 percentages they are scumbags and
33:31 criminals and they typically have a very
33:34 similar background but they will do
33:35 everything in their power to hide that
33:37 background so if you ever meet an in
33:39 person who claims to be an investor one
33:43 don't tell the [ __ ] thing about what
33:44 you're doing don't tell them anything
33:46 you know maybe an industry well we're in
33:49 the game industry that's all you're
33:50 gonna get to know and then you put a
33:53 glove on and you make a bend over and
33:55 you go in and you find out everything
33:58 about them do a background check on them
34:01 run their credit make them prove how
34:04 much money they have in their bank
34:05 because they will lie and lie and lie
34:09 right some of these guys have been have
34:11 been rich in the past and lost all their
34:13 money and like criminal enterprises or
34:15 they'll there'll be an investments that
34:17 go tits up and everyone's getting sued
34:19 and tens of millions of dollars are up I
34:21 recently worked with a guy like that he
34:24 was renting a room from somebody right
34:27 he doesn't reveal that of course in the
34:28 first year or any only reveals that when
34:30 he absolutely had to reveal it then we
34:33 find out he's completely broke last
34:35 investment cost his partners forty
34:38 million dollars and people nearly went
34:40 to jail he lost all of his money in this
34:42 venture and they broke the law was how
34:46 they got their work with another guy guy
34:49 was the biggest you know
34:51 self-congratulatory douchebag I've ever
34:53 met in my [ __ ] life right and the
34:56 only reason why I gave the guy some time
34:58 was that I had a partner that was that
35:00 was saying we should give this guy a try
35:03 but he had no business background
35:05 whatsoever right this guy bragged about
35:08 Vietnam I guess he went to Vietnam now
35:12 having been raised by at least three
35:13 people that went to Vietnam and and you
35:17 know saw the [ __ ] but they don't talk
35:19 about Vietnam ever if you really solve a
35:22 [ __ ] you don't talk about it you just
35:25 don't and the guys that run their mouth
35:26 about it one of the guys that are
35:28 bullshitting about it they are unless
35:30 they're nuts
35:31 you know because they've been affected
35:32 by it right and then we sit down and
35:34 listen and help and get out their PTSD
35:35 right but this guy just told all these
35:39 tales all these stories about his life
35:43 and that's all he ever was was a bunch
35:46 of stories he had this image in his mind
35:47 that one day he was an investor and two
35:49 he was his big war hero he didn't like
35:52 the war he didn't say it was good he
35:53 said it was stupid we should never be
35:54 there so at least that part was true but
35:57 he was a fake investor and we were told
36:00 that he was gonna be checked out by the
36:02 other guy who was also a fake investor
36:06 right it's interesting but the entire
36:10 time I was sitting with this whole thing
36:12 kind of strapped down because I had this
36:14 other partner that was locked into these
36:16 other two guys and without any business
36:18 acumen he couldn't sit mell [ __ ] if
36:19 you stuffed it up his nostrils right I
36:21 had to sit there for a year in this sort
36:28 of intellectual prison of any common
36:32 sense right sitting there watching
36:33 stupid thing after stupid thing happened
36:36 and just kind of going well you know I
36:39 think I'm gonna be pulling out of this
36:40 thing cuz it's just not worth my while
36:42 right but how did they duped my other
36:44 partner blue sky blue sky blue sky
36:49 telling him they could raise money in
36:51 two seconds and what's really really
36:53 funny about is that we spent basically
36:56 about a year and a half I spent two
36:58 years in it sort of my first partner but
37:00 the last two guys spent between them a
37:02 year and a half on one year on the other
37:04 kept promising millions and millions of
37:06 dollars millions and millions of dollars
37:08 never ever showed up and the final play
37:12 was that we got rid of the investor dude
37:14 it was we just finally figured out had a
37:15 bad record with all of his people
37:18 disreputable to the nines and then the
37:21 last guy that had already dragged my
37:24 partner through another previous two
37:25 years of some other venture I wasn't a
37:27 part of unable to raise any money all of
37:30 a sudden says I can raise ten million
37:33 dollars in two seconds that guy bought
37:36 it I said goodbye I said see you later
37:39 don't want to have anything to do with
37:40 this
37:41 you're an abject [ __ ] [ __ ] when it
37:43 to business right good luck dude lottery
37:48 ticket the lottery ticket when someone
37:52 else has done it we can do it someone
37:54 else has done it you can do it right now
37:58 one of the things that I've done since
38:01 I've been in Los Angeles is I've been
38:02 very privileged to bump into some
38:04 incredibly talented people that when
38:07 they met me they said look you are going
38:09 to be our manager I mean it would be in
38:13 one case I met some these two comedians
38:15 and I think it was in the first week the
38:19 older brother are the older cousin I
38:21 think of the two he just came up to me
38:23 and said you're gonna be our manager
38:25 just had a thin air and I said okay I
38:28 never done this before but I'm sure we
38:31 can work it out the video game business
38:34 has a deal with all kinds of different
38:35 management of talent and what have you
38:37 so I've seen it from the other receiving
38:38 side of it so I'm gonna get behind the
38:40 curtain now right and it worked out
38:42 great we had all these great things that
38:44 happen got him on television shows and
38:47 we film them at a million places and
38:49 eventually they ended up with a
38:50 permanent gig on cruise liners but just
38:54 with meaning these two guys in managing
38:55 them ended up bouncing around and
38:58 meeting other people that said you know
38:59 do you do management I said yeah I do
39:02 you know I've called booked comedians
39:05 you know I've produced pilots you know
39:09 I've done the filming I've done the
39:10 editing of then the show design all
39:12 kinds of stuff right so I've been very
39:14 very lucky with this whole thing again
39:16 this is part of the hard work you know
39:18 true the methodology of making
39:21 successful things happen right you know
39:24 I've had the privilege of you know
39:26 making really good friendships and some
39:27 of my clients slash friends have hit
39:31 rough spots you know where they're they
39:33 might lose a family member and then that
39:35 kind of shocks them and they they don't
39:36 go on stage anymore and I've worked with
39:39 comedians more than anything but I one
39:43 of my really good friends
39:44 Jimmy Della Valle great New York
39:47 comedian just an exceptional town he's
39:49 been all over these shows television
39:51 shows he he lost his father and
39:56 I wasn't aware this even happened cuz he
39:58 and I fell apart for like three months
40:00 so I got busy he got busy towards the
40:02 end of the year I knew his father was
40:04 sick but didn't realize he had passed
40:05 and it happened and it got to him and so
40:08 we're talking about three months after
40:09 it happened I said what's going on man

40:40 those jokes right now it's just too soon
40:42 it hurts too much I said well you know

40:46 brilliant comedians I've ever met let's

40:51 just basically you do it and you try to
40:53 make me laugh adjust everything right
40:55 need to need my help whatsoever and he
40:58 just kind of paused you know and I said
41:02 I said where can we get you on stage
41:04 because we have all these other places
41:05 he's been on stage and he said well
41:07 maybe I'll go over to jon lovitz place
41:10 up in the Universal Studios little
41:16 amusement park they got up there and
41:17 it's kind of a open mic night constantly
41:20 there's no admission you just come in
41:21 and sit down have drinks and comedians
41:23 just constantly don't I said okay let's
41:24 do it
41:24 so my girlfriend at the time and his
41:28 wife we all went up there I met he lets
41:31 all these guys go on and they're doing
41:32 pretty good you know it's open mic night
41:34 of course
41:34 my guy is a closer my guys a two-hour
41:36 closer man he's just invincible you can
41:38 do 30 minutes to two hours just just
41:42 because right he gets up there and does
41:44 really good cause he blows away everyone
41:46 freaks out he likes going after everyone
41:49 if it's if it's non regimented because
41:51 he tries to find out what the crowd
41:52 likes a little dirty or they
41:54 straight-laced what-have-you
41:56 so he gets up there and just nails it
41:58 and then we start working together again
42:00 and he's getting into voiceover and so
42:02 we worked to get his voice over online
42:05 so people can hear it you know and
42:07 I'm just helping to kind of keep him
42:09 going and work talking a lot and we're
42:10 meeting him at his house and we're going
42:13 through material and he eventually got
42:16 so back on track that within the year he
42:20 had a vh1 special okay now there's a
42:24 point to me telling you all this
42:25 information about just trying to blow my
42:27 own whistle here he gets on stage at his
42:34 vh1 special which we filmed twice
42:35 because the first one that was kind of
42:39 weird but during the first one he stops
42:43 in the middle of the act and and he says
42:46 I just want to say thank you somebody
42:48 because without him I wouldn't be
42:51 standing here and he just points right
42:52 at me and he says I wasn't on stage my
42:57 father had died I couldn't use a bunch
42:59 of my material I wasn't comfortable with
43:01 it and he goes but what I didn't tell my
43:04 friend was that my father's last words
43:07 to me were get back was to get back on
43:09 stage and he sent my buddy to get me
43:14 back on stage I was blown away and he
43:18 continued to do that little introduction
43:20 you know like if you introduced me in
43:21 front of people for several events after
43:24 that he was like this is the guy this is
43:25 the guy that got me back in and I you
43:28 know it's that's something I would do
43:30 that I've never had someone return such
43:32 a kind gracious gesture amazing now I've
43:37 also worked with very famous legendary
43:41 film writers directors special effects
43:44 guys like I've said so I have probably a
43:47 combined nearly 20 years experience
43:50 doing this okay and that doesn't count
43:52 the 25 years of video game experience
43:55 I'm setting this up for the for the
43:58 crescendo here I recently had the
44:00 situation where I'm helping some talent
44:05 various talent you have very young
44:06 talent kind of incubate up into a real
44:09 career here in Hollywood and there's
44:12 some friends of mine in the Midwest that
44:13 are
44:14 just the sweetest amazing people the
44:16 most talented frickin family it's like
44:18 the Jackson 5
44:20 just one sibling after another is
44:22 amazing and but to them are really going
44:24 for the for the gusto my part of it is
44:27 to try and figure out where the careers
44:29 are here in Hollywood so they can get
44:31 their groove on right now I've been
44:33 through the Machine I've seen it all
44:35 I've been in you know film conferences
44:38 and the exact room in 20th Century Fox
44:41 where George Lucas and Steven Spielberg
44:42 negotiated their first three or four
44:44 films all the Star Wars films I've been
44:46 off to Paramount Studios to work on film
44:49 projects you know for years I've read my
44:53 own stuff for famous celebrities I've
44:56 been in the machine I've seen it I know
44:58 it works I know it doesn't work I've
45:00 seen projects that were done that made
45:02 people legends in 1982 and I watched you
45:05 know I met them in this century and then
45:07 I went back and researched their entire
45:09 career where did they go after that what
45:11 was successful this guy doesn't seem to
45:13 have any money
45:14 and lives in a shack this guy you know
45:17 can't seem to fall down he's making
45:20 hand-over-fist money highly respected in
45:23 the industry right so now I'm helping
45:26 this group of kids and obviously I work
45:31 with the parents the entire time but
45:34 there was an interesting funny ass thing
45:36 which was how to manage well you know
45:39 where should the kids go show the kids
45:40 focus more on social media or should
45:43 they focus on going to college and
45:45 getting film degrees or whatever it is
45:48 that turns them on right and they were
45:53 given a text message from one of the
45:56 fellow kids that's doing really well on
45:59 YouTube and it was the most a pedophile
46:03 of the lottery ticket win business model
46:07 and in the text messages said I once
46:10 made a hundred thousand dollars in a
46:11 month off my YouTube channel now I
46:15 personally don't even know how that's
46:16 possible I mean you get a fraction of a
46:18 freaking penny anytime one of these
46:20 things gets viewed okay but the kids
46:23 said and again it's unverified by
46:25 anything it's just a claim but then the
46:27 next thing you said was
46:28 that was the last time that ever
46:29 happened it went down from there
46:31 this is like an 18 year old kid maybe 19
46:35 tops giving advice to this family in the
46:38 Midwest now what do you think the family
46:41 in the Midwest wants to hear my version
46:43 of reality which is your kid needs to
46:45 really focus needs to become a
46:47 professional increase the scope of the
46:49 talents and increase the scope of range
46:52 of of those talents so if you're going
46:54 to be a comedian you got to learn how to
46:56 figure out what kind of comedian you are
46:57 if you want to be a nice you know sort
47:03 of Jay Leno comedian that never swears
47:04 you're gonna have to be really funny at
47:06 that you got to write your own material
47:07 you got to test it out and do it if
47:09 you're gonna do skits and sketch comedy
47:11 you need to get inside of a comedy
47:12 troupe and see if you can do it right if
47:15 you want to be a dancer well you're
47:17 gonna have to figure out how to count
47:18 down dance moves you just are right for
47:22 anyone want to get into film you got to
47:24 go to film school you need to go to film
47:27 school today it is too complex to go in
47:29 and just learn it if you had a parent
47:31 that was in this if you're James
47:32 Cameron's kid or grandchild yeah sure
47:35 grandpa's going to teach you everything
47:37 you know but you're going to get that
47:38 film school equivalent education so I
47:43 get this copy of this text message and I
47:47 was kind of like well that's great but
47:49 you know a heartthrob on YouTube only
47:52 probably has like a five year lifespan
47:54 right the last Justin Bieber how many 12
47:57 year old girls are throwing their
47:58 panties onstage anymore right when he
48:01 was 14 it made sense they're seeing
48:03 someone they could marry I mean really
48:06 in real life two years ahead no big deal
48:08 right this kid is in decline mode he
48:12 will never ever be on top again in his
48:14 life will he continue to poor florrum
48:15 and make tens of millions of dollars
48:16 sure but he's going to be entertaining
48:18 little girls who are now older in their
48:21 20s 30s 40s and 50s when he's in his
48:23 2030s forties and fifties and all
48:24 anyone's trying to do is recreate their
48:26 childhood anyone who sees Bret Michaels
48:30 perform is not going for SuperDuper
48:32 music quality they're going to recreate
48:34 the 80s right if you ever saw poison
48:37 it's not because you're looking for
48:38 really original rock tunes you're
48:40 looking for your childhood
48:42 right and there's nothing wrong with
48:43 that okay it's just you can't build a
48:47 whole life on that that's what George or
48:48 rep Michaels does a bunch of shows on TV
48:51 he needs some battery income alright he
48:54 probably came out a lot sweeter than a
48:56 lot of these folks and hopefully he's
48:57 invested as money well I met the guys
48:59 this absolute total sweetheart and let
49:02 me tell you there's one dude in this
49:04 industry in the rock industry that takes
49:05 care of his fans Bret Michaels is number
49:09 one on my list
49:09 this dude is amazing other rockers hate
49:13 him because he's so successful at it too
49:14 it's really funny but when it comes down
49:18 to the math of what I just experienced
49:20 it's really funny people are going for
49:24 what they want to hear right it's their
49:29 own version of the lottery ticket well
49:30 this one seems a lot easier if I say
49:34 have you read any reports on the decline
49:36 of social media nope okay how old do you
49:41 think your kid can be before they're not
49:43 going to be grabbing the kids that are
49:45 sitting on their phones all day pounding
49:47 through YouTube videos no clue right so
49:52 my my thought process is based on my
49:55 experience you know I've seen the
49:58 greatest stand-up comedians you know
50:03 they can't get anyone to come to see him
50:05 and all sudden something turns around
50:07 you know I hid this woman's name because
50:11 she was going through a lot of crap at
50:13 the time but I saw Leslie Jones which
50:17 some people don't like but I think she's
50:19 an absolutely brilliant human being she
50:22 opened for Katt Williams I was really
50:24 watching Katt Williams shows on Netflix
50:26 and Leslie open for him on this special
50:29 and I was like where is this woman how
50:31 come I've never seen her you know I used
50:32 to go to the Melrose improv a couple
50:37 times a month for years never saw her
50:39 come through and so I quickly looked her
50:43 up on my sofa looked up her website it
50:46 was 1999 that last time she had an
50:50 update I think this was like 2011 2010
50:52 2011
50:53 it hadn't been updated for over 10 years
50:55 and so I sent her an email and I said
50:57 hey what's up I take care of celebrities
50:59 from time to time
51:00 I rarely charge any money I just do it
51:02 because I believe in people I said
51:04 what's going on with you
51:05 she instantaneously cop you know he's
51:08 met emails me back she wasn't famous yet
51:10 right I said well let's get you on track
51:13 I said just I'm gonna build a site let
51:16 me let me have access to your domain so
51:19 we can point it to my server I'll back
51:21 up what you got then I'll put something
51:22 up there really nice and within two or
51:25 three days I had her whole thing worked
51:26 on she had a vh1 special on DVD but no
51:30 one knew what existed cuz the site
51:31 didn't have it she had no representation
51:32 right I went and attended one of her
51:37 performances I did a bunch of
51:39 promotional stuff where I should say
51:40 everything I could everything that she
51:42 had going she used to throw these really
51:44 big birthday bashes with all these
51:45 comedians from MADtv
51:47 she was totally hooked up and she's
51:49 aggressive she's like this 6-foot plus
51:52 you know african-american woman and
51:55 she's just she's just a tour de force in
51:58 real life
51:59 amazing right plus a huge sweetheart
52:00 right and so we just kept pushing and
52:05 pushing and changing and pushing and it
52:08 was just a tiny little nudge for me not
52:11 that much just got her looking decent
52:13 online got her some good promotional
52:15 stuff looked like she had some money
52:16 behind her she goes bouncing around
52:21 she went from you know barely being able
52:25 to probably pay rent I mean this is kind
52:27 of the things that she communicated with
52:28 me time which I can say now because
52:30 she's not having any problem paying her
52:31 bills now and she gets one of the head
52:34 writing jobs at signing out live just
52:37 out of thin air boom and she's had some
52:40 some unfortunate experiences the last
52:44 couple years but I think that's all
52:45 settled down now right when I don't even
52:51 know if you guys know but she got hacked
52:52 pretty bad a couple times and you know I
52:56 had agents blowing up my phone thinking
53:00 that I was still hosting her website
53:02 which I wasn't someone to actually put
53:04 up a website on her domain having stolen
53:06 her phone gotten her
53:07 information probably use the trial
53:09 account put up these horrible websites
53:11 all her personal data up there and you
53:14 know they were padding she's emailing me
53:16 to suck you know like she's really upset
53:18 and I'm trying to calm her down she just
53:20 more I tried to calm her down the more
53:21 she got pissed off at me and I said look
53:23 you're emailing me to take down your
53:25 website and I just need to hear your
53:27 voice just call me and say take it down
53:29 and hang up the phone so I can verify
53:31 it's you because I could be getting
53:32 hacked right now and this could not be
53:34 you and then finally she yelled at me
53:36 with enough information about our
53:39 background together that I knew okay no
53:41 one would know that except for her and
53:42 so I took it down right away but she's a
53:46 perfect example of someone who didn't
53:48 buy the lottery ticket
53:49 she worked her ass off and love her or
53:53 hate her she worked her ass off now she
53:55 does you know was it
53:57 Farmers Insurance commercials I think
53:59 and you know she does all kinds of stuff
54:00 she's in movies and you know people
54:02 don't like the new Ghostbusters I doubt
54:04 I would like it either I never saw it
54:06 that's a that's a franchise you don't
54:09 touch I don't care who whoever he does
54:11 it these remakes are obviously awful but
54:16 the point of this and I'm you know it's
54:17 a sort of a meandering around thing but
54:19 hopefully it's entertaining and
54:20 informative
54:21 the idea is you need to think about the
54:27 lottery ticket find out in your life if
54:28 you are selling yourself on someone's
54:31 one-in-a-million chance to succeed I
54:35 have a big philosophy in life and it has
54:38 to do with being able to replicate
54:40 perfection which kind of lightly ties
54:44 into this and the idea is that anyone
54:49 can slip and create something wonderful
54:52 once and I hope that happens to each and
54:54 every one of you and I hope some of you
54:56 have already experienced that but ask
54:58 anyone who's had a top 10 hit or a
55:00 number one hit if it was easy to write
55:04 the second one if you can put one up
55:08 there again and again that's why I'm
55:10 Michael Jackson and Prince and all these
55:11 amazing musicians are so amazing because
55:14 they could do it over and over and over
55:16 again right there's no pie in the sky
55:19 there's an
55:20 a lottery ticket model no let's take was
55:24 you understand that don't need to say
55:26 much more about that so let's just take
55:29 a little second here before I close this
55:30 off to really talk about what can happen
55:34 because you do need to have something to
55:37 inspire you to go do it how many times
55:42 have we benefited from someone selling
55:45 themselves a line of crap I don't know
55:49 what music you like but if you've ever
55:52 obsessed on a particular band or a
55:54 particular band member and you said you
55:57 know you've heard them had the interview
55:58 and they've said you know the question
56:02 is well what made you do this why'd you
56:03 get in the business and and you'll have
56:05 these guys say well I wanted money and
56:07 chicks and that's why they got it and
56:12 there are hundreds of albums and dozens
56:17 and dozens of songs that are part of our
56:19 life because they sold themselves such a
56:23 pie in the sky dream necessarily right
56:26 that's a lot different than saying well
56:29 I saw everyone else doing it so I
56:30 thought for sure I could succeed every
56:34 time you used to watch American Idol
56:35 back in the day when the first two or
56:37 three seasons which were just
56:38 unbelievable right the the legendary bad
56:43 auditions
56:43 you know entertained us for a decade
56:46 after you know she bangs she Bing right
56:50 what they sold themselves in a bad
56:53 audition usually is someone who sold
56:55 themselves the fame game they sold
56:59 themselves something not based on any
57:00 Talent they never recorded their voice
57:02 and played it back or they're so
57:04 tone-deaf they can't tell the difference
57:05 they don't have anyone in the family
57:07 that has any experience no one was being
57:09 realistic with them right someone sent
57:12 them a text message and they jumped on
57:14 board and completely derailed their
57:15 lives right we do have to find ways to
57:18 inspire ourselves and I would say the
57:23 threshold in the sand okay and in your
57:26 mind that is going to go from probably
57:30 fairly healthy thinking to not so
57:33 healthy thinking
57:34 is this mechanism of anything that you
57:39 rationalize that takes away your
57:42 dedication and makes you lazy because
57:45 you think it's a short sure thing
57:46 because someone else is seemingly done
57:48 it without putting much work into it you
57:52 know Elvis Presley is probably one of
57:53 the greatest examples of someone that
57:55 literally fell uphill now he had a
57:58 natural talent to sing he was a handsome
58:01 bloke and he knew how to dance for 1955
58:04 up he knew how to dance you know how to
58:07 shake his hips right so he wasn't
58:10 talentless by any stretch he never would
58:12 any of his lyrics by the way but he just
58:14 picked up these old blues tunes from
58:17 probably down south from the black folks
58:20 that have written most of those riffs
58:22 and they sanitized it up to a white guy
58:25 because they knew that that would sell
58:26 more records and he was the right place
58:28 at the right time recorded a single and
58:30 kaboom he was off to the races but he
58:34 also was you know the king of what he
58:37 did I guess you could call it rock and
58:39 roll you know we don't consider 50s
58:41 music rock and roll today but it is it
58:43 is the 50s rock so he's the king of rock
58:45 Michael's the king of pop right and
58:49 Prince was a Greek god sometimes you
58:52 have that much talent right Prince said
58:55 in baby on the star he said one of the
58:57 lyrics when you got a baby nothing comes
58:59 too hard and I've said that before in an
59:01 episode extremely important thing but
59:03 how do you get it right go look go look
59:07 up YouTube videos about Prince and you
59:10 know a lot of the interviews with his ex
59:12 bandmates after he passed there's a
59:14 channel out there called Jamie Star News
59:16 if you happen to like Prince but even if
59:18 you just want to go on the little
59:19 journey that with me go listen to some
59:22 of those interviews because Prince
59:25 worked around the clock 24/7 he just so
59:28 happened to biologically not need a lot
59:30 of sleep and I think you know of course
59:33 the end of his life he may have used
59:34 stimulants to keep that going in his 40s
59:36 and 50s but way before that he was just
59:38 a natural high kind of guy right
59:41 practising guitars for eight hours
59:43 straight if not twelve hours straight
59:45 staying up playing all the instruments
59:46 working
59:47 song mixing it all down himself turning
59:50 in his own album right we need to be
59:53 like that because a lot of times will
59:56 end up happening with your career and
59:57 with your life is that you if you do it
60:00 right in my opinion or I say one of the
60:04 very successful ways of doing it is that
60:05 you sell yourself on a very large
60:08 investment it's gonna take me a thousand
60:12 hours to figure out how to do that
60:13 really well what ends up happening is
60:16 you don't really need a thousand hours
60:18 but you won't know until you find out
60:20 you don't need a thousand hours and then
60:21 you can cut it short and you'll succeed
60:24 it 200 hours you'll find out you have a
60:27 lot of talent you'll find out actually
60:28 things don't take a lot to learn the
60:30 basics and get kind of dangerous with it
60:32 right
60:33 I took one music class in college I had
60:38 probably written at least one album of
60:40 instrumental music before that and it
60:45 was just I learned how to read music by
60:48 programming my own synthesizer as a kid
60:51 in my teens and in order to I did rigged
60:56 up the keyboard so I could actually play
60:57 a keyboard on the keys on my computer
61:00 but I eventually bought a synthesizer
61:01 very shortly after I wrote this program
61:03 but in order to test my software I would
61:06 take sheet music and translate every
61:08 note down into the notes inside the
61:10 software so it saved the score and I'd
61:12 play it back and it sounded like crap
61:13 it's like a like a Nintendo game playing
61:16 it back to me but that's the way I
61:17 confirmed it worked and that's how I
61:18 kind of learned to read sheet music
61:20 never ever learned how to read it
61:22 fluently right the people can do that
61:23 hats off man but after that one class
61:28 which this jerk-off gave me an F I had
61:31 to drive 30 minutes to school every
61:34 single day one day it was really really
61:37 backed up due to some accidents on the
61:39 280 up in the Bay Area which if you ever
61:40 driven that you'll know what I'm talking
61:42 about I think it was even like a
61:45 fatality I told the guys to look man
61:46 that traffic was jams it was my final
61:49 exam and I played it perfectly right on
61:52 a piano he sat there listened to me
61:54 didn't have the balls to tell me he's
61:56 gonna fail me what a jerk-off I just get
61:58 that off my chest there you go
62:00 but after that I wrote you know several
62:04 tracks for videogames I wrote them for
62:06 private projects I would I would write
62:09 full soundtracks for corporate demos
62:11 that I was doing so I program and
62:13 animate it in 3d and then write the
62:15 soundtrack for it and turn it in so I
62:19 knew I learned enough to get dangerous
62:20 but to make some money to actually do it
62:23 professionally a couple times right and
62:25 so you can get in and make things happen
62:28 without a tremendous investment the
62:31 reason why I tell you these stories is
62:33 because if you're drawn to the lottery
62:35 ticket model because reality is scaring
62:38 the crap out of you let me take a little
62:40 bit of steam out of the reality for a
62:43 second just say look maybe you will need
62:45 the full thousand hours okay it will
62:49 break there'll be a point where you play
62:51 a guitar and it sounds like crap for a
62:53 really long time at least a long time to
62:56 you depending on how old you are time
62:57 moves a little faster or slower right
62:59 but eventually if you keep playing it
63:03 just happens first time I recorded a
63:05 guitar solo I never done a guitar solo
63:08 in my life and I had just played the
63:10 guitar so much every single day crap
63:13 right did eventually and I only played
63:16 solo stuff I chords that's easy
63:19 transition but boom or easy ish but
63:22 there got to be a point where I learned
63:24 the neck of a guitar and my brain
63:26 wanting to express itself in the guitar
63:28 was completely natural I didn't know to
63:32 this day I have no idea what notes I was
63:34 playing but when I played it I you know
63:37 I got through all different types of
63:39 techniques playing the neck and doing
63:40 all kinds of crazy stuff my first solo I
63:42 played it for a buddy of mine who's a
63:44 guitar player and he's like you how long
63:47 have you been playing guitar yeah well
63:48 just fooling around with it you know is
63:50 that that was really excellent you know
63:52 I can't believe you just played that and
63:54 I was like well just happen he goes well
63:56 you know what that's how it works
63:57 you get into an instrument enough you
63:59 just become the instrument that's really
64:02 it is for everything if you're into
64:03 dance well you'll just organically pull
64:06 it out of your body because the music is
64:08 demanding you move a certain way right
64:10 for those of you can dance you know it's
64:12 the that's
64:13 you dance and the people who can't dance
64:15 they're trying to break dance into like
64:17 some mechanical execution right so I
64:19 line dancing musn't want a barf all
64:21 right you're not dancing you're you're
64:24 being a robot
64:25 you're just one two three yeah you know
64:27 it's like whatever if it's entertaining
64:29 you it's great but I'm just saying
64:31 you're not dancing
64:32 who's telling you I want you to succeed
64:34 I really really do because you know the
64:39 motto of this show is to rebuild society
64:41 from the bottom up right yeah you know I
64:44 corrected myself we're not trying to
64:45 build a pyramid again but we're trying
64:46 to build society from the gutteral
64:49 talent and the guttural cause-and-effect
64:52 models that create happiness and every
64:54 human being on planet earth right and it
64:57 doesn't matter what the hell you do
64:59 accounting could confuse you and confuse
65:01 you
65:02 statistics take statistics and or
65:04 calculus and college and way too you
65:07 know if you if you blazed through that
65:10 to your special human being but if you
65:12 fail the first time welcome to the club
65:14 you know and then you might go through
65:16 again and get an A plus it just clicks
65:19 right my dad took calculus twice one is
65:22 a young man one as a guy in his late 30s
65:25 and then he got his ass kicked
65:28 first time he took it in his late 30s
65:30 and then he he just got pissed he was
65:33 like I should know how to do this ice
65:36 cream Chuck yeah but my dad's a very
65:39 intelligent guy brilliant dude and he
65:42 just it's just a personal vendetta
65:45 against calculus he was just like I'm
65:48 going to get this and finally he told me
65:50 the story a couple times and it's just
65:52 this is I love it it's one of the best
65:54 stories I've ever heard about academic
65:56 you know tenacity and he said it finally
65:59 clicked not only did he ace calculus but
66:03 he a statistics right after that which
66:05 was kind of a side probability you know
66:08 indicator and on the side of statistics
66:10 right I didn't get into calculus until I
66:14 started programming things and I needed
66:15 some calculus to do some certain you
66:17 know type of trajectory work some
66:20 trigonometry as well but I didn't get
66:23 into statistics until I worked on
66:25 and here we are we were spending 300
66:27 million dollars on a big gaming platform
66:29 we try to sit down and figure out the
66:32 statistical needs of handling 20 million
66:36 consecutive players and we just sat down
66:39 and without taking the class we started
66:43 just doing statistics and we started
66:44 just doing probability analysis and
66:46 right there in front of me I had two
66:48 other guys that were pretty good at it
66:50 ahead of time but eventually just seeing
66:52 it on the board made my brain go click
66:54 and that was it forever I can do those
66:58 calculations now right based on all the
67:00 factors right you can do it too and
67:03 whatever you love or whatever you need
67:05 you do it and uh you know I'm gonna
67:08 close this off before I read out the
67:10 bumper I forgot what they call it
67:14 there's this there's this phase in
67:16 performers if you ever perform on stage
67:20 I have saying several times on stage and
67:24 there's this out-of-body experience that
67:27 happens and a lot of folks especially
67:29 these actors like Johnny Depp that say
67:31 he's never watched any one of his movies
67:33 all the way through which I don't quite
67:34 believe because how do you go to a
67:36 premiere of your own film I guess you
67:38 can sit in the back the whole time but
67:40 Elvis Presley used to get so absolutely
67:43 nervous before he walked on stage he'd
67:45 forget all of his lyrics I've had to
67:49 sing live at like you know rocker
67:53 weddings and you know I'm trying to
67:55 remember the song that I just learned to
67:58 sing on the stage and I can barely you
68:00 know it's a word it's a saw I never had
68:02 heard before and I'd had three weeks to
68:03 kind of prep for it and you know you get
68:06 to the point where you're like okay and
68:08 I knocked out the first song really
68:10 really well it getting to the second
68:11 song and the drummer kind of messed up
68:12 the whole song but you know the lyrics
68:15 were crazy the timing was nuts and it
68:18 was just it was a I believe the songs
68:22 custard pie by Led Zeppelin it's a
68:25 really odd song right I got up there
68:28 before I walked up I had brain freeze so
68:30 my brain just went white I don't
68:32 remember any of this song and I've been
68:34 singing it hundreds of times before I
68:36 got on stage right
68:38 but when you get up there there's
68:40 something that happens to you you have
68:42 this out-of-body experience and it all
68:44 comes back to you once the music starts
68:46 to play all your pavlo nyan triggers for
68:48 what you know how to do your muscle
68:50 memory for whatever it is you're doing
68:51 kicks in for anyone who has ever had a
68:54 good comedic moment with your family
68:55 members or maybe you stand on stage
68:57 we've got our buddy John Vee he's a
69:00 professional you have these experiences
69:04 where you go up there and there's just
69:06 this amazing thing that happens when you
69:08 connect with an audience and you get
69:11 them to start laughing and then any
69:13 doubt you had that you're gonna be able
69:14 to pull this off over and over and over
69:16 for an hour goes away and you're in your
69:19 zone and then you get off the stage
69:21 relax go to bed get up the next day and
69:24 you'll look back at your performance and
69:26 you'll say how did I even do that does
69:29 that mean do I really have this
69:30 recessive talent in me thing is it
69:33 doesn't have to be a celebrity thing or
69:35 you're you know performing on stage or
69:37 anything anytime you do what you love
69:39 you're on stage anytime you create
69:42 something you're the people on stage
69:44 right when you consume something you're
69:47 the people in the audience right as I've
69:50 said in previous episodes my hope for
69:52 you is that you get a good chunk of time
69:54 in the audience and you get a good chunk
69:55 of time on stage and you take change do
69:57 you take turns easy for me to say you
70:02 take turns back and forth between the
70:04 stage and the on the audience and once
70:06 you start framing what you do in life
70:07 and these leave these easy little
70:09 metaphors it starts to help you perform
70:12 better if you're a sales person all
70:17 right you're going to room you know if
70:19 you've done it a hundred times it's just
70:21 like Babe Ruth hitting a home run but if
70:23 you haven't done a hundred times wait a
70:24 little nervous the first couple times
70:26 right how many times have you had to
70:28 have a difficult conversation with
70:29 someone and you don't know what you're
70:32 gonna say but you slow yourself down so
70:35 you don't go nuts in the room and you go
70:37 in there and for whatever reason every
70:40 perfect thing you could possibly say
70:41 comes out of your mouth and you make no
70:43 mistakes and you walk into that room and
70:45 everyone's thrilled to death that you
70:46 came and that you sold a new product or
70:48 whatever you reassured them of something
70:51 or you had to deal with a personal issue
70:53 and everyone's happy
70:55 my advice is to get out while you're
70:58 ahead you know didn't get it all
71:00 straightened out and then say oh you
71:01 know I'm gonna take off now see you
71:02 later
71:03 give yourself some breathing space give
71:06 yourself some room for a victory lap
71:08 right put it in your quiver as your
71:12 abilities to do something special
71:14 there's two hemispheres to the lottery
71:17 ticket life people who are trying to
71:19 sell it to you and you sell it to
71:22 yourself it's going to be probably a
71:25 hell of a lot easier after this episode
71:27 for you to see it now someone's selling
71:31 you a one-time situation a lot of people
71:34 fabricate these situations right now I'm
71:36 gonna tell you about a guy who's made
71:37 one hundred thirty thousand dollars in a
71:39 month oh really
71:40 show me his bank account right by the
71:43 way anytime much money in this day and
71:44 age right
71:45 you only gonna do it one time that's not
71:48 enough money right it's better to fight
71:51 with a big paycheck then to fight for
71:56 all these little ones what did Jim
71:57 Carrey do he wrote himself a check for
71:58 ten million dollars right stuck it in
72:00 his wallet so he could cash it I think
72:02 less than two or three years later he
72:05 was able to cash the check and it's all
72:06 [ __ ] he didn't cash it but he kept
72:08 he keeps it in his wall and he's shown
72:10 it to a bunch of people over the last
72:12 ten years of interviews right I been
72:15 doing it since the mid 90s but when you
72:18 have to adjust your own lottery ticket
72:20 winning system that archetype of this is
72:22 why I'm gonna succeed that's a little
72:25 tougher to catch so now you're aware if
72:28 you weren't aware before you are aware
72:29 the younger you are when you hear this
72:31 message the better if you are a parent
72:33 or a grandparent and you are engaged in
72:35 your kids life and you start hearing
72:37 these archetypes come out of your kids
72:39 try to find a way to just to
72:46 let them know that they're gonna have to
72:48 actually put some work in right that
72:51 just because the one guy or one girl
72:52 made it happen
72:54 doesn't mean it's it's gonna happen
72:55 again to them all right
72:57 use a real lottery ticket metaphor like
72:59 I used in this one or an example I
73:00 should say I think you feel me
73:03 this was a surprise super long day I
73:06 came out at 10:30 out of my house and I
73:10 was I wore a jacket when I came outside
73:13 and I was sweating within two seconds so
73:16 I popped it off and I said look this is
73:18 a great day to do an episode I'm gonna
73:19 do it in the middle of the morning here
73:21 I've been up all night so this is me up
73:25 probably 20 hours at this point if you
73:29 haven't been already go to deep thoughts
73:30 radio comm from there are all the feeds
73:32 all the methods of contributing to the
73:35 show if you're on video YouTube is the
73:38 only channel at this point vid dot me
73:40 went out of business I'll say that a few
73:42 more times I will be posting more of
73:46 season one on the locked Facebook group
73:48 you can get that link from deep thoughts
73:50 radio calm at the top if you're coming
73:52 in on mobile it's got that little you
73:54 know the dashes you click that and it
73:56 gives you the menu of where you're going
73:58 if you'd rather have this in your car as
74:00 an audio feed feel free to go on iTunes
74:03 or Google Play or simply go to the
74:05 website and click the appropriate link
74:07 there's also just an RSS feed link and
74:09 there's three little icons that drop on
74:10 to the screen on your phone most phones
74:14 have some sort of podcast reader I use
74:17 podcast addict on the Android if you're
74:19 on the iPhone just you're going to get
74:21 through iTunes it's an easy way to get
74:23 it you will have to download the entire
74:25 episode if you need to pause because the
74:27 website is on a server that is not
74:29 allowing for you to restart after you
74:32 pause at least with podcasts addict I
74:34 can't do that for those of you
74:36 supporting me on patreon i SuperDuper
74:37 appreciate it i am going to start
74:39 increasing my posting there there is a
74:41 Twitter account I should probably put
74:44 that up there it is ran by a close
74:48 friend of mine who is now part of the
74:49 show in terms of administration on the
74:51 backend so I've got another person
74:53 helping out with the actual locked
74:54 Facebook group I want to see a big shout
74:56 out to him he prefers not to have his
74:57 name out there they
74:59 he is running the Twitter feed I'm not
75:01 participating in the Twitter feed but I
75:03 guess I could lock into that I just
75:04 don't know if I have a heck of a lot of
75:05 things to say I think the more you have
75:08 a single place to find it all the better
75:09 but if you guys you know have a big
75:11 preference for Twitter do let me know
75:13 somehow I did open up the PayPal because
75:19 some folks requested PayPal I haven't
75:22 had anyone use it yet so you know
75:24 whatever floats your boat is cool I did
75:29 buy some new audio software this morning
75:31 that hopefully helped out I've been
75:32 using Adobe Audition to record and what
75:37 has been going on is the audio will be
75:39 going fine and then all the sudden turns
75:41 into this horrible static distortion for
75:44 you know 10 20 seconds that's why the
75:47 last episode had a weird intro because I
75:50 had to use the mic off my camera here so
75:53 if you ever hear a bad audio it's simply
75:55 because the computer itself had an issue
75:56 but this software is dedicated nothing
75:58 but recording audio and I gave it a big
76:01 test today that seemed to work out
76:02 beautifully so I made the switch from
76:05 Mac back to Windows I haven't bought a
76:07 Windows computer since my video game
76:09 company 10 years ago so I am absolutely
76:12 thrilled to death of my Myra public
76:15 computer gamers republic of gamers or
76:18 whatever anyhow if you made it this far
76:20 thanks for listening take care of
76:23 yourself and somebody else and I will
76:24 see in the next deep thoughts over now
76:27 [Music]
76:32 you
76:32 [Music]
