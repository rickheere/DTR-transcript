00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:35 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen on this rather
00:39 chilly day the whole world's really cold
00:42 right now
00:44 in the northern hemisphere i need a job
00:47 where i go to
00:48 the southern hemisphere in the winter
00:50 and then northern hemisphere in the
00:52 summer for the northern hemisphere
00:57 so today i read an article
01:01 and apparently this came out a couple
01:02 days ago but since i'm not reading
01:04 mainstream press of any kind and i'm not
01:05 sure how mainstream this is but it
01:07 should be
01:09 the united states pentagon our head
01:12 building
01:13 command headquarters for the u.s
01:15 military
01:17 has apparently released via a freedom of
01:20 information act or
01:21 foia request 154-page report
01:27 that essentially admits that they have
01:30 been testing
01:32 alien spacecraft slash
01:35 alien materials and technology
01:40 now for those of you who've been a part
01:42 of this channel for quite some time
01:44 you know we got lots of episodes
01:47 that have talked about ufos which are
01:49 now called
01:50 uaps unidentified aerial phenomenons
01:54 and so i thought we'd just review
01:57 sort of what we know about areas where
02:01 we think there's a lot of credibility
02:02 for ufos
02:04 and the warning that werner von braun
02:07 gave
02:08 supposedly his phd assistant
02:12 who said that be careful
02:15 they are already planning
02:19 a fake alien invasion of earth
02:22 which they will use to install a
02:24 one-world government
02:26 hmm now let's say i think he died in
02:30 like 78 or something like that
02:34 between his death and say 2019
02:38 we keep having the same conversation
02:40 well could they really do it
02:43 what technologies would they have to
02:45 develop to do a fake one
02:48 and or did they truly make contact with
02:50 a civilization
02:52 that is friendly and willing to come and
02:56 say hello
02:58 plus all of the dr stephen greer just
03:01 you know project disclosure stuff that
03:04 makes claims of
03:05 you know up to 27 species of aliens
03:08 many of which supposedly look like us i
03:11 mean they are us but whatever
03:14 and so there could be a big political
03:17 play
03:19 for a particular planet it just baffles
03:21 me that um
03:23 there would be 27 species
03:27 one that would make this miraculous
03:29 discovery of earth in the first place
03:32 it would beg a starfleet
03:35 sort of galactic alliance
03:39 configuration to them such that when one
03:42 of their
03:43 scout ships finds earth could just even
03:46 be a drone
03:47 that then that would get registered in a
03:48 database and they get a value we would
03:50 get evaluated by their
03:52 metrics of whatever kind and then
03:55 team one team two team three
03:58 it did dawn on me a funny story that has
04:01 never been told which is
04:02 what if your roswell crash aliens were
04:06 here to do something illegal in their
04:08 world right they were coming to
04:10 take something gold or diamonds or
04:12 people or whatever like a ferengi
04:16 cargo ship or something but they just
04:18 happen to crash because they're
04:20 always operating on a shoestring budget
04:22 and they're pirates
04:23 they're alien pirates that sound kind of
04:25 sexy
04:26 but now that we're in 2021
04:30 and we know that they are attempting an
04:31 economic reset
04:33 using illnesses as a methodology to
04:36 consolidate power to destroy this small
04:39 business person
04:41 to force universal income and
04:45 a regimented probably by yearly
04:48 bi-annual shot in your arm for something
04:53 get you believing that you're absolutely
04:55 genetically defective
04:56 which if you are an atheist scientist
04:58 and you believe in evolution
05:00 you should immediately reject such an
05:02 assertion because
05:03 we wouldn't exist today if we were so
05:05 flawed and if we are
05:07 introducing technology and
05:11 poisons into our food supply slash
05:13 environment
05:15 then the atheist scientists should
05:18 raise up their hands and go we must stop
05:21 this because we're creating all the
05:22 illnesses that then they're turning into
05:24 all these things
05:26 but let's rewind why is the government
05:29 doing this now
05:31 and why have they been fairly lenient
05:33 about these kind of things
05:35 releasing a couple years ago the
05:38 what they call the tic tac ufo video
05:42 and that's the name that the top gun
05:43 pilot who chased it off the coast of
05:45 california down here
05:47 called it the tic tac it was a
05:50 tic-tac-shaped which is like a
05:52 pill-shaped
05:54 vehicle that they simply couldn't catch
05:55 it was toying with them
05:57 it accelerated extremely quickly
06:01 didn't appear to have any of the sort of
06:03 anomalies that
06:05 maybe ball lightning would have in the
06:07 desert where you think you're seeing a
06:08 ufo but it's really just a spinning disc
06:10 of plasma
06:11 which acts like a mirror thus giving it
06:13 a reflective surface
06:15 and it dissipating very quickly through
06:18 a negative pocket in the atmosphere
06:20 and vanishing can be explained
06:26 but it's uh it compared to the tic tac
06:28 is a very organic kind of reactionary
06:32 exchange between electricity and the
06:34 atmosphere whereas the tic tac
06:36 is flying uh what was it uh
06:40 donald trump jr interviewed his dad
06:43 i believe in the last year about
06:46 disclosing some of this stuff
06:47 and you know he kind of like was
06:51 sort of he had a little grin on his face
06:55 and was
06:56 sort of insinuating that he would but
06:58 the one thing that they actually focused
06:59 on was roswell
07:00 in that conversation for a split second
07:03 and trump was like yeah you know that
07:05 one's got teeth
07:07 that one's got teeth what's interesting
07:09 about that is that no president before
07:12 well let's put this way lots of
07:15 presidents have believed in ufos but
07:18 to my knowledge not a single president
07:20 has ever been truly briefed
07:22 without some sort of mole
07:25 that went to area 51 to ask a question
07:29 there's rumors about truman who
07:31 inherited roswell's situation
07:33 and i think there's one about eisenhower
07:35 sending a guy to
07:36 area 51 to check it out who then says
07:39 immediately he saw
07:40 you an alien talking to one of our
07:42 people he had to wait for that meeting
07:43 to end before you get into the room
07:46 so there's kind of two parts to this
07:48 thing
07:50 and there could be a third scenario you
07:52 have let's do three scenarios instead of
07:54 parts scenario one is that roswell
07:57 is indeed a true situation then there's
08:00 scenario two it's
08:01 not a real situation
08:05 then three right i guess scenario two is
08:08 that they would have to fake
08:09 some sort of visitation and three
08:14 really adds one extra thing to the
08:16 puzzle which would be
08:18 a variation of one which is one you re
08:20 you retrieve
08:21 a vehicle but all the the occupants are
08:25 are dead then you get you retrieve the
08:28 vehicle and all these well at least one
08:30 of them is still alive
08:32 one or more
08:35 if you don't have a flying saucer or
08:38 some sort of craft
08:40 then you're gonna have to make one out
08:41 of thin air and that's not gonna be a
08:42 big problem
08:45 if you have one you gotta figure out how
08:46 it works
08:48 if you're gonna create some sort of
08:49 invasion i mean the weird thing is
08:51 imagine
08:51 finding one the alien is gone he's dead
08:55 or whatever
08:55 but you're still going to use his
08:56 vehicle to create this
08:59 you know alien invasion on film
09:02 now some of you will probably believe
09:04 that maybe this is a holdover residual
09:07 from
09:08 trump's administration who seem to be
09:09 getting a lot more involved with
09:12 this sort of thing and then that would
09:15 be
09:16 if you follow him and you like him
09:17 you're going to think this is very legit
09:20 he simply got the pentagon to start a
09:23 plan to reveal things but now he didn't
09:25 get back in due to the the
09:28 shenanigans
09:31 and so he's
09:35 uh there was a someone quoted something
09:37 from the uh
09:39 i don't know it was constitutional
09:40 something or other someone just briefly
09:42 read it to me today and
09:44 and it was that for whatever reason
09:46 because of events
09:48 prior to the potential switch of the
09:51 administrations that trump maintains
09:54 control over the military for 60 days
09:57 so this could be part of that and he's
10:00 saying
10:00 let's go ahead and throw this out before
10:01 our 60 days is up
10:04 throwing sort of a wrench in the
10:08 control apparatus that was typically the
10:10 pentagon prior to
10:11 perhaps decent generals being involved
10:13 in it
10:15 or if you think this is a byproduct of
10:18 the current administration
10:20 then it's probably more nwo stuff
10:24 and it's another it's basically von
10:26 braun's
10:28 warning coming true yet not in a very
10:31 in-your-face
10:31 way now many of you who study this
10:35 you'll know right off the bat that
10:37 ronald reagan
10:40 went up to a podium i can't i think it
10:43 was his first
10:45 speech for one of his first big speeches
10:47 after getting into office
10:49 i could be wrong could be 84 but i think
10:52 it was an 81 or 80 or something like
10:54 that
10:55 i guess i'd be 81 but he laid out this
10:58 scenario
10:59 that wouldn't be great if we had an
11:02 alien
11:04 visit us i think he even
11:07 went as far as to say sort of an
11:09 invasion
11:11 um scenario and that that would
11:15 immediately unite the entire earth
11:18 to be human as opposed to all these
11:21 meticulous
11:23 left-wing weird find a billion ways to
11:26 hate everybody else thing
11:28 now the history channel ran a
11:32 uh episode on that particular speech of
11:35 his
11:37 and he had two speech writers who said
11:39 that he wanted to insert that into the
11:41 speech
11:42 they said no sir you can't do that he
11:45 said okay but he walked out and said it
11:47 anyway
11:50 who knows he was dead after
11:55 or dead before they said that stuff
11:58 now we we talk about this a lot we and i
12:01 use it as an example in other
12:03 subject matter but the notion is
12:06 is that and i just had a conversation
12:07 with my buddy about this last night
12:12 the notion is that they can't tell the
12:14 public because the public would panic
12:17 orson welles did his
12:20 war the world's thing on the radio and
12:22 freaked everybody out because they cut
12:24 out the commercials
12:25 so it would feel super legit and boy did
12:28 it ever work
12:31 i was talking to my buddy and
12:34 we sort of agreed that because america
12:38 was so
12:40 bible belt in mid-century last
12:45 last hundred years that this might have
12:48 been
12:49 a very panicky thing
12:53 the question i have is how panicky and
12:56 for how long
12:58 the kubra ross effect can go through
13:00 pretty quickly through someone
13:02 they're freaked out and then they
13:05 negotiate and then they accept it
13:08 again their stomachs still get hungry
13:09 they still got to pay their bills
13:11 they still believe in god i mean
13:14 the notion is that someone let's say in
13:17 the christian american world
13:20 believes in jesus for instance
13:23 and the suggestion has been given
13:26 several times which is
13:28 well if you prove that aliens exist then
13:30 earth is potentially not the center of
13:32 the universe
13:33 and therefore all of religion just
13:35 unravels overnight
13:38 that doesn't make any sense to me
13:39 whatsoever because
13:42 if science could kill religion
13:45 it would have killed religion a hundred
13:47 years ago at least
13:49 and it didn't in fact i know more people
13:52 in this century now that's that are
13:54 getting
13:54 religious than ever before and they're
13:57 not necessarily crawling into
13:59 a bible and really understanding what's
14:01 in there but they're definitely
14:02 believing in god
14:04 and that sort of thing
14:07 the other scenario that i mentioned a
14:09 lot is that
14:10 these agents that get briefed on ufos
14:16 they apparently they appear to survive
14:18 the process
14:21 very easily they do don't they
14:24 well don't you think they were a little
14:25 shocked don't you think they went home a
14:28 little freaked out
14:30 i mean imagine a scenario where you are
14:32 given one of the most coveted pieces of
14:34 information ever
14:36 but you've already signed a gag order
14:38 for 50 years
14:40 or whatever it is given q clearance
14:44 and the only people you can talk about
14:46 it with are your colleagues
14:48 who are also at your level but if you
14:51 want to leave
14:53 a government institution on a particular
14:55 evening and go home to your wife
14:58 and she has no clue but your mind is
15:00 sitting here
15:01 blown it takes a hell of a constitution
15:06 i would imagine to
15:07 keep that inside now there have been
15:10 death bed confessions of all
15:12 kinds a lot of them recently
15:15 i don't believe all of them believe it
15:17 or not which
15:18 i know that sounds crazy because
15:20 typically when someone is facing death
15:23 what do they have to lose if they
15:24 believe in a god what do they have to
15:26 lose
15:27 to reveal the truth god doesn't buy into
15:28 all this secrecy
15:30 guarantee it if there is a god
15:35 but some of their stories just
15:37 contradict so much other information
15:39 which has a
15:40 a pretty solid bedrock to it
15:44 the other one is that folks that tell
15:47 stories about
15:48 massive participation between us and
15:50 these alien races
15:53 it's definitely tough to
15:57 reconcile in your mind that these people
15:59 be talking to us
16:01 but only the the government and i don't
16:05 know what
16:05 what an alien would think i mean we have
16:07 no clue we may
16:09 have proof that these things exist but
16:12 we haven't had any i believe credible
16:15 conversations with aliens revealed i
16:18 mean so many attempts have been made on
16:19 youtube
16:20 and for a little while there someone
16:23 will get traction for a little while
16:26 faking interviews with these folks and
16:29 then when they got tired of trying to
16:33 account for the fact that perhaps an
16:34 alien doesn't speak
16:36 words they reboil the formula such that
16:40 a human can speak
16:42 and that's just the alien there's been
16:44 some of those too
16:46 but this report is
16:50 bizarrely um
16:54 revealing and yet mysterious
16:59 and for me a bit of the logic doesn't
17:02 compute
17:05 because we're not looking for i mean
17:08 most human beings
17:10 in phase one are not looking for
17:13 you know chemical readouts and and
17:15 autopsy reports of these
17:18 aliens if they were to exist and we were
17:21 to have met them
17:23 we want to know basic answers to
17:26 basic questions and the idea that these
17:30 basic things aren't being addressed but
17:33 other basic things are being addressed
17:36 doesn't compute for me the pentagon's
17:39 report essentially says that they've
17:40 been testing crashed
17:42 aircraft from non-terrestrial
17:46 sources meaning outside the planet earth
17:51 they've even discussed the famous
17:54 famous foil that was picked up all over
17:57 roswell
17:58 which apparently was memory metal i
18:01 don't know how to pronounce it but
18:03 the english language would have us
18:04 pronounce it something like
18:07 nitinol and i-t-i-n-o-l
18:12 that's what they started to call the
18:13 memory medal
18:15 there was no mention of element 115 from
18:18 bob lazar's world
18:20 but nothing's negated it either
18:23 now when i first started this show
18:24 obviously i didn't know as much as i
18:26 know now
18:28 researching stuff for shows and just the
18:30 world
18:31 barfing out more information but i could
18:34 definitely tell you in the summer of
18:36 2015
18:37 having gone through eric dollard stuff
18:39 already which pointed me back to the
18:42 the discoverers of electricity for us
18:46 in the especially modern world
18:50 i wouldn't have been able to tell you
18:52 what i'm about to tell you but
18:55 the more that i think this through
19:00 especially after the tesla episode after
19:03 seeing several videos online of people
19:06 creating what's tint amount to a
19:08 perpetual
19:10 motion machine there are
19:13 people building these magnetic engines
19:16 that will run
19:16 for the life of the magnet they will
19:20 they will spin forever as long as the
19:22 magnet has magnetism
19:25 and these are little parlor magnets that
19:27 you can buy
19:29 now we know that we could create some of
19:30 these magnets at
19:33 disturbingly huge magnetic force we
19:38 wouldn't have to
19:39 because just like the tesla car itself
19:41 runs on a bunch of
19:43 custom designed batteries which
19:45 initially were computer batteries
19:46 but now been heavily refined
19:49 we could simply put together
19:53 a million of these things and we'd have
19:55 free energy
19:57 but that's more of a land-based energy
19:59 system
20:01 i believe that there are a number of
20:04 configurations out there of an infinite
20:06 power
20:06 source that is truly
20:12 a siphon of the universe
20:16 whereby a vehicle could be given
20:21 as much inexhaustible power as you need
20:23 to
20:24 shape the fabric of the universe in a
20:26 way
20:27 that you're going to create these
20:28 gravity wells and vehicles can fall into
20:31 the well because they have no choice
20:33 and achieve incredible speeds
20:37 thus allowing us to travel the stars at
20:42 i think far faster than the speed of
20:44 light
20:45 and you need to forget pop science
20:48 algorithms like equals mc squared
20:50 which automatically kills your soul when
20:53 it comes to achieving these
20:55 warp factor engines so my brain
20:59 is dividing this up in two different
21:01 categories one
21:03 if we had the shackles lifted off of us
21:07 and we got rid of all these one world
21:09 government
21:10 tyrannical nut bags running the place
21:13 then we
21:14 i think in short order could
21:17 freely discuss how to create these
21:20 engines
21:21 you got geniuses all over the world just
21:24 chomping at the bit
21:26 and so i think that we within 50 years
21:28 could probably create a vehicle
21:30 even just a probe that would either
21:32 achieve the speed of light or
21:34 surpass it make a trip take a look
21:38 wherever it is take its video record
21:41 whatever sensors we can put on that
21:43 thing and get back to us
21:44 in short order now again warp one still
21:48 requires years of travel
21:50 to anything super out of our
21:53 solar system but if my
21:57 sid mead who was visited several times
22:00 by
22:00 military people who just loved him if
22:04 their rumors to him are correct
22:06 then they've already had these power
22:07 supplies for a very long time
22:10 potentially 55 years
22:14 or less or they're mobile
22:18 the rumors were to him that
22:22 these engines were very messy at the
22:24 very beginning meaning a lot of
22:25 radiation
22:27 they had sort of quirky configurations
22:30 in terms of parts and chemicals and
22:32 everything that
22:32 made them work but then by
22:35 the 90s this thing had been drastically
22:38 cleaned up and in the 21st century
22:41 it's a pretty much a turnkey system
22:45 but now what if some part of bob lazar's
22:47 story is correct
22:49 there is an element out there 115 which
22:51 doesn't occur naturally
22:53 but we can synthesize it we have
22:55 synthesized it
22:58 they stack it up in a like a roll of
23:00 quarters
23:01 but each layer is about a quarter inch
23:03 thick according to bob
23:05 and then they lathe it or i shouldn't
23:08 say lathe
23:08 they cut it into a cone
23:12 i'm assuming that that shape of 1
23:15 15 creates a very intelligent
23:19 pull of the emitting radiation from this
23:22 element
23:24 i also assume that whatever goes for
23:27 the du ordinance with metal shielding
23:30 meaning when it's
23:30 all together and solid
23:35 it is much more stable and emits
23:38 less radiation when it's stationary
23:41 versus when it turns into a gas or a
23:43 liquid
23:45 but the idea is that this is sort of a
23:47 crystal
23:48 a super mega crystal that happens to
23:50 resonate with the universe itself
23:53 and when it is stimulated puts off a
23:56 pole
23:56 that could be guided via the ship's
23:59 interior
24:00 down to again bob lazar's story three
24:03 antimatter
24:04 engines in his sports model which looks
24:06 like season
24:08 five ship and then
24:11 these antimatter engines which
24:13 apparently can take a small siphon of
24:15 energy and augment them up to
24:18 unimaginable levels
24:20 can then start creating electromagnetic
24:22 field around the ship
24:24 to create these gravity wells of which
24:26 the ship falls into
24:28 and can go in various directions the
24:30 fastest configuration being the engine's
24:32 hanging straight down
24:34 the ship rotates its rear end
24:37 up and then it blasts in a particular
24:40 direction
24:42 and there's also plenty of
24:45 stories about how when we see these
24:47 little dancing lights in the sky
24:49 and they line up in a line and then they
24:51 all vanish
24:53 that they are essentially connecting
24:56 their poles and creating a much bigger
25:00 well which i'm not sure
25:03 how that would affect the speed of a
25:05 ship but ether is supposed to move 50
25:07 times the speed of light
25:09 so imagine you were to ride a wave of
25:11 ether
25:12 and by god you could get get home pretty
25:15 damn quick
25:17 now for those of you star trek fans we
25:19 have the deflector shield to talk about
25:22 what is it clear to me is if this
25:25 technology were to exist
25:27 were would objects simply bend around
25:30 this
25:30 field meaning you could fly through a
25:33 planet a sun
25:34 a moon an asteroid an asteroid a
25:39 nebula and all the mass that's there
25:43 displaces because it's being distorted
25:47 and then if behind the ship it comes
25:49 back together the way it was
25:51 before it was disturbed in the first
25:52 place because it's simply
25:55 sort of swimming through water if you
25:56 will
25:58 you know when you swim through a pool
26:00 and you're just kind of doing a little
26:02 stroke
26:03 the water behind you doesn't leave a
26:04 void it fills in behind you
26:07 now we know water reconfigures
26:10 completely
26:10 so if you were to draw a picture in the
26:12 water somehow and you swim through it
26:14 all that ink and weird stuff would be
26:18 a mess behind you or just start
26:20 diffusing all over the pool
26:22 the enterprise you know the body has
26:25 that
26:25 radar dish back in the 60s it looks much
26:28 cooler in the
26:29 87 and up but that dish is supposed to
26:33 clear out of the way
26:34 any particles that would be in the way
26:35 of the ship obviously small particles
26:39 but nevertheless it helps the other
26:42 theory is that this these are
26:43 interdimensional ships meaning they go
26:47 out of phase
26:48 with the the tangible universe
26:52 and if you watch forbidden planet the
26:54 very beginning of that movie
26:56 all of the crew 1956 have to stand on
27:00 the
27:02 these pods or not these pods these sort
27:04 of round plates on the ground
27:06 and they were all phased out of
27:07 existence putting into a different
27:10 dimension while the ship slowed from
27:12 light speed down to
27:14 cruising impulse power if you will to
27:16 reference the star trek thing
27:19 and they were phased back into the ship
27:21 so they would survive
27:23 i mean that's just utterly brilliant now
27:26 this was going to be
27:28 an alien invasion i have a whole episode
27:29 on alien invasion but it's a little
27:30 dated so i thought we'd update some
27:32 stuff here
27:33 unification using a ufo story and an
27:38 alien presence story
27:41 in my opinion is going to have to be a
27:44 shock and awe moment
27:45 not just an article here a foia request
27:48 here and there where people
27:50 slowly come up to date on it if they
27:53 want a speedy
27:54 union of mankind willing to give up all
27:56 their rights
27:58 or whatever whatever their plan
28:02 is but what would be the scenario if it
28:05 was a slow
28:06 cook remember we just reviewed ipec go 2
28:09 which my buddy says he saw ipad go 3.
28:12 i'm a little confused because the helio
28:14 font site did not have three
28:16 and who would have made it you know he
28:18 says it looks just like the other one
28:19 which
28:20 i'm just so shocked it didn't come up
28:22 because i did see something
28:23 labeled that and it was ugly as all sin
28:26 but in that episode what is dying
28:30 in that video it's pretty much
28:33 everything's dying in that video but one
28:35 of the major
28:36 themes is going away is religion
28:40 i do apologize we have a little wind out
28:42 here it's 51
28:44 but it's just kind of bursty hopefully
28:47 it doesn't get any worse
28:49 if they slow cook us into this whole
28:52 disclosure thing
28:54 and i think we can safely assume
28:59 that the most basic approach on a piece
29:01 of paper if we were in the think tank to
29:04 somehow prioritize the information to
29:06 come out
29:08 would be the ship then
29:11 the alien or aliens
29:15 then maybe if we were ever able to
29:17 gather any information off this person
29:18 that would go second let's see that
29:20 little dude from roswell
29:21 as reported lived
29:25 there's all kinds of rumors where that
29:26 guy's still alive or
29:28 or not my big question would be what
29:30 would the
29:31 the being consume in order to survive
29:34 whitley strieber's
29:36 book majestic said that they
29:37 photosynthesize off their skin
29:40 except that space travel would not
29:42 provide an ample amount
29:44 of photons so they'd have to be i guess
29:47 sitting in a sunbathing
29:50 apparatus inside to get that sort of
29:52 feedback that would mean also why would
29:55 they have gigantic almond eyes
29:57 and be photosynthesizers because they'd
30:00 have teeny tiny eyes
30:01 because they're probably basking in the
30:03 sun unless those eyes are very
30:07 inefficient but typically big eyes
30:10 always beckons a
30:14 dark kind of nocturnal creature
30:17 the other question would be if they ever
30:19 do get to an advanced disclosure
30:21 situation where they are going to talk
30:23 about this alien
30:25 race that exists it will be interesting
30:28 to see if they immediately give us a
30:30 platform
30:31 to keep our belief systems which they
30:34 really don't have any authority to
30:36 answer to that at all right they don't
30:38 know
30:39 but it would definitely be a subject
30:41 matter that could distract the living
30:43 crap out of us for a very long time
30:45 couldn't it
30:46 what if they were to publish its
30:48 language publish everything that we know
30:50 about that being and where he came from
30:52 and
30:53 what constellation he might be in and
30:55 how he travels and all that good stuff
30:58 now you guys who are common listeners
31:02 you know that i went out to prove
31:03 roswell was a bunch of bs
31:06 and i mean i'd written articles about
31:09 how the government uses
31:12 this notion that we have ufos but no one
31:15 else does
31:16 to freak out our competition
31:19 now these things are real they're i just
31:21 want to finish up a point i was about to
31:23 make
31:24 it does make sense that obviously the
31:26 technology regardless of how it performs
31:29 would never be revealed you know
31:31 probably
31:32 for two reasons one we don't know how it
31:34 works but two we figured out how it
31:35 works and we obviously don't want our
31:37 competitors to have that information
31:39 but think about the presence attack from
31:42 the united states to russia
31:44 which of course the libs are all into
31:46 hating russians
31:47 the rest of us are ready to continue
31:50 being friends
31:52 but you have an enemy of america let's
31:54 just put it that way
31:55 and this technology is an absolute
31:59 annihilator there's nothing they can do
32:02 to
32:04 stop us we've got a vehicle that goes
32:06 infinite speed
32:08 relative to man's needs it can be
32:11 stealthed
32:13 let's just say that was part of the
32:14 report
32:17 and so uh good luck good luck fighting
32:21 us
32:23 it's terrifying to think that of what
32:25 these
32:26 nut bags would do if they were ever
32:28 given such power which is why
32:30 part of me just says whatever they have
32:32 they don't understand it or at least how
32:34 it works
32:34 because think about
32:38 the agendas that are on top of us
32:40 especially the depopulation agendas
32:43 and they could just push a red button
32:46 and get everything they wanted
32:48 i mean you just push that button and the
32:50 world changes
32:51 x number of people are gone x number of
32:53 people survived
32:55 the the land goes back to the way it was
32:58 back in the middle ages
33:00 except instead of living in cold castles
33:03 and crapping out windows
33:04 into a moat you got
33:08 vcrs or your dvd players and and you got
33:11 the whole
33:12 litany of man's creative creations up to
33:15 that point you push the button
33:17 to watch you get every book that's ever
33:19 been written
33:20 and you can read it i mean many twilight
33:22 zones have explored this and it's always
33:24 a regretful decision to do such a thing
33:29 i somehow struggle with the aristocrats
33:32 of the world having that much
33:34 forethought but perhaps they do so i go
33:37 out to kill off
33:38 roswell and i come out 100
33:42 a believer that that particular one was
33:45 absolute
33:46 it was real it doesn't mean everything i
33:50 have read about it or people's uh and
33:53 you know deductions are all true they're
33:56 doing their best in many cases
33:59 but here's what's weird about me telling
34:01 you guys this
34:04 you know i'm always hanging out in cigar
34:06 lounges or this one at least
34:08 and guys come in and they want to hear
34:11 fun stuff
34:12 you know it's part of the game and we'll
34:15 get to
34:16 like this conversation and i'm staring
34:19 at someone and i will have to tell them
34:21 that exact line you know look i thought
34:23 this was all fake and i did this
34:24 research and oh my god
34:26 people who they claimed were lying and
34:28 changing their stories over 40 years
34:30 never once changed a word
34:32 didn't add any details they've been very
34:36 consistent
34:37 and there's a part of me that feels
34:39 really weird
34:41 saying that it's almost like
34:45 deep down inside and this isn't um like
34:47 a feeling from god or the universe or
34:49 anything this is just straight up
34:52 relative human conversation
34:55 regulators i'm saying i shouldn't be
34:58 telling someone
34:59 that i believe this but it's almost like
35:02 an old-fashioned feeling that comes from
35:04 other people
35:04 not from this guy right here who made a
35:07 show on youtube
35:09 and has told the entire planet whether
35:11 or not they want to see it or not
35:13 that this is how i believe the
35:15 interesting thing about the evidence
35:18 of roswell is one uh if you go look up
35:21 that old episode
35:23 just go to deepthoughtsradio.com and
35:25 type in roswell or click the ufo button
35:27 or aliens button i put in that
35:31 original youtube video my sources every
35:34 interview i watched that i thought had
35:36 credibility about
35:38 two years ago i went back and checked
35:41 and more than half of those videos have
35:43 had their entire channels
35:45 deleted and i'm not saying it's
35:47 censorship or anything
35:48 i don't know what happened they're gone
35:51 but they were stunning what do you mean
35:54 someone has like the copyright on a
35:56 hotel interview from
35:57 30 years ago i'd love to see that in
35:59 court
36:01 but you know how copyright strikes work
36:02 on online if you
36:04 rip off someone's stuff i've done it
36:06 accidentally where i put a
36:08 i put a david copperfield clip
36:12 from like 96 or something and it was
36:14 just a few seconds of him flying around
36:16 in front of a
36:18 curtain that was hiding his wires to
36:20 prove a point about how wires work
36:24 and i got a copyright strike and when
36:26 you saw the video it's a copyright
36:27 strike
36:29 so these people intentionally got rid of
36:30 their their entire channels
36:34 there are notices on channels that have
36:36 been removed for violating you know
36:38 community policy but come on what do you
36:41 care about
36:42 roswell interviews i just don't buy it i
36:44 don't know what that means but it's gone
36:46 a lot of them are gone
36:48 but the thing for me is that if you were
36:50 to do one of those
36:51 those hollywood scenes where the murder
36:53 mystery is being pieced together with
36:55 polaroids on a cork board with
36:57 you know yarn
37:00 and you start painting the picture
37:02 behind the polaroids as to what these
37:04 individual interviews
37:06 were revealing i couldn't find any
37:08 consistencies
37:11 it was the complete picture as much as
37:13 you possibly can
37:14 so is like the uh was it the ntsb who
37:16 puts together planes that have fallen
37:18 out of the sky you know and
37:19 you see those pictures of the warehouse
37:21 and you look at it and you can
37:22 definitely see
37:23 the most of the plane this was good
37:27 this was consistent the other thing is
37:30 is that that element i told you about
37:32 where
37:33 america was very bible belt
37:36 70 years ago okay well
37:39 i think we're pretty much past that
37:41 phase at this point
37:44 i mean as long as the kids
37:46 identification has like
37:48 20 adjectives and no one's losing their
37:52 marbles over a kid that's non-binary
37:57 it's like okay well that's an extreme
37:59 concept for a bible belt person right
38:01 if these kids have all these crazy
38:03 genders beyond their biological one
38:06 okay so i think we're at a phase now
38:08 where could you
38:09 really shock anybody can you really
38:11 shock anybody
38:13 but just i want to recap the roswell
38:15 thing for a split second because some of
38:17 you have never done a dive in it
38:20 you know about it but you don't know the
38:22 claims as to what occurred
38:24 you have a ship well you have a storm in
38:27 the desert in new mexico
38:29 next to the roswell air force base which
38:33 was a
38:33 base that not only flew planes but it
38:36 was also notorious for
38:38 creating weather balloons our experts
38:42 in the united states on weather balloons
38:45 we're all set up in roswell so when they
38:48 said this wasn't a ufo it was a
38:50 weather balloon get everybody who was an
38:52 expert who found the debris said oh no
38:54 that's ufo that's how bad that story was
38:58 but in the middle of the night there's a
39:01 huge electrical storm
39:03 and a two groups of people as a matter
39:06 of fact
39:07 only one group of people claimed to have
39:08 seen this an archaeologist with his
39:11 i believe four students they saw
39:13 something fall out of the sky like a
39:14 meteorite
39:16 and they were like okay tomorrow when
39:17 it's not raining
39:19 let's go see what that was
39:22 but the next morning before they got to
39:25 the curse we don't exactly know all the
39:27 times
39:28 a farmer who owned the land starts to
39:31 notice
39:31 all the silver fire fibers not fibers
39:34 pieces of metal all over his land
39:38 he starts scooping that stuff up he
39:40 calls the authorities
39:42 meanwhile a completely different family
39:45 a third family with
39:47 i believe a a father
39:50 his brother and his eight-year-old kid
39:53 at a minimum
39:54 it might have had more people but those
39:55 are the three main ones
39:57 they stumble on this thing hiking around
39:59 the desert
40:01 there wasn't a reason why they were
40:02 hiking you know it just happens
40:06 but they find this vehicle that's about
40:10 32 feet in diameter as far as the
40:12 estimated
40:14 and right away they notice there's a
40:16 being
40:17 sitting next to the vehicle and he has
40:20 three little mats down on the ground one
40:23 little dude
40:24 is really burned up into pieces he's
40:26 dead a second guy is
40:28 mortally injured he is dying and he will
40:30 eventually die
40:31 within that day and the last dude was
40:34 fine
40:35 the ship is sort of embedded in the
40:37 ground with one end of it
40:39 blown open this father-son
40:42 team goes up to it of course he's got
40:44 his uncle and i think
40:47 i think there's a second son a brother
40:49 or a cousin or something
40:51 the little kid who's all grown up now
40:54 as an adult he said look what happened
40:56 was i thought this thing was a toy
41:00 it looked like a toy it didn't look
41:01 human and he's not picking up on the
41:04 vibe that the parents
41:06 at least his father and uncle were like
41:09 oh my god what's going on here
41:12 well his brother or cousin or something
41:14 was the one that actually
41:16 moved around the vehicle to take a look
41:18 at it
41:20 but he said he walked up an innocent
41:22 child sat down next to the alien
41:25 who was also sitting down and he just
41:28 put his hand on his
41:30 left knee ish and the dude jumped
41:35 and that's when he realized oh my god
41:37 this is a living thing
41:39 jumps up runs behind his dad and starts
41:41 looking through the legs like little
41:42 kids do
41:44 his dad and i believe his uncle start
41:46 trying to speak different languages
41:48 to this being who has no idea what
41:50 they're saying at least
41:52 using words probably through the mind
41:55 but that's when the archaeologist shows
41:57 up with his students
41:59 he speaks about you know five or seven
42:01 languages or whatever so he's rounding
42:03 off a bunch of stuff
42:05 just about this time a military jeep
42:08 shows up
42:09 there's a redheaded white guy and a
42:11 black guy the redheaded white guy
42:13 is a complete prick he's yelling
42:15 obscenities
42:17 that this whole family what the f are
42:18 you doing here blah blah blah blah
42:21 well the black guy remained very calm go
42:24 figure
42:27 so he pushes them all inside of his
42:29 vehicle
42:30 and starts heading north on this highway
42:33 and the archaeologist is like hey i got
42:36 students i'm responsible for them
42:37 if you want us to leave that's fine but
42:39 i got to go south because
42:41 that's where we're parked and he says
42:44 shut the hell up blah blah blah
42:46 so they get to this clearing in the
42:48 highway
42:49 and at that point the kids said look man
42:51 this place was
42:52 utterly packed with big jets that had
42:55 land on
42:56 landed on the highway there's jeeps
42:58 everywhere there's
42:59 people everywhere it's nuts and he said
43:02 we were our car was there so he goes we
43:03 were allowed to get in and leave
43:05 of course told if you ever say anything
43:07 we'll kill you and all this other stuff
43:09 and he said the last vision he saw
43:11 looking out the back window
43:12 was this archaeologist pointing his
43:14 finger at the redheaded guy reading the
43:15 right act
43:17 meanwhile in town you got a few things
43:20 going on
43:21 this farmer is reporting that a flying
43:24 saucer landed because he eventually
43:25 tracked all the debris up to the saucer
43:28 then he goes home there's not that much
43:30 data from that guy
43:32 there's just data from people he talked
43:34 to
43:36 then you have this gentleman from the
43:37 air force who was sent to gather up
43:40 all the debris not the redheaded guy and
43:43 he ends up
43:44 babysitting this alien for however many
43:48 minutes
43:48 that that occurred
43:51 and he said that the being talked to him
43:54 through his mind and said
43:57 i have conceded that i am here and the
44:00 second thing he said was don't worry no
44:01 one's coming after us
44:04 which has never made any sense to me why
44:06 wouldn't they
44:07 i mean are they literally magellan's on
44:09 the middle of the universe not telling
44:10 anybody where they're going i mean don't
44:11 you radio home like a cop and say i'm
44:13 pulling someone over on the 405. you
44:15 know if you don't hear from me send
44:17 another
44:17 unit but it's the air force guy
44:22 that's the real real linchpin of this
44:24 thing and there's
44:25 more but he picked up all this debris
44:28 and one showed it to his
44:29 12 year old son in the middle of the
44:30 night and told him man you'll never see
44:32 this again so just get a look and
44:33 there's
44:34 several versions of black plastics all
44:36 the versions of this metal
44:37 but this thin foil stuff uh was there
44:40 but he said
44:41 the son who's now an md i don't know if
44:44 he's still alive he finally wrote a book
44:45 about all this
44:46 really late in his life he said that he
44:50 kept some of this stuff and that it does
44:53 do what they say but he said when his
44:54 father showed it to him
44:55 they never even thought to test it out
44:58 right i mean you don't know this stuff
44:59 does this until it does this
45:01 but here's where it gets good that dude
45:06 he's supposed to be leading a bridge
45:07 game but he's missing but the guy that
45:09 ended up substituting for him
45:10 actually told this story where he said
45:12 the dude brought in a box of all this
45:14 debris we all looked at it we're all
45:17 weather balloon experts has nothing to
45:18 do with any materials we use there's a
45:20 metal
45:21 beam with some writing on it he says
45:23 that's nothing come out to my truck and
45:24 they all went out to the truck
45:26 of course he's telling them at the same
45:27 time a flying saucer landed this is
45:29 amazing i just saw it i'm an
45:31 alien and they're not sitting there
45:33 shocked
45:35 it's 1947 people i guarantee almost
45:38 everyone in that room believes in god
45:40 and the bible and jesus and all that
45:42 stuff and they seem to survive just fine
45:46 by the next day at work they all went
45:47 back to work i don't know which one was
45:49 which but that guy who told the story
45:51 said he was at work the box that was
45:54 brought in was sitting on the table
45:56 but by noon that day the black seeds
45:58 show up and swear everybody
46:00 into queue clearance and it's over no
46:02 more telling stories
46:04 there's the famous corner they got the
46:05 phone call from the air force how do you
46:07 preserve a body
46:08 do you have any kid caskets and he said
46:11 you know
46:12 it depends on what your pathologist
46:13 wants to do
46:15 with these bodies but freezing them is
46:17 usually a pretty good
46:19 first step if you don't know what you're
46:20 going to be doing with them later
46:22 but they swung by his place bought his
46:24 coffins and then he starts getting
46:25 really suspicious
46:27 he's thinking something really bad
46:28 happens so he's got a pass to the base
46:30 he drives on the base because he takes
46:32 care of all fatalities on the base
46:34 and he ends up going into the hospital
46:36 bumping into one of his female nurse
46:37 friends
46:38 she comes out and throws up into a trash
46:40 can she says you gotta get out of here
46:42 this isn't good i'll tell you later they
46:45 end up having breakfast
46:46 she says look the reason why we're
46:47 throwing up is that these bodies have
46:49 sulfur in them they're gagging us out
46:53 but she starts drawing this alien
46:56 parts of his hands and stuff she gets
46:59 transferred
47:01 and later uh reported dead
47:05 he doesn't think his friend died he
47:06 thinks that she was erased so she could
47:08 continue her work
47:10 my opinion that's pretty optimistic
47:11 thinking one of the receptionists that
47:14 was shown the body
47:15 later killed herself like dorothy
47:17 kelgallen only 20 years earlier
47:20 found in a room registered to her sister
47:22 she ends up taking a bunch of drugs and
47:23 all this other stuff she's maryland
47:25 randleman road blamed on her having this
47:29 secret life of debauchery
47:31 she's married with two kids her best
47:33 friend told the story in her living room
47:35 and started crying
47:37 and she said i think they killed her it
47:39 was just beyond her imagination
47:41 i want to recall that story as we take
47:43 in this new information
47:45 because that's why i was so utterly
47:48 convinced and all the debunking about
47:51 it being a weather balloon and having
47:53 some tape for my toy company and also
47:55 the crap
47:56 the son of the air force guy said you
47:59 know they sent me that tape and it looks
48:01 nothing like
48:02 what my father drew which you can find
48:05 online
48:06 just look up roswell i beam writing
48:09 images
48:10 you'll see it the
48:13 scenario i think that we all sort of if
48:15 you've put any time into thinking about
48:17 an alien invasion
48:19 hoax and jesus imagine it was real
48:23 imagine it was real but still
48:25 orchestrated
48:26 meaning our government and these folks
48:28 do a deal
48:30 and they say here's what you're going to
48:32 do you're going to land here you're
48:33 gonna do that
48:34 that's gonna hurt us all into these
48:36 camps and then
48:39 we'll start doing weird things to our
48:41 people whatever but you're gonna be in
48:43 charge when it's over because we know
48:44 that you could be in charge any day that
48:46 you decide to be in charge
48:48 one of the sentiments of why the
48:49 government hasn't admitted such a thing
48:51 but they know it
48:52 let's just say that's true was that
48:54 their duty is to protect
48:56 the people of the united states
49:00 every country protects their own now
49:03 whitley strieber's
49:04 book which should be taken with a salt
49:07 lick
49:08 his uh excuse for the cia was that
49:13 after roswell crashed in 47
49:16 that truman formed the cia
49:19 to basically put together a
49:22 professional task force that can monitor
49:26 ufos which is utterly hysterical
49:29 it's a fun little fictional thing we
49:32 know that operation
49:33 blue book was put together the majestic
49:36 project was put together
49:38 a bunch of weird projects were put
49:40 together to look into this stuff
49:42 and of course people get disenfranchised
49:45 on these teams because
49:47 i think roswell's crash would be a
49:48 fairly rare occurrence
49:51 and people on the team are probably not
49:52 going to be taken to somewhere else and
49:54 shown this stuff
49:56 because they have no contribution to
50:00 offer the military simply being an agent
50:04 that's going to go and investigate
50:05 reports they're not physicists they're
50:06 not aerospace people
50:08 and so why show them anything now i've
50:11 done an episode on bob lazar as well
50:14 i find bob to be very endearing as a
50:16 person
50:18 there was a recent you know episode on
50:21 him
50:22 i think 2019 and netflix it was cool
50:26 that's where we learned more about 115
50:28 and of course this rumor that he's got
50:30 some and they keep raiding his offices
50:32 to find it my big challenge in believing
50:35 him
50:36 is that he says he has multiple degrees
50:38 from two of the most prestigious
50:40 organizations in the united states one
50:42 being caltech
50:43 in pasadena and the other one mit in
50:46 massachusetts
50:49 okay well where's your photographs of
50:52 being at those locations because there's
50:53 no way a dude gets a
50:54 degree in both locations without
50:58 accounting for the time to just just
51:00 enroll
51:02 take the class and test
51:05 if any and they interviewed a bunch of
51:07 bob's friends i've seen
51:09 many interviews from many different
51:10 sources talking about how he was
51:12 really really brilliant because he loved
51:14 to create jet cars
51:17 like the kind that you know you race at
51:19 a drag race top fuel place is a
51:21 just a fun little piece of entertainment
51:23 but no one said
51:25 this is my brilliant friend who has two
51:27 degrees from the two most prestigious
51:30 organizations united states
51:32 if you had a child and they were that
51:34 much of a prodigy
51:36 because he's again he's taking these uh
51:38 supposedly he's getting these degrees
51:40 without being contacted by the
51:41 government it's not like they contact
51:43 him says you're gonna get these two
51:44 degrees
51:44 no he supposedly got these two degrees
51:46 and then he was contacted because he got
51:48 the two degrees
51:49 and they've supposedly erased him now
51:51 there's phone books and
51:53 area 51 it proved that he was on the
51:56 list someone that's a very bizarre name
51:58 and to be in
51:59 two different places like two different
52:00 people the same name
52:02 but you would have a t-shirt you would
52:05 have a fan
52:06 bunch of family members and friends that
52:07 said oh yeah man
52:09 we visited him at mit we visited him in
52:13 caltech and people would drop him off
52:15 there and he would go inside cal tech
52:16 but no one has any recollection of him
52:18 going to massachusetts
52:19 and having lived in massachusetts for
52:21 two and a half years coming from the
52:23 midwest
52:23 and spending 33 years in california
52:26 believe me
52:26 one of the stories you would tell
52:28 everybody is how freaking cold it is
52:30 there in the wintertime and even the
52:32 summer time
52:33 hottest day i ever experienced in two
52:34 and a half years was at least 10 degrees
52:36 hotter than any other day i'd ever
52:38 experienced and that was 88 degrees
52:40 you would know you'd have like you know
52:42 used to call me mac
52:44 i used to say hey can you say the letter
52:46 r they go
52:47 ah i'm like can you hear the sound
52:50 coming out of my mouth
52:53 i love my bostonian friends but my gosh
52:56 you just don't forget that kind of thing
52:58 but he does offer
53:00 some amazing stuff you know i also
53:03 was told um you know you get these bad
53:05 documentaries
53:07 this is before i ever started this show
53:09 but there were rumors that bob lazar had
53:11 passed
53:12 you know up to 35 lie detector tests all
53:16 over the world and
53:17 turns out he only took a few and he
53:19 flunked them
53:20 uh and then they had to kind of adjust
53:22 it no no suddenly he's telling the truth
53:25 the documentary that they did on netflix
53:28 this producer's running around saying
53:29 that uh
53:31 element 115 was completely undiscovered
53:34 still and all this other stuff and then
53:36 i did the research on 115
53:38 and i think the first time they ever
53:40 created a single element of 115 was like
53:42 2003
53:44 but definitely by the time this was
53:46 filmed so what's up with that bad
53:48 information
53:49 then they do this real dramatized thing
53:52 where he
53:53 meets some guys out in the woods and
53:54 they put their phones away and he's
53:56 going to bury the 115
53:58 somewhere and yada yada okay
54:02 if he really had that stuff they'd get
54:04 it out of him trust me
54:07 because there would be no there would be
54:10 no protection for that guy
54:11 i mean they would do some braveheart
54:13 crap on him and he would
54:15 he'd start confessing really fast or
54:18 they would just juice him up and say why
54:19 don't you come work for us again you've
54:21 had some time to think about it we've
54:22 had some time to think about you
54:24 the last batch that went through because
54:26 his story is the scientists go into
54:29 s4 this this
54:33 underground base that's in a mountain
54:35 side just south of area 51
54:38 it's got doors that look like the
54:40 mountain and so it pulls away and you go
54:42 inside and that's where all the vehicles
54:44 are
54:45 he said that they rotate through he also
54:48 insinuated on the joe rogan show that
54:50 these are
54:51 archaeological finds and not crash
54:53 spaceships
54:55 he said that that was just a rumor so
54:58 one of the big questions
54:59 is and we've again we've done meticulous
55:02 episodes if you like this information or
55:04 this type of top
55:06 subject matter i should say we got the
55:09 episodes
55:10 the big concern is that you know the
55:13 there's pretty much
55:14 two elements that we would need to see
55:16 to start believing this is actually
55:18 occurring
55:19 one a ship well if we have a bunch of
55:23 anti-gravity technology as was reported
55:25 several times my buddy sid
55:28 then making a veneer around an
55:31 anti-gravity
55:32 machine is no big deal you can make it
55:33 look like a flying saucer you can make
55:35 it look like
55:36 something out of star wars you could
55:40 but the other big one is aliens
55:44 and we think we know what they look like
55:46 because of pop science and science
55:48 fiction movies
55:49 and and just culture in general creating
55:52 all these different
55:53 drawings and illustrations and paintings
55:55 of them they could actually be
55:58 mocking something that they think really
56:00 exists but they start
56:02 gene splicing human beings
56:05 and potentially have been doing this for
56:07 20 30 40 years
56:09 and they've got a weird little species
56:11 of
56:12 subhuman things i mean they would be
56:14 only sub-human because they might have
56:16 been mixed with
56:17 some other animal insect and they just
56:20 keep playing until they find something
56:21 that can one survive
56:24 and two has an intelligence to learn
56:28 a whole new language so imagine you
56:31 hatch these kids probably hatch is a
56:35 operative term there and you already
56:37 have a language that you've been
56:38 designing for decades
56:41 and people know it they know how to like
56:42 people know how to speak klingon it's
56:44 not a real language but they do it
56:46 and so they have these
56:51 nurses and doctors and scientists all
56:53 talking to these people
56:55 and teaching them this language and they
56:56 tell them where they're from
56:59 they will they could literally tell
57:01 these kids look you are from another
57:02 planet
57:03 and we have simply worked hard to keep
57:07 you alive and to keep you procreating
57:10 and uh you're gonna make your debut next
57:13 tuesday
57:15 they put them inside the vehicle they
57:17 figure out a really opportune place to
57:19 land it
57:20 they land it these beings come out
57:23 they're a little freaked out but it's a
57:25 quarantine situation because it's all
57:26 pre-planned
57:28 helicopters are flying over people are
57:30 looking through fences
57:32 and you know someone goes up and shakes
57:34 their hand
57:35 and then they immediately quarantine
57:37 them again get them out of that volatile
57:39 environment
57:40 take them away and maybe you never even
57:42 see them again
57:43 in the out in the outside maybe there's
57:46 just a cover story
57:47 where they come out and say they don't
57:48 breathe oxygen so they can't be outside
57:51 for more than a few minutes or whatever
57:53 they'll die so you
57:54 you know then the rest is all staged in
57:56 a movie
57:57 set somewhere these real beings are on
58:00 camera super detailed you know hd
58:02 4k and they're blinking their little you
58:05 know eyes and stuff and looking around
58:07 and it's
58:08 they're different because they're a
58:10 synthesized species
58:13 it's interesting that uh ipad goat never
58:15 had an alien in there
58:17 that'd be a really funny one to stick in
58:18 there but it's
58:20 it's i don't want to say it's just that
58:22 simple
58:24 i think that the fairly simple part of
58:27 that is the ship itself
58:29 and i think that the very difficult
58:31 thing because i know nothing about
58:33 human cloning and splicing and the
58:36 island of dr moreau kind of theory
58:38 you just you just never know i mean
58:40 brute force
58:42 applications of that science could yield
58:44 some pretty miraculous things
58:47 you hear about all these crazy stories
58:49 coming out of china which
58:51 china should not be singled out because
58:52 i'm sure they're a latecomer to this
58:54 game
58:55 but you know these freaks who run the
58:57 world they'll do that stuff
58:59 they just want to know what would a
59:01 spider and a human being look like
59:04 and it just comes out a big clump of
59:05 skin but it has some gigantic spider
59:07 legs or some weird hair on them and
59:09 stuff and you're like oh my god
59:11 that never lived but there it is you
59:14 know
59:14 it just stated what's interesting is
59:18 when i talk about the moon missions you
59:19 know i get that feedback every once in a
59:21 while i haven't received this really in
59:22 a few years but the
59:24 the age-old defense which is boy if they
59:26 fake the moon missions
59:27 you're talking about thousands of people
59:29 knowing and hiding it all
59:31 no i'm not i'm talking about dozens and
59:34 dozens of people perhaps with everyone
59:36 underneath
59:37 believing the entire story now with the
59:40 ufo thing
59:42 it does seem a bit more profound hiding
59:44 a hoax of going to the moon
59:46 but seeing all the benefits it gave to
59:47 science and kids
59:49 you could keep your mouth shut for very
59:51 honorable reasons in your own head
59:55 but never disclosing that aliens
59:59 truly exist and really barfing out some
60:02 fact that is indisputable
60:05 somehow naming a location or something i
60:09 mean the internet you can't stop that
60:10 thing man
60:12 people will get copies of everything and
60:15 you can
60:16 you know you could say okay let's we
60:17 have a lot of alternative social media
60:20 sites now that don't censor you
60:22 all right where you could do it that way
60:24 you could put it on snapchat you could
60:26 text it to a billion people
60:28 you could buy a mailing list and and
60:30 send physical copies i mean there's just
60:32 a million different ways that
60:34 information could get leaked out that
60:36 would be extremely difficult in any
60:38 timely manner
60:39 to go pick up all the data you can't
60:41 threaten the entire world
60:44 there's not enough agents to get in
60:46 people's faces if something were to go
60:48 viral
60:49 but like i told you guys before imagine
60:53 you go up to google or duckduckgo and
60:56 you type in
60:57 real alien photograph hit images
61:01 and hundreds of images come up a bunch
61:03 of words cg stuff
61:06 past hoaxes of autopsies and stuff
61:10 but imagine if one percent of those
61:13 photos
61:14 are actually real but it's so disinfoed
61:17 it's so surrounded by fakery that we
61:19 don't know
61:20 but somebody does bill cooper said he
61:23 saw
61:24 vehicles coming out of the ocean and
61:26 vehicles going into the ocean i believe
61:27 in 1967 or somewhere around there
61:29 as he was doing duty on a ship in the
61:31 navy
61:33 he was not a he turned out to be a
61:35 brilliant man but
61:38 at the time he's just a gum shoe i mean
61:39 he's just like some reporter just
61:41 watching it oh my god this happened
61:43 and then he said he got cute clearance
61:45 the next day
61:47 or within 12 hours because the
61:49 helicopter flew out to the ship and
61:50 black suits came out and signed him up
61:52 and he
61:53 he was chasing chasing claims of ufo
61:56 sightings and abductions for 20 years
61:58 but then in his
61:59 sofa in the 90s with an interview with
62:03 cnn
62:04 which i don't know if was ever broadcast
62:06 he claimed well you know what i might
62:07 have been
62:08 duped after my legitimate moment with
62:11 these vehicles
62:12 coming in and out of the ocean i might
62:14 have been duped
62:16 now the thing is is let's rewind for a
62:18 second and take on this one scenario
62:22 one crash happens and it is legit
62:25 a surviving alien is part of that crash
62:29 and unlike bob lazar's story of having
62:31 nine crashed
62:33 ufos that have been recovered there's
62:35 only one
62:36 so the government knows this is legit
62:38 and it's real
62:40 now because it becomes a bit of a pop
62:43 culture fever thing
62:45 well there's all kinds of hoaxers out
62:46 there the government is investigating
62:49 every single one and finding it to their
62:50 demise
62:51 or to their dismay i should say that
62:53 they're they're just fakes
62:56 but they do want to find another one but
62:59 this 147
63:00 roswell thing is just a pure anomaly you
63:03 know still we don't have any explanation
63:04 as to why this thing follows sky
63:07 back in the day the radar was a big deal
63:09 and so they said uh radar knocked it out
63:11 of the sky which is so
63:12 ridiculous because again the universe
63:15 has more
63:16 electromagnetic radiation than any radar
63:18 we've ever built
63:19 um stephen greer tried to re-thrust that
63:24 theory by saying that they had a
63:27 really powerful radar it's even way more
63:29 power this is 47
63:30 folks there ain't no radar in 47 that
63:33 hasn't been disclosed in 2021
63:35 so we he wouldn't have to have this
63:38 folktale method of telling the story
63:40 he could call it the xj25 rca
63:44 made for the air force radar that was
63:47 x number of joules of energy with the
63:50 flux capacitor and this is the way it
63:52 knocked out the sky he could totally
63:53 give the model number at this point
63:55 but since it's all bs it remains
63:59 a campfire story is this
64:02 just coming out to further consolidate
64:06 the powers of earth
64:10 to put more power in the hands of
64:12 absolute nut bag
64:13 pedophiles well if you were ever
64:16 going to do a simulation software that
64:19 would look at all the climates that
64:20 would have to line up
64:22 i mean the cultural climates of man to
64:24 line up to dump this thing
64:26 out on a docile ignorant world
64:29 this is the time to do it it really is
64:34 the thing is is if it's real i mean in
64:36 terms of this
64:37 encounter at least once then a lot of
64:41 people i could imagine being told a
64:42 story well dude it's real i mean we've
64:44 got that ship you've seen it and you've
64:45 met the alien guy and you've seen hours
64:47 of video of us talking to the guy
64:48 so this is all legit we're just
64:51 preemptively striking
64:53 the situation by simulating that this is
64:55 occurring
64:56 this is healthy for man and they could
64:59 even tell you a bunch of crap where it's
65:01 like
65:02 the aliens said they won't come down
65:04 until
65:06 you're acclimated to their existence
65:09 and so that's a pretense to go ahead and
65:11 do this well you know
65:13 i've always wanted to meet an alien so
65:14 if i went around the world saying that
65:16 these things exist and we do a little
65:17 fake here and there and there
65:20 then they'll come down and i'll finally
65:22 get to meet one before i die
65:24 but it does seem like the trickle of
65:25 information from the u.s military
65:29 is ramping up so i think we can expect
65:32 a lot more information in the coming
65:34 five to 10 years
65:36 where again the weirdest thing and you
65:40 just give me your opinion
65:41 every time i've ever seen or heard the
65:44 story of a pilot seeing one of these
65:47 and them saying something to the effect
65:49 of
65:50 i didn't want to report it because they
65:52 they thought i'd be a section 8 you know
65:54 this is these are even in
65:56 twilight zones then immediately
65:59 if you report what you see you're
66:01 considered
66:02 crazy that never sat well with me i
66:06 don't know about you
66:07 what do you mean we're in a cognitive
66:09 dissonance organization
66:12 but let's just say for whatever reason
66:14 that was a cultural
66:16 fear of man in the 50s
66:19 that went all the way up until whenever
66:22 but these disclosures from the
66:24 government
66:25 start to make people who have seen
66:28 things
66:29 feel much more comfortable with
66:30 themselves to admit such a thing
66:34 my hope is that if this isn't going to
66:35 be a hoax
66:37 that that's exactly what's occurring
66:39 pilots i mean i saw the interview with
66:41 the top gun pilot to
66:42 chase the tic tac well he definitely
66:46 guarded himself a little bit
66:48 from being considered a crazy because it
66:50 was disclosed it was supposedly filmed
66:52 like 2004
66:54 he was well retired from now from that
66:56 point
66:57 but he did you know when someone tried
66:59 to push him on whether or not he thought
67:00 it was a ufo or something like that the
67:02 guy kind of started pulling punches
67:04 and well you know i don't want to you
67:06 know say speculate anything which is
67:08 honorable
67:10 i just think that if it was a pedestrian
67:13 who saw such a thing
67:15 we just immediately say yeah man this
67:17 thing was not
67:18 of this earth and if it is it's a
67:22 boatload of undisclosed technology
67:26 and then the big question is why on
67:27 earth would the government
67:29 fly something like that that could be
67:32 identified as a
67:33 uap in the middle of the day such that
67:36 top gun pilots could chase it they
67:38 already know that the ships can't
67:39 catch it so what are you what point are
67:42 you proving
67:44 yeah what's funny is you know i watched
67:46 dark five
67:47 the channel he's done a few episodes
67:50 about you know rumored
67:51 anti-gravity vehicles and all that and
67:54 he would show these like propeller
67:56 based saucers and
67:59 he would claim that these things had
68:00 gotten to like mach 3
68:02 because he's he's very he doesn't really
68:05 get involved with judging anything like
68:06 we do
68:07 but this thing in this picture has never
68:10 hit mach 1.
68:11 guarantee it come on now it's like
68:13 saying that a uh
68:15 a drone out of kmart or target or
68:17 whatever
68:18 could go that that speed too it's just
68:20 it's not going to ever achieve that
68:22 where's the propulsion system that would
68:24 ever take it to that level
68:26 apparently the aurora triangle aircraft
68:29 was recently photographed
68:32 so that's starting to leak out a little
68:34 bit it's very very sad to see
68:36 this cold war thing start to come back
68:40 because you know it's all a hoax you
68:42 know it's all
68:44 fear-mongering through the press
68:47 through pundits or whatever lobbyists
68:51 saying oh we're going to go to war with
68:52 china china's going to go to war with us
68:54 we're going to go to war with russia
68:56 it's like give it a rest man
68:59 getting a bunch of kids killed you know
69:02 in fake wars has got to be the most
69:04 reprehensible behavior
69:06 so anyway i just want to touch base on
69:08 this because
69:09 it just came out and i hadn't said
69:11 anything
69:14 i know a lot of you have done passionate
69:15 research in this sort of
69:17 avenue please throw into the comments on
69:19 youtube anything you've got are the
69:21 facebook page
69:22 with other research that you think is
69:24 legit obviously the shorter the videos
69:26 for me the better but just lament just
69:30 tell me in the comments what
69:31 has triggered your mind to believe one
69:34 way or the other is it's going to be
69:35 another
69:36 attempt at the hoax or is it legit
69:40 is it both i mean we did find these
69:42 people but
69:43 the thing you're going to see isn't real
69:46 what do you think about my opinions of
69:48 genetically engineering a small race of
69:51 hybrid humans to complete the illusion
69:56 of these aliens you know the the one
70:00 thing that kind of
70:02 ices that down for me is that a lot of
70:05 times
70:05 a child will be deformed and passed away
70:09 very quick after birth and they take
70:10 that fetus
70:11 or that baby and then they take a bunch
70:14 of pictures of it and they say look we
70:15 found an alien in
70:17 india or something like that right
70:21 anyway it's getting really super windy
70:22 out here so i got a book go to
70:24 deepthoughtsradio.com
70:25 everything you wants on there bookmark
70:27 it
70:29 take care of yourself and someone else
