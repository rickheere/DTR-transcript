00:30 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen
00:33 on this cigar free episode i've only
00:36 done a few ever
00:37 i've already had a stick today i didn't
00:38 feel like doing another one
00:41 so i have been watching this amazing
00:45 i'm not done with it yet i'm only two
00:46 hours in so this is gonna be part one
00:49 of a bonus round um also going through
00:52 tesla's invention list
00:53 oh my god it's gonna be so good it's
00:56 gonna be so good to explain
00:58 what this dude's done but i can't
01:00 digress because no one knows that's
01:02 coming he doesn't watch the show
01:03 normally
01:05 watch this guy named brian forster and
01:07 everything
01:08 well a bunch of new stuff i'm gonna
01:10 mention is
01:12 credited credited to him i don't know if
01:15 i'm going to
01:16 cut in his um images or not
01:20 i'm kind of debating i don't want to do
01:22 a disservice i will be putting his
01:24 video in the link down below to give you
01:26 a chance to see part of it
01:28 before we go to the next section it's
01:31 about seven hours
01:32 about six hours fifty minutes i think
01:35 so i thought about doing maybe two or
01:37 three of these
01:38 ketchups on this to see if i've come up
01:40 with anything new
01:42 this will be definitely some new stuff
01:44 in the area of
01:45 ancient egypt as well as other
01:50 other sites
01:54 but it's gonna mix in a little bit of
01:55 some of the dna we've talked about from
01:57 other shows
01:58 about ancient egypt and these
02:02 these cultures that have names that are
02:05 i think completely misunderstood
02:08 because we
02:13 have been taught bad history and you
02:16 know i think that some of it's been bad
02:18 history due to
02:19 people just trying really hard and not
02:21 being able to come up with any other
02:23 ideas and
02:24 you know i want to make sure that you
02:27 know we remember that a lot of times
02:29 when we
02:29 read about ancient ancient stuff like
02:32 the pyramids or machu picchu
02:34 or other amazing locations
02:38 we lean on one phd who was like
02:41 the guy or girl who went in and first
02:44 uncovered this stuff and so
02:50 you know they get to say you know and
02:53 again i think that a lot of these lone
02:55 sharks uh uh i shouldn't say uh long
02:58 sharks different thing but these kind of
02:59 like solo guys
03:01 or gals that go in you know they have
03:04 however much history that they've been
03:06 able to discern out of reality you know
03:08 printed books
03:10 or a little bit more difficult to get a
03:11 hold of than
03:13 internet websites that might have the
03:14 book online which is what it is today
03:16 someone researches something goes online
03:18 first then maybe it turns into a book
03:20 later
03:21 and then the online version could be you
03:24 know
03:25 thousands of hours of youtube videos
03:27 whereas the book is only going to be
03:30 capable of holding 400 pages or
03:32 something like that right
03:34 so the three areas that i'll go through
03:35 today will be
03:38 ancient egypt's knowledge
03:41 the pre-inca civilization
03:44 and petra because that's what he's
03:46 covered in his
03:48 his video you know obviously my
03:51 knowledge is
03:52 uh has more probably what he's going to
03:53 end up talking about in his video but
03:56 something's dawned on me because you
03:59 know we've had graham hancock go first
04:03 he wrote fingerprints of the gods he
04:05 wrote the book about the sphinx
04:08 and then we had the pyramid code that
04:10 came out in bbc which is now being
04:13 sold or you know viewable on netflix
04:15 which i think is
04:17 unbelievably mandatory if you want to
04:20 start getting a grasp of things
04:22 and this is where so you have graham
04:24 hancock
04:27 finding hieroglyphs with years and
04:30 months on them
04:32 taking it back you know
04:36 according to man you know pre-ice age
04:39 then you have the pyramid code
04:43 which finally was able to
04:46 say that the pyramids were power
04:48 stations
04:49 then you have brian forrester and i
04:51 don't know exactly where he's going to
04:52 end up
04:53 but he has alluded to the power
04:56 supply but what foresters done
05:00 is uh really get into the geology
05:04 of the structures and the
05:06 [Music]
05:07 rocks that have been imported from in
05:09 some cases
05:10 500 to 1000 miles away
05:13 at you know a thousand tons
05:16 or more which seems you know absolutely
05:20 possible
05:20 no matter what you want to do with some
05:22 of these rocks they're huge and
05:24 interestingly enough for those of you in
05:25 other conspiracies
05:27 a lot of it is black boxes
05:31 of these stones
05:35 and what he has done is he's looked at
05:39 he finally just said this forester guy
05:41 looked at the construction methodology
05:43 and simply said look
05:45 he he introduced a rating system for
05:48 rock which i think was extremely
05:51 powerful for the mind which he said look
05:54 all of the rocks that are
05:55 a part of these monolithic structures
05:57 from the past
06:00 average of a hardness of seven out of
06:02 ten
06:04 ten being a diamond and so the rule is
06:08 in chemistry is that you have to have a
06:11 harder substance to etch
06:13 a another substance right so an eight
06:17 can etch a seven a nine can connection
06:19 seven ten canadian seven
06:22 however if you're going into the eight
06:25 uh i would say seven eight nine realm
06:28 you're going to be dealing with rocks
06:30 other rocks pounding rocks
06:32 and those rocks will deteriorate over
06:34 time especially
06:35 if they're cut in a fairly sharp wedgy
06:38 way
06:39 right you just you got a little spike
06:42 and you're
06:43 hitting it so diamond
06:47 is just the all end all bead all winning
06:50 methodology but then diamond cutting
06:54 technology
06:55 has a tremendous amount of requirements
06:57 for invention
06:58 and implementation for instance
07:02 if you want to cut a stone with diamond
07:04 uh one we've only
07:05 we've had that technology less than 150
07:07 years
07:08 in our realm and this stuff goes back
07:11 you know his
07:13 his date just so that you know is twelve
07:15 000
07:16 years ago which would take off the two
07:17 that we've lived in the 80 realm so he's
07:20 talking about 10 000
07:21 bc um he apparently in his
07:26 narration has been talking about the ice
07:27 age being a barrier
07:29 in his mind and i'm not convinced that
07:30 ice ages happen anywhere near
07:33 the way that they have been described
07:35 because the places that they go to try
07:37 and prove that ice ages occur
07:39 are still very polar based regions of
07:42 the world so very close to the south
07:43 pole very
07:44 close to the north pole and so that
07:46 doesn't infringe on
07:47 constant invention at the equator which
07:49 is where egypt is
07:50 right i don't believe for
07:54 a second that at the equatorial level
07:57 that you got freezing temperatures i
07:59 just don't believe that
08:01 and again it's because they found rocks
08:03 that rolled okay and they've seen glass
08:06 glaciers almost call them glaciers the
08:09 british way of saying it
08:11 so you know okay so ice rolls a rock
08:15 way up in you know some northern
08:17 hemisphere region
08:18 and to somehow create this this
08:21 intellectual barrier it's almost like
08:23 the flawed algorithm equals mc squared
08:25 if you do the math on it it says that
08:27 nothing can go the speed of light
08:28 obviously that's completely untrue
08:30 certain things would
08:32 definitely struggle to get to the speed
08:33 light but pure energy most definitely
08:35 can exceed that
08:36 ether being tested at 50 times the speed
08:38 of light by
08:40 faraday through tesla and then
08:42 reconfirmed in the late 70s early 80s
08:45 by eric dollard so it's important to
08:48 kind of
08:49 flush out of your mind if you're coming
08:50 into the channel new this this title
08:52 interests you i need you to let go
08:55 of things that like the big bang just
08:57 let go of it right it's not true
08:59 it doesn't it defies all physics and
09:01 nobody was there
09:02 it's just a way to make sure that the
09:04 common person can go
09:06 i know how the universe started right it
09:08 makes them feel empowered
09:10 if you take that away from them then you
09:12 leave them with doubt and uncertainty
09:14 again
09:14 because they're usually not that
09:16 intellectual but even
09:17 if you're massively intellectual
09:19 thinking about the beginning of the
09:20 universe is something that
09:21 like thinking about infinite number sets
09:23 as i've said recently
09:26 but what this uh forester guy did was
09:29 focus on things that is in a book of
09:31 mine called 39000 bc
09:35 which is more around graham hancock's
09:37 time frame which is interesting to
09:39 independent thinkers come up with the
09:40 same number now graham
09:41 again has been on i think even the joe
09:45 rogan show
09:46 brought photographs with them that they
09:47 cut
09:49 uh where he has a temple that takes back
09:52 the dynasties way way back there now
09:55 what forester
09:56 does is very intelligent which he has
09:59 the dynasty time
10:00 which for those of you who are new to
10:02 this whole thing it's where the
10:03 dynasties were
10:05 and then he has pre-dynastic era which
10:08 is things that were
10:09 created prior to any egyptian uh sorry
10:11 excuse me
10:12 arabic presence in the area
10:16 it's very apparent once you look at the
10:18 busts of these
10:20 individuals that they honored that
10:22 they're uh
10:23 they're they're african they're not
10:26 i'm not saying it's uh any one of the
10:28 tribes that's in south africa now or in
10:30 the southern
10:30 i guess the lower 90 percent
10:34 because the innovation has obviously
10:35 been lost right
10:38 but i think that they are direct
10:40 potentially
10:41 ancestors of those individuals who knows
10:45 but the arab face is very different than
10:48 an african uh which we call an america
10:51 blackface right
10:52 a black person they have much different
10:54 geometry
10:56 it's all incredible and so the busts are
10:59 and you know
11:00 it does develop up to a nefertini bust
11:02 at one point
11:03 a head bust rate but you know you have
11:05 statues that are most definitely not of
11:07 that genetic pool
11:10 and so his tact is
11:13 mini fold but he starts his it's a
11:16 slideshow he's sitting there
11:17 talking to you it's the easiest
11:19 documentary i have ever
11:21 watched on the subject even though he's
11:23 just sitting there talking going through
11:24 slides the slides are intoxicating if
11:26 you know what you're looking at
11:28 his presentation he says nothing that
11:30 doesn't need to be said never repeats
11:31 himself
11:33 unless he's demonstrating multiple
11:35 issues with multiple slides
11:37 it's fantastic i mean hats off to this
11:40 guy
11:40 i don't know him at all i should
11:44 but what he's done is he's looked at it
11:46 from a geographical
11:47 or as i should say geological uh
11:51 sensibility of the stones that were used
11:54 and then he looks at the erosion
11:56 techniques
11:57 and then he looks at the tools that were
12:00 used
12:01 to create these objects and then he
12:03 brings in a whole new thing i have
12:05 never seen before uh
12:08 and having said that i probably have
12:12 seen it and didn't recognize what i was
12:14 looking at
12:15 and at first when he started saying this
12:17 on his presentation
12:18 i thought oh he's going to be starting
12:20 to go into that you know fringy
12:22 theory uh area and then he showed
12:25 three dozen slides proving his point and
12:28 you're like oh my gosh you're absolutely
12:29 right
12:30 and that is is that there's essentially
12:35 um i guess about four or four erosion
12:38 techniques that you'll see
12:40 uh one is flood flooding the other one
12:43 is sure just wind
12:44 without any other objects in the wind
12:47 then there's sand blasting wind
12:49 and then there's this new thing which is
12:52 that a
12:52 bunch of these structures are burned
12:56 and i mean they have been burned at a
12:58 thousand celsius
12:59 plus because these rocks won't respond
13:02 to anything below
13:03 a certain level of high temperature
13:06 in addition to his fire theory because
13:09 he's showing that
13:12 some of these sites have all been
13:15 essentially obliterated by what looks
13:17 like
13:18 a fire coming from one side
13:22 like almost like an atomic bomb it looks
13:25 like it has burned
13:26 uh one half of a statue and then it's
13:30 the the rubbling that's gone on at these
13:32 sites
13:33 he's now postulating and he said it was
13:37 some other guy's theory that it was a
13:38 plasma burst from the sun
13:40 yeah it might as well think about it
13:43 like that
13:44 the sun is apparently 93 million miles
13:46 away so that would be pretty
13:48 amazing if it's a flat earth then it's
13:50 only 3 200 miles up and then what's
13:52 going on there
13:53 but the earth has enough plasma in its
13:55 interior that they could have been
13:57 fiddling with the earth's interior like
14:00 tesla was fiddling with it
14:02 to you know tesla created a siphon
14:05 out of the earth's crust of infinite
14:08 energy
14:08 plasma energy and then he was able to
14:11 convert it into
14:12 harmless waves of energy so we could use
14:14 induction to run all of our appliances
14:16 everywhere in the world
14:19 and so you know the origin of
14:22 the blast isn't as as interesting to me
14:26 at this point
14:27 maybe he'll offer more theories later on
14:30 but he is absolutely correct
14:32 all around the world even over in the
14:36 kind of
14:36 machu picchu areas of the world in in
14:38 peru
14:41 and in the um i think that petra doesn't
14:45 really have a tremendous amount of the
14:46 burning thing but he does
14:48 he does show that some of the petra
14:50 rocks and this is the
14:51 if you're not familiar with petra by
14:52 name it is that
14:55 amazing relief it's called the treasury
14:58 i believe
14:59 in the side of the mountain it was in
15:01 indiana jones 3 where he walked inside
15:04 that chamber to then go through his
15:06 three trials and
15:07 retrieve the um
15:10 the holy grail from the uh knights
15:13 simpler dude in there
15:14 right but what he mentioned about petra
15:18 and
15:18 we'll skip back to egypt after this but
15:20 he said petra is seven miles long
15:23 he said there were he lost count he said
15:25 look there's at least a hundred
15:27 different inlets in this place from
15:30 super fancy ones that look like the
15:31 treasury
15:32 to homes is the further you go down
15:35 but he said it could have been 200 he
15:37 goes literally i just couldn't keep
15:38 count of what i was seeing
15:40 he was so exhausted after exploring
15:44 each one of these you know unique
15:47 reliefs in the mountain that they said
15:49 they had to rent horses to get back
15:52 to seven miles you know like seven miles
15:53 is not really that long to walk you can
15:55 do
15:57 11 to 15 at disneyland right but he was
16:00 just
16:01 laboring to take all these amazing
16:02 photographs and i will compliment
16:04 one thing about this guy over most
16:07 photographers graham hancock's really
16:09 really amazing at it
16:11 uh he and his wife do their photography
16:13 brian and his wife do their photography
16:16 he is really great about taking
16:18 pertinent photographs he uses humans
16:21 of you know average six foot height to
16:24 stand in front of objects so you can get
16:25 a sense of scale
16:27 but he in his egyptian
16:31 exploration paid the extra money
16:35 to get to certain sites privately
16:38 and so his analysis is undisturbed
16:41 by tourists
16:45 without you know he doesn't have too
16:46 many guides
16:48 he also when he gets to petra he starts
16:51 to kind of
16:52 talk about his guy he went to machu
16:53 picchu area in peru he starts talking
16:56 about his
16:56 guides and just generally what the
16:59 philosophy was that was coming out of
17:00 them
17:02 and so so here's the um
17:06 the super interesting thing initially is
17:09 that
17:10 the rocks he showed me uh
17:13 in this presentation these black boxes
17:16 that they built and for those of you
17:18 who follow the saturn worship theories
17:20 of the black box you know again saturn's
17:23 probably a gas giant with uh
17:26 you know rings around it but you know
17:28 earth doesn't look like
17:30 because i've seen saturn to a telescope
17:31 with my own eyes okay
17:33 uh it does have you know gaseous clouds
17:35 around it you know and imagine
17:37 us living in a world where we always
17:39 have cloud cover
17:40 in these rings that go from top to
17:42 bottom right
17:43 it just doesn't sound like a place you
17:45 can live right
17:46 when you stare at earth from space or
17:48 even a high altitude plane
17:50 one or the other we have openings you
17:52 know you can see
17:53 the ocean you can see a continent oh
17:55 there's a storm right there there's a
17:56 hurricane right
17:57 if you were to cover earth with clouds
18:00 all the way around it
18:01 you're starting to have a greenhouse gas
18:03 system that would
18:04 fry everybody down below it just doesn't
18:06 make any sense anyone
18:07 lives on saturn so that's just for those
18:10 of you who follow that really intensely
18:13 but he even got to the point where
18:17 before we start talking about some of
18:18 the construction techniques
18:20 that he he brought something up
18:25 that i think was fascinating i've never
18:28 heard anyone else say it
18:29 and of course if you're with a lot of
18:31 egyptian
18:33 um archaeologists or especially that
18:35 crazy guy they finally fired at the
18:36 cairo museum
18:38 you know everything's you know them them
18:40 them them you know they just want to
18:41 take credit for all this engineering but
18:43 it's like okay dudes if you had built
18:45 built the pyramids right now
18:47 you would have anti-gravity vehicles you
18:49 would be
18:50 the mecca of invention because if you
18:52 had
18:53 structural knowledge of this place
18:56 and um pai figured out and also stuff
19:00 you're
19:01 thousands of years ahead of everybody
19:02 else right i mean literally thousands of
19:04 years ahead of everyone else
19:05 now his dates which i have to trust his
19:08 dates
19:09 more for official history when i started
19:12 egyptology for six years
19:14 uh at a exhausted pace you know i heard
19:17 that the
19:18 the master buzz were which is these old
19:21 burial chambers that they used to dig in
19:23 the ground very
19:24 primitive just almost looks like a shoe
19:25 box with some walls in it there's no
19:27 doors or anything you
19:28 literally put people in little chambers
19:31 you do would kill all of his animals and
19:33 put him sometimes the wives who go with
19:34 them
19:35 and then you just cover it up and you
19:36 build this little bunker
19:40 extremely primitive
19:43 he he said that um and so what
19:47 you know because for me it was the
19:48 pyramids were were built between
19:50 3000 bc to about
19:54 2800 bc he puts about 2200 bc
19:59 so i must have my numbers wrong because
20:00 this guy definitely knows his stuff
20:03 and so he quotes that as bad history
20:06 he makes it very apparent his
20:08 presentation that this is what you've
20:09 been told
20:10 we don't we're not sure when again he
20:13 goes back to 10 000
20:14 bc whereas graham chapman has done an
20:18 amazing job
20:19 also visiting all the sites exhaustively
20:22 several times and he has it back to 35
20:25 000
20:26 bc which coincidentally also aligns the
20:29 stars
20:30 of orion's belt and leo the
20:32 constellation of leo
20:34 with the sphinx so
20:37 that was interesting the other thing
20:39 that graham hancock submitted
20:41 which just for those of you interested
20:42 in doing the deep dive his book on the
20:44 sphinx which i can't remember the clever
20:46 name you came up with but it's just
20:47 graham hancock look up the word sphinx
20:49 and it's the book
20:51 he had the sphinx completely diagrammed
20:53 internally
20:54 with all of its internal chambers and
20:56 windows out of the body
20:58 of the sphinx pointing at various stars
21:01 whereas this guy correlates with my
21:06 findings which is that no one knows if
21:08 there's chambers inside there they know
21:10 there's a chamber underneath the pause
21:12 and there are inlets into the sphinx but
21:15 you're not allowed to go in there
21:17 so graham i don't know i mean graham is
21:20 not a
21:21 he's not a casual guy you know he
21:23 doesn't just make up stuff so he must
21:24 have been either told something or maybe
21:26 he got some privilege access
21:28 that he's not saying and just to kind of
21:31 put a um
21:33 another point on that when i was working
21:35 in the san francisco area
21:38 south of san francisco about 30 miles we
21:41 had this ivy league guy come through the
21:42 company and he worked for us for a
21:44 little while
21:45 and uh he was a rich kid he went to
21:49 cairo egypt before he came back to
21:52 united states after he went to college
21:53 and he said that
21:55 you weren't allowed to climb on the
21:57 pyramid
21:58 but he slipped a guard like 20 bucks and
22:01 the guy said go ahead
22:02 he just crawled up the whole thing all
22:03 the way at the top so
22:06 you can get to these privileged places
22:08 in the past now today they have
22:11 20 foot walls around the gizza plateau
22:15 but this brian forester guy actually
22:17 bought a tour because they're now
22:18 opening up the chambers
22:21 underneath the plateau which is what the
22:24 the pyramid code talks about what this
22:27 mason who was an egyptian mason
22:29 he talked about playing in those
22:31 catacombs catacombs excuse me down below
22:35 the giza plateau and said that there was
22:36 a hexagonal
22:39 pattern underneath the giza plateau that
22:41 was full of water
22:43 we know it's built in an aqua ravine and
22:45 that plus the
22:46 conductive stones above
22:49 it spells electricity now this forester
22:52 guy also
22:53 clarified something that i may have been
22:55 quoting incorrectly from the pyramid
22:57 code
22:58 but i find it hard to believe the
22:59 pyramid code got it completely wrong
23:02 but apparently there's a lot more red
23:04 granite
23:05 as the interior rocks of the pyramids
23:09 than i previously understood now what
23:10 i've been told is that there's a
23:11 conductive limestone
23:13 on the inside and non-conductive on the
23:15 outside plus
23:16 all the corridors inside were built out
23:18 of this red granite
23:20 that's what i believe the uh pyramid
23:22 code said
23:23 so all of that creates a battery because
23:26 you have
23:26 plasma energy coming up through the
23:28 water catacombs hits the water plateau
23:31 remember the giza plateau is supposed to
23:33 be taller than the pyramid the pyramids
23:35 like 455 feet
23:37 it's just massive right
23:42 but he talks about explosions what he
23:45 he says that when he looks at some of
23:47 these other pyramids especially a step
23:49 pyramid
23:50 that was created from what we believe
23:53 much much later because the stones
23:55 inside were extremely primitive
23:58 he said that it looked like the top half
24:02 of this step pyramid had blown apart
24:05 and if you think about it you've got
24:07 some pyramids
24:08 three of them each smaller one's
24:11 supposed to be
24:12 red one's supposed to be white i think
24:14 it's white red and black as the colors
24:16 and they would stain it you know they
24:17 would use smoke to
24:19 stain it black and they would i don't
24:21 know how they got red out of it but it
24:22 was explained in the in the pyramid code
24:25 you know pure freshly cut limestone in
24:28 the sunlight would appear to be
24:30 just utterly blindingly bright right so
24:33 you might just get white
24:34 just out of street limestone
24:38 but he talked several times and he was
24:41 saying look the force
24:43 to break up these stones to hurl these
24:45 stones from what they apparently
24:47 seem to originated from as they match
24:50 the ones that are on the pile
24:51 way you know far away he's and he just
24:54 says look the pattern just looks like an
24:56 explosion
24:57 so he didn't show any photographs to
24:58 really reinforce that he would probably
25:00 need a drone
25:01 to honestly give us that view and those
25:04 events allowed
25:05 apparently based on the uh
25:09 the book 39 000 bc
25:13 they said that by the last decade
25:17 that the egyptian government had figured
25:20 out that they got a bunch of like
25:21 secrets lying all over the ground and
25:23 outside temples and outside these
25:25 pyramids there's a bunch of like
25:26 throwaway stones
25:29 not sure if they were functional at one
25:31 point and then
25:33 something got torn down or whether or
25:34 not this was just a mistake and they
25:36 just uh i broke that up
25:37 leave it right there but it was so bad
25:39 that you when photographers were
25:41 starting to notice all these bore holes
25:43 and these diamond cut circular blade cut
25:46 because we know what it looks like today
25:48 this is the crazy thing we know what it
25:50 looks like in the 20th century and above
25:52 and so to see these etching marks
25:56 on stones that match exactly the way we
25:59 cut
25:59 you know your your marble cabinet in
26:01 your house or the marble in your
26:02 bathroom or whatever
26:04 it's it's like oh it's one of those but
26:07 how the hell did you do it so long ago
26:08 you know but you were the
26:12 39 000 bc was able to get a lot of
26:14 photographs
26:15 but at the same time the photographers
26:18 in that book were saying that they would
26:19 actually have to
26:21 kind of hold their camera you know like
26:23 pretend like they're sitting down
26:24 and not looking anywhere just kind of
26:26 looking off in the distance but really
26:27 they're snapping shots with the camera
26:30 um luckily digital cameras don't have
26:33 film so they can just
26:34 rack up like 15 000 shots on one visit
26:36 switch the memory card do it again right
26:40 so he
26:43 uh this brian forrester guy he really
26:46 brings your mind
26:47 straight to the evidence of um
26:51 some of these stones okay were again a
26:54 thousand tons or more right
26:58 big cubes of stone that he said the
27:00 closest quarry for some of this stone
27:02 was like in turkey
27:04 which is a lot further from america and
27:06 europe but from
27:07 egypt it's it's it's not a tremendous
27:09 distance but
27:10 what boat could you build to hold a
27:12 thousand tons
27:13 i mean seriously how do you move that
27:15 thing and what if you lost one you would
27:16 probably find them on the bottom of the
27:18 mediterranean sea if that was the way
27:20 it worked maybe they're there too but he
27:23 insinuated that
27:24 um and it's so clear it's so freaking
27:27 clear when he see
27:28 when you see his uh pictures that
27:32 and i've seen just so you know i mean
27:33 like i don't know
27:36 hundreds and hundreds of pages of
27:38 hieroglyph photographs because i studied
27:40 it
27:42 and he says look look at these
27:44 hyperglyphs these higher close look to
27:45 cut by machine
27:47 and they're super deep like perfect
27:50 relief symbols of ancient arabic
27:54 and then he goes look at this stone
27:56 right here and it looks all
27:58 you know like you and me using some
28:00 chisel and okay what's that thing look
28:01 like again
28:02 okay yeah yeah it just looks really
28:04 gross
28:05 and and coarse no precision what's a
28:08 wall whatsoever
28:09 the depth of the actual hieroglyphs is
28:13 really maybe maybe a quarter inch
28:17 whereas these other earlier stones
28:20 okay are like an inch two inches thick
28:24 and absolutely mitered edges i mean it
28:26 looks like
28:27 it looks like a 3d model where you just
28:30 get perfection because it's fake
28:32 inside of a computer right
28:35 so he shows us this
28:41 this one site that has a bunch of really
28:43 long corridors
28:44 that are beautifully arched all the way
28:47 and super deep like 300 feet deep or
28:49 some yards or whatever
28:51 and the precision of the actual
28:55 tunnels is precise i mean just
28:58 ridiculously perfect now can you imagine
29:01 us
29:02 trying let's say we had a tool that's an
29:04 11 right it can go right through all
29:05 this stuff
29:06 what we're going to do by hand is our
29:07 honey machines well
29:09 you can get some pretty good stuff going
29:11 chip chip chip chip chip
29:12 but eventually with a with a arch
29:15 ceiling
29:16 going 300 feet back hell even 30 feet
29:19 back
29:20 we're not gonna have precision because
29:22 we're human beings
29:23 even if we brought like a little you
29:25 know ruler with us or trying to measure
29:27 constantly we're going to get it off
29:29 it's going to look human built and there
29:31 are a lot of those
29:33 sites as well but
29:36 when you compare the two then your mind
29:37 starts blowing
29:40 but down at the end of these corridors
29:41 are these big giant
29:43 black cubes they have these perfectly
29:47 mitered
29:48 corners like
29:51 it's one thing to create one corner it's
29:54 another thing to keep all
29:55 four sides parallel plus the top is
29:58 perfect 90 degree angle he said that
30:01 some of these lids that they were
30:02 creating back in the day
30:04 if they were to fall down into the slots
30:05 he goes it's hermetically sealed
30:08 that's how tight these uh these giant
30:11 humidors are right
30:13 but he also noted that the etching on
30:16 some of this
30:17 some while etching in all these black
30:20 cubes
30:21 looks primitive and looks more recent as
30:24 if they found these cubes didn't know
30:25 exactly what they were used for
30:27 and then just started putting stuff on
30:29 them
30:31 there was actually one cube that wasn't
30:34 quite finished yet and it was pushed way
30:37 down the hallway and the lid was
30:38 actually further down like 10 feet
30:40 further down the
30:41 down the hallway and he was like man you
30:43 know it just blows the mind as to what
30:47 you know how they get the lid further in
30:50 and then
30:51 why did they stop in the middle of this
30:53 whole thing
30:55 and he starts uncovering various regions
30:57 of
30:58 egypt from the valley of the kings all
31:00 the way up
31:01 through luxor up to the giza plateau
31:05 where it really appears that
31:09 they suddenly abandoned the place
31:12 something happened
31:14 now again it does look like fire is
31:17 present at the
31:18 areas where there's no more life on the
31:22 ground
31:22 except some kind of barbie little bushes
31:25 but there's no
31:26 normal plants there's no indigenous
31:28 animals running around
31:30 and so he said you know there was this
31:33 one area that looks like it was bombed
31:35 and then a second it stops
31:38 life starts again like you have plush
31:41 something or other
31:42 living on this border of this particular
31:45 area
31:47 now the other distinction he makes which
31:49 i think
31:51 we've all made recently in the last five
31:53 years at least as this new information
31:54 keeps coming out
31:56 is that you know one you're raised with
31:59 wrong information
32:00 and again there's a lot of pride for the
32:02 egyptians
32:04 to claim that all this is theirs right
32:08 how convenient okay it's not that you
32:10 know they didn't do amazing things
32:12 in addition to whatever they found but
32:15 it looks like all the most amazing
32:16 things were created by this culture that
32:17 was long gone
32:19 like they found it and then they just
32:21 claimed it as their own why not
32:23 that's what the ptolemies did from rome
32:27 but he said look we all know that if you
32:30 subscribe
32:30 to the electrical theory of the pyramids
32:32 which is not a stretch
32:34 it's not even it's pure physics it's
32:36 pure electronics
32:39 and electronics but uh pure electricity
32:41 electrical theory
32:44 they told you that these things were
32:46 tombs it you know
32:48 i guess you know we when you're kids you
32:50 look at the pyramids you're like tombs
32:52 right and then you get older like yeah
32:55 people do
32:56 get really sentimental about you know
32:57 their leaders who die especially if they
32:59 were good leaders
33:01 but the interesting thing he noted right
33:02 at the beginning of his presentation
33:04 which i've never had anyone
33:07 say is that he said look um
33:11 he says all these pharaohs they claim
33:12 various pyramids he goes you know
33:14 the great pyramid is estimated between
33:17 2.3 to 2.5 million
33:19 stones all weighing you know 10 tons
33:21 plus
33:22 and he said uh some are 60 tons i mean
33:26 they're just gigantic they're huge
33:29 he said they would have to be placing a
33:31 stone every two and a half minutes to
33:33 get the thing done in the guy's lifetime
33:35 so
33:36 the idea that these were built in any
33:37 one pharaoh's lifetime
33:39 is um just a joke it's just not true
33:43 without special technology okay
33:46 and again if if they did it then they
33:49 did the most abysmal job
33:50 ever in history of recording how they
33:52 did it because i can tell you with
33:55 every single hieroglyph i've ever seen
33:58 every book i've ever read that
34:00 translated them for me
34:02 there's no knowledge of how these things
34:04 are built they didn't leave back leave a
34:06 schematic of how they
34:08 how they um built these things and
34:11 you're thinking what what happens in the
34:13 modern world
34:15 what happened with greece they advance
34:18 you know they get the parthenon and then
34:19 it gets to rome and then they create
34:21 their columns and then it moves into
34:23 europe and they start creating more
34:24 advanced things again
34:26 remember the closer the pillars are in
34:28 architecture
34:30 the more primitive the builders were at
34:32 the time and it's the further they can
34:34 build these pure
34:35 pillars out the more amazing the
34:37 structure is
34:38 because it has more structural integrity
34:40 right
34:42 so everyone else in the world as
34:45 compared to the
34:46 arab arabs in egypt the egyptians of
34:49 today
34:50 they they moved up
34:54 after europe moved up you know
34:58 and so it doesn't make any sense when
34:59 they were totally advanced
35:01 and now it's just kind of a third world
35:04 you know especially today so
35:07 he tries to stress look just because
35:09 someone said this was a tomb this was a
35:11 home
35:12 this is a sarcophagus you have to take
35:16 all of that indoctrination away
35:19 and then just look just observe what
35:22 you know you're seeing with your own two
35:24 eyes
35:25 for the tunnels and this is a big thing
35:27 about the pyramids as well
35:29 because he hasn't gone inside the
35:30 pyramids yet i hope he loops back and is
35:32 in the show he said look the
35:36 we know what the indigenous people
35:40 used for lights they had pretty advanced
35:43 torches
35:44 back in the day but torches
35:47 burp out a lot of carbon and so if you
35:50 were to take one of those torches let's
35:52 just say your
35:52 your ceiling in your house wasn't
35:54 flammable okay
35:56 but it's white and you were to carry one
35:58 of these torches just from the front
35:59 door to your back door and back out to
36:00 the backyard
36:02 you would have a candle burn
36:05 on your roof just from the carbon just
36:07 sticking to your roof
36:09 and so think about how long it would
36:12 take to build these structures by hand
36:13 without amazing tools
36:15 being there forever so how you gonna
36:17 clean it all up
36:18 i mean you could potentially okay it
36:21 makes no sense
36:22 and you wouldn't get rid of all the
36:23 carbon because carbon sticks in every
36:25 little hook and cranny
36:26 but you could you know technically go to
36:28 the very end of the corridor with some
36:30 torches and then polish your way out of
36:32 the place right and then it's like don't
36:33 go inside because
36:34 you know the torch is going to make
36:36 everything look bad
36:38 doesn't make any sense the pyramids
36:41 internally
36:42 have no scorch marks but once you go
36:44 inside there's no light
36:45 you turn a corner and there is no light
36:49 there were old theories of mirrors but
36:51 then again the technology of mirrors
36:53 back in the day
36:54 was very primitive for a very very long
36:58 time
36:59 even polishing steel to cast light in
37:04 we didn't have you had bronze age stuff
37:06 at best
37:07 in the dynastic period 2200 bc
37:12 so a lot of questions
37:16 but now some of the things that he's
37:18 pointing at
37:19 are the
37:22 he mentioned something i didn't know
37:23 which is these boreholes
37:26 it's weird when you grow up with
37:28 technology
37:30 and then you see it in prehistoric man
37:34 basically right i don't mean
37:36 unsophisticated man because obviously
37:38 they were capable of doing things that
37:40 we can't do today
37:42 and that's just wild for the mind isn't
37:44 it your hubris won't allow it
37:46 ah no wait you know we know everything
37:48 today we got b2b bombers you know
37:51 okay these boreholes are everywhere
37:57 now some of them i think he he um
38:02 may have mistaken for modern boreholes
38:05 that were used to move things
38:07 because he he showed this one area where
38:08 there was a rock on a
38:10 on like a pedestal
38:14 and it's a big heavy rocks by about a
38:15 510 rock
38:17 and they had bore holes on both sides
38:20 all the way through
38:21 little tiny you know maybe like one inch
38:23 or one and a half inch two inch balls
38:25 going all the way through i would think
38:27 that that's what they did
38:29 in modern times to move it to that
38:30 location
38:34 but the most important boreholes are
38:36 ancient boreholes
38:39 big quartz baths
38:42 and when i first heard um
38:45 or first saw in this book of mine
38:49 you know then really calling out the
38:51 boreholes and the egyptian earth that's
38:53 right the pyramid code actually has a
38:55 little bit of this in it
38:56 but my book went into it a really
38:59 intense rate
39:02 you still think there's a way of someone
39:04 creating some sort of
39:06 drill let's say i mean mounting diamonds
39:09 on something okay
39:12 part of it has to do with the fact that
39:14 you don't just mount
39:15 diamonds on other rocks and then turn it
39:19 and create a drill it would seem as if
39:24 they um you have to mount it on
39:27 something that's
39:28 equally strong as the diamond at least a
39:30 nine to
39:31 an eight to a nine in strength because
39:34 all the kinetic force once you start
39:35 banging it into something right
39:37 all the kinetic force is pushing back
39:40 against your
39:41 diamond drill and it's going to start
39:43 knocking the diamonds off if it's
39:45 not mounted on something perfectly
39:48 and so i think that it just gets more
39:52 and more mind-blowing but now he
39:53 mentioned something that was something i
39:56 didn't know
39:58 which is i don't even know if this is
39:59 true but it sounds like it makes sense
40:00 he said look
40:02 you can't do a diamond drill that has a
40:05 variable speed
40:06 otherwise you don't get perfect holes so
40:09 he said you can't pedal
40:11 you can't turn with your hand and some
40:13 you know crane thing
40:14 like those those little drills you used
40:16 to have you know when you were a kid
40:19 from your grandpa's tool shop he said
40:21 you can't do it that way he goes some of
40:23 these boreholes were
40:25 about an eight inch diameter he stuck
40:27 his hand in this one and it was like
40:28 eight to ten inches and he goes this is
40:30 a gigantic
40:32 borehole and he goes just ask any
40:33 engineer that does this type of work
40:36 the difficulty of you know boring a
40:39 quarter inch hole
40:40 versus a 10 inch hole in
40:43 a seventh string stone
40:47 like granite and again it
40:50 starts going oh my god you know what
40:53 what must have been the situation
40:55 and then this is where i'm gonna put in
40:57 some more of my own dna
41:00 before we go into other little pieces
41:03 here
41:04 what starts to blow my mind is that
41:07 obviously
41:10 you think about these um
41:14 people who were doing these amazing
41:16 things i mean the stuff in peru
41:18 is equally amazing these mitered edges
41:22 that they came up with in stone was just
41:25 unbelievably perfect
41:28 but if you had the technology to create
41:30 the tool to bore a hole
41:33 in stone the big question is why are you
41:36 using stone
41:37 where is where are your other inventions
41:40 that would um
41:42 you know like skyscrapers or whatever
41:44 now according to the
41:46 discovery channel simulation of what the
41:49 world would look like in 10
41:50 000 years they said that
41:54 in their estimation new york city would
41:57 atomize
41:58 you know no human beings anywhere in the
42:00 world it's just going to age he said
42:01 that the plant growth will move into the
42:03 city
42:05 it'll turn all the roads over because
42:07 it's just it'll eat them up it'll just
42:08 atomize all the asphalt and eventually
42:10 it just atomizes to like a dust you know
42:13 you mean we might find like dust trails
42:15 ten thousand years from now from a super
42:17 highway
42:18 that where you know archaeologically we
42:20 could get in there and dig it out and go
42:21 oh wow there's this
42:22 weird stuff you know it's kind of
42:25 rubbery you know whatever it is
42:26 but they said that the the the buildings
42:29 the skyscrapers made of
42:30 steel would just rust away and fall into
42:33 the ground
42:34 very interesting right
42:37 so it does baffle me that i can't
42:40 reconcile
42:41 my brain all of these amazing tools
42:44 without the other side of the game but
42:47 you know again it
42:48 does demand a few inventions that i
42:50 think um
42:53 change their universe right they didn't
42:55 have potentially like
42:57 silicone chips and miniaturization
43:00 and vacuum tubes and resistors and
43:02 transistors and all that kind of stuff
43:04 so you know there's definitely limits
43:07 perhaps they hadn't
43:09 completely figured out a combustion
43:11 engine that kind of thing
43:13 but they had oil that would burn of
43:15 course
43:17 and so that's a little side thing to my
43:20 brain
43:20 i'm trying to figure out but the other
43:24 side of the game would be as i've said
43:26 before
43:28 uh this this alien theory right and the
43:31 alien theory
43:32 when i was a kid was aliens are
43:37 over here and human beings are over here
43:39 we're not the same thing
43:41 and as you grow older and you start
43:44 looking at
43:44 uh you know anthropological studies
43:48 uh genetic studies you start to find out
43:50 there's some pretty weird stuff inside
43:51 the human body that looks very very
43:54 deliberately engineered and the one
43:56 example i give often on the show
43:58 is that the visual cortex of the human
44:00 brain
44:01 is five layers of cells and the first
44:05 the only part that we use is the half of
44:07 the first layer
44:08 because there's a blocker in there that
44:11 keeps our signal from traveling the rest
44:13 of the four and a half
44:15 slices meaning someone did this to us
44:19 it doesn't make any genetic sense
44:20 whatsoever why this blocker would be
44:22 there
44:22 like why would this other similar well
44:25 identical tissue
44:27 ever develop if it was
44:30 if it wasn't being used right evolution
44:33 doesn't do that
44:35 if you build it you use it yeah there's
44:37 the uh
44:39 appendix and the gallbladder which has
44:41 marginal use at this point
44:43 but your visual cortex come on we use
44:45 that all the time we're not eating rocks
44:47 anymore so those other two organs you
44:49 know have minimal use
44:52 so you know when you look at the alien
44:55 side of things then you start to have to
44:56 start reconciling this
44:57 notion which is um
45:02 if we were them and i won't spend a
45:03 tremendous amount of time on this
45:04 because i have whole episodes on this
45:06 subject matter but just to kind of lean
45:08 into this a little bit as we're thinking
45:09 about the other things
45:12 is that perhaps we are them you know
45:16 maybe the different races of us out
45:18 there in the universe
45:19 the other theory is that they might find
45:22 a infib well sorry
45:26 a primate or a hominid of some sort
45:29 that's indigenous and already you know
45:32 acclimated to the
45:34 the um oxygen that we breathe the food
45:36 supply that's on earth
45:38 and then over time genetically splicing
45:41 us
45:42 their dna with the local dna to create
45:45 some
45:46 sort of hybrid it would seem that if
45:48 they had enough
45:49 technology to get to planet earth simply
45:52 re-engineering themselves
45:54 to match whatever is available would be
45:57 child's play for someone of that
45:59 technology level
46:01 so maybe there's no splicing and then it
46:03 could be that even
46:05 prehistoric man which should be a
46:08 bipedal creature
46:11 that perhaps would have been a threat to
46:13 them on a
46:15 hey we need to get our act together and
46:17 figure out how to live on this planet
46:19 and stuff maybe they strictly
46:20 annihilated them personally at least
46:22 you know i could wipe out the hominids
46:23 completely so there's no bigfoots
46:25 anywhere
46:27 as far as any big population of a
46:30 predator they just wipe them out or they
46:33 cut back the numbers so bad or even
46:35 genetically change them such they can't
46:37 leave the jungle they can't just be
46:39 anywhere but we can't
46:40 sort of thing right but they built
46:43 things out of
46:45 stones all over the world so let's just
46:49 say that they can
46:52 move stones i'm kind of dismissing as
46:54 well as kind of
46:56 pushing into your mind potential
46:58 possibilities but
47:00 the one thing against aliens like
47:02 literally from outer space coming down
47:04 and building all this stuff is that why
47:05 would there ever be an unfinished
47:07 obelisk
47:08 why would there ever be an unfinished
47:09 stone because with their technology
47:13 maybe i'm over assuming they should be
47:16 able to
47:17 crank these things out very quickly
47:20 again with that guy's point about the
47:22 2.3 million stones which is what i was
47:24 always told he he averaged up another
47:26 200 000
47:28 potentially is that uh
47:32 you know he said look every two and a
47:34 half minutes you put that together and
47:36 you're gonna have a long life
47:37 lifespan there so
47:41 you know it would be something that if
47:43 they couldn't
47:44 build it that quickly which that's
47:46 insanely fast no matter how what kind of
47:48 construction site you're dealing with
47:51 then it took a long time to build
47:53 doesn't have to be slaves
47:54 or anything like that sometimes people
47:56 just do good things because it's
47:58 what's cool man hey you want to build
48:00 the most amazing structure on planet
48:02 earth
48:03 world world wonder number one yeah sure
48:06 can you give me some food absolutely man
48:10 okay let's do this you know my research
48:13 into egyptology again put
48:15 the average human in egypt at the
48:18 pre-dynastic times and dynasty times at
48:21 around 70.
48:23 the pharaohs some of them have been
48:26 estimated in their mid 90s
48:29 and so you know all that stuff about us
48:32 living shorter lives it's more of a
48:34 european
48:35 bubonic plague sort of thing or maybe
48:38 even some of the rougher roman eras
48:40 where again everyone's going off to war
48:42 and dying or they don't understand how
48:43 to keep their
48:44 keep themselves clean
48:47 but there are countless boxes
48:51 in egypt and they're always called
48:54 sarcophagus
48:56 shaka for kai i guess and
48:59 you know he's like well you know they
49:01 could be they could be used as tombs but
49:03 he goes look
49:04 he puts a slide up there where he shows
49:07 an old box
49:08 and then an older box and he goes look
49:10 at this one right here he goes this
49:11 one's more recent
49:12 and it's it looks like a man did it it's
49:15 all
49:16 round it's got all there's nothing
49:18 precision about it there's no mitered
49:20 edges in or out of this thing
49:21 it looks like a bathtub created by rock
49:25 rock uh you know
49:28 hitting sort of techniques right
49:30 chiseling
49:32 and then there's this black version of a
49:34 box right next to it
49:38 which is as close to human well i mean
49:41 it's close to perfection in the universe
49:42 as you could possibly make an object it
49:44 is
49:44 perfectly mitered the the lid on the
49:48 box matt it's it's the same stone they
49:50 just somehow figured out a way to clear
49:52 cut this thing
49:54 unbelievable uh the book
49:58 that i read and i think graham hancock
50:01 has talked about there's
50:02 there is a box out there i try to find
50:04 the picture of it
50:07 and it's a perfectly minor box about the
50:09 size of your average cooler
50:12 big cooler and the box has
50:16 in fact i think it was joe brogan thing
50:18 but it has four little pegs
50:20 attached to the lid and then the body of
50:22 the box
50:24 has four little inlets where these
50:26 notches will come down
50:28 he said the crazy part was and he had
50:30 these zoomed up photographs what i saw
50:32 he put the lid down on the box
50:34 and when they looked at the the geology
50:37 of the rock
50:38 really really close the composition of
50:40 the rock they found
50:42 like a circle of some of the embedded
50:45 pattern that was continuous between the
50:48 two
50:49 sides as if something laser cut this
50:51 thing clean across but was able to leave
50:53 the
50:54 pigs so imagine that how do you create a
50:57 peg
50:57 inside of a rock down below by etching
51:00 from the outside
51:02 i mean it's like it's mind-blowing
51:04 technology right
51:07 but he said that if you don't spin a
51:09 diamond bit
51:10 at the same rpm with a motor
51:14 he goes it will not look correct which
51:17 means they had
51:18 some sort of motor that was constant
51:23 well those of you who have looked at
51:25 these hieroglyphs which
51:27 appear to show
51:30 like a like like an assistant to the um
51:34 furrow which they'll always call a slave
51:36 he's holding these big giant light bulb
51:38 things and they're big giant
51:40 uh looks like if the dude was six foot
51:42 this thing is probably eight foot
51:44 and inside there's like a serpent
51:46 wiggling
51:48 to the center of this bulb looking
51:50 object
51:51 very much like a filament in an old
51:53 edison light bulb
51:56 and it looks like these things were
51:57 lights
51:59 now today if you were to make a bulb out
52:01 of our current technology and try to
52:03 hold it want to be
52:04 so blinding you would you know have to
52:07 drop it run away
52:08 but it would also be so thermally hot
52:10 that you couldn't hold it
52:12 so i think we need to dial back our
52:15 interpretation of what a bulb would be
52:16 if these are indeed bulbs because what
52:18 would you be doing holding
52:20 these and they're all over the place and
52:22 some of these hieroglyphs collections
52:25 these big bulb things with these big
52:26 serpents in the center
52:28 it couldn't be that bright you know
52:30 bright enough or hell maybe just the tip
52:32 of the tongue of that serpent is the
52:33 part that's shiny
52:35 and just remember serpent worship is all
52:37 over the world
52:39 uh the pharaohs put the cobra right over
52:41 their third eye
52:44 and we know dragons are in china and
52:47 japan and there are plenty of serpent
52:50 statues in south america
52:52 and so obviously it was a formidable
52:54 creature
52:56 and to claim any sort of symbolic
52:58 dominance over the
53:00 [Music]
53:02 one of the sneakiest predators right a
53:04 bike can kill you
53:05 cleopatra or boob bit right
53:09 and by the way what is it charlotte
53:11 johansson is playing cleopatra in the
53:13 new movie
53:14 and this new round of protest is coming
53:17 out
53:18 how dare a white girl play cleopatra she
53:20 was a black lady
53:23 and i hate to inform anyone who believes
53:24 that cleopatra was a ninth generation
53:27 ptolemy roman white girl
53:29 okay really sorry study your history
53:31 okay
53:33 but now the book that i have has all
53:36 kinds of amazing edge work
53:40 that when i have to do 3d and i'm doing
53:42 like a pillar
53:43 or some wild you know spaceship thing
53:46 that's on the wall
53:49 there are tools to create these
53:50 beautiful beveled edges
53:52 as well as mitered edges and
53:57 the the easy one to do just so that you
54:01 know
54:01 is a perfect in tools of today okay is a
54:04 perfect 90 degree angle because a lot of
54:06 tools that are made to do
54:07 mitered 90 degree angles uh doing a
54:10 bevel
54:11 a nice kind of graduated curve right
54:14 pretty easy with the tools that we have
54:16 today
54:17 what is not easy today
54:21 is to create an organic or organic curve
54:25 that has a bevel to it
54:28 meaning like if you were to do a statue
54:30 of a woman lying down
54:31 okay so that amazing profile of a
54:34 woman's body you know from her shoulders
54:36 down to her waist up over her
54:38 hip down her thigh a few changes in
54:40 territory trajectory from the thigh of
54:42 the leg to the foot
54:44 that's why people are master sculptors
54:47 and
54:49 modelers and stuff because that's hard
54:51 okay
54:53 well when we look at the the full-blown
54:56 statues
54:57 that the egyptians put together this
54:59 very african
55:01 composite of the face
55:04 they're doing they're doing exactly that
55:07 but again researchers have now
55:09 discovered that their discipline for
55:11 creating the human form
55:13 was always to embed pie wherever you
55:16 possibly could it was as if it was an
55:18 addiction to them to use spheres and
55:20 circles
55:20 and and even if they needed to change
55:23 the trajectory all to the trajectories
55:25 would fall into some other sphere that's
55:27 a part of the overall face
55:30 the level of just ingenuity to come up
55:33 with that
55:33 discipline prior to actually executing
55:37 it
55:38 on a head and some of these heads are 12
55:40 foot wide
55:41 you know 10 feet tall and you can take
55:43 them in photoshop
55:44 straight on picture cut one of the half
55:47 the face off throw it away and then
55:49 mirror the other side of the face and it
55:50 looks perfect and it matches up with the
55:52 part you threw away
55:54 what's exciting about this whole thing
55:56 is what the hell was going on
55:58 on earth prior to all of the
56:03 seemingly primitive cultures that
56:05 swelled up that became us
56:08 how did we lose all this tech
56:12 he goes off to peru and it wasn't on
56:16 machu picchu i forget the name of the
56:17 place he's kind of bouncing around quite
56:18 a bit
56:19 into some places he said that even the
56:20 locals didn't know existed
56:23 and it matched everything i had seen
56:25 before and everything i've ever told you
56:28 i have an episode called monolithic
56:30 structures i believe is the name of it
56:33 but it uh they have these amazing stones
56:37 right
56:39 and they're from far away that's another
56:42 thing means
56:43 just the whole idea of just moving a
56:45 stone
56:46 is one whole mystery that these guys
56:50 don't have time
56:53 or a methodology to even they haven't
56:56 found the thread to pull the sweater out
56:57 just yet
56:59 okay you can you can go with those old
57:01 theories when i was a kid that they
57:02 rolled um
57:03 a couple theories was that they put logs
57:05 down
57:06 and then you just keep putting a log in
57:08 front of the stone and just keep rolling
57:09 okay you know a thousand tons though
57:13 what that log made out of you know
57:16 the other one is this uh there is a
57:18 hieroglyph
57:20 of this but it's not pre-dynastic
57:23 hieroglyph unfortunately which is this
57:25 notion that you can
57:27 and i've seen it try to be simulated and
57:29 it's sort of a huge joke
57:31 that if you have a sled with a big heavy
57:33 stone on it
57:35 i think the smallest stones on the
57:37 pyramids
57:39 can survive this theory but it is so
57:41 illogical and
57:43 uh we'll just go through it you put it
57:45 on a sled
57:46 and then you pour water on the sand in
57:49 front of the blades
57:50 of the sled there's like a sled the
57:52 santa rides right
57:53 and you can pull it along the sand
57:58 okay this is definitely a lusher area
58:01 back then than it is today the nile has
58:04 actually moved
58:05 several miles since back in those days
58:06 which we can see
58:08 geologically speaking but i mean that's
58:11 a lot of haul and water man you know for
58:13 one stone
58:14 it is going to be sand at one point you
58:16 know and you're
58:17 that's the theory you're pouring it on
58:18 sand and so sand's going to eat up
58:20 water like crazy so how do you have this
58:23 constant flow of
58:24 water without an aqueduct without some
58:27 tubes
58:28 you know that are very malleable so you
58:30 can move them around and spray them
58:31 you'd have to have buckets and buckets
58:33 of
58:33 millions of these buckets man you have
58:35 to have a row taking them back to the
58:37 to the nile and back up i'm not saying
58:40 it's impossible but
58:42 there does come a point where sand goes
58:44 away and now you're on the plateau
58:47 okay and then the plateau goes away
58:49 because you're
58:50 starting to move the stone higher and
58:51 higher and higher
58:53 on the pyramid yeah sure
58:56 you could do levers and you know
58:58 potentially some
58:59 some theories about how this works i
59:02 think that what those
59:03 theories lack is any theory of
59:06 efficiency that would last
59:10 like if you slowed down the process
59:12 remember the guy said
59:13 two and a half every two and a half
59:14 minutes you'd have to put a stone down
59:17 to finish a pyramid for kofu or you know
59:21 any one of these guys that says they
59:22 built the pyramids
59:23 they're going to be dead before the
59:25 thing is finished so if you start
59:26 introducing
59:27 levers and pulleys and all this other
59:29 stuff
59:31 then you're talking about a mess it's
59:34 going to slow down every stone to like
59:36 hours so you can't finish this thing in
59:39 a hundred years now
59:40 because you've got a big problem so i'm
59:43 going to throw out you know one more
59:45 sort of theory before we move on uh
59:47 which i have
59:49 sort of mentioned i think in a more
59:50 brutal manner because it was occurring
59:52 to me during the episode
59:53 but um what if you had a time machine
59:57 you go back
59:59 and uh they're there you know you're not
60:01 sure what year it started but you go
60:02 there and they're fresh they're nice
60:04 they look really good and the people are
60:06 definitely not the
60:07 current egyptians it's the pre-egyptians
60:10 pre-dynastic period
60:11 folks and you go do you know how these
60:14 things were built
60:16 oh yeah totally well how how you move
60:19 these big heavy rocks
60:21 and they look at you kind of funny let's
60:24 see what do you mean
60:25 well these things are like really heavy
60:27 how the hell did you move them there's
60:28 millions of them in there
60:31 what do you mean by heavy when they go
60:34 up and they grab a rock
60:36 that should weigh four or five hundred
60:38 pounds right and they just hand it to
60:39 you
60:40 like you mean that and you're holding
60:43 this rock
60:44 and back in their era didn't weigh as
60:46 much
60:48 but how's that possible am i just making
60:50 something up
60:52 no the idea is
60:56 if the earth was a little early in its
61:00 development
61:04 it has to do with you know a bit of that
61:06 coral castle guys
61:08 my theory on his thing but what if the
61:10 world was burping
61:12 through a meridian line energy
61:16 energy that flowed up out of the bottom
61:19 of the earth or the center of the earth
61:24 and it just so happened to resonate with
61:25 with those particular rocks
61:27 the limestones of the world because
61:29 cruel castle is actually technically a
61:30 limestone
61:34 and maybe granite's affected as well
61:37 and these stones just aren't as heavy as
61:39 they
61:40 are today who knows you know again we
61:43 don't know when these things were built
61:46 and again no glacier is going to be
61:47 reaching
61:49 egypt no matter what theory they give
61:51 you about the ice age it's not going to
61:52 reach
61:53 in fact this guy this brian forrester
61:55 guy if anything
61:57 his his issue is fire
62:01 now the fire thing is super interesting
62:04 the way that he has filmed the rock
62:05 because he shows you these amazing
62:08 scorches on the rock and he quotes this
62:11 um geological data that said essentially
62:15 this rock
62:16 and a couple different um structures
62:20 both structures and statues flight
62:23 it started flaking off almost like
62:26 you're
62:27 peeling paint off of you know some other
62:30 structure
62:31 where the structure's made of one thing
62:32 paint's made of paint
62:34 and he said look in order for this to
62:36 start flaking you have to expose this
62:38 particular type of rock to a thousand
62:40 degrees celsius or higher
62:42 to get this star sort of erosion to
62:44 occur
62:45 and i'll be damned man he filmed temples
62:48 he filmed rocks on the ground that are
62:50 you know
62:50 broken off from something else statues
62:53 that have been knocked down
62:54 obelisks and they're just some of them
62:57 have these
62:58 massive scorching on them now if our
63:00 rockets fallen down and moved around we
63:01 don't know what angle it was at when it
63:03 all occurred but for the
63:04 structures that are there it appears
63:08 that a blast came from a particular
63:11 direction
63:12 and nail i don't want to say the
63:13 direction that's one of the
63:16 south north east west
63:19 angles and not the other ones
63:23 it doesn't account for in any way shape
63:24 or form these tools
63:27 now one of the other big tools that we
63:29 see
63:30 is and we see it all over the place we
63:32 seem to see it in petra we seem to
63:35 see it in peru our circular saws
63:39 with apparently some sort of diamond
63:42 level 10 hardness bit
63:45 that is just eating up these stones like
63:47 no problem
63:51 that's a little strange the bigger
63:54 the diameter of the cuts and i have seen
63:57 in the book i have
63:58 like massive diameters of what these
64:00 blades would have to be
64:01 we're talking about like a table saw
64:04 turns sideways or turns straight up and
64:05 down or whatever and it's cutting these
64:07 things
64:09 and it would be gosh you're talking
64:11 about some of these blades being
64:13 anywhere from six feet to ten feet in
64:14 diameter
64:17 but there are plenty of rocks at these
64:19 structures
64:21 that have absolutely no
64:24 cut marks whatsoever but they're most
64:26 definitely cut he
64:27 he showed this per meridian stone which
64:30 is the
64:30 tippy top stone to a pyramid it's got
64:32 all four sides on it's like a little
64:34 mini pyramid you put it on the top
64:37 they had found the egyptians had found
64:39 this
64:40 perfectly black polished stone
64:44 i mean it was unbelievably beautiful
64:48 polished and he said look for you to
64:51 polish this stone to have this sheen on
64:54 it and all the edges are perfectly
64:55 beveled just
64:56 beautiful tiny bevel down the side
65:00 because once you polish it like that its
65:01 structural integrity is huge you know if
65:03 you have a little cut
65:04 into the stone surface to its raw
65:08 unfinished surface then water can get in
65:11 there air can get in there just erosion
65:13 can occur
65:15 but then it had a little band of
65:18 hieroglyph across the bottom
65:20 he said look at the hieroglyphs the
65:22 hieroglyphs are really primitive
65:23 i mean just they do they look like
65:25 crayon versions of
65:27 the other stuff this is i'm going to
65:30 tell you right now he goes that was put
65:31 on
65:31 after they found the stone because
65:34 whoever has the technology to create
65:36 this stone
65:37 is way ahead of this crappy etching on
65:39 the bottom
65:42 now so far he hasn't mentioned anything
65:43 about the pyramids having colors
65:46 i'll be very interested when he
65:47 hopefully loops back to the pyramids
65:49 if he actually acknowledges that
65:52 but he gets over to peru and what's cool
65:55 about the peruvians
65:56 is that in all the research i've seen
66:00 they immediately say
66:03 we didn't create that we created that
66:05 repair
66:06 so you have this beautiful wall you know
66:09 and again
66:09 machu picchu is supposed to have
66:11 corridors where for
66:12 years they just looked at them and said
66:16 this is amazing there's no mortar
66:17 between these
66:18 rocks they fit so perfectly they look
66:20 like
66:21 they look like they were one rock and
66:23 then someone just created
66:24 faux indentations that they were
66:27 actually individual rocks that they're
66:29 not individual blocks but they
66:30 absolutely are and they're like
66:32 three feet thick and it's perfect all
66:34 the way through
66:36 but a dude who was researching that said
66:38 um
66:39 he finally noticed that when he was in
66:41 the corridor
66:43 and looking around just trying to find
66:44 something new you know
66:46 he looks left sees a pattern and then he
66:49 looks right
66:50 and he sees the inverse pattern the
66:51 other side mirror imaging
66:54 the corridor meaning if you've ever
66:57 looked at one of those machu picchu
66:58 walls
67:00 you would think that oh you know okay it
67:02 looks like it's really hard but they're
67:04 randomly picking rocks and you know
67:06 it's got to have a certain size and
67:08 they're doing this cut
67:09 technique and they just kind of fit it
67:12 on top of the other rock
67:15 absolutely not it's very specifically a
67:18 pattern
67:19 to create an earthquake proof wall
67:23 because that already shakes a lot the
67:26 other
67:26 just you know amazing thing that you'll
67:29 see a lot in peru
67:30 are these mitered windows doorways
67:35 a lot of the doorways are kind of
67:36 trapezoidy you know so the top of the
67:39 door
67:40 um the width is a little bit smaller
67:43 than the bottom so it kind of creates
67:44 this cool angle
67:46 from an architectural standpoint that is
67:49 essentially a square arch
67:51 it is a great design to distribute
67:54 weight
67:55 uh and vectors so that they don't you
67:57 know come to a point and just blow up a
67:59 particular part of the structure
68:01 but in his photographs he has these burn
68:04 marks on the walls
68:05 here and there and you know most of us
68:08 would look at burn marks on the wall and
68:10 just go and maybe they had just a
68:11 campfire right here maybe they had a
68:12 torch on the wall right there
68:15 where the hell they would have put it i
68:16 don't know and so for you know
68:18 a century or two maybe they just put a
68:20 fire right there
68:22 but what he proves by analyzing the rock
68:26 and then studying how the rock got
68:28 damaged by the fire
68:29 he's letting you know that this requires
68:32 massive temperatures
68:34 you know at kelm level which the torch
68:37 is never going to get to kelm level it
68:38 would melt itself
68:40 and these are external structures
68:42 outside
68:44 now the other thing that if you study
68:47 inca
68:48 technology and pre-inca technology you
68:51 will always see a beautiful wall
68:54 that's this crazy amazing architecture
68:56 and some of it's uh pillowed
68:57 it's a pillow bevel embossment so these
69:00 rocks are not only fit together
69:02 but they kind of have a pillowy soft
69:05 very
69:05 nice aesthetic right
69:08 and then if you look up a wall usually
69:12 if
69:12 there's been any damage to the wall any
69:14 rocks that are missing
69:16 you will have uh these just like people
69:20 just setting stones down you know it
69:22 looks like you and me
69:23 fixing a wall and the incas that are
69:25 there were like yeah that's us
69:27 right there that's how it's doing those
69:28 repairs all that other beautiful stuff
69:30 is from the culture that we don't know
69:32 anything about
69:34 so what's nice about peru is that
69:36 they're
69:37 up front about what they made and
69:39 upfront about what they discovered
69:41 whereas egypt tries to take credit for
69:42 everything but doesn't have any of the
69:44 technology today
69:45 to do it now peru has the technology
69:48 that matches their repairs right
69:52 egypt is in the stone ages compared to
69:54 what the technology was to build the
69:56 pyramids
69:59 but now these black boxes so i told you
70:02 about some black boxes in these uh
70:04 tunnels
70:07 the other black boxes they found were in
70:10 these catacombs underneath the giza
70:12 plateau
70:13 which dropped gosh like um
70:19 several hundred feet down under the
70:22 ground
70:23 and so these catacombs aren't just like
70:26 holes dug in the ground
70:28 right it's not just like you and i
70:29 digging a well and then oh let's just
70:30 lower ourselves down in there and the
70:31 rocket cave in on us right
70:33 no these are
70:38 you know mitered big ass
70:41 stones that create the
70:45 shaft that you go down inside of he said
70:47 some of these
70:49 shafts are like you know 16 by 16 feet
70:51 which is a trim and then the walls and
70:53 who knows how deep the walls are maybe
70:54 they're three feet thick
70:57 but it's just again that classic
70:59 asymmetric
71:00 amazing design all the way down and it
71:03 seems like it has
71:04 logic to it you know they it well
71:07 i guess in america today if you were to
71:08 ask a mason to come create a wall for
71:10 you and he's a really great mason
71:13 if they want to do the um corner of your
71:16 house they're going to
71:17 stack rocks you know one over the other
71:19 to create the corner
71:20 but they're all going to be the same
71:22 size brick right
71:25 what the pre-dynasty people did
71:29 was they actually created corner rocks
71:32 rocks that actually
71:34 change directions or it's all one rock
71:35 it's like a corner rock it's almost like
71:37 a corner piece of a puzzle
71:39 it's only ever going to be the corner
71:40 piece you can't ever put the corner
71:41 piece anywhere else in the center right
71:43 so that just shows a tremendous amount
71:46 of planning
71:48 and just architecture man if you see
71:50 this stuff and then you go i have a big
71:52 deal
71:53 because today i see it all over the
71:54 place but you don't but even if you were
71:56 to come to that false conclusion like a
71:58 lot of us do
72:00 then you have to go back to 10 000 bc
72:01 and go okay
72:03 they did it right there now
72:06 how many centuries millennia
72:09 did it take for them to get to the
72:11 architectural knowledge
72:13 to even attempt it in the first place
72:16 and so again you know that's why i don't
72:19 keep the ice age out of the conversation
72:21 because this was a pristine perfect
72:23 place to start
72:24 a civilization i don't care if you're an
72:26 alien dropping us off as cousins
72:29 or hybrids spliced or if we just happen
72:31 genetically
72:33 something amazing took place a long long
72:36 time ago
72:38 but he gets to the bottom of the shaft
72:39 which i believe was over like
72:41 almost 60 a couple over 100 drops so
72:44 they're almost 300 feet underneath the
72:46 ground
72:47 i got that number right
72:50 and there's a black box down there
72:54 and you're like what one of those big
72:57 giant
72:57 thousand ton black boxes is down there
73:02 and you know there's this weird black
73:03 box black box worship you know when they
73:05 do mecca
73:06 there's the black box in the center uh
73:09 which is
73:10 what they call it the arab spring right
73:12 there's the black box they all walk
73:13 around
73:14 and inside that they're supposed to be
73:16 another
73:17 like meteorite that's down underneath
73:19 there that's what they're actually
73:20 worshiping
73:22 i don't know what the acidic jews
73:25 are doing but they do have a ritual
73:26 where they wear little black boxes on
73:28 their foreheads
73:30 so it's like something something going
73:33 on there some
73:33 ancient stuff and again for those of you
73:36 who are
73:36 really into the planetary theories that
73:39 there's life on all the planets
73:40 um it's called saturn worship
73:44 even though nasa's screwed up and
73:46 rendered a hexagon on the top of uh
73:50 saturn a long time ago which now they
73:52 have to keep that because they made a
73:53 mistake a long time ago oh we got a
73:55 clearer picture now
73:56 it's no longer hexagonal up there
73:58 because we had bad
73:59 circular mathematical algorithms
74:03 so funny then he goes to petra
74:08 and petra i i knew it had
74:11 several of these reliefs that are very
74:15 much like
74:16 um the treasury i believe i'm calling
74:19 that the right name
74:21 they've even turned one of the little
74:22 installations into a bathroom which is
74:24 kind of funny
74:25 what i didn't know was that there were
74:28 so many
74:29 so many of these things and so what he
74:31 actually
74:32 estimates which i think is pretty
74:35 dead-on but he didn't explain
74:37 all of the amazing reliefs of this thing
74:40 is that the um the treasury which has a
74:44 massive amount of ornateness in the
74:46 front
74:46 it looks like grease it looks like um
74:50 rome you know these these columns of my
74:52 my big question about
74:54 petra is what the hell were you
74:56 emulating when this was created if this
74:58 is an ancient
74:59 place then how come it looks like
75:03 you know greece or rome so he he has an
75:06 explanation that they actually
75:07 when they found this location of petra
75:11 with you know hundreds of these inlets
75:14 carved out of the of the stone and we're
75:16 talking about
75:17 you know the average room in one of
75:19 these like if you were to go into the
75:21 treasury and you go into the back he
75:22 says there's a room back there with
75:24 360 000 cubic feet
75:28 behind the treasury inside and then he
75:31 goes what's even more remarkable is
75:32 there's another chamber below this
75:34 chamber it's another 300 000 plus cubic
75:38 feet
75:40 it's just like you know and so
75:43 the big question is why do these things
75:45 exist
75:47 you know the pyramids we can say energy
75:50 source
75:50 the temples according to the locals are
75:53 actually hospitals
75:54 or dwellings but
75:57 petra um he starts looking at the stone
76:01 and he starts just very easily right in
76:03 front of your face
76:04 he's he starts um
76:08 showing you the difference between what
76:10 probably
76:12 the locals found and started repairing
76:15 as well as hiring people from europe to
76:17 come and do additional repairs
76:19 and then there's this weird thing he
76:22 says
76:23 fairly nonchalantly because he's so
76:26 immersed in this i don't think it's a
76:27 big deal to him but to me it was a big
76:29 deal he said you know
76:31 and i take it this guy's been all over
76:33 the world he said um
76:36 every time that these cultures find
76:38 something
76:39 a pre-existing ancient culture
76:42 he said they they will
76:46 worship it they'll clean it up they'll
76:48 restore whatever they possibly can
76:51 and live in it and the big question
76:55 there
76:55 is why
76:59 you know and you might think well of
77:02 course they would do that i mean it's
77:03 amazing right
77:04 well yeah that's probably a big part of
77:06 it
77:07 but what if you and i found a
77:10 pre-existing
77:11 let's say you and i find atlantis we
77:14 find atlantis and it's there's no one
77:16 there anymore
77:18 and a bunch of it's still okay and a
77:19 bunch of it's damaged
77:21 well the reason why we would want to
77:24 improve it
77:25 would be probably emergency repairs make
77:29 sure nothing falls
77:30 maybe even hurts us but two because we
77:33 know
77:35 this is a sacred place that an amazing
77:38 culture created this because we know we
77:41 didn't
77:43 and you would restore it now the
77:45 restorations are always extremely
77:48 evident because
77:51 they're bad i mean hats off to them for
77:54 trying to make it better
77:56 but it's always just absolutely
77:58 noticeable he just showed photograph
77:59 after photo you know
78:00 he must have went through three dozen
78:01 photographs of petra
78:05 and you can just see you start
78:06 developing the eye for it and he teaches
78:08 you and you start oh yeah i can totally
78:09 see
78:10 and then he starts to show you the
78:11 erosion and he said that petra
78:15 has flash floods to this day and so he
78:17 goes the floods are about
78:19 get anywhere from six to ten feet deep
78:21 and so you will have for the first six
78:23 to ten feet
78:24 of a lot of locations that are elevated
78:26 uh clear water erosion
78:29 and he says that um he says horizontal
78:33 erosion is typically sand
78:34 and wind he said vertical erosion
78:38 is almost always um
78:42 uh water running down
78:46 and that's how we know that the the
78:49 sphinx is so old and of course you know
78:53 um
78:54 the we have to play this game
78:57 i think petra is technically in jordan
79:00 but we have to play this game
79:02 where you don't insult the locals too
79:04 much
79:05 with new theories because they'll start
79:07 shutting you down because you're
79:08 removing their
79:10 usception of other people's
79:12 accomplishments
79:14 and this is i don't know if any place
79:16 more prevalent
79:18 than egypt of this particular situation
79:21 and you may have genuine people that are
79:23 simply raised with that knowledge and
79:26 and then they just you know you just
79:27 resist what you don't want to hear
79:29 so it could be a portion of that
79:31 involved as well
79:34 but there were you know inlets
79:37 at a frequency that does look like
79:42 it could be dwellings but the big
79:45 question
79:46 is wow this is a tremendous amount of
79:50 work
79:50 to create a home and so
79:54 you know is it dresden or this petra is
79:57 full of like all of the
79:59 architects all the people that invent
80:01 this stuff and so
80:03 you know if you go into like in my
80:04 community if you go to the
80:06 neighborhood which has a lot of our
80:08 immigrants from mexico
80:10 their lawns are perfect their houses are
80:12 perfect because that's what they do they
80:13 make those things
80:14 they polish all day long other people
80:16 stop so they polish their own too right
80:18 so perhaps maybe
80:22 it does look like the further that he
80:23 said that the funny thing about
80:25 petra is that you they said that you'll
80:28 walk about a mile in to get to the
80:30 treasury
80:31 and he goes people just walk in that
80:33 mile see the treasury and turn and leave
80:36 and he goes there's six more miles
80:39 and he says those six more miles are
80:41 everything when you're trying to figure
80:43 out what the hell this place is
80:44 which most people aren't right you
80:46 understand
80:48 they do have installations also in petra
80:52 where
80:52 they've simply dug out that 300 000
80:55 square foot
80:56 or cubic foot excuse me um
80:57 [Music]
80:59 and there's nothing there in fact
81:01 there's no veneer on the outside you
81:02 don't have to walk through
81:04 a fake building to get in it's just a
81:06 big perfect square
81:08 uh cut into the side of the mountain and
81:10 he took this photograph of his wife
81:13 for scale showing how big the room was
81:15 and it was
81:16 it was oh gosh i mean it must have been
81:18 30 foot ceilings at least
81:21 and here's the thing here's the thing
81:23 just blows the mind to
81:24 pieces sorry i got mosquitoes in there i
81:26 gotta keep what
81:28 look in the moy i'm not trying to wave
81:31 to everybody
81:32 but the edges of this room are perfectly
81:35 mitered
81:37 the back wall the ceiling all mitered
81:40 beautiful and because the stone is so
81:42 gorgeous when it's cutting you know
81:44 cross-section
81:45 ceilings like this swirl of all this
81:47 crazy rock
81:49 i mean give me a break some people i
81:51 guess live in these dwellings as it's
81:53 allowed by the jordanian government
81:56 way at the end so
82:00 so it was a goat farmer there that keeps
82:02 his goats inside
82:05 one of the buildings with the erosion
82:07 towards the last
82:09 half of petra is extremely telling
82:12 because you might have somebody look at
82:14 something and say oh look at that
82:16 erosion
82:16 on the rock behind it surrounds the
82:19 sphinx
82:21 and you might look at that now well
82:22 maybe not maybe but you know
82:25 the erosion of petra in the last five
82:28 miles
82:29 is so evident that you have
82:33 stone and by the way petra is
82:36 apparently um
82:39 sandstone which would be extremely easy
82:41 to etch with bronze
82:43 but his wife i guess is the geologist on
82:46 his team and he said that she said that
82:48 this said i forgot the name of what is
82:49 translated into a um
82:54 a sedimentary sandstone which is
82:57 a level seven stone now because i guess
83:00 it's been you know it's been on earth
83:02 for so long that i guess it just keeps
83:03 settling and settling on a microscopic
83:05 level
83:06 to the point it hits a seven and she
83:08 goes this is not
83:09 sandstone you know you just feel it it's
83:11 not sandstone sandstone
83:12 literally you could just etch it with
83:14 your finger you wouldn't be able to
83:16 tourists there because they would be
83:17 able to scrape something off
83:19 everywhere they went apparently again
83:20 you're not allowed to go inside the
83:22 indiana jones one anymore for just
83:25 erosion purposes
83:26 which is smart of them but these
83:30 openings which again closer to the
83:32 treasury
83:33 or more mitered the etchings are sorry
83:36 the openings
83:37 that in the last five miles it starts
83:40 getting super
83:41 round and it's all erosion
83:44 which is fantastic for us because it
83:46 starts to give us the indication of how
83:48 old these rocks are
83:50 and i know that there's a lot of um
83:53 scientists claiming that they can age
83:55 the patina on a rock
83:57 because that's very handy for people
83:58 that want to keep stonehenge really
84:00 really old
84:02 and a bunch of other sites you know
84:05 these things
84:06 come into vogue they age a bunch of
84:10 stuff
84:10 and then 10 20 years later they're like
84:13 oh yeah that technology was all crap
84:15 you know it wasn't really what we
84:17 thought it was and so we don't know how
84:19 old all this stuff is but erosion is
84:21 amazing because erosion is mathematical
84:24 it takes a certain number of years to
84:26 create
84:28 this certain type of massive erosion
84:30 that's in petra and he actually filmed
84:32 a plaque took a picture of this plaque
84:34 which was saying that
84:36 one of the structures he was looking at
84:38 was created in 25
84:41 bc to 2080 somewhere in there
84:46 which you know it's 2000 years so you
84:49 know
84:49 it's definitely going to account for a
84:51 little bit of erosion but again
84:53 he keeps taking pictures all the way up
84:55 this trail and he starts to show you
84:57 that
84:58 the romans showed up and created certain
84:59 structures his very
85:01 um key ways for instance we all know
85:03 that romans and the greeks when they
85:05 created pillars they created
85:07 slices of pillars and kept stacking them
85:09 up on each other right
85:10 create the parthenon they never were
85:12 creating a full
85:14 pillar out of one piece of stone one it
85:17 gets massively heavy
85:19 and uh you know just where do you find
85:21 that kind of pristine stone the whole
85:23 time anyway
85:26 he showed this one inlet which wasn't um
85:29 terribly large but i think it was
85:31 probably uh
85:33 12 feet um high with the inlet that went
85:36 in about another 12 feet at least
85:38 probably a little bit more net but there
85:40 was five pillars
85:42 holding up this edge
85:45 and he goes um these look identical
85:48 right
85:49 and you're looking at him and you know
85:50 at the casual glance you're like yeah
85:52 yeah
85:53 and he says well the three pillars on
85:55 the right are
85:56 original pillars carved out of the stone
85:58 it was actually
86:00 a part of the stone above and the stone
86:02 below so they weren't moved into place
86:03 they were start
86:04 you know carved straight out of there
86:05 because the two on the left
86:07 were restored probably by the romans
86:11 because the two on the left are stepped
86:14 pillars of you know cylinder cylinder
86:17 cylinder cylinder
86:19 so immediately you see the seams and
86:23 you're like oh yeah oh my gosh they did
86:24 an amazing job making these other two
86:26 look like the other three
86:29 and then he starts taking close-up
86:30 pictures of the other three
86:32 and you start to see this raking
86:36 tool that they were using to create this
86:38 perfect roundness
86:42 the thing is is you know and again i
86:45 i coming as a complete
86:47 [Music]
86:49 neophyte to carving stone with uh
86:52 tools but it seems as if the
86:57 you know pillars are never
87:01 like you make them in 3d as a novice
87:03 where you have the same
87:04 diameter all the way up the pillar you
87:06 look at an egyptian pillar for instance
87:09 ones especially to hold up the temples
87:11 they're
87:12 they're tapered you know they have a
87:14 really thick base and then they kind of
87:15 get
87:16 lighter and lighter as they go up not
87:18 too much but a little bit
87:19 and of course you have all kinds of um
87:21 palm plumes and stuff etched in there
87:26 and so i don't know how a human being
87:29 creates these objects with utter
87:32 perfection
87:33 the the raking on the pillars looks a
87:36 lot like
87:38 uh this is a silly analogy but it's it's
87:41 what i thought of when i thought about
87:42 okay looks like
87:43 maybe use machines to make this thing
87:46 you know the
87:47 the machines that strip um
87:50 trees in the forest for for
87:54 lumber you know creation they'll grab
87:57 the tree
87:58 and they slice off the bottoms big blade
88:00 goes boom and chops it up and then it
88:02 sucks it through
88:03 this conveyor belt it's a part of this
88:05 machine it just strips off all the
88:06 branches and now you have this perfect
88:08 telephone pole ready to go
88:10 it almost looks like something of that
88:12 nature
88:13 with these diamond bits that is just
88:16 simply stripping this
88:17 apart because the interesting thing
88:21 about the pillars and their etchings was
88:23 that
88:24 if you truly had all this um
88:28 easy peasy sandstone you wouldn't have
88:30 any etch marks
88:31 because you might etch away with a
88:32 coarse tool and all you got to do is
88:35 just take some stones when i was a
88:37 little kid in kansas there's a ton of
88:39 sandstone it's one of the most fun rocks
88:41 to play with as a child because you can
88:43 get a piece of sandstone
88:45 and carve it into a car in just a few
88:47 minutes you know
88:48 it was always brilliant to play with and
88:51 it was always super smooth you could get
88:53 another sandstone
88:54 and carve a sandstone with it or
88:56 especially if you got a heavy rock
88:58 no problem because sandstone is very
89:00 pliable i guarantee if petrol was made
89:03 of sandstone petrol would be
89:07 just destroyed it would have fallen
89:08 apart and definitely if anything was
89:11 still in place you wouldn't be able to
89:12 humans buy it because
89:14 you know it could fall
89:18 so i'm going through this documentary
89:22 it's just blowing my mind it's nice to
89:25 know
89:25 because i create well i do you know
89:29 research like any of you
89:30 i go deep into these subjects and then i
89:33 get a little concerned that
89:35 you know maybe i latched on to something
89:37 that
89:38 doesn't really pan out but to see a
89:42 i don't even know when this was
89:43 published it just came across my feed
89:45 yesterday and i locked it in
89:46 to watch it later
89:50 to see that this is still moving forward
89:52 that this
89:54 you know these early archaeologists are
89:57 helping
89:58 the world open their minds so that we
90:01 can get to the next theory
90:03 because at some point we have to
90:06 i mean there's there's two sides to the
90:08 equation
90:09 which um brian is extremely good at
90:12 reinforcing as he goes to the
90:14 presentation hopefully there's a big
90:15 grand finale which i can bring to you
90:18 at a future time again you're gonna have
90:19 a chance to watch this
90:21 today because i'm gonna link it down
90:23 below but again seven hours so depending
90:24 on your
90:25 regiment it's gonna take a few days to
90:27 get through it
90:29 but do you have fabrication questions
90:33 and fabrication questions have to do
90:35 with
90:36 um why and then how
90:40 and then you have use utilitarian
90:44 questions
90:45 why why did you make these things again
90:48 pyramids if they're truly what we think
90:50 they are today big power sources that's
90:52 great
90:53 why is petra like petra why is machu
90:56 picchu like machu picchu and all these
90:58 other things
91:00 one of the things he did in peru by the
91:01 way was he found a lot of
91:04 what looked like uh well definitely um
91:06 inca
91:08 walls and things where they're really
91:10 just you know rock stacked up on each
91:12 other what they call dry stacking
91:14 and then in the center of like a wall
91:17 that they may have built
91:18 was a pre-inca structure where
91:21 it's it's a little home but these rocks
91:24 are perfectly mitered
91:26 you know perfectly smooth and you know
91:28 in
91:29 my egyptology um
91:32 experience you know you have a rock that
91:34 might be
91:36 60 feet long with less than a 500 of an
91:39 inch
91:40 deviation is surface
91:43 okay take an inch and try to cut that
91:45 baby into 500 pieces
91:46 good luck i'm gonna have to use some
91:50 microscopic uh carbohydrate to do it or
91:52 something i don't know i mean it's like
91:54 it's gonna be really tough to
91:55 do five hundredths of an inch but that's
91:58 how perfect these guys were
92:02 um then you know like he's saying that
92:05 this black rock which i forgot has a
92:07 name i
92:07 i'll maybe show it on the screen it has
92:10 um
92:13 it comes from a long ways away and
92:16 you know there's this thing of like
92:19 why i mean they could think about the
92:22 logistics
92:23 of the whole thing so you're a pharaoh
92:26 in egypt
92:27 so do you leave egypt or not i mean
92:29 you're the guy in charge
92:30 leaving egypt back in the day was not
92:32 like i'm just gonna go on a little day
92:34 trip i'm gonna get on a
92:35 g5 i'm gonna fly to london eat lunch
92:37 come back home because i'm super rich
92:40 if you left you left for weeks
92:43 and so someone
92:46 has got to leave egypt like as a citizen
92:50 find this crazy rock
92:53 that's extremely heavy and really
92:57 hard right seven or above and then
93:00 get a sample of it someone will break
93:03 off right and you bring it back to the
93:04 pharaoh and you go man
93:06 you know that black box collection you'd
93:08 like to create you know well look at
93:09 this
93:10 i can get a bunch of this and the barrel
93:13 is gonna be sitting there going
93:16 okay that that looks awesome uh how far
93:19 away is this
93:21 oh it's like it's like six months away
93:23 you know whatever it takes to travel to
93:25 turkey
93:26 let's just say they got it from there
93:27 he's not sure where it comes from
93:29 and then how heavy is this going to be
93:30 oh man it's going to be like a thousand
93:32 times to 2000 tons
93:35 it'd be great what's the pharaoh gonna
93:37 say
93:38 what year is it you know 20 000 bc
93:42 30 000 bc 40 000 bc sure yeah i'll send
93:46 a couple of my
93:46 my cousins are really strong
93:50 it's not going to happen you know where
93:53 is someone going to say well can't we
93:54 make out of something that's in our
93:55 backyard
93:56 oh but you deserve the best sir it's
93:59 like
94:01 i find those decisions to be just as
94:04 baffling as how the pyramids were built
94:05 in the first place
94:06 like that someone would go and grab
94:09 these exotic
94:10 rocks that are extremely heavy and then
94:13 you're going to have to because
94:14 eventually you have to carve this thing
94:15 right
94:17 so the idea is that you're not going to
94:18 carve the black box in turkey
94:21 so ask michelangelo how big
94:24 david was before he made david out of
94:27 the rock
94:28 how heavy was it before he cut away
94:31 stone
94:32 and how heavy is david after he cut away
94:34 the stone
94:36 i've always heard in my lifetime at
94:38 least two thirds of the rock is cut away
94:40 to make any venus de milo or any statue
94:43 that you have
94:44 you always need more rock because you
94:47 can't put it back on
94:49 you know but if you like for instance if
94:51 you did dave a little bit wrong
94:52 you could go down further and cut away
94:54 everything that you did to make it right
94:56 again you know
94:59 so this black box is gonna have to be if
95:00 it's a thousand tons today
95:02 it's gonna be at least two thousand tons
95:05 volumetrically to give yourself some
95:06 wiggle room in case you make a mistake
95:10 you don't wanna transport the thing
95:11 after you've mitered all the edges
95:13 because someone bumps it and oh my god
95:14 i'm going to kill you because we'll
95:15 never get this edge back
95:17 you have to take it down another inch or
95:19 two right
95:20 which is the whole thing being redone
95:22 back down to another level
95:24 oh my god so someone had to bring these
95:27 rocks
95:28 these massively heavy rocks i mean again
95:31 what i know egyptians had boats that
95:33 were phenomenal and all that kind of
95:35 stuff but
95:36 there's a there's a interesting equation
95:38 i've heard several times which i can't
95:39 remember the exact math on it but
95:41 there's a whole
95:42 calculation for the displacement of
95:44 water
95:46 versus the payload that's inside
95:49 um sure you could maybe crane maybe that
95:52 big rock into the
95:53 belly of a battleship and you'd be okay
95:56 but
95:56 uh ancient pre-dynastic era
96:00 i'm not buying that there's water
96:03 that you have to get over you know
96:05 there's little tiny land arteries maybe
96:08 so that's a huge question before
96:11 fabrication starts
96:12 getting these rocks i mean i'm pretty
96:15 sure the dude who
96:17 figured out how to get it over to egypt
96:18 got some special reward
96:22 but then you have you know everything
96:24 takes time
96:26 a lot of effort egypt's a little bit
96:28 more civilized right in terms of
96:30 well if not massively civilized compared
96:32 to these other more
96:34 primitive areas like a machu picchu
96:36 where it's like you know
96:38 it's really cool it's it's amazingly
96:40 innovative but
96:42 you know it doesn't have a full
96:43 ecosystem up there
96:47 it kind of does and it kind of doesn't
96:48 right we have to think about what all
96:50 these rooms would be to
96:52 build an ecosystem whereas egypt's like
96:53 oh yeah there's the there's the temple
96:55 there's the hospital there's the
96:56 residence
96:57 there's the power supply what else you
97:00 want to know
97:01 you know there's the trade routes all
97:03 down the nile
97:04 if you're afraid when you die you take
97:05 it down the valley of the kings it's
97:07 awesome
97:08 luxor you gotta see it so
97:12 with the um the petra
97:16 it seems like a very unforgiving land
97:18 again we have to assume
97:20 that that the floods were occurring
97:22 constantly
97:23 while this place was being built it's
97:26 just nature
97:27 it's going to rain and then there's this
97:30 giant
97:31 cataclysmic fire thing which is very
97:33 surgical it's not like
97:35 the um you know the theories of killing
97:37 the make-believe dinosaurs
97:41 okay fires happen everywhere and so
97:42 geologists always draw false conclusions
97:45 in my opinion because they'll go to
97:47 montana they'll go to the grand canyon
97:50 they'll go
97:51 all over the world and they'll always
97:53 there's always a sedimentary layer
97:55 that's burned
97:57 like see all this is the same thing and
97:59 it's like it's not the same thing
98:00 necessarily
98:01 right what would happen if you had a
98:04 cataclysmic
98:05 fire burn out you know the rocky
98:08 mountains
98:09 and then it settles and then earth
98:12 grows up on top of all that sedimentary
98:14 stuff and of course millions of years it
98:16 pushes down and gets
98:17 crushed into the rock and you have this
98:20 massive layer of carbon
98:22 so as you know if you go on this journey
98:26 perhaps triggered by this video to to
98:28 get oh yeah i really like that stuff i'm
98:29 going to dig into it
98:31 my advice to you is to say one any
98:34 man-made history that you've ever been
98:36 taught about this kind of stuff
98:37 you might just want to toss it out the
98:39 door two
98:41 be careful with ice age theories you
98:43 know
98:44 halting man's development again
98:50 go just do yourself a favor go look up
98:52 why they think ice age has occurred
98:55 then remind yourself where egypt is
98:58 at the belt of the earth's
99:02 biggest gravitational area right or
99:04 sorry
99:05 diameter right
99:09 no need for that to ever occur
99:13 to remember that trophies are important
99:16 to societies just as bad as
99:20 egypt might be today in claiming a
99:22 pre-dynastic
99:24 african society or alien society
99:27 building all these amazing things
99:31 same goes for all the european countries
99:33 and the americas
99:35 nobody wants to lose their trophy and so
99:38 a lot of history has been simply
99:41 designed
99:42 to ensure that your kind
99:46 is the winner of all innovation
99:50 and you know someone could definitely
99:53 say okay i've got a
99:55 i've got an iphone and that beats the
99:57 pyramid
99:58 um the only difference is we know how
100:00 the iphone was built
100:03 people go to coral castle and go yeah
100:06 when there was a bunch of rocks whatever
100:09 they're overlooking the fact that no one
100:11 on planet earth
100:12 in his entire lifetime said that they
100:15 helped him take a stone off a truck
100:17 but everyone who brought him a stone on
100:19 the back of a drug said yeah he made his
100:21 go around the corner and he took the
100:22 rocks off the truck by himself
100:26 oh and then he moves it like 25 miles
100:28 after he finishes it
100:31 so there's a lot of room for us to
100:32 consider a lot of different theories
100:35 how things work if the coral castle dude
100:38 was truly using his
100:40 um his magnetic wheel
100:43 as a stimulant to a rock to infect it
100:46 to be more permeable to ether or
100:48 ethereal winds to then make it more
100:50 weightless and somehow the pyramid
100:54 errors are the other pyramid builders
100:56 had figured out
100:57 a lesser means of creating electricity
101:00 the thing could be used to create a
101:01 bigger means of creating electricity
101:03 right so
101:04 all of you have seen a little generator
101:06 level generator could start a bigger
101:07 generator you know
101:09 there could be some some sort of uh
101:11 connection theory to that as well
101:15 the interesting thing i just want to
101:16 make another final point about the fire
101:18 thing
101:19 and again it doesn't really matter if
101:21 his
101:22 he called it a silver plasma burst from
101:25 the sun
101:26 and what's funny about that if you've
101:27 watched all my shows is that i'm always
101:29 saying to you that
101:30 you know we don't need to worry about
101:32 coronal mass ejections
101:34 because there's never been a place on
101:35 earth that's ever been scorched in the
101:36 past
101:37 that we need to worry about them
101:38 actually do anything more than
101:39 interrupting a few
101:41 you know communication satellites
101:45 you know he mentioned the dude that came
101:46 up with that theory i do
101:49 believe that the scorching
101:52 from the sun theory i mean unless
101:55 there's something about this silver
101:56 plasma theory i do not understand
102:01 you know earth is super teeny tiny right
102:05 if the
102:06 sun was a basketball
102:11 then earth is a third of a period on a
102:15 piece of paper
102:16 so if there's any massive coronal mass
102:18 ejection against the earth earth could
102:19 be completely vaporized if we didn't
102:21 have a vanilla belt protecting it right
102:24 so i think that if there was any plasma
102:27 discharge
102:29 it would be coming from the bowels of
102:30 the earth probably because
102:34 they had power units that
102:37 could be overwhelmed you know what if
102:39 you created an artery
102:40 let's just say your tesla and you're
102:42 creating his tesla tower
102:44 which again puts a little bit of
102:45 amperage into the earth and sucks out
102:47 infinite average up
102:50 volts whatever you want to measure that
102:52 by
102:53 and then what we didn't understand maybe
102:55 he didn't understand is that the ink
102:57 the core of the earth is very dynamic
102:59 and can give us surges
103:02 and so his tower vaporizes one day
103:05 because
103:06 the way that the core aligned aligned
103:08 with his aqua ravine
103:10 with his plateau with his antenna just
103:13 overwhelmed the thing and just blew it
103:15 up
103:17 so maybe um
103:21 you know the pyramids have been stripped
103:24 of their outer coating
103:26 and i would say that um
103:29 now after listening to forester and i
103:32 hope again he goes over to the
103:34 uh back to the pyramids before his last
103:35 four and a half hours i gotta watch
103:39 what if these things simply were too
103:43 aggressive in design and those outer
103:47 stones were vaporized were
103:52 blown off the unit
103:55 my theory prior to this episode is that
103:59 they were dismantled right they always
104:02 told you this ridiculous theory when i
104:04 was a kid that the
104:05 stones on the outside of the pyramids
104:07 were taken off to build other structures
104:11 again without some logic in your brain
104:12 as a child you swallow that
104:14 and you find out that that's a complete
104:16 bunk
104:17 because the outer stones of the pyramid
104:20 were these mitered
104:21 angled stones that were meant to lay on
104:24 top of flat stones but put a
104:26 curved edge on the outside except the
104:27 great pyramid which actually has slanted
104:29 stones
104:30 internally but still the outer
104:34 coating of these pyramids were slanted
104:36 stones
104:37 the hell you're going to build with that
104:39 you can't do anything but build another
104:40 pyramid at exactly that angle
104:43 and i do know the pyramids are actually
104:46 four corners pushed together i mentioned
104:49 that
104:50 i think way back five years ago and a
104:52 lot of my friends were like well did you
104:53 know that these pyramids are made out of
104:54 these
104:54 different different edges and then when
104:56 the sun hits at a particular time of day
104:58 you can actually see the creases down
104:59 the walls and you're like hell yeah
105:01 it's absolutely phenomenal when you see
105:03 it
105:06 so be you know interesting what you guys
105:08 think
105:10 i think that um what we have to gain
105:16 is several fold which is
105:22 i think the the one of the most
105:25 intriguing parts about the whole game
105:26 is that if history was erased
105:30 why and to whose advantage
105:35 two beyond anything i've said here two
105:38 who are these folks and what can we
105:41 deduce about
105:42 their capabilities based on what they
105:45 built
105:46 again if they have diamond bit drills
105:50 and i mean there's some of these
105:51 structures that have little one-inch
105:53 drills
105:54 where someone was building something
105:55 they stopped building for some reason
105:57 and they had little um it was about a
106:01 couple match boxes right next to each
106:04 other and
106:05 it was going to be this embossed thing
106:07 in the lid
106:08 and someone had drilled one two three
106:11 four five six seven eight nine ten
106:13 holes directly down into this lid but
106:15 they're all still round
106:17 drills you can still see they never went
106:19 in there and chopped it out and cleaned
106:20 it up
106:22 so you know i mean did they leave did
106:25 they just
106:26 pick up and go one day and you know
106:27 we're done here
106:30 did they have a war a long time ago
106:33 and these maybe this burn mark is some
106:36 weaponry it's just it's just interesting
106:40 i mean petra is really phenomenal
106:42 a bizarre place to live machu picchu
106:45 very lush land plenty of crop land
106:48 and you can refer all kinds of wild
106:50 things in peru but peru has those
106:51 drawings that you can only see
106:53 if you're in a hot air balloon or higher
106:57 you know it's just like how could this
107:00 exist
107:01 and then go away and then be
107:04 rediscovered later
107:07 just all the time it's everywhere
107:11 and i guess the other big question would
107:12 be at the end of all of these
107:15 amazing cultures and these technical
107:20 societies you know did they um
107:25 like you know what would have made them
107:27 just quit what they're doing
107:30 almost like those weird stories of the
107:32 villagers that just disappear but their
107:34 food is still you know cooking on the
107:36 stove or something you know
107:40 so if you have the theories and other
107:42 videos that you would recommend please
107:43 link them down below because that would
107:45 be really good
107:46 for me to complete this uh i didn't
107:48 think i would ever
107:50 why didn't i say ever but i didn't think
107:51 it would be so soon that someone would
107:53 be introduced into the game
107:55 that really sparks my mind but this
107:58 brian uh
107:59 forester guy is a new breed of
108:01 archaeologists that
108:03 again for my money the way he speaks is
108:05 clear as a bell
108:07 just riveting so um definitely have a
108:10 look at the video down below
108:13 and that's a good segue to if you
108:15 haven't been to deepthoughtsradio.com
108:16 please go all the links
108:18 are up there two video um two audio
108:22 i five social media now because we have
108:24 a parlor in there
108:25 don't know parlor's gonna survive we'll
108:27 find out
108:28 there's the uh a couple ways to
108:30 contribute which is patreon and paypal
108:33 there's also um the all new remastered
108:36 season one
108:37 with then the store and so this summer
108:41 again i've got uh some stuff from
108:43 photoshop i'm working on right now
108:46 to get up there and so you should have
108:49 some more opportunities to create some
108:50 cool
108:50 get some cool schwag from the show
108:54 anyway take care of yourself and someone
108:55 else and i'll see you in the next deep
108:57 thoughts
108:57 over now
109:01 [Applause]
109:08 [Applause]
109:14 [Applause]
109:21 [Applause]
109:26 yay
