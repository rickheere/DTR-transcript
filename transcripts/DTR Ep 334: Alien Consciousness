00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:34 good morning and good evening ladies and
00:37 gentlemen welcome back to deep thoughts
00:42 today I thought I would rattle on a
00:45 little bit about a theory that has been
00:48 I think written into several films so in
00:52 written into several books and I think
00:55 it's something that we have a hard time
00:59 conceiving of even though it could be
01:01 true I could see my breath that's how
01:05 cold it is that here I did an episode I
01:08 think at the end of season 3 or towards
01:12 the second or the third third I kind of
01:17 made a Masonic reference essentially
01:20 said we I think grow up thinking that
01:26 everything that we see inside of our
01:28 head is something that we created
01:32 meaning we created the thought we
01:36 created the circumstances and I think
01:39 that by being told that you can think
01:44 you're a different person than you
01:47 really are you could have the vision of
01:50 road rage and it wasn't something that
01:55 you would have normally done I I have
02:01 found that as I study every vision that
02:06 I have and again I write film so I'm
02:08 always searching for visions for the
02:12 specific film I'm working on because I
02:15 just see it finished see it finished
02:17 it's all I do is I sneak in the back of
02:18 the theater and then I watch a scene and
02:21 I'm like god I don't know what that
02:22 means well like the other scene in this
02:24 scene and then I put it all together
02:25 right psychologists like Freud came in
02:29 and a psychiatrist as you could say they
02:33 came in and started suggesting that we
02:36 had different layers of our mind the
02:39 unconscious the subconscious and the
02:41 conscious and they
02:44 take credit for everything that's
02:46 happening that you can't understand
02:47 about yourself
02:49 Louis how many birds are going crazy but
02:53 when you're told that and you believe
02:54 that and you know and it does you know
02:57 paradigms of thought help you manage
02:58 anything that's occurring to you as long
03:01 as they're accurate in some way shape or
03:04 form and then be giving an example that
03:06 I've been giving a lot lately you know I
03:09 go on and on on this show about ether
03:11 being responsible for the negative
03:14 pressures that create what we think is
03:15 gravity and people will say oh no no
03:19 it's it's the other thing it's the
03:20 phenomenon and it's the [ __ ] thing we
03:22 can't figure out that's what it is and
03:24 so I gave an analogy way back when to
03:28 say when
03:30 you know two balls are dropped two
03:32 different sizes from high a place you
03:35 know the theories that they hit the
03:36 ground at the same time which we kind of
03:37 proven on a nanosecond level that's not
03:40 exactly true but regardless it's pretty
03:44 similar and you could say it's this
03:46 phenomenon gravity that you can't
03:48 explain you don't know what it is you
03:49 think it's mass actually sharing
03:51 information with mass which is the most
03:53 [ __ ] thing ever
03:54 for those of you they're coders the
03:57 universe isn't coupled okay it's object
03:59 oriented but someone could have said
04:02 it's angels it's angel power and they
04:08 get all the calculations correct and
04:09 they're able to predict terminal
04:11 velocity and buh-buh-buh-buh-buh rate of
04:13 descent and but they're attributing it
04:16 to their spiritual orientation which is
04:21 which are angels they've got the math
04:25 right but they have the COS wrong well
04:29 if the math is right it's going to cause
04:31 a huge headache when you're in Geneva
04:34 trying to argue against it because the
04:36 guy's gonna simply go well you know it's
04:40 one big angel and two small angels for
04:42 that and it's too big angels and three
04:44 [ __ ] angels for this you know it's
04:46 just like you could go on and on having
04:49 the wrong causality for the right math
04:51 okay
04:53 that's relevant here because let's say
04:57 you're really
04:58 sentient you're very enlightened as a
05:01 human being and you are able to filter
05:04 the thoughts that come into your head
05:06 and you're able to discern your emotions
05:09 and you're able to feel the truth
05:12 frequency inside your chest to say wait
05:17 a minute that's my thought right there
05:20 and this thing that's happening right in
05:22 front of me like a movie I wouldn't have
05:25 thought that in a million years that's
05:27 not me
05:28 there's the old saying lose your [ __ ] oh
05:31 man I'm gonna lose my [ __ ] if this
05:33 continues ha ha ha ha and usually what
05:36 happens before you lose your [ __ ] is you
05:38 start having visions of what you would
05:40 do if you lost your [ __ ]
05:41 what you are willing to do to get out of
05:43 the situation that you're in the alien
05:47 consciousness of which this episode is
05:50 entitled is going to reference a
05:53 symbiotic relationship that we might
05:55 have with an alien that has no
05:58 instrumentalities of which we can see no
06:01 body we say things that are alive have
06:04 to have bodies why do we say that
06:06 because we have them and we can't exist
06:09 without them perhaps in some naive sense
06:13 we would be jealous of such a thing
06:15 pile of astral projecting around the
06:17 universe ya know if I would I've been
06:23 stuck in a Sun for a trillion years this
06:25 sucks but now here's how I personally
06:28 filter these visions of which some I
06:33 give the attribute of my thought now
06:38 it's pretty easy when I sit down and do
06:40 a show I'm forcing my brain to go
06:42 through the library of information that
06:46 I think I've accurately correct
06:48 accurately gathered over time where I'm
06:52 skeptical I try to be very clear about
06:54 that where I've gotten some hearsay I
06:57 try to be pretty clear about that and so
07:01 it's pretty easy these are my thoughts I
07:03 am forming words you were listening
07:05 Papapa we all do this right but then
07:10 when I don't attempt to speak my brain
07:15 still sees things when I go to bed at
07:17 night and lay my head on the pillow my
07:20 brain on one day might pretty casually
07:24 go to bed I don't sleep I don't
07:26 transition to sleep real quickly because
07:27 my brain just keeps it going and going
07:31 it's a [ __ ] Timex running on a
07:33 Duracell but as these other thoughts
07:36 occurred when I'm not trying to run my
07:38 mouth I've noticed that there is an
07:40 indicator built inside me though that's
07:44 me know whether or not what I am seeing
07:45 is a product if my thought our product
07:48 of some ambient movie that's being
07:50 played in front of me
07:52 what happens at a greyhound racetrack
07:57 there is a sad sad model of a bunny
08:01 attached to a stick it's attached to a
08:04 rail that goes around the course the
08:07 dogs look at this fake bunny and they
08:11 run their asses off after it and it's
08:14 obviously not real but this dog seemed
08:17 pretty determined to grab something that
08:18 they don't understand how do you herd
08:21 sheep well you can do it by yourself or
08:26 you get yourself a sheepdog and you
08:28 train it to scare them into the barn
08:30 right and only a few of the Sheep
08:33 actually get contact with the dog the
08:35 rest of them are so damn stupid they
08:37 just follow along right could man be so
08:42 primitive of course not we are man we
08:48 are designed by God God looks exactly
08:52 like us by the way
08:53 how convenient but what ends up
08:56 happening when we buy into a lectionary
08:59 sorry let me finish this first what I
09:03 have found is that the visions that I
09:06 see that sort of are shocking you know
09:10 it could be anything it could be just
09:12 the way that I might react to a
09:14 situation could be it's usually
09:19 surrounding hidden information
09:22 no you're like wonder what he's doing I
09:24 wonder what she's doing and your brains
09:27 like harvesting these images of what
09:30 that could be
09:32 when you're younger you're far more
09:35 mature like I said to you guys recently
09:37 no my relationship back in high school I
09:39 was super jealous and so my brain was
09:41 accepting visions of what this
09:44 girlfriend of mine my guess was doing
09:47 with other people or just there was an
09:52 insinuation that her wanting to live her
09:55 life in addition to dating me meant that
09:57 she didn't love me if she wasn't with me
09:59 enough right those immature sort of
10:01 archetypes I mean what's your first time
10:04 it's your first time right but I find
10:07 that when I reprocessed the thought add
10:09 a step to the situation so I've seen
10:11 something I put it through my analysis
10:14 on my computer when I say you need
10:17 anyone in here make this thought I mean
10:19 are you vested in this particular
10:21 thought and what I usually find is what
10:24 I'm loving something or the other one
10:28 which is being analytical about
10:29 something I can find the the Apache log
10:35 in my system that says yes we did
10:37 originated that thought that does that's
10:39 congruent with the thoughts that we've
10:41 had for the years that you've been alive
10:43 when you reprocess the thought you feel
10:46 that cool thing in your chest that's
10:48 because that one's yours now trauma a
10:52 little bit different something happens
10:55 to you that is usually an extremely
10:57 involuntary thought process it's very
10:59 raw someone calls you and says your
11:03 friends in the hospital or your
11:04 relatives passed away what are you gonna
11:07 do those aren't really your thoughts
11:08 that's an occurrence not thought for me
11:11 I thought is you're sitting there like I
11:14 am now and also do to do oh gosh that
11:16 was a weird vision I just had but this
11:19 reprocess technique yields a lot of
11:22 rejections I'm gonna say that on a
11:25 particular day I might end up rejecting
11:27 two-thirds or more of what I've seen
11:33 and what I'm finding is that it's the
11:35 process seems to calm down meaning I'm
11:40 not buying into it and so it's sort of
11:44 getting bored because it can't rile me
11:48 up and manipulate me I've got too many
11:52 you know fool me twice situations at
11:57 least fool me once situations now a lot
12:00 of cases I have fallen for these
12:02 archetypes you know probably in a
12:05 microsecond level millions and millions
12:08 of times in my lifetime but it's because
12:11 no one ever told me the things that you
12:13 see may not be your creation which you
12:16 have miscategorized is your thought
12:19 isn't your thought so then the second
12:24 thing that comes around when you're a
12:25 scientist is simply saying okay then
12:29 where would it come from now I'm going
12:32 to say the word alien I'm probably not
12:36 talking about your average theory of a
12:38 grey alien an average theory of a
12:40 reptile or anything like that
12:43 and again in the reptile realm of David
12:46 Icke you know it's it has been built up
12:50 as one of these metaphorical
12:53 interpretations that you can pretty much
12:56 attached to anything it's almost like
12:58 climate change today a reptile can
13:00 shape-shift into a human a reptile can
13:03 be I guess close to you and influence
13:05 your thoughts I mean it's just whatever
13:06 the hell floats your boat is what that
13:09 there is instead of someone saying no
13:11 scientifically it's this gray aliens are
13:13 about this tall the males and the
13:15 females are really tall and the boys are
13:17 gray and the girls are beige and they
13:20 have this other subspecies they hang out
13:21 with it does a lot of lifting work for
13:23 them it's very regimented you look this
13:25 way they wear these clothing they wear
13:27 this clothing Papapa right you know let
13:30 me take a little digression here because
13:33 I won't be able to make a whole episode
13:36 on it but and this may not be the most
13:38 appropriate place I might mention it
13:40 more than once and then the coming
13:41 episodes but I was watching an episode
13:43 on YouTube last night
13:46 which was a queue analysis episode and
13:49 the guy said this is what we're seeing
13:54 things that the Bible warned us about
13:56 thousands of years ago this person's
13:59 very religious and thanks queue is all
14:02 about Jesus and what has happened is you
14:06 have a book where you can pick a lot of
14:09 different things out but definitely
14:10 revelations is 99.9 percent where these
14:13 folks go to sort of legitimize their
14:16 personal theories of the universe but
14:20 basically what the New Testament said
14:22 and you know it has some fairly profound
14:24 understandings of money changers meaning
14:27 a single currency is the way you run the
14:29 world but it basically predicted a bunch
14:33 of bad news didn't it and so anytime you
14:36 interpret the events of the world as bad
14:38 news you automatically can gravitate
14:41 symbolically and metaphorically towards
14:43 that book and say oh my god it was so
14:45 predictive well maybe all right do you
14:50 have three-headed Hydra is coming out of
14:51 the ocean at you you're like my wife and
14:57 my mother-in-law they're almost like a
14:59 Hydra
15:00 when I say alien in this particular
15:02 episode I just mean a foreign
15:04 consciousness now what I love about you
15:08 guys is that so many of you in the
15:11 comments have elaborated so beautifully
15:17 about consciousness about it being a
15:20 being about it being a force about it
15:23 being what we really are
15:26 you're way out you're way past Kurtz
15:28 well right he wants to make everything a
15:31 chemistry set what a sad life that is
15:34 right I mean I hope he's happy taking
15:36 240 pills a day because he doesn't need
15:39 food anymore
15:39 that's not a joke this alien is going to
15:43 be responsible for its its design and
15:50 what it feeds off of
15:53 we have several examples here in earth
15:57 of insects that feed off of each other
16:00 a wasp that lays eggs inside a worm
16:04 there's several of them but it's where
16:07 the movie alien from 1979 got the
16:11 chestburster idea but now think about
16:15 the chemistry inside your body and then
16:18 take into account your consciousness
16:20 think about that analogy of the bug
16:23 going towards the zapper and simply
16:27 existing feels good
16:29 what if again that bug going towards the
16:31 zapper is merely having an orgasm of
16:34 ether winds pushing through his little
16:36 carcass where human beings work in
16:40 mysterious ways to create orgasms
16:43 bugs just fly towards light and they're
16:46 just living in one big pal the whole
16:48 time right now imagine you have another
16:52 consciousness that is more like our
16:55 technique of having to orchestrate
16:57 various events in another creature to
17:01 create a certain configuration of energy
17:03 whether beef consciousness changes
17:05 shifts in consciousness or shifts in
17:07 chemistry that create a shift in
17:09 consciousness and the byproduct is
17:13 something that they feed off of it keeps
17:16 them going which would mean they have
17:20 always needed us to exist you ever think
17:24 about that the wasp that lays its eggs
17:26 inside of a worm okay what did it do
17:29 before that and how the [ __ ] does it
17:31 exist before it does that right we have
17:35 to be some really bizarre idea that it's
17:40 you know one wasp it doesn't do that
17:41 guys hey you know what I did last night
17:43 what did you do i laid bags in this worm
17:45 what it's totally cool man he carried
17:48 them around the whole time I went off
17:50 and went to Vegas got some tits and ass
17:52 and whatever brilliant but now think
17:58 about the fact that we are Homo sapiens
18:01 sapiens on this planet and we
18:05 are similar to the other counterparts
18:08 that we have at least in the animal
18:10 kingdom like a bear and a coyote they'll
18:13 definitely go through some adrenaline
18:15 pops as they're out there in the
18:16 wilderness trying to survive and let's
18:19 just say that that's a vanilla emotional
18:22 arc and it tastes like vanilla to these
18:25 aliens and say hey you know get tired
18:27 Aidan that kind of energy sort of
18:30 primitive and just that one flavor yeah
18:33 me too
18:33 when I went to New York City oh yeah
18:36 where are the flavors they are [ __ ]
18:38 amazing
18:38 I went to Columbia alright get all these
18:42 [ __ ] to kill each other crazy you
18:44 know the wharf the battlefields awesome
18:47 isn't it oh my god get these kids to
18:49 hate each other it's so incredible so
18:50 easy I know right you just rabbit out in
18:53 front of them that guy's gonna kill you
18:55 he's gonna kill your family and man that
18:57 kid just goes out and blows away a whole
18:59 village I know it's awesome no knocking
19:04 anybody in those situations because at
19:06 home we have our own versions road rage
19:07 and domestic violence and you know
19:11 disputes in public or with your friends
19:13 or whatever we're all susceptible to
19:14 this susceptible but we don't have to be
19:20 feeding it there was a something I
19:25 watched recently I wish I could give a
19:27 proper credit and some of you might
19:29 remember the line I saw somewhere where
19:33 they said you know the the parts of your
19:37 mind that start to grow and take control
19:39 are the ones that you feed the most and
19:43 so if you want to have patience and love
19:45 then you must feed your patience and
19:47 love and when anger shows up and
19:51 retaliation or whatever suspicion
19:54 accusation you don't feed it but I'm
19:58 gonna give you hopefully a little
20:00 mechanism and a metaphor such that this
20:03 becomes really easy now I really really
20:07 really can't stress enough this
20:09 reprocessing step it is going to be if
20:14 you have it if you suffer from this and
20:16 you've never done this
20:18 the level of power and lucidity you're
20:21 gonna gain from this technique is
20:22 utterly profound okay now think of
20:27 something that you love could be a child
20:32 that you have born or that you take care
20:36 of could be a spouse could be your
20:38 mother father family members your job
20:40 your little hobby off to the side deep
20:43 thoughts radio and when you process how
20:48 you'd like to spend your time with these
20:50 things that you love there's usually
20:53 your your definition of what it feels
20:56 like in your chest for me it is a cool
21:00 beautiful congruent wave of energy that
21:03 goes through my body that is congruent
21:05 with the truth that I am made out of
21:07 because I can't be made of anything else
21:09 right again the math has to be perfect
21:10 otherwise I cease to exist same with you
21:13 it feels like that emotion belongs
21:16 inside me and for any of you who've said
21:21 this a couple times any of you've just
21:23 kind of had a you get up you get your
21:26 breakfast you go to work or whatever
21:28 you're chilling out the house and the
21:30 weekend or whatever and you have this
21:33 little bug up your ass and it's just
21:35 something that is makes your chest tight
21:37 it's like a little tiny PTSD PTSD is
21:44 when you have a traumatic feeling that's
21:46 looping inside your body but you've lost
21:48 track of its causality or you never paid
21:51 you know you weren't able to to figure
21:53 out where it invaded your system a
21:56 soldier that drives over an ie D and a
21:58 bunch of people get hurt maybe even
22:01 killed but they survive however that is
22:04 described the concussion of the bomb
22:07 that races ten minutes of the frontal
22:10 lobe that didn't get filed away and so
22:12 they wake up maybe missing a limb
22:16 missing their buddies and they can't
22:19 remember the moment that it occurred and
22:21 so the mind needs to resolve causality
22:25 of negative things that occur to us and
22:28 so the therapy for PTSD soldiers is to
22:31 retrack back
22:32 your head the the moment that the trauma
22:38 occurred and they're using virtual
22:39 reality goggles now to playback the
22:42 events based on records of the events
22:44 based on photographs of what they you
22:47 know the rescue cure crews that pick up
22:48 things and they rebuild the whole thing
22:49 and it's down to like where the cup was
22:52 in the cup holder where the m16 might
22:55 have been off to the side I mean what
22:56 someone was wearing it's the more
22:58 details they can put into these virtual
23:00 reality simulations they're again
23:03 they're reaching over 80% recovery rates
23:06 now whereas they used to have over a 50%
23:09 dropout rate with these verbal
23:11 techniques well when you reprocess one
23:16 of these thoughts and you can't find any
23:19 real congruent connection to the
23:24 thoughts you were having prior to seeing
23:26 what you call this thought again I
23:27 shouldn't call it a thought until it's
23:29 categorized as your property it's a
23:33 vision until it's your property and what
23:37 I find is that it's clever it's very
23:39 very clever these visions that get put
23:43 in front of human beings and again it
23:44 could be literally caused by your
23:47 neighbor's thoughts can you know
23:49 combining with your thoughts it could be
23:51 someone to clear across the world
23:52 there's no limitation whatsoever it
23:54 could be your loved ones thinking about
23:55 you or whatever but I doubt it because
23:58 it seems to be fairly proprietary but
24:01 you'll process the thought sometimes and
24:03 you'll yoke oh my god I would never have
24:06 that thought I mean I would never think
24:07 those thoughts I would never instigate
24:10 what I'm seeing you know now it doesn't
24:14 mean you're you're this pure perfect
24:16 human being and that every road rage
24:18 situation that you that you get into and
24:21 again road rage can be the crazy [ __ ]
24:23 that people do you know running people
24:25 off the road and getting out and yelling
24:26 each other or just mouthing off inside
24:29 your car and the other person has no
24:30 clue that you're just discontent with
24:33 their driving capabilities right yeah
24:35 stuff like that occurs you do get angry
24:37 at people doing things but now imagine
24:42 there are human beings that are little
24:45 different
24:45 than a greyhound chasing a plastic bunny
24:50 hmm well what do you think snowflakes
24:54 come from in the world and I don't mean
24:56 the [ __ ] that falls in the wintertime we
24:59 have a lot of concerns on this show
25:01 about fluoride aspartame vaccinations
25:08 GMO foods anything unnatural
25:13 well now what if all those chemicals
25:16 contribute to an inability to tap into
25:19 your consciousness to manifest memory
25:25 and so the very components that make up
25:29 intelligence which is again deducing
25:32 more than just memorizing and repeating
25:35 their hindered by all these chemicals
25:37 and so it doesn't prevent you from being
25:40 a human being and sort of operating in a
25:43 real basic level I mean a greyhound dog
25:46 is still a dog it's not exactly the one
25:49 you keep in your house to fetch the
25:51 paper but there's a lot of good dogs
25:56 it'll chase a plastic rabbit greyhounds
25:58 just look cool and run faster right but
26:01 what happens when you're young or how do
26:04 we describe ourselves when we're young
26:06 most of us will say we're pretty damn
26:08 naive now in my own personal description
26:14 of myself during my earlier years I
26:16 would say that I maintained utter
26:19 naivete in some areas of the world that
26:24 as I got older and looked back I was
26:27 like wow what I wonder I wonder why I
26:28 was so utterly naive about that huge
26:31 category of life and then on one level
26:35 like entrepreneurship I was more
26:39 advanced at [ __ ] 13 than some people
26:41 are at 70 you know I made things I sold
26:46 things I got jobs I loved a day's work
26:50 I loved it man I lied on my first job
26:52 application saying I was 14 so I could
26:55 get a job with the movie theater but
26:57 before I even got that job I had
26:59 hundreds of dollars of [ __ ] as a kid
27:02 greeting cards and and my artwork and a
27:07 bunch of other crap right but the reason
27:10 why we mature is that we gain insight
27:12 and we memorize patterns either we like
27:17 it we don't like and we engage in the
27:19 ones that we like and we try to avoid
27:20 the ones we don't like right you date
27:24 casually for a certain number of years
27:27 before you realize it's a fast way to
27:31 catch crazy and live with it right and
27:34 then eventually you start becoming more
27:35 discerning you ask more questions you
27:37 you get better at the process right you
27:40 take any job when you're young and then
27:41 as you get older you're like well you
27:43 know I don't want that big giant commute
27:44 and I don't really want to be doing that
27:46 and oh this job looks so awesome yeah
27:48 boom one of the movies that I mentioned
27:52 off and on throughout every season and
27:55 is very applicable here because it
27:58 affected my brain with this entire
28:02 episode theme which is alien
28:06 consciousness that is invisible to the
28:08 mind is controlling human beings and
28:11 that's the premise of this story of the
28:14 movie called branded which again I think
28:16 is an indie film I know it's an indie
28:18 film but it was made I think in Russia
28:20 then again could it be made in Canada
28:22 but anyway it's a movie about an alien I
28:29 want to say an alien race but each alien
28:31 was completely different and it was
28:33 associated with a brand so they had they
28:38 had spoofs on each one of the big brands
28:40 that we have in this world so Nike there
28:42 was a spoof McDonald's there was a spoof
28:44 all these different brands and a the way
28:48 it worked was that these aliens floated
28:51 the big mothership a Liam to float up in
28:54 the air and the little worker bees which
28:57 are these just kind of nebulous balloons
29:00 like a big bubble and there's a decal on
29:04 the outside that matches the mothership
29:07 and so you can see where the McDonald's
29:09 little soldiers were versus the Nike
29:11 soldiers
29:12 and all the aliens wanted to do was to
29:15 instigate a situation where our human
29:18 being lusted after something it did not
29:21 care about the human beings emotion if
29:25 the human being got what they wanted
29:27 eventually again I mentioned this scene
29:31 all the time but there's a scene this
29:33 classic of this little fat kid little
29:35 Gustus gloom kid and he wants some ice
29:37 cream and his mother can't discipline
29:42 the child so she gives in and he gets
29:45 his money and they they slow down this
29:46 is the camera and so the kids like hi
29:49 one more ice cream and so he's bringing
29:51 the money up to the guy and the guys it
29:54 just looks like some French really cool
29:56 ice cream gelato Italian guy or whatever
29:59 and he's making this amazing thing and
30:02 the kids just like and this balloon is
30:04 attached to the back of his neck and he
30:06 just keeps inflating and inflating as he
30:08 lusts after this ice cream in a second
30:10 he gives them the ice cream the balloon
30:13 breaks off and goes up to the mothership
30:14 and feeds the queen bee I think about
30:18 that you might be listening that for
30:20 like the tenth time if you're one of my
30:22 common listeners and go Jesus stop
30:23 telling this story one make sure you've
30:26 seen the movie it used to be on Netflix
30:30 and some dumb ass reason they pulled
30:33 behind a pay barrier I think but someone
30:36 had this idea and they had this idea to
30:40 the extent again it's been portrayed in
30:42 several different ways in several
30:44 different films star tracks had several
30:48 versions of this but this particular one
30:52 even though it was physical I mean there
30:55 was a physical connection to the human
30:56 body it wasn't quite as invasive as the
30:59 Star Trek ones where there was this
31:00 alien little embryo that goes up into
31:03 your spine the base of your brainstem
31:06 but they made a whole film after this
31:09 and I think they just absolutely nailed
31:10 it it's kind of a I think it's like a
31:13 seven and a half to an eighth film it's
31:17 not the conclusions a little weird it's
31:20 not quite like a Dark City conclusion
31:22 but it makes you think
31:25 once you can understand this other
31:27 paradigm of digesting visions that you
31:30 have right how many sci-fi shows have
31:34 you seen where they have an alien race
31:37 that either always can see other
31:40 people's thoughts like the counselor
31:43 troi and her mother Roxana god I love
31:47 her god rest her soul this is from Star
31:52 Trek there are two empaths they can see
31:56 everyone's thoughts now if you were
31:58 raised into that capability then you
32:01 would be hip to some techniques such
32:07 that you could regulate the invasion
32:10 regulate this constant vision and
32:12 imagine going to Disneyland and having
32:15 to see everybody's thoughts at that
32:17 place imagine being stuck in a prison
32:21 mm-hmm and seeing [ __ ] crazy 24/7 so
32:26 there would have to be techniques where
32:28 you would just as you move through a
32:31 crowd and you can ignore people around
32:33 you but you still have to acknowledge
32:34 that they're there because they're
32:35 physically blocking you that would be
32:38 how you would have to manage your
32:39 thoughts if you could see everybody's
32:42 consciousness and then there's other
32:46 stories where someone gains this
32:48 capability like the twilight zone with
32:52 the bewitched guy where he flips the
32:55 coin it stands on edge and then because
32:57 he did that at the paperboys stop he all
33:01 of a sudden can hear other people's
33:03 thoughts it's genius episode love it to
33:05 death but he he had a hard time managing
33:08 a situation he listened to an old man at
33:11 the bank he worked at plot to steal all
33:14 the money out of the safe and run off to
33:19 Barbados or whatever the hell he wanted
33:22 to go to so he tattletales to the
33:25 president of the Bank president bank is
33:28 skeptical but then they are willing to
33:31 pull him aside and sure enough he goes
33:33 into that freaking safe comes out with a
33:37 suitcase is at the JK sand
33:39 stop right there and I push him onto the
33:43 counter and they open up his satchel
33:45 there's nothing in there just his
33:47 sandwich and some of his personal items
33:49 and he then this main character gets
33:53 fired and the old man comes up to him
33:56 afterwards and says how did you know he
34:00 says what do you mean he was how did you
34:01 know that I was thinking about stealing
34:04 everything out of the bank and going on
34:06 this crazy vacation or escaping you know
34:09 at the country and he goes I don't know
34:13 I'm really sorry I ever accused you that
34:15 and he goes well you know it's true I
34:17 have that thought every single day I
34:19 fantasize about that every single day
34:21 but I never do it
34:23 because I'm a coward I would never do
34:25 that eventually he gets him a ticket to
34:29 go which is really cool now some people
34:33 believe that human beings have ESP that
34:36 we can hear each other's thoughts we do
34:38 the experiment we put two four heads
34:39 together for I think 30 minutes and then
34:41 pull them apart and for about mmm
34:45 average to 10 to 15 minutes after that
34:47 they can hear each other's thoughts they
34:49 can see each other's visions and
34:51 radio-frequency proof rooms but they
34:54 separate them
34:55 okay well that shows that the brain can
35:01 pick up brainwaves from someone else but
35:05 here's what I think you'll find out if
35:07 you use my technique of reevaluating the
35:11 visions that you see you will be
35:15 enlightened with a brand new capability
35:18 which will be the following when you see
35:22 your thought it feels like something
35:26 that is embedded in your chest that is
35:28 being projected out in front of you and
35:30 you're simply seeing your thought when
35:35 you see a vision something that is being
35:37 portrayed in front of you like a movie
35:39 to manipulate you into whatever state
35:42 that that thoughts going to do Andy you
35:44 could me maybe you like the vision it's
35:47 something that you need to do you're
35:49 going to a nightclub or you're going to
35:50 some place and you do have the guts to
35:52 say
35:52 hi to someone you want to potentially
35:54 date play all the games you want as long
35:57 as it's it's where you want to be but I
36:02 now see those visions is a paper-thin
36:05 projection in front of my face and it's
36:09 sort of dancing in front of me like the
36:12 bunny to the grey hem and it's saying to
36:16 me take me inside you legitimize me
36:21 mimic the pattern of the thought that
36:24 I'm presenting to you envision inside
36:26 your system make it your own change who
36:29 you are to accept this crazy it's not
36:34 that was crazy it's just you know it's
36:36 that's when you really notice it you
36:37 know it's usually like I tell you one
36:41 that happens to me frequently enough I
36:45 mean a few times a week at least when
36:48 you live in the big city then you travel
36:50 you you don't know
36:55 you know when strangers walk into venues
36:58 that you're in perhaps the most common I
37:00 think is a restaurant and sometimes you
37:03 know we have so many people here that
37:05 when someone cracks it's not hard to
37:08 find them they'll run out in
37:11 intersections naked and jump on
37:13 everybody's car hoods the road rage out
37:17 of thin air on the highway no one's cut
37:19 them off they're just pissed at the
37:21 world well there's someone that is
37:25 homeless and hasn't eaten much in the
37:28 last week and they are feral you know so
37:32 this kind of stuff happens in the big
37:33 city happens everywhere definitely the
37:36 big city so much more common for you to
37:38 bump into it I think in the big city so
37:39 sometimes you'll be it like a restaurant
37:41 I'll be sitting there and you know I'm
37:43 kind of one of these dudes like most
37:46 chieftains you sort of need to know
37:48 where the exits are you know you should
37:51 you know depending on the danger in the
37:54 room you want to know where fire
37:56 extinguishers are and you know various
37:59 emergency things again like one of my
38:01 old partners died at a country club and
38:04 because someone knew with a
38:05 defibrillator
38:06 was on the wall they saved his life
38:08 right so [ __ ] can happen right
38:11 it's anyway someone will come in that is
38:14 sort of playing the hard roll right I'm
38:17 a hard badass dude which is really
38:20 [ __ ] dumb as hell let me just tell
38:22 you I mean you don't want to come in
38:23 like Poindexter but at the same time you
38:26 don't want to come in portraying
38:27 something that you're really not because
38:28 someone could take it the wrong way and
38:30 they'll defend themselves or become
38:34 suspicious about you they'll get the
38:35 vision it's going to stimulate you into
38:38 something that you're not but as soon as
38:41 someone comes in I'm the kind of guy
38:42 that because I write screenplays I'm
38:44 just like running a thousand scenarios
38:46 of what kind of day that person had what
38:49 kind of person that person is and then I
38:50 just kind of sit and relaxing and see
38:53 what happens so you how they talk see
38:55 how they treat the staff see how they
38:57 shovel food in their mouths you know all
38:59 these little things are indicators of
39:01 who they are right and sometimes it'll
39:05 click over to another level of what
39:08 would you do if what would you do if
39:10 they were gonna come in here and rob the
39:12 joint and you'll see like in my brain I
39:15 just see like a thousands of examples
39:16 and sometimes it's totally entertaining
39:18 it's like oh yeah I should put that in a
39:20 film that's great that was like yeah I
39:22 could do this and that in this cuz
39:23 there's been a million fight scenes and
39:25 movies
39:25 everyone's bored of fight scenes and
39:27 films I mean you have to be a super
39:30 clever stunt coordinator to create
39:32 anything that someone hasn't seen before
39:34 right but in the end those types of
39:40 visions they're not always my creation
39:44 sometimes it is sometimes it isn't
39:47 that's the reevaluation process let's go
39:51 back to the alien side of things we see
39:55 it all the time in nature that like a
39:57 whale has a bunch of crustaceans on his
39:59 body they use the whales movement
40:02 through the ocean to eat with our fish
40:05 that use the whale as a big brother man
40:09 you're not gonna mess with me but I'm
40:10 gonna fly right underneath this whale
40:11 everywhere it goes right we are taught
40:15 by religion to think that we are the top
40:17 species in the universe
40:19 which is why the alien conversation is
40:21 so dangerous to the Vatican we always
40:27 think of aliens being smarter than us
40:29 for one specific reason in our model
40:33 they are with a body and in most cases
40:39 there's interdimensional stuff that's
40:41 starting to arrive in the 21st century
40:43 but before that really started taking
40:46 effect where the masses could understand
40:48 what the hell you're talking about when
40:49 you mention that they have to travel on
40:52 a spacecraft to our destination to say
40:56 hello and we know that if they ever do
40:59 that at least the current at the current
41:02 state of mankind they're going to be
41:03 more advanced than we are so there's
41:07 this fear bubble that wraps around
41:10 aliens because of that very thing Doctor
41:15 Who back in the Tom Baker days which is
41:18 the 70s for those of you're too old to
41:19 know they had a whole series of episodes
41:23 where there was a sort of a beetle like
41:26 a scarab beetle but it was black it was
41:28 huge and it was in I believe several
41:31 episodes as this being that was doing
41:34 exactly what I'm telling you it would
41:38 attach to you and you couldn't feel it
41:40 there's been several portrayals of this
41:42 in different different productions since
41:45 that time but it was controlling the
41:48 thoughts of the human being the doctor
41:52 could see it and was trying to get these
41:54 things off of people especially his
41:55 companion we like to think of ourselves
41:58 as coming from the palm of God there was
42:04 a space not meaning outer space but
42:07 there was a place God forged the
42:10 universe brushed off a few of his ether
42:13 ether particles to give us a place to
42:15 live and we are directly from his hand
42:20 in theory in design now again I will say
42:25 over and over I think the world is
42:26 intelligently designed I mean again life
42:28 is beautiful
42:31 and I'd Lee think that you know when I
42:36 Drive down the highway and I look at the
42:38 cars I think we're in a pretty good era
42:41 in 2019 that 60 to 70 percent of the
42:44 cars are pretty pretty attractive cars
42:46 but goddamn it there's thirty percent
42:48 out there that are just but ugly and I
42:51 cannot for the [ __ ] life of me figure
42:53 out how somebody walked onto a car lot
42:55 with money because these are new cars
42:58 and they said I can have this car over
43:01 here that looks cool and has all the
43:04 same features in space and fuel economy
43:06 and this piece of [ __ ] right here right
43:09 the fact that the kei car ever sold is
43:11 just [ __ ] phenomenal right so life
43:17 for me every time I look at a bug fish a
43:21 bird a vegetation everything out there
43:27 in the forest it is all absolutely
43:30 incredibly beautiful and I just think I
43:34 would be looking at something eventually
43:36 and going oh that is gross right again
43:40 frogs they get pretty close with the
43:43 little the ones that have the babies in
43:45 their backs that's pretty gross but once
43:48 they're all born and they all look
43:49 pretty cool right but now what if as a
43:52 part of our know if we're gonna loop
43:58 this back here what if we need what they
44:01 produce as well Douglas Adams I
44:05 mentioned several times has come up with
44:08 came up with in the late 70s the idea of
44:11 a babel fish it's based on the Tower of
44:14 Babel where all the languages were
44:16 created because man built a tower to
44:18 reach the heavens and when he couldn't
44:20 reach the heavens he that was at the
44:22 king climbed to the top and shot an
44:24 arrow into the sky
44:26 to try to punish God and God punished us
44:30 with a bunch of languages broke down our
44:32 communication so the Babel fish was a
44:35 fish that accounted for the fact that
44:37 the main character needed to understand
44:39 the languages of all these aliens he was
44:40 going to meet throughout this adventure
44:42 and so you put the Babel fish inside
44:46 your head and what it does is it feeds
44:49 on consciousness from one being to
44:52 another so it eats the consciousness
44:56 that someone is projecting at you and
44:59 the former communication and it excretes
45:01 the translation consciousness for your
45:04 brain so it literally eats and excretes
45:07 translation absolutely one of the most
45:10 brilliant things ever conceived of in a
45:12 fictional science-fiction book on earth
45:15 so now imagine that's going on not in
45:22 the form of translation but some other
45:26 factor
45:27 could you imagine not only discovering
45:29 that this exists because we developed
45:32 some sort of mechanical device that can
45:34 track consciousness we find something
45:38 you know spiral behavior of energy that
45:41 is consciousness and then we build a
45:44 machine to track it and then we find our
45:46 own consciousness and then right on top
45:47 of us
45:48 we find this that we find the human body
45:50 we find our consciousness which is sort
45:52 of like our soul but attached to it like
45:56 a little fish maybe several little fish
45:59 is this little hive minded culture a
46:04 bacteria if you will of consciousness
46:06 that grows on top of our brain our top
46:08 of our consciousness excuse me and
46:10 perhaps it's linked with all of its
46:13 brothers and sisters that are all over
46:15 the rest of us it's like we have a
46:18 blanket on top of humanity but now what
46:21 if hopefully you're building a vision in
46:24 your brain of what I'm saying we start
46:27 to observe these soros itical
46:33 consciousness entities and then we start
46:37 talking to human beings in laboratories
46:39 and serve
46:40 psychological sessions we sit down
46:45 someone with their loved one a newlywed
46:47 couple and we track all of the you know
46:53 the CERN Hadron Collider offshoot energy
46:58 that comes from these two entities
46:59 ourself and then these parasitical x'
47:02 and then we put it into someone that
47:04 they hate the changes we put them in
47:08 suspicious situations where you know we
47:12 introduced a fake bully into the
47:15 restaurant they're about to eat in the
47:16 he eyeballs the guy across the room we
47:20 do it with a more feminine man who's
47:24 never gonna protect himself and then we
47:25 put in the the giant alpha male that's
47:27 like what the [ __ ] you looking at right
47:30 and we watch and we watch and we watch
47:32 and we track and we find out the
47:35 ecosystem involves us may be needing
47:40 this other consciousness but perhaps we
47:43 figure out a way to remove the
47:46 parasitical attachment and we watch the
47:50 transformation of the person
47:55 and maybe something miraculous occurs
47:59 how many of you believe that man had
48:02 incredible powers in the past but
48:04 doesn't have any real attachment to that
48:07 or capability to enact that today
48:10 example we don't know how the pyramids
48:13 were built how Stonehenge was uprighted
48:16 the original one all these different
48:19 Machu Picchu places Aztec pyramids but
48:22 what happened was they were unaffected
48:26 by this alien consciousness and they
48:31 simply moved rocks with their minds they
48:34 were merely limited by the designs that
48:36 they could conceive of mathematically in
48:37 their brain why didn't the Egyptians
48:41 write down how they made the pyramids
48:43 mm-hmm
48:45 because everybody could build a pyramid
48:47 they just thought well why'd would we
48:50 write down how to walk everybody can
48:52 walk but no what does any sort of force
48:59 try to do put it that way
49:02 it tries to control or it inadvertently
49:05 controls by design what if the taste of
49:08 love and communal behavior it's not like
49:14 it doesn't taste okay but it doesn't
49:17 taste as good as the forbidden taboos of
49:20 hatred and deceit and what if those who
49:25 run the world well they've done this
49:29 episode a few thousand years ago and
49:34 maybe they have different names for it
49:35 maybe they call these parasitical beings
49:38 demons suppose so
49:42 and they're mine they may not have a
49:45 canoe they may not really conceive of
49:47 what they're doing to you they just need
49:51 to eat and so they are a feral parasite
49:55 that simply says I realized or we have
49:57 realized and we have figured out that if
50:00 you have this little blip and the
50:03 consciousness of the creature that
50:05 you're on top of you anti blip this
50:08 and it seems to make them respond like
50:12 what if you had a part of your
50:13 consciousness that was anger it is to be
50:16 activated at a time when you need to fin
50:19 your self off right alcoholics that give
50:22 very angry and belligerent and physical
50:24 what's going on with that person's brain
50:27 you can tell them when they sober up is
50:28 your body is being attacked it's having
50:31 the the level of oxygen in the blood
50:35 depleted and so you're starting to die
50:38 your livers rotting your brain is dying
50:40 and so you are lashing out to stop the
50:44 infection of what you put in your mouth
50:47 but you're hurting your loved ones and
50:49 random people but what if there's that
50:51 anger gland inside your consciousness
50:53 and this thing just goes it just plays
50:56 you like a drum I got some anger and
51:00 some love in there got some taboo taboo
51:01 taboo you know and it creates this
51:05 manipulating pattern on top of you but
51:08 you don't know what's there all these
51:11 cultures that are out there right you
51:14 know I mean could you imagine it
51:16 arriving in some alien race some
51:20 spaceship that lands and they've got it
51:22 attached to them it's an infection it
51:25 comes in from outer space if it really
51:27 exists right maybe it manifests out of
51:32 the mutation of another human being I'm
51:35 giving you guys who are writers total
51:37 premise here let's go for this right if
51:40 any of you know Steven Moffat I've got a
51:43 whole season treatment for Doctor Who
51:46 that'll blow your mind but anyway this
51:49 bacteria maybe it starts in Europe maybe
51:53 it started in Rome maybe it became
51:57 something that could infect a human
51:58 being once human beings became really
52:01 devious way beyond the primitive man
52:05 that may have hit a girl on the head and
52:07 done something to her she didn't want
52:09 done because he simply doesn't know what
52:11 the hell he's doing
52:14 but imagine they travel with this
52:18 parasite on them that procreates based
52:21 on its
52:22 feeding regimen on the human
52:24 consciousness they bring it to Egypt and
52:28 then all of a sudden everyone gets
52:29 infected and no one can think about and
52:32 remember I can't move the rock today
52:36 yeah me neither
52:38 oh well let's go over here isn't it
52:44 interesting that the the megalithic
52:46 structures that exist have a timeline
52:51 right so you've got the Egyptian
52:53 pyramids and temples and what have you
52:56 and then it later on you've got Machu
53:00 Picchu which again the years they tell
53:03 you these things are created are usually
53:04 to protect white people's history right
53:07 there's no way to date a rock okay they
53:10 try to create the dating technique with
53:12 the oxidization of the outer particles
53:14 of Iraq whatever whatever that Machu
53:19 Picchu could have been the first place
53:20 but anyway
53:22 imagine you travel to South America you
53:24 shut everybody's brain down with this
53:25 [ __ ] it just ends Christopher Columbus
53:29 arrives and it ends because he spread
53:32 the virus now man is based on mechanical
53:37 capability not conscious capability
53:40 there's the old movie Forbidden Planet
53:42 which I talk about a lot the premise of
53:45 the movie is that there was an ancient
53:46 race called the krill and they had
53:51 developed a machine to take them from
53:53 needing bodies to exist to living in
53:56 pure consciousness and I won't ruin the
54:00 movie for you but when they turned on
54:01 the machine all hell broke loose okay
54:05 you owe it to yourself to see that movie
54:07 let me tell you I don't give a [ __ ] how
54:08 old you are whether it's your boy or
54:10 girl it's kind of romance in it it's got
54:12 Leslie Nielsen as a young handsome man
54:15 1956
54:16 I forgot that woman's name but man she's
54:19 beautiful too mm-hmm you'll find that
54:24 the science in that movie is so dead on
54:26 to this show I guess I probably imitated
54:31 it from knowing it but
54:33 imagine that going backwards instead of
54:35 forwards you had no body and you made a
54:38 body what if we were pure consciousness
54:41 I mean here's the thing if you believe
54:43 in reincarnation or a soul then you're
54:47 not too far off from believing that we
54:50 actually are as I suggest several times
54:52 in this show a soul consciousness right
54:56 sa soul because that's sort of what
54:59 we're familiar with your spirit
55:01 but now if we can exist and maintain our
55:04 identity as this consciousness because
55:07 we're unaffected by mass right by ether
55:11 particles we join the relationship with
55:15 Annie throw a particle beam but we flow
55:18 through perhaps like a red dye through
55:22 water right now it doesn't have to be
55:25 again this parasitical creature the
55:28 alien may not exist let's put that way
55:31 it may simply be the echoes of
55:33 consciousness around you the reason why
55:36 I tend to lean away from that and my
55:38 personal experience is that I feel like
55:40 I spend a fair amount of time in
55:43 solitude doing my work and the visions
55:48 that I see are very proprietary to my
55:51 life it includes people that I know
55:54 includes my characters in my world and
55:57 therefore I think that if it was just a
56:00 generic archetype flying around the
56:01 neighborhood which it very well may be
56:04 then by the time it gets to us it is
56:08 specific you know could you imagine well
56:13 I'll give you a real-life example I had
56:15 a neighbor have neighbors who are
56:18 married married forever super couple you
56:21 know nothing's ever gonna shake him up
56:23 but the husband went off and bought some
56:25 jet skis it didn't tell the wife and
56:27 then he went off and bought a I think
56:30 maybe wasn't the jet skis me it was the
56:32 golf cart now in the end dad created a
56:36 lot of fun in the house and the wife was
56:38 actually totally cool with it the end
56:40 but it's a shocker when someone comes
56:41 home with something that costs two or
56:44 three thousand dollars right
56:46 but now I went across the street and she
56:49 was in the throes of being surprised and
56:55 and she wasn't exactly thrilled that he
56:58 came home with this item and again it's
57:00 turned into a very positive thing for
57:04 the family and for many reasons but
57:05 anyway now if I was over in my office
57:07 working and I started stressing about
57:13 buying something that I didn't need to
57:15 buy well I didn't do that so hmm
57:18 I haven't walked crushed she basically
57:20 and found that what I was thinking in
57:22 the in my office was I an identical
57:24 archetype of what someone was thinking
57:26 across the street but what about dreams
57:29 we I've done several episodes on dreams
57:33 I am brewing up additional episodes for
57:37 dreams but I don't want to repeat myself
57:38 I just plagiarize a new episode but how
57:44 would this affect your unconsciousness
57:47 because at best when you put your body
57:49 to sleep you are probably living in the
57:54 playground of your consciousness it's
57:58 almost as if you need a break right as I
58:00 always say it's like why do you sleep
58:02 there's no sense in that he's not every
58:06 damn day why are some people night owls
58:09 right some people might think it's a
58:11 cyclical thing with the Sun I don't know
58:15 I've been a night owl for so long it
58:18 doesn't make any sense I would stay up
58:20 late as a child as an adult oh my god
58:24 I've had regiments where I stayed up for
58:26 a year working a 12-hour shift
58:30 programming that night I show up at 6:00
58:33 and I'd leave at 6:00 I didn't feel
58:37 weird I slept all day and I felt a
58:41 little strange when I straighten out
58:42 lever once and want to go do something
58:43 with my friends but the weird thing for
58:46 me is that when I'm awake the positive
58:49 things as I've said to you guys several
58:51 times those are yours when you love
58:53 something that's almost categorically
58:56 your thought but when you start being
58:58 angry
58:59 and hating things that's usually where
59:02 you need to be really kind of like is
59:03 this really me like I don't really feel
59:05 like I have any hatred towards anybody
59:07 or intolerance or whatever and you'll
59:11 find out 99% of the time it's just a
59:15 it's just a movie playing in front of
59:17 you it's not your thought it didn't come
59:19 from your heart you don't have any
59:21 vested ownership with this of this
59:23 vision that you're seeing but now when
59:26 you're asleep wouldn't these things tear
59:30 you apart because how much control that
59:32 we have in dreams in the first place
59:34 right
59:35 most of us again in a dream you don't
59:39 have a body you imagine that you have a
59:43 body you may see your hands do things
59:46 and see your legs do things and you
59:49 might feel something someone might touch
59:51 you for a split second and you manifest
59:53 that thought I've definitely had a dream
59:56 when I was a kid and I forgot to mention
59:58 where I had grabbed something from
60:02 somewhere was like some little soft
60:03 thing and I could really feel it in my
60:07 hand and then I woke up and it was like
60:11 I still had my hand gripped in real life
60:13 and I thought oh my god I pulled this
60:14 out of my dream and I look at my hand
60:15 it's empty and I'm like mother I told
60:19 you guys I used to have nightmares as a
60:22 kid and when I say nightmares we're
60:25 talking about I don't mean to dramatize
60:29 this up but I really think this is true
60:31 probably from at least four years old to
60:36 seven years old and it was like if I
60:39 remembered dreaming it was a nightmare
60:42 the way I stopped it was I got sick and
60:46 [ __ ] tired of this thing that was
60:48 terrorizing me the dreams weren't always
60:49 the same like again my toys would come
60:51 after me and there's this mannequin
60:54 thing that would just terrorize me and
60:58 it was using my mother's voice it was
61:00 really strange my mom never beat me up
61:03 or anything the thing would put me in an
61:05 impossible scenario that I had it was
61:07 going to fail and there was gonna be
61:08 great penalties if I failed and so
61:11 eventually I just beat
61:13 living [ __ ] out of this thing in a dream
61:15 and after that I started having positive
61:19 exquisite scientific explore the
61:24 universe kind of dreams right
61:25 and one more occurrence I think when I
61:28 was 12 and that was it I fought it again
61:30 immediately when it came at me man it
61:32 was like it's on you know I'm not
61:34 letting you terrorize me for one goddamn
61:35 second you're gonna fear me way more
61:37 than I fear you and it was a knock-down
61:41 drag-out fight literally in the dream
61:44 and I never saw it again but I tell you
61:48 what if I did it would run for me trust
61:51 me and that's that's the way I handle
61:54 any being that's coming after me in a
61:56 dream I'll shoot them a hole it's not
62:02 that I won't be afraid but I just stand
62:05 my ground I'm just like either you're
62:07 gonna kill me or I'm gonna kill you so
62:08 let's get this let's get this [ __ ]
62:10 over with right it's interesting but now
62:14 what happened to stop the nightmare I
62:17 woke up realized I had power and I
62:20 realized eventually as an adult that I
62:21 have complete control of my dreams I go
62:24 full lucid almost ii did something
62:26 threatens me in a dream it was a
62:30 paradigm upgrade a shift very important
62:36 because what i'm trying to give you is a
62:39 shift that i've had in my mind that has
62:42 given me authority over my own life when
62:47 it comes to what is my thoughts and what
62:49 is perhaps an alien thought the human
62:53 bunny to make me run after something now
62:56 i'm gonna repeat something i've said a
62:58 couple times over 320 episodes so
63:00 hopefully this is a good little reminder
63:06 for those of you remember this little
63:07 statement I heard once I was in a
63:11 convenience store in New York City I'm
63:15 pretty sure that's where it was and some
63:18 guy came in to the convenience store who
63:22 the owner knew but the owner hadn't seen
63:24 him in a while
63:25 and he said how you doing man I'm doing
63:28 great man
63:30 and that's probably all the guy needed
63:35 to hear from the other dude but he the
63:37 guy kept talking he goes you know I
63:39 guess the thing is like the guy had had
63:41 some issues and he was kind of the dude
63:45 who came into the store was kind of a
63:47 little more simple let's just put that
63:50 way and he said you know he comes back
63:53 to the guy he was you know I don't let
63:55 people I don't let people rent space in
63:57 my brain I was like what the hell does
64:00 that mean any guys like yeah I hear what
64:03 you're saying man and his whole thing
64:05 was he goes I don't let someone crawl up
64:07 my ass and ruin my life I live my life I
64:11 control my mind and that's it and think
64:15 about that analogy versus the alien
64:17 consciousness idea this parasitical
64:18 consciousness that might feed off of
64:20 human thought he doesn't let them in to
64:24 his mind he owns his own thoughts what
64:29 could be more powerful than you owning
64:30 your own thoughts right here's what I
64:33 think is very important you if you can
64:38 get behind what I'm saying and if any of
64:40 this rings true to you once I tell you
64:42 because sometimes you can't unsee what
64:44 you see right once you experience it
64:46 once you're like oh oh totally cool I
64:49 got control now the ones that you
64:52 reprocess or when you get really good at
64:55 it you'll just know you say those are my
64:58 thoughts and thus those are real real
65:02 occurrences of the way that you think
65:04 they're based on things that you either
65:06 want to have happen or things that are
65:08 currently happening or things that have
65:10 happened in the past meaning I have been
65:12 loved I'm being loved and I'm going to
65:14 love anytime you have these visions
65:18 again you see them you see them just
65:21 like looking out the window of your car
65:22 did you put the factory there did you
65:25 put the road sign there did you put them
65:27 all there did you put the person cross
65:29 in the street no that's occurring in
65:31 front of you I know once you get
65:33 confused here because the ones out the
65:35 window are real right but the ones that
65:38 are just this imagine
65:39 any movie that's being played for you
65:42 that's not real that's not real at all
65:46 what do we say on this show about
65:48 manifest reality well you know if you
65:52 concentrate on something and so many of
65:55 us and I don't mean to repeat myself so
65:56 I'll go off slightly a different track
65:58 when you fear something you sometimes
66:03 bring it into fruition
66:05 it's magical yeah and a horrible way
66:09 sometimes but then you can be an
66:12 athletic person this is where the
66:14 analogy gets most mentioned in our
66:16 reality I just watched a like a top top
66:21 20 knockouts or something video on
66:23 YouTube and this one guy said it was
66:26 that was all about cocky boxers getting
66:29 their asses kicked right away with the
66:31 guy that actually won the interview and
66:33 they said before the fight and he said
66:35 do you think you're gonna beat this guy
66:36 and he's like yeah he goes I've been
66:37 doing my visualizations and he goes
66:39 every single time I win and he knocked
66:42 this dude cold who'd never been knocked
66:44 out in his whole career having control
66:47 of your consciousness it was probably
66:49 the most powerful thing you can possibly
66:50 do but you want it to be effortless and
66:53 you want it to be automatic so you need
66:55 to get really good at this but again if
66:57 you're not having any of this then you
66:59 are fortunate you have very positive
67:02 outlook on life and perhaps whatever you
67:06 produce is not that interesting to them
67:08 but like I hinted in my previous episode
67:11 which I cannot remember the name of that
67:14 thing they will get bored of you the
67:18 less that you feed them so don't feed
67:23 them don't feed your anger don't feed
67:26 your suspicions your accusations it
67:31 doesn't mean you can't continue to
67:33 possess the ability to defend yourself
67:36 or to have insight into things right you
67:39 do need to be coherent when you're in a
67:42 business with other people you know
67:44 partners you need to be coherent when
67:47 you're having a relationship maybe it is
67:50 taking a little turn for the
67:53 and you need to change yourself or you
67:55 need to address it with your partner
67:56 it's not to remove your analytical
67:59 abilities I think what you will find is
68:01 that your true consciousness your true
68:03 mind when reprocessing certain thoughts
68:06 will say yeah that that one is mine I'm
68:08 a little bit concerned that my loved one
68:11 drinks too much or they spend too much
68:13 money or whatever it is and maybe I'll
68:15 find a way in a time to mention this
68:18 maybe they have friends that have done
68:20 that I'll simply recall that story and
68:23 not associate it to them and whatsoever
68:26 what are the odds I'm making a show in
68:28 my backyard
68:29 the closest corner I've got with my
68:31 neighbor they have to [ __ ] tear down
68:32 a tree at the same time I think you feel
68:35 me on this be very interested to hear
68:38 because I don't believe I got a lot of
68:39 comments with the very first version of
68:41 this episode but it's something that has
68:43 given me a level of clarity that is hard
68:47 to describe level of control
68:49 that is really Pleasant and it you know
68:57 it's I think it does occur when one
68:59 opens oneself up to storytelling
69:01 especially I think a lot of us know that
69:04 we have a lot more capabilities than we
69:06 acknowledge as humans and I think a lot
69:10 of you understand that we have
69:11 potentially lost amazing capabilities as
69:14 human beings maybe that's incorrect but
69:18 I would think that you know I'll give
69:23 you an analogy that I know that you
69:25 understand which is mass media spreads
69:31 hatred right when project mockingbird
69:36 got greenlit you have the military and
69:38 the intelligence agencies probably more
69:41 the intelligence agencies getting
69:43 involved with the narratives of who is
69:45 bad and who was good the Russians are
69:48 bad the four Americans we have been told
69:50 Russians are horrible at times the
69:53 Japanese were horrible because of World
69:55 War two
69:56 obviously the Germans and Nazis that was
69:59 a very compartmentalize hatred because
70:02 we couldn't hate our white
70:04 European cousins over there even though
70:07 Russians are white as well in some cases
70:09 right I see that from a very biased
70:14 white man's perspective but I just want
70:15 you to know that's the it's the [ __ ]
70:17 they fed us right it's just like
70:18 mushrooms keep us in the dark and feed
70:21 is [ __ ] and so I know that we have
70:24 been probably at times more peaceful
70:27 with each other and then became filled
70:29 with rage when you when you study the
70:31 Crusades of the Catholic Church it's
70:35 insane how all these people in Europe
70:37 were just farmers taking care of their
70:39 families and then all of a sudden the
70:42 church comes through and says you need
70:44 to drop your your backhoe here and or
70:47 your hoe and come with us and fight this
70:49 war against what we're gonna tell you
70:51 our evil people which at the time were
70:52 Arabs and they ended up slaughtering a
70:55 Christian village in their first
70:56 endeavor now of course a lot of that has
70:59 to do with the elders of a particular
71:02 region of a particular race saying we
71:05 need to don't you like we're awesome
71:07 right so let's procreate and kill
71:09 everybody was in us how we're going to
71:11 convince people to do that because they
71:13 could die in the process I was just
71:14 invented religion okay we know how the
71:19 internet corrupts the salt you know what
71:22 if what if the world's round in space
71:26 exists the satellites exist and then all
71:29 of a sudden clutter comes around as this
71:31 SIOP from the intelligence agency to
71:33 weed out folks that are susceptible and
71:36 and it creates a divide and division
71:38 right but now closing statement couldn't
71:44 this entire conversation be construed as
71:48 one crazy human being talking about is
71:51 defective mind couldn't that be a a
71:54 prohibitive control mechanism to make
72:00 sure that you and I don't analyze our
72:04 minds our consciousness
72:07 I mean obviously people in mental
72:11 institutions look what we might call
72:13 crazy I've got a trash truck on one side
72:16 and this crazy [ __ ] cutting [ __ ]
72:18 down his back yard over here oh I know
72:21 what he's doing he's getting rid of a
72:23 bunch of vines that have been growing
72:25 all over our [ __ ] I'm gonna kaleidoscope
72:28 of [ __ ] sounds here should do
72:31 off-duty Foley work here wait to the
72:34 trash truck leaves here we have three
72:36 trash trucks to drive by one for the the
72:39 green one for the trash and one for
72:42 recycling but now have you ever thought
72:44 about the fact that a quote-unquote
72:46 crazy person is actually truly dialed
72:50 into these parasitical consciousness
72:54 beings and it is utterly chaotic once
72:58 you dial in like being a person who all
73:00 the sudden can hear everybody's thoughts
73:02 and so after that point they are hearing
73:09 logical things perhaps they're hearing
73:10 other people's thoughts here on earth or
73:12 hearing like human consciousness they're
73:14 hearing this weird manipulated
73:17 consciousness and they are simply
73:19 reacting to it without the faculties
73:21 that we're gaining by talking to each
73:23 other on this show right anyway it's
73:25 food for thought isn't it we are so
73:29 hubris that we are the top species in
73:31 the universe and then we understand
73:33 everything and it's science what the
73:34 capitalist understands everything but I
73:40 think it's clear that we don't and I
73:43 think that a lot of folks will say we
73:47 don't understand everything but we
73:48 understand most of everything I love
73:51 that one it's the kubler-ross it's the
73:55 negotiation stage of kubler-ross
73:57 well I don't want to have to say I'm not
73:59 the dominant species in this universe so
74:01 what I'll do is kind of say well I'm I'm
74:03 really close to the tippy-top right you
74:07 have to say it is a hell of a thing
74:08 being the top species of a particular
74:10 planet right isn't it wild as far as we
74:15 know with
74:17 physical bodies in this planet for the
74:21 sake of a lack of a better word for some
74:23 of you guys we're it now there may be
74:27 some consciousness out there's some
74:29 flying discs in space and that you know
74:32 that feed off of our atmosphere or
74:33 whatever the hell we think we're seeing
74:35 up there but we're it and I what's
74:39 interesting about that is obviously we
74:41 have gained responsibilities that other
74:46 creatures don't not like does a there's
74:48 a mountain lion have to worry about
74:50 deforestation no does a whale have to
74:54 worry about you know the Chinese fish
74:57 nets that are destroying the pacific
74:59 ocean floor no it's just really really
75:02 sad that you know when you really [ __ ]
75:07 up your train of thought let me tell you
75:09 you know it would seem the man is
75:11 gaining the mechanical power to destroy
75:14 the world faster than its gaining the
75:17 sentient consciousness of responsibility
75:20 of what that means right Brazil selling
75:23 its forests to China who's going to cut
75:25 that [ __ ] straight down to the
75:27 stumps and walk away right now they've
75:30 also bought all of the ports serve all
75:33 the ports in Africa because they're
75:35 about to rape that continent dry with no
75:39 causality it would seem that they're
75:42 gonna destroy the planet at the same
75:44 time they're not the only ones they're
75:46 just gonna do it bigger and better than
75:48 everybody else that's all so I think
75:50 it's important because we are the
75:52 dominant species in this world that we
75:55 gain as much control over ourselves as
75:56 possible and you know in the end it's
75:59 all about treating each other better all
76:02 right I think that's all I got on this
76:05 one if you haven't been a deep thoughts
76:07 radio com that's where you go to switch
76:09 your feeds from video the audio audio to
76:11 video there's a lakh Facebook group it
76:14 was a patreon page and currently there's
76:17 a store link that's all I'm gonna say
76:19 today take care of yourself in someone
76:21 else and I'll see on the next deep
76:22 thoughts over now
76:24 [Music]
76:33 you
