00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:37 deep thoughts
00:38 today's episode may offend brand new
00:41 listeners
00:43 it may make some of you really happy i
00:45 don't know
00:47 it's called alpha and omega which
00:50 probably isn't very obvious right off
00:52 the bat unless you read the description
00:56 which if you're like me you kind of like
00:57 not reading it and then just jumping in
00:59 and see what happens here
01:01 there has been a saying
01:06 sometimes turned into a meme
01:09 it's been going around for a few years
01:12 and every time i see it i just cringe
01:17 because it's usually being posted by
01:18 someone i know
01:20 and it's hard to put it into words how
01:24 utterly frumpy the entire logic of this
01:28 saying goes how
01:32 i don't know i don't even know how to
01:34 say
01:36 weak-minded this saying goes how
01:39 unobservant
01:40 this saying goes how
01:43 utterly brain dead the person who posts
01:45 it must
01:46 be in real life
01:49 how fragile they must be inadvertently
01:53 they're scapegoaters and they don't know
01:56 but the same will go like this
01:59 the saying accuses all men
02:04 of being afraid of strong women
02:08 and it's just a real interesting
02:11 archetype
02:12 of a post because this will
02:15 most naturally come from a couple
02:17 different groups i don't have any young
02:19 female friends
02:20 okay i have young female relatives
02:24 but they don't post in this crap
02:27 even my liberal ones they know better
02:31 so it's usually someone i'd say maybe
02:34 between 35
02:36 and 60 somewhere in there
02:39 the post is kind of stuck and maybe some
02:43 men have never thought about the concept
02:44 you know there's like oh really strong
02:46 weak woman oh i guess never really
02:48 thought about how strong a weak a woman
02:49 is i just like women and i get along
02:51 with them and everything's fine
02:53 i'm assuming the kind of women that post
02:55 this stuff are women that
02:56 are having a problem finding a mate
02:59 perhaps
03:00 maybe they've had an isolated experience
03:03 where
03:04 something didn't go right in the
03:06 relationship
03:08 and for whatever reason they want a
03:12 foe story
03:15 so that when they come out of the bad
03:16 relationship of which
03:18 may have not been their fault at all
03:21 they latch onto this but i i would say
03:24 it's a tiny tiny percentage of women
03:26 that would ever post such a thing but
03:27 i've seen it several times the last
03:28 several years
03:30 and i by several i might might be
03:33 totaling up maybe six in three years
03:36 but it just it's just one of those
03:38 things you're like oh come on seriously
03:40 you really one read this two thought it
03:43 was true and three
03:44 i thought it was a really good idea to
03:46 post it out there
03:48 which i guess is the
03:51 sort of passive-aggressive technique of
03:53 trying to say
03:54 hear me roar george carlin opened a
03:58 routine a couple times with the phrase
04:00 isn't it interesting that the women that
04:02 are
04:04 for abortion are the exact kind of women
04:06 you'd never want to have sex with in the
04:08 first place
04:09 i get the feeling that it's sort of
04:11 those women
04:13 could be wrong
04:16 isn't it interesting though when all
04:18 these these classic feminists and you
04:20 can go back to
04:22 was eleanor roosevelt which wow
04:25 she's a powerful intelligent woman but
04:27 man
04:29 was it franklin was one
04:33 accepting guy so what does alfred omega
04:36 have to do with this statement
04:39 it finally clicked in my brain a few
04:40 nights ago such that i could write it
04:42 down on a piece of paper to tell another
04:44 friend
04:45 and i'm going to assign
04:49 alpha and omega as it has been literally
04:52 referenced several times as the
04:55 perfect balance between yin and yang the
04:58 man is the ying
04:59 the woman is the yang it makes no
05:02 difference but that's how the
05:03 creators of that saying divide up the
05:06 sexes
05:08 an alpha male is a complete male
05:12 he knows his responsibility he knows his
05:14 place in society
05:15 he uses his attributes of upper body
05:17 strength to do what he can do
05:19 that his wife can't do the omega female
05:23 is your consummate strong female
05:27 who knows her place in society and she
05:29 can do things the guys can
05:32 they are equal in different ways
05:35 typically the man is more left-brained
05:37 as the egyptians would say
05:38 he is the logical hunter using his upper
05:41 body strength and his up
05:42 his body strength in general his
05:44 endurance to go out and hunt
05:47 the woman is the right brain nurturer
05:50 she knows how to build the intellectual
05:52 capacity of a family she knows how to
05:54 raise a child
05:55 she knows how to look into a child's eye
05:57 and see directly into their soul
05:59 to know their needs to provide
06:02 she nurtures her man she nurtures her
06:04 kids and she takes care of herself and
06:06 hopefully the man is also protecting
06:08 that institution
06:10 he is providing in a traditional sense
06:12 before the last 40 years
06:15 he goes and gets the money goes and gets
06:17 the resource
06:19 if for any reason a man starts to
06:24 misbehave and belittle his wife
06:28 and sanction money
06:31 for favors or behaviors
06:34 then he is no longer an alpha
06:38 he is slowly turning into a little [ __ ]
06:42 and so if you're going to be referencing
06:44 those guys and your mind is alphas
06:46 i'm going to say that's incorrect
06:50 a good man is kind
06:54 he has chivalry depending on what kind
06:58 of woman he has
06:59 as her dictated by her preference he may
07:02 never
07:02 utter a swear word in her presence
07:06 he toots her like a queen and she treats
07:08 him like a king
07:09 when they cuddle up together at night he
07:12 is loving every morsel
07:14 of her femininity and she is loving
07:17 every morsel
07:18 of his masculinity it is a ying
07:21 and a yang a balance a left brain and
07:24 the right brain
07:26 again is the egyptians espoused
07:29 it is the job
07:32 believe it or not of the woman
07:36 to usher the man into full enlightenment
07:40 she will usher herself into her
07:42 enlightenment
07:43 using the example of her male because
07:46 she is more intellectual
07:48 he is more myopic he is more blinders on
07:52 i get up and do this thing every day his
07:55 needs like dr laura would say is
07:57 sex food sleep those are his basic
08:01 fundamental needs she understands the
08:04 more abstract because she is right brain
08:06 she sees the world as it truly exists
08:09 he sees it as a bizarre linear loop
08:12 until
08:13 she can convince him probably through
08:17 inadvertent subliminal techniques
08:20 to grow his right brain she over time
08:24 if she doesn't already have it quickly
08:26 we'll learn the left side
08:29 but she is the usher she is
08:32 mother to the entire family including
08:36 her alpha male the statues
08:39 in egypt of king tut will often have his
08:42 wife
08:43 with her right arm around his waist
08:46 visible on the right side of his rib
08:48 cage
08:50 signifying the relationship and the
08:53 responsibility model
08:55 the nurturing model of the woman but
08:58 also
08:59 the mentor of the man
09:03 one is not less than the other in
09:06 principle
09:08 now because life is chaotic and has its
09:11 surprises here and there
09:13 in the past this formula has obviously
09:16 wobbled
09:16 within relationships within marriages
09:19 and people will have
09:20 unfortunate stories about how a
09:22 particular
09:23 era in a relationship happened
09:27 you know sometimes relationships are
09:28 really good at the beginning and sort of
09:30 fall apart
09:31 as two people grow apart other times and
09:36 there's a couple of my own family
09:37 where they married out of convenience or
09:39 obligation
09:42 and weren't really close at the
09:44 beginning
09:46 and then over 20 years 30 years they
09:48 grew to absolutely be inseparable
09:52 being growing to a point where there was
09:54 nothing
09:55 and there is nothing that they wouldn't
09:56 do for their spouse
09:58 either way the alpha in a traditional
10:03 sense of the nuclear family when a
10:05 society is balanced and not being
10:07 interrupted
10:08 by agendas
10:11 is a honored institution it is balanced
10:17 if there's any envy between the male and
10:19 the female for each other's capabilities
10:22 it is merely an incidental recognition
10:24 of those capabilities
10:26 it is a brief brush with envy
10:30 but then there's also
10:33 a retreat back to
10:36 their own strengths and their own
10:38 identity defined by those strengths
10:42 so what's the problem the problem is
10:45 this
10:47 in my opinion
10:51 and you know i i do express my opinion
10:53 in every episode
10:54 this one's a very touchy one that i
10:56 typically don't touch
10:58 but i think i'd like to start the
10:59 dialogue i'd like to get this one into
11:02 your mind so you can
11:05 mulch it tell me what you think
11:08 the problem now is that we have
11:11 what i believe to be this
11:16 i want to call it an alpha female and
11:19 the problem with an alpha female
11:21 is that it really can't complete itself
11:23 it can't truly exist
11:25 except for maybe one and you know 100
11:27 million
11:28 women could actually possibly pull this
11:30 completely off
11:31 at least on the physical attribute level
11:35 but on a mental level i haven't seen it
11:37 pulled off yet i
11:38 have been told by women that they don't
11:41 believe their children need fathers
11:43 i don't think a father in my
11:47 entire life experience has ever uttered
11:49 even the
11:50 semblance of the inverse phrase
11:54 even though i've got a couple buddies
11:55 that were stuck with
11:57 a broken marriage and thus had to raise
12:00 their children and did amazing jobs at
12:02 it
12:02 without the female influence on their
12:04 side and they were concerned
12:06 that the female wasn't there some of
12:08 them had a chance to remarry and
12:10 replenish that missing resource and
12:12 others never had the opportunity
12:14 but here's the rub an alpha female
12:20 will never be attracted to an alpha male
12:23 an alpha female i think has a mental
12:25 psychosis
12:27 she's been programmed through
12:29 gullibility to be something that she is
12:31 not
12:31 to attempt to be something that she is
12:33 not instead of honoring what she truly
12:35 is and this has nothing to do
12:37 with being gay these are straight
12:39 heterosexual people i'm talking about
12:44 but she will inevitably be insecure
12:48 well she is insecure which is why she
12:49 has gone this route in the first place
12:51 as much as she thinks she is engaging in
12:54 acts of
12:55 heroism and strength something that an
12:58 omega female does every single day
13:01 the alpha is off
13:04 trying to do things that are not meant
13:07 to be
13:09 but because it's a social construct of
13:12 the mind
13:14 she will tend almost unanimously
13:17 if she doesn't remain single her entire
13:19 life due to an inability to attract
13:21 someone
13:22 that she would be attracted to in the
13:24 first place
13:25 almost invariably the alpha female
13:28 will be only attracted to a beta male
13:32 and we know that there are movements to
13:34 create beta males
13:37 that's why we have more on planet earth
13:39 now than ever before
13:41 but what is a beta male a beta male
13:45 doesn't recognize who he is
13:49 he doesn't recognize even the omega
13:51 female
13:53 he doesn't supplant the other side i
13:56 have met gay men
13:57 who are omega females
14:01 and they do a damn good job at it even
14:03 if there's no children involved
14:05 there's still a partnership and it's
14:07 balanced
14:08 but the beta male is incapable of doing
14:12 what a traditional male can do the beta
14:16 male doesn't conceive of
14:19 alpha male responsibilities and i want
14:21 to repeat that
14:22 the beta male cannot and does not
14:26 conceive of them acting in any way
14:30 or shape of an alpha male
14:34 they can't hunt for food they can't
14:36 clean an animal if they happen to
14:38 stumble upon one
14:39 that has died recently they have an
14:42 inability to protect their
14:44 female if there's a noise in the middle
14:46 of the night
14:49 he's a pussycat hoping that his alpha
14:51 female
14:52 will know how to operate a gun
14:56 but since the alpha female is built out
14:58 of nothing but hubris and insecurities
15:01 and mental illness in my opinion she is
15:04 also incapable
15:06 so both of them become victims very
15:07 quickly of anything that's going on
15:10 so there's a lot of conspiracy channels
15:12 out there which will
15:14 uh have you know survival prepper
15:17 services that they co-sponsor their
15:20 channels with
15:22 they sell lots of food right and they'll
15:24 read you this big write act about how
15:25 uncertain times are coming you should
15:27 have at least
15:28 10 weeks of food in your home and water
15:30 and that kind of stuff and there's
15:31 nothing wrong with that
15:34 but let's just say they're right
15:37 let's just say america and this is just
15:39 a for instance to drill home the
15:41 importance
15:42 of the alpha and omega configuration
15:45 let's say that we are near some sort of
15:49 apocalyptic thing as punishment for
15:51 choosing our president and then
15:54 enforcing that result
15:57 and a certain deep state organization
16:00 wants to punish the united states
16:01 citizens for doing such a thing
16:03 they will show us is what they're
16:06 thinking
16:08 they blow up a few major cities they cut
16:10 our power supply
16:11 they cut our internet which would be
16:13 very tough to do because we will turn it
16:14 back on
16:15 a saboteur can only do their thing once
16:18 and they better destroy everything
16:20 because we'll build it back quickly
16:23 well let's say that we did enter some
16:25 sort of modern day apocalypse
16:28 nothing like the movies necessarily but
16:31 you never know
16:33 i guarantee that people in japan never
16:36 envisioned
16:37 their country being ripped apart by
16:39 water
16:40 but indeed that occurred catastrophic
16:43 things that they never thought they
16:44 would see
16:45 have already occurred nine years ago i
16:48 misquoted the date by the way 2013
16:50 on accident it's 2011 in a previous
16:53 episode
16:55 and so now you are married with children
16:57 or you're just married one of the two
17:00 you had your life pretty well dialed in
17:02 i mean you know 2020 has been hard but
17:04 let's just say you figured out a way to
17:05 stay alive
17:07 and now all of a sudden just finding
17:09 food to eat
17:12 is really really tough the tank of gas
17:14 you got in your car
17:15 well that's the last take of gas you're
17:17 ever going to have in your car for a
17:18 while
17:20 you could have bars of gold and
17:21 nothing's going to change anything
17:23 because this is an apocalyptic kind of
17:25 situation
17:27 the configuration that's going to be
17:29 well equipped
17:30 or should say hit the minimums is going
17:33 to be your alpha and omega
17:36 couples you know why
17:41 because an omega female will learn
17:45 quickly if she doesn't already know
17:47 before the marriage
17:49 how to take care of business to defend
17:52 her children
17:53 to defend even her husband if he's
17:55 incapacitated or he's
17:57 taken out targets that way and she's got
18:00 to take out targets that way because the
18:01 family's right here
18:03 i've told you guys several times in in
18:05 some of the earlier business episodes
18:09 that there is a an interesting
18:11 phenomenon that is not taught in
18:12 business schools because professors who
18:14 teach business schools typically have no
18:16 background never becoming an
18:17 entrepreneur so they're merely repeating
18:20 what they think is good information for
18:22 you
18:23 if you've ever started a business
18:27 you will know how difficult it is to be
18:30 a single
18:30 person running a business whether you're
18:33 married or not
18:34 is immaterial you are a one
18:37 x person no matter how hard you work you
18:40 will never eclipse
18:41 the work of one person because you are
18:44 one unit
18:46 however when you partner with someone
18:50 in a business who is working as hard as
18:53 you are
18:54 the results are bigger than 2x
18:58 for some reason it just happens
19:02 example the one of the most successful
19:05 businesses i've ever put together
19:08 my buddy and i we're making five
19:10 thousand dollars a piece a month
19:12 this is without taxes being taken out
19:16 we did this for a couple months maybe
19:18 three tops
19:19 and eventually said to him i said look
19:21 you know we need to form a company
19:22 because that's going to catalyze
19:24 everything that we're doing and he was
19:26 like sure let's do it
19:28 so we did it we formed a c corp thank
19:30 god because that got us two gigs that
19:32 wouldn't have come through if we were s
19:36 and our first gig out the door went from
19:38 us
19:39 collectively making 10k for the two of
19:41 us
19:42 and we were making a game a piece
19:46 for 5k a piece so two games
19:49 for 10 000 the first gig that we were
19:52 able to close
19:53 was a 55 000 deal to make
19:56 one game amazing
20:00 the next deal i signed was 180 000 to
20:03 make
20:03 one game on three different platforms
20:07 it was uphill uphill uphill in terms of
20:09 money
20:11 and that's when i look back at my past
20:13 and i said you know what every time i
20:14 try to do this by myself
20:17 it's like running in water the second i
20:19 collaborate with someone who's actually
20:21 business minded because i've
20:22 collaborated with a lot of
20:24 folks that are simply wishful thinkers
20:26 about who they are
20:28 god bless them
20:31 as soon as i find a partner that works
20:32 as hard as i do oh my god
20:35 sky's the limit and the multiplier
20:38 i think that almost the minimum
20:40 multiplier if two people are working
20:42 really hard at something
20:43 is 5x minimum multiplier
20:47 if you really work hard together and get
20:49 clever
20:52 it could be a hundred x easy
20:55 i mean divide 180 000 dollars by by
20:58 five grand with two people that was the
21:01 x for the next contract we got
21:03 just two of us the deal i did
21:06 actually two before that before we
21:08 started the business
21:09 we got 160 grand for three guys
21:12 all right that's the difference between
21:16 a perfectly balanced
21:19 what i would say nuclear family slash
21:22 almost homogeneous family built out of
21:25 an alpha and omega parent
21:27 couple the kids
21:30 in the alpha omega family grow up with
21:32 standards
21:35 the divorce rate in a truly alpha omega
21:38 relationship
21:39 is very very low but once you get these
21:43 alpha beta or i should say
21:46 beta alpha to maintain chronology in our
21:50 examples here
21:52 oh boy you got the guy coming in
21:56 who when we ask hey can you can you
21:59 stand smoke a cigar can you hang out at
22:00 the barbecue
22:02 i mean calm my wife see if i can do this
22:04 whole thing
22:05 and they just cower down into whatever
22:07 they're allowed to do
22:09 now the inverse is not to tell your wife
22:11 the way it is
22:12 by any means but the inverse typically
22:16 is the male has a free
22:20 slot in his schedule maybe multiple in a
22:23 week maybe one in a week doesn't matter
22:25 but he's already pre-agreed with his
22:27 partner in life
22:28 who understands his needs to have male
22:31 friends
22:32 because you know why she wants him to
22:35 come back that night
22:36 more alpha again not a person is gonna
22:41 use money and other things to manipulate
22:45 her
22:46 those horror stories are not what i'm
22:48 talking about
22:49 those people have fallen out of the
22:50 slide
22:52 he also wants her to have her female
22:55 friends because she maintains her
22:56 femininity
22:58 by being around other omegas now what is
23:01 not occurring in an alpha omega
23:02 relationship
23:04 in my opinion these are the people that
23:06 raised me
23:08 wasn't my parents it was my parents
23:10 parents
23:12 the dude isn't going to a strip bar the
23:15 chick isn't going to a nightclub with
23:17 their friends and pretending to be
23:18 single
23:20 they're not on you know what is it
23:22 tender
23:23 they're not on sites trying to hook up
23:24 on the side with children at home
23:26 wondering where mommy and daddy are
23:29 no there's probably a configuration of a
23:32 beta beta
23:33 as well two children pretending to be
23:37 in a relationship even though they've
23:39 consummated it
23:40 with rings and children
23:44 they got no business pretending to be
23:45 married i mean to each their own
23:49 but right we have choices we should make
23:52 good choices
23:55 and a lot of areas of the world they're
23:57 still arranging marriages
24:00 some areas of the world like north korea
24:03 they don't have words for gay
24:06 they don't have words for uh a lot of
24:09 things that
24:10 plague society we that we have over here
24:12 not the gay is a plague or anything
24:14 it's just they don't have the ability to
24:16 be tolerant because they don't have a
24:17 word for it
24:19 the girls will typically stay unengaged
24:23 with males all the way up to their
24:24 marriage
24:25 i mean unengaged
24:29 there's a incredible defector from north
24:31 korea who's now in the united states and
24:33 she creates a channel
24:35 and i can't possibly say her name
24:37 correctly
24:39 i think it's like yaomi or something
24:40 like that
24:42 she's an endearing person she's she just
24:44 did an episode or at least i just
24:46 watched it
24:47 but she was saying you know we are so
24:49 sequestered away from the opposite sex
24:51 while in north korea
24:52 that we but we don't know how babies are
24:53 made and we actually think that if you
24:55 hold hands
24:56 you'll get pregnant the outfit omega
24:59 communicate
25:00 they share everything the how to's
25:04 if the dude isn't feeling good he
25:06 doesn't
25:08 hesitate to tell his wife he may not
25:11 tell her was sobbing tears in his eyes
25:13 but he'll communicate somehow
25:15 but i guess but guess what an alpha
25:16 omega that is really connected at the
25:18 hip
25:19 and not being defensively cowardice in a
25:21 relationship like a beta to an alpha
25:23 female
25:24 who's like uh what is it the couple in
25:28 miles uh in fraser he was the beta
25:32 and i i'm trying to think of his wife's
25:34 name that you never ever saw in the
25:36 episode
25:37 she was the alpha and that didn't work
25:39 he was cowarding down to her the entire
25:41 time
25:43 it's imbalanced but an alpha omega
25:46 relationship
25:48 i can tell you i've been in them my
25:50 whole life i think
25:52 they can just hear the tone of your
25:54 voice on a telephone
25:57 and the most microscopic variation in
25:59 your normal deliverance of a sentence of
26:01 an answer
26:02 without you trying to exhibit such a
26:04 thing
26:05 they know they know man
26:10 i've had conversations over the last i
26:12 guess
26:13 33 plus years at times
26:17 it doesn't happen anymore but with my
26:20 high school sweetheart
26:21 because we check out on each other once
26:22 a while usually goes like three or four
26:24 years and then hey how you doing
26:25 whatever
26:26 but i tell you what i could chat with
26:27 her through text
26:29 back in the day say go back about 15 20
26:32 years
26:34 and she could just sense from the words
26:35 i am typing into a chat
26:38 exactly what's going on in my mind to an
26:41 unbelievable
26:42 empathic degree very rare emotions that
26:46 i
26:47 very rarely ever exhibit
26:50 amazing why mention this entire thing
26:54 aren't we in the middle of a gendered
26:56 fluidity where a grown man
26:58 can say that he can rape your boy
27:00 because he identifies as a
27:01 seven-year-old girl
27:05 i just saw another expose
27:08 of a [ __ ] reading
27:13 stories to little kids in a kindergarten
27:16 as if they go to school to get their
27:18 sexual identity
27:19 you were told it's a gene in your body
27:21 that determines who you are
27:23 orientation wise but this latest
27:26 insanity of the last 10 years should be
27:29 extremely insulting to the lgbt
27:31 community because it marginalizes
27:33 that argument well there's not a gene
27:36 that makes you a furry there's not a
27:37 gene that makes you
27:38 a ninja turtle those are social
27:41 constructs that are taught in the mind
27:45 so you know until we find this gene
27:48 we shouldn't be having sexual
27:50 orientation
27:53 conflicts in grade schools if your kid
27:55 is in a school that is conducting this
27:57 that is your responsibility in my
27:59 opinion to get your kid out of that
28:00 school or petition that that's not part
28:03 of the curriculum
28:04 now sex ed well that's probably an
28:06 important ed's class to have
28:08 at some point boys need to know and
28:10 girls need to know
28:12 about their own bodies and about how you
28:14 can procreate
28:15 girls need to learn ovulation that's one
28:17 thing that's never taught in america
28:19 i know a girl like i said she had two
28:21 kids and she was pregnant with the third
28:23 and i said and she was like kind of
28:24 mystified how she's having all these
28:26 kids and i said well when do you ovulate
28:28 and she goes what's that i can imagine
28:31 you get
28:32 pregnant on your first kid and no one
28:33 ever explained that to you it's your
28:35 parents obligation to sit the kids down
28:37 and do that
28:39 but how do you visit an ob gyn
28:42 to the extent you can deliver a baby in
28:44 a hospital and no one mentions it to you
28:46 that's how screwed up the system is and
28:49 that's the way they want it
28:52 if you're a parent or a grandparent well
28:55 you know how terrifying it is to know
28:56 that your children are stuck inside this
28:58 system
29:00 if you plan on being a parent boy you
29:03 hit the right episode
29:04 if you're not already turning this off
29:05 out of some protest
29:08 we won't balance on the world right
29:12 want healthy relationships in the world
29:13 because people's happiness
29:15 spills out into the world doesn't it why
29:18 do we have a gigantic group of
29:20 disenfranchised people on this planet
29:22 because they've been following crappy
29:24 advice for a really long time
29:27 they get more and more angry that
29:29 everything that they're told doesn't
29:30 work
29:30 or that they're not being told anything
29:32 and their guesses are inaccurate
29:35 and they don't want to admit it out of
29:36 hubris
29:38 and so they latch on to anything
29:41 to abstract away from themselves their
29:44 anger
29:45 so it's that thing you get back what you
29:46 put out well they're putting out really
29:48 bad vibes
29:50 a friend of mine who i love dearly she's
29:53 going to hear this
29:54 and i passed it on to other friends
29:56 which she had said and i really got some
29:57 interesting responses
29:59 but she said you know um i think that
30:02 you should
30:03 experiment she was talking about a drug
30:05 i should take
30:07 a very mild one because she said i think
30:09 it'll
30:10 help you get in touch with your feminine
30:12 side
30:13 and i totally understand it and i
30:15 absolutely respect your opinion
30:17 i said you know when i look back at my
30:20 past
30:22 i think what i have done in my older
30:24 ages
30:25 is naturally shed the beta training that
30:29 society was giving me
30:33 and so i look back at my past and i see
30:37 you know i was always a very masculine
30:39 guy
30:40 verbally but boy i bought into some
30:43 fashion that
30:44 really was uh pretty questionable you
30:46 know just sort of i mean it's always
30:47 kind of it's dude stuff but it was still
30:49 not what i would wear today and so i
30:52 drew this on a piece of paper i said
30:53 there's the alpha male but what you're
30:56 never told is about the omega female
30:58 you're just told [ __ ] alpha male
31:02 and poor woman who has to be beaten
31:04 every night and
31:05 beg for money and she has to do
31:07 everything the man says otherwise you
31:08 won't give her any spending money
31:10 which is the feminist fiction about the
31:12 past
31:13 did those things happen every once in a
31:15 while i'm sure they did but i guarantee
31:17 you in my little tiny town
31:19 if anyone was caught doing that to their
31:21 old lady the dudes would beat the living
31:23 [ __ ] out of the guy
31:26 i mean i've told you guys stories even
31:29 in high school
31:30 high school man or anything goes
31:34 one dude smacked his girlfriend
31:37 now she'd hit him too but
31:41 she was a petite thing and he had no
31:45 business pushing it back out to her
31:49 so his buddies took him out in the woods
31:51 and got him really drunk
31:52 and beat the living [ __ ] out of him and
31:55 as the people who did it told me
31:57 to the edge of his life and i don't know
31:59 he's like three to five miles outside of
32:01 town
32:02 and they just left him there and said
32:03 you walk your ass home
32:05 and you think about what you did because
32:07 we'll be back with some more
32:09 if we ever hear this behavior again and
32:11 magically
32:12 he behaved for the rest of his life so
32:14 far at least
32:17 you still see this sort of behavior
32:19 actually in third world countries
32:22 south america and asia especially china
32:25 i'll see these videos all the time
32:26 whether they're beating the living crap
32:28 out of somebody male or female
32:29 the females take care of the females and
32:31 the males take care of the males in
32:32 these countries
32:34 and they'll have the crime translated
32:37 in the video they're not killing these
32:40 people they're just
32:41 spanking them like adults that's all
32:45 it could be that a woman cheated a
32:48 single woman cheated
32:49 on a married man the males beat the crap
32:52 out of him till his face is bleeding
32:54 they take the girl out and they spank
32:55 them in south america they'll actually
32:57 take
32:57 in india especially they have a ritual
32:59 of taking hot peppers and rubbing it all
33:01 over their private parts
33:03 meanwhile the guy's getting his arms
33:04 broken all kinds of stuff they teach
33:07 each other what is acceptable and what
33:09 is not acceptable
33:11 you had a problem with your marriage try
33:12 to work it out doesn't work out
33:14 well formally divorce them at minimum
33:17 separate and let them know you're going
33:19 to go be with other people so that
33:22 there's no
33:23 heartbreak there but if you're going to
33:25 be with other people you might as well
33:26 just
33:27 cut the ties but i'm drawing this on a
33:30 piece of paper
33:31 and the next thing i drew was you know i
33:33 drew like a girl with boobs stick figure
33:35 guy with this little y chromosome
33:38 hanging down
33:39 and i drew another set down below and i
33:42 drew the woman taller
33:43 in the second section and the guy
33:44 smaller and i put an a on top of her
33:47 head
33:47 and a b on top of the dude's head i said
33:50 that is an alpha female
33:52 who's attracted to beta males again to
33:55 each their own if you can make it work
33:57 if you want to be a stockholm syndrome
33:58 dude your whole life then just
34:00 just go do it if that makes you happy
34:02 i'm not trying to change your mind
34:04 but for any of you that are trying to
34:06 figure out where society has kind of
34:07 lost its mind
34:08 i thought this episode might be useful
34:11 and i said what you want me to do is
34:13 take a drug so i can get in touch with
34:14 my feminine side
34:16 i said what that what is that gonna do
34:20 i said that'll make me absolutely
34:21 unattractive
34:23 to an omega female which is what i like
34:27 i don't care what body shape you are i
34:28 don't care what your
34:30 skin color is i will love you however
34:33 you
34:34 are just be strong
34:38 be balanced and so i pointed down the
34:41 other two characters and i said look
34:42 i don't want this alpha male chick
34:44 coming after me
34:46 who's full of crap the whole time who's
34:49 going to tell me
34:49 that she can do everything i can do
34:51 because she because she watched too much
34:53 he watches too many action movies
34:55 where these uh five foot four 120 pound
34:59 celebrities are
35:00 punching a six foot eight bodybuilder in
35:02 the face and knocking him cold
35:05 isn't that great training for your
35:06 daughters
35:08 oh i can handle myself in a nightclub i
35:10 know girls are 110 pounds
35:12 who will live right off to a dude who
35:14 weighs 280 pounds
35:16 the last guy they punched is still in
35:18 the hospital
35:19 and they have been convinced that they
35:22 can take these guys on and
35:23 no one's gonna mess with me or they
35:25 think they're gonna go get another guy
35:26 he weighs 180 pounds
35:28 to fight this 280 pound dude whose job
35:31 is to pick people up and throw them
35:33 outside of restaurants
35:35 and nightclubs and somehow this guy's
35:37 going to go up and
35:38 you know risk his face
35:41 again the dude who might have a chance
35:45 knock another dude out he's not
35:46 attracted to her because she's an alpha
35:49 female
35:50 delusional i should say
35:53 just to live back for a split second
35:56 when i see two feminine men together who
35:59 are probably gay
36:00 it makes complete sense to me you're the
36:04 same
36:04 enjoy totally cool man i don't you know
36:08 what you do with your life is your thing
36:10 do no harm and you'll be good and none
36:12 of them do any harm so there you go
36:15 i wouldn't try to go around convincing
36:16 all the other kids in the neighborhood
36:18 to be like you
36:19 that might get you in some trouble just
36:21 be who you are live by example
36:24 i got plenty of friends who are like
36:26 this i got friends that are
36:27 two alpha males that dig each other or
36:30 probably alpha omega to be honest
36:32 but they're both dudes and they live
36:34 together for decades and they're fine
36:37 what's the problem right but i'm not in
36:40 that realm
36:41 so all i'm talking about in this episode
36:43 is what i know
36:45 one of the things i have seen lately and
36:48 it's only in women who are probably
36:50 within five years
36:52 of my age and typically younger
36:56 is that they remember their youth in the
36:58 70s and 80s
37:00 and in that youth they remember the
37:02 strong omega females that raised them
37:04 their mothers and their grandmothers and
37:06 maybe their great-grandmothers
37:09 and they had recipes for the for the
37:12 kitchen
37:13 they made their own clothes they were
37:16 very crafty in general
37:18 the children growing up in grade school
37:20 had crafting projects
37:22 because arts were still taught but arts
37:25 can uh consistently open the mind and so
37:27 that's what's been defunded
37:29 to make sure there is no right brain
37:31 abstract development
37:32 that can see a conspiracy when it comes
37:35 right at them
37:36 so i've seen some women from about 45 to
37:39 55
37:41 hit a point in their life where they
37:42 realize oh my god
37:44 i have not eaten this particular food
37:47 since i was a child and what the hell
37:50 every single time my mother speaking for
37:52 them made these meals they constantly
37:55 went back to get
37:56 grandma's recipe not their mother's
37:58 recipe but their grandmother's recipe
38:01 two generations up that famous apple pie
38:04 that famous
38:05 pumpkin pie the turkey recipe the ham
38:07 recipe whatever it is
38:09 to make homemade noodles maybe
38:12 they didn't see it as weak they saw it
38:15 as strong
38:16 look what i can do with just some flour
38:19 water and a little bit of table salt
38:22 i can make a meal and feed a hulk who's
38:25 my protector
38:27 feed my children and i know that when
38:29 they go to bed at night they've had
38:30 nourishment
38:32 organic nourishment my family has a
38:35 famous
38:38 ice cream recipe we've modified it over
38:41 the years
38:42 so we've got several different kinds
38:43 it's always vanilla but there's one for
38:45 the
38:46 family members that shouldn't be eating
38:47 too much sugar and there's ones for
38:49 people that can eat it all
38:51 people that are low lactose intolerant
38:53 we've got ways of knocking down the
38:54 cream and they'll still taste exactly
38:55 the same
38:56 and this year right here on this patio
38:58 in fourth of july
39:01 a friend of mine from my hometown and i
39:03 we made it right there
39:05 like two gallons of it ben we had to
39:08 give half of it away to friends
39:10 just because we had too much
39:13 it was euphoric it was a little too
39:15 creamy for me but uh
39:17 it was still delicious heritage
39:21 missing what's funny is if you ask a
39:25 typical female today and this isn't
39:28 really a criticism whatsoever this is us
39:30 losing
39:31 our culture losing our tribe
39:35 if you said hey you know have you ever
39:37 made your own clothes
39:38 i'd be like what are you talking about
39:40 today that would be a sign of
39:42 being poor i had to make my own clothes
39:45 i was so poor
39:46 that's the way it's construed today but
39:49 in the 70s
39:50 i used to go with i had three ants and
39:52 we used to always go down to the
39:54 fabric store and i'm just like running
39:56 around looking at all stuff
39:58 they buy a pattern they dug buy the
40:00 fabric take it home i watch them do the
40:02 whole thing i'd help cut out the
40:03 patterns and pin stuff down and watch
40:05 them sew this stuff together
40:08 it was considered a privilege to have
40:11 the money
40:12 and the talent to sell your own clothes
40:15 the better you sewed it that became a
40:17 bragging right
40:19 when i was in the bay area one of my
40:20 buddies he's calling bluto because the
40:23 dude looked just
40:24 like bluto man nicest freaking guy on
40:26 planet earth
40:27 he married a woman overseas from asia
40:30 somewhere don't know where she was from
40:32 the dude's a big guy i mean he's just
40:34 he's bluto
40:35 bluto as a human being no i've shown
40:38 pictures of this
40:39 and movies of this guy to friends of
40:41 mine they're like oh my god
40:42 i'm like yeah it's not just like kind of
40:45 looks like it's him
40:46 so he's a big dude probably weighed 250
40:49 pounds and looked healthy
40:52 so he came to work after he got married
40:53 and he had these
40:55 amazing hawaiian shirts and i say
40:58 amazing one it fit him perfectly
41:00 but two they were just perfectly sowed
41:05 i mean there was no difference but if
41:07 anything if you were to say to somebody
41:09 who's like a big versace guy or someone
41:11 a big fashion dude
41:12 hey look at this shirt what do you think
41:13 about this shirt the jewel would start
41:16 coming out of their mouth
41:17 if they dug that kind of thing
41:20 john lasseter would be so jealous let me
41:22 tell you and then they would look at the
41:24 stitching and look at all and go where
41:25 did you get this
41:26 why isn't there a label on it and the
41:28 dude's like my wife makes me shirts
41:31 i was totally jealous in fact we all
41:33 kind of talked about going down and
41:35 getting a fabric
41:36 and paying her to make us some shirts i
41:38 never followed up on it i should have
41:41 wow was she a weak female
41:44 because she sewed him shirts no she was
41:47 an omega baller
41:49 and he was lucky as hell
41:53 we've lost our traditions males
41:57 all right let me give us a little test
41:59 here too i've been kind of picking on
42:01 the female side of things
42:03 all right let's say this little
42:04 apocalyptic moment occurs and
42:06 let's say you got an uncle that owns a
42:07 ranch in the midwest like me
42:10 and you show up and you know how to
42:13 shoot a gun
42:15 but you don't know how to shoot an arrow
42:18 maybe your bullets run out man and
42:21 you've got to hunt food
42:24 and let's just say over the course of a
42:27 week you manage
42:28 out of pure starvation and feral focus
42:31 you manage to shoot a buck a big deer
42:36 it's got a lot of meat on it venison
42:38 should be good gonna be a little gamey
42:40 or hey man you're starving you don't
42:42 care plus your omega wife's like
42:44 uh dude family's getting hungry
42:49 so you got it dead now what are you
42:50 going to do what are you going to do man
42:54 you know how to clean it if you don't
42:56 know how to clean an animal
42:57 it's going to be an absolute catastrophe
43:00 you're going to poison your whole family
43:02 because you're going to cut the gut sac
43:03 open you're going to cut the
43:05 entrails open and it's going to spill
43:07 all kinds of e coli all over the meat
43:11 and let's just say you have a lot of
43:12 meat and maybe electricity is not a big
43:14 commodity what do you do now you got
43:17 more meat than you can then you can eat
43:19 what are you gonna do if you grew up in
43:21 california
43:22 you're probably sol man if you grew up
43:25 in kansas
43:26 well you grew up with native american
43:28 families all around you
43:32 you grow up with cowboys dudes who still
43:34 hunt today with bow and arrows like ted
43:36 nugent
43:37 that dude will live until his last
43:41 expiring breath probably over 100 years
43:43 old
43:45 you got to know how to tie it up you got
43:48 to know exactly how to make the cuts
43:50 if you're smart you're going to cut it
43:51 so that you can keep the fur
43:53 you're going to use every single piece
43:55 of this animal
43:57 if you can't eat at all you're going to
43:59 try to figure out a way to
44:01 beef jerky the meat hang it up to dry if
44:04 you don't have any other way of
44:05 preserving it
44:06 you'll know that salt is a natural
44:08 preservative
44:10 to keep the bugs off of it until it's
44:11 time to eat
44:13 you'll know about trains that used to
44:15 transport beef without any refrigeration
44:18 and everything was packed inside salt
44:20 layers
44:23 if you're a big prepper then you might
44:25 want to get on youtube and watch a few
44:27 how to skin and animal videos from a
44:30 cow to a pig to some of the natural
44:33 animals in your area and as much as you
44:36 might think you're going to kill a bear
44:38 good luck with that you're not going to
44:41 probably be killing like a cheetah or a
44:43 tiger
44:44 that's for people in africa know how to
44:45 do those kind of things but come on you
44:47 want something with meat on the right
44:49 maybe you get a moose in canada or
44:51 alaska
44:53 but you better know what you're doing
44:55 maybe you even
44:56 find dudes around your area that still
44:58 do it or you go online you
45:00 try to find a group that's going to go
45:01 hunt and maybe you're just there to look
45:04 you're just there to watch they
45:06 typically wouldn't let you just watch
45:08 because they know hey if you're going to
45:10 be here and if you're going to partake
45:11 in any of this then you got to
45:13 pull your own so here's the knife and
45:15 don't screw up watch me on the left
45:16 you're going to do the same thing on the
45:17 right
45:19 you're going to know how to hunt birds
45:23 my uncle probably has i don't know 20
45:25 000 turkeys on his land
45:28 well they travel in packs they got the
45:29 males out there looking for the hawks
45:32 she can't just go up on them you have to
45:35 shoot them
45:35 with something trap them something not
45:39 exactly that intelligent you scream they
45:40 scream
45:42 chickens everything you gotta know how
45:44 to do this and that's just
45:46 beef what if you're a vegetarian you're
45:48 like man i need to
45:50 have seeds on hand i got to be able to
45:53 find some land that someone's not going
45:54 to kill me for touching
45:56 perhaps someone owns land doesn't know
45:57 how to till it doesn't know how to make
46:00 a garden a field a crop
46:03 you're gonna find out why farmers make a
46:05 ton of money and you're no longer going
46:07 to call them names for me
46:09 being millionaires because they're
46:11 getting up the crack of dawn
46:12 and going to bed pretty much at sunset
46:16 and they are tired
46:20 imagine all of us city folk trying to
46:22 convert to survive
46:24 we got more to offer the world more to
46:26 offer society we've got to make it
46:27 through the pocket
46:28 it's going to be rough this
46:31 configuration of alpha and omega in my
46:33 opinion
46:34 is truly the configuration i know
46:36 listeners
46:37 who are females who are omegas who have
46:40 alpha males that they're married to
46:43 they're all their kids raised they're
46:44 all over the united states
46:46 and they live in really beautiful rural
46:48 areas
46:49 where all this is just a flick of a
46:51 switch oh we don't need power
46:53 all right well let's go to the closet
46:55 and get our stuff out
46:57 let's go fish cleaning a fish
47:01 boy if i've seen people clean fish man
47:05 and just make a mess of everything they
47:08 don't know how to clean a nice between
47:09 every cut
47:10 they don't know how to get salt water to
47:12 put whatever they clean out of the fish
47:14 off to the side the gut sac is again
47:16 another problem inside of a fish
47:18 they don't know how to start a detail
47:19 and work towards the head
47:21 in addition one of the reasons why i
47:25 believe
47:26 countries like america with a fully
47:27 functional second amendment are being
47:29 attacked
47:31 is to get rid of these alpha males to
47:33 send them off to war and kill them
47:35 before they can procreate
47:38 to demonize them for that very action
47:41 for the loyalty to their country
47:43 now we know wars are all bs we do we
47:46 know that
47:47 potentially every alpha male should
47:49 stick around but part of
47:50 the rite of passage for a male is to
47:53 suck it up and do some things that are
47:55 tough
47:56 and i mean really tough not just math
47:58 right
48:00 not just getting through a level of
48:01 metal gear solid
48:03 with this oh man i'm such a sniper on on
48:07 the ps5 that it's no problem whatsoever
48:10 to
48:10 get out there and do it in real life i
48:12 would say that someone's really good in
48:13 a video game would probably be
48:15 pretty good hunting at least in the kill
48:18 after
48:19 kill portion of the game
48:22 but once it's dead they don't know
48:23 anything
48:25 the first time i hunted with my uncles i
48:28 was just cleaning these birds out man
48:30 they'd fly
48:31 and i just i'm pretty good with the gun
48:33 anyway but i would just i never fought
48:35 with i'm
48:35 sorry i fought i never hunted with
48:38 shotguns these
48:39 really designer italian shotguns man but
48:42 i would draw a fire and boom the bird
48:43 would fall down and one of my uncles
48:45 who's a doctor he looked at me he goes
48:47 he says it to my other he goes god it's
48:48 just like he's born to do this
48:52 and i just like i might say that's uh 25
48:54 years of video game playing
48:56 but again in terms of cleaning the birds
48:59 they had to teach me
49:00 pull the buckshot out got to get the
49:03 bird off of the meat you know the
49:04 outside of the bird
49:05 off the inside of the bird and we ate
49:08 those birds that night
49:10 my only regret is i didn't participate
49:11 100 in the process
49:14 now thankfully during an apocalypse some
49:16 of the hunting rules go away
49:18 which makes it much easier to catch and
49:21 kill animals
49:23 with our weapons today and our
49:24 techniques today
49:27 you shouldn't go without food as long as
49:30 you live in a rural area with those
49:31 animals
49:34 let's come back to the psychological
49:35 part of the game
49:38 what's very interesting is the
49:40 masculinity of a man and the femininity
49:42 of a woman is being robbed
49:43 from those respective groups
49:48 you want to know what's going to make
49:49 you feel more disenfranchised than
49:51 anything else but you won't be
49:52 consciously aware of it
49:54 is when your masculinity has been robbed
49:57 but you know that you have this
49:59 genetic instinct to be a man why do you
50:03 think there's so many bar
50:04 fights that like bro bars i've said this
50:07 you know five years ago but here it is
50:09 again
50:10 what is what is the multi-million year
50:14 training for a human being
50:17 well the man would get with the other
50:19 men
50:20 the other alphas because there were no
50:22 options even 150 years ago there were no
50:24 options
50:25 no bait it would ever survive 150 years
50:27 ago
50:29 if he was in europe where it was already
50:31 developed but that's about it
50:33 maybe in rome during caesar's era you
50:35 became his
50:37 dedicated eunuch
50:40 we used to get up get together organize
50:43 and hunt
50:45 which is nerve-wracking but you also had
50:47 to build up the courage and the chemical
50:49 structure every day
50:50 to go out and hunt and kill
50:53 so now we've got this same genetic
50:55 instinct which cannot be muted
50:56 in the short time that we have ceased
50:58 doing this
51:00 in america we used to do this 150 years
51:02 ago you wouldn't eat
51:03 if you didn't have this capability well
51:06 now
51:06 what do we do with the chemical triggers
51:08 that are going off all day long
51:10 well it depends on how you feel about
51:12 being emasculated by the
51:15 media by hollywood by the people around
51:18 you if you live in a
51:19 liberal city and so you just kind of
51:23 bottle it all up you push it inside and
51:24 you go to a bar
51:25 and now you're just pissed at life for
51:27 probably what amounts to a ptsd
51:30 of a masculinity you don't know why
51:33 you just have this urge to fight to kill
51:37 and you mistaken it for your fellow
51:39 humans all that energy and all that
51:41 negativity is not supposed to be
51:43 negative it's supposed to be
51:44 the courage that you have to manifest
51:46 every morning to go out and do what you
51:47 have to do to eat
51:50 women i have talked to women as young as
51:52 23
51:53 all the way up and i would ask them
51:57 well you know or someone would just tell
51:58 me but you know they'd say look
52:01 i want to just be married with kids man
52:03 i want a job after i
52:04 get my kids into school but that's
52:06 really what i want to do
52:08 and i feel like i can't tell my other
52:09 female friends of mine because they
52:12 would see that i am supposedly injuring
52:14 this feminist movement which is so
52:16 important
52:18 wow so procreating now and building a
52:21 solid family
52:22 is demonized to the extent that women
52:24 are getting ptsd
52:25 because their maternal instincts are
52:27 being compromised
52:29 they have children they know that they
52:31 should be home with their children
52:32 because one they love them
52:34 but two they know that the state is not
52:35 going to do as good of a job as they
52:37 would do
52:39 plus the family has traditions and
52:40 standards and how those standards and
52:42 traditions ever going to be instilled in
52:43 your child when they spend most of their
52:45 time in daycare
52:46 or public school or even after school
52:49 events
52:49 right class is over at three in
52:52 california it's 2 15
52:53 and they get wednesday's half days i
52:55 mean it's nuts in california the
52:56 education system here
52:58 sucks huge if you're a kid
53:02 who watches a bunch of hollywood movies
53:03 like me when i was a kid
53:05 and you have the delusion the california
53:08 kids got it made
53:10 and you live in some rural little town
53:11 somewhere and somewhere in the world and
53:13 for substitute california for whatever
53:15 place you think is cooler that might be
53:16 more modern and populated
53:18 trust me you're winning the game in
53:21 those little tiny towns
53:22 almost every single time they are
53:25 imbalancing the world
53:27 on purpose we all know it but hopefully
53:30 this gives you a little bit of grit
53:32 for your tires to actually make progress
53:34 in your mind
53:37 and they'll want to demonize what i'm
53:38 saying because i'm going against the
53:40 agenda of everybody
53:42 being upside down building a family is a
53:46 negative thing
53:48 and isn't it interesting that supposedly
53:51 in these primitive cultures
53:53 and i'll just let you assume whatever
53:56 that is
53:57 they believe in family still they have
53:59 big kids big
54:00 sorry big families and probably big kids
54:02 too they have big families now some of
54:04 them go overboard because of their
54:05 religion
54:07 that's still occurring masculinity being
54:09 attached to how many children you have
54:11 is about as stupid as your masculinity
54:14 being attached to how many beers you can
54:15 drink
54:18 if you're counting your beers at a party
54:20 and bragging about that number
54:21 you got a lot of developing to do
54:24 hopefully you'll make it
54:26 trying to oppress people that don't
54:27 exist is another fallacy of the world
54:32 now one of the big things that's going
54:33 on in the absence
54:35 well i should say in the absence of
54:38 abundant alpha males and omega females
54:41 but of the ones that still exist they're
54:43 being suppressed and repressed
54:46 to a great extent is that when they want
54:49 to exude their value systems
54:52 they're punished by those who don't
54:55 really determine anything about their
54:56 life
54:58 it'd be one thing if somebody said oh oh
55:00 we don't say that and
55:02 here's a 100 000 and we hope that you
55:06 learn not to say that anymore and if you
55:08 don't say it anymore we'll pay for
55:09 everything in your life
55:12 that never happens so why do you care
55:14 what they say
55:16 i look at youtube channels that are full
55:19 of
55:19 millions and millions of subscribers
55:22 they do silly things like review every
55:23 episode of mandalorian
55:26 they'll take their obsessions and make
55:29 channels of them and
55:30 there's nothing wrong with that but i
55:33 look at
55:33 my regiment with you guys i make very
55:36 complex videos
55:38 very long videos it makes the editing
55:40 long it makes plus because i work all
55:42 day i gotta do these things it's right
55:44 now it is 3
55:46 58 at night it's 46 degrees outside
55:49 this is more important to me than me
55:52 cannibalizing all the knowledge i've got
55:54 about video games or
55:55 whatever star wars franchise and making
55:58 a copycat channel like those other ones
56:00 because they apparently can't get enough
56:01 of that stuff
56:03 i am toying with an educational class
56:06 in blender 3d but there are so many good
56:11 channels out there that do the exact
56:13 same thing i'm trying to see
56:15 i know that the way i teach is different
56:16 than the way anyone else teaches and i
56:18 believe that my techniques work a lot
56:20 faster and i'm
56:22 so i've got some techniques i'm going to
56:23 probably integrate in but i have to
56:25 lock in my mind something that has more
56:28 value than someone else's channel
56:31 it doesn't negate their value it just is
56:33 a different voice
56:34 teaching you a different way that i
56:36 believe is superior
56:37 and i will make you a power user from
56:39 day one instead of
56:41 you just being kind of confused and
56:42 overwhelmed by so many features
56:45 they're cowarding down to society to
56:47 make money
56:49 man i'm going to tell you something i
56:52 usually don't tell you guys but
56:54 i guarantee you guarantee you
56:58 if i was willing to live in a place i
57:00 didn't like
57:01 and cut my hair short
57:05 this is not exaggeration because i've
57:06 had the offer more than once
57:08 in the last five years probably last
57:11 seven years
57:12 yours truly could be making anywhere
57:14 from 250 thousand dollars to probably
57:16 half a million dollars a year
57:19 and you might say well then you're
57:20 stupid look at that retirement package
57:24 for you
57:26 the only problem is is i gotta live
57:28 inside this suit
57:31 this meat suit that i'm i'm wearing
57:34 like i look in the mirror every morning
57:36 i gotta figure out if i'm being true to
57:38 myself
57:40 and when i look at those options i just
57:42 think you know what
57:44 it's funny of the family members that i
57:46 have that
57:48 have followed all the rules and coward
57:50 down every single time they were told to
57:52 move because their jobs said hey you
57:54 know i know you were born and raised in
57:55 this town but i want you to move you
57:57 clear across the united states
57:59 and by the way your hair is getting a
58:00 two little too long and you really don't
58:01 wear suits enough
58:03 and they'll tell you that you can't
58:04 close million dollar deals looking any
58:06 any other way and it's like
58:09 too late for my game but they do it
58:13 and they'll have the retirement they'll
58:14 have the big bank accounts and they'll
58:17 own their homes and whatever
58:20 but in the end they didn't live life
58:22 they may even go to europe
58:24 once every two years on a big two-week
58:26 vacation
58:28 but they'll be standing inside the roman
58:30 coliseum looking up wikipedia to find
58:32 something out about it
58:35 and that's going to be the utter extent
58:37 of their
58:38 journey outside of the little town they
58:40 live in
58:42 so in my personal opinion
58:45 they will never have lived their entire
58:47 life
58:49 but they will look down on me oh gosh
58:52 you know
58:53 relative he's got this thing he's trying
58:56 to do
58:56 don't understand what he's doing oh gosh
58:59 i hope at one point he has a good moment
59:00 in his life
59:01 it's like dude it is it started a long
59:04 time ago but it's never stopped
59:06 and hopefully you're the same way it's
59:09 one of those
59:09 it's like the old saying live free or
59:11 die
59:12 all right well that definitely applies
59:14 to hopefully your country
59:16 the boy the majority of this world
59:18 population is not engaging that
59:21 and supposedly as a minor digression
59:25 the idea is well you're primitive if you
59:28 don't want to
59:29 work with your fellow man to build a
59:31 better world and therefore cowered down
59:33 into all the surveillance and all this
59:34 other stuff
59:36 so untrue there is a reason why
59:40 the entire freaking planet wants to
59:43 migrate to america
59:45 now they don't want to in some cases
59:47 keep it going the way that it was
59:50 omar being one of them right
59:54 the ones that are true to our country
59:56 they come from all different countries
59:58 they see the american dream they know
59:59 how to work hard they work harder than
60:01 americans because you know why
60:02 they saw tyranny where they were so many
60:05 people in orange county california right
60:06 now come into the smoke lounge
60:08 being first generation immigrants
60:12 and they're yelling in the room going i
60:14 just came from a country that
60:16 took away our guns that
60:19 told us what jobs we were going to have
60:22 when i was robbed and my wife was
60:24 raped or whatever there was nothing i
60:26 could do because the police were in on
60:27 it if they weren't the ones that did it
60:30 and now i'm watching this faction in
60:33 america
60:34 and the media especially
60:37 participating in the destruction of the
60:38 country as if there's some long-term
60:40 plan for them
60:42 which there isn't again when you
60:45 betray your own kind to facilitate
60:48 change for the global elite you're the
60:51 first one that gets liquidated because
60:53 you're a trader
60:54 and they won't allow traitors in their
60:56 world they'll use you like a tool
60:58 once you give them what you can give
61:00 them and that could end very quickly
61:02 right you could just do one speech and
61:04 that's it that's all they think you can
61:05 do
61:06 poof you're cut off and now you're one
61:09 of us
61:10 wondering what happened the other thing
61:12 that happens
61:13 in my experience living in a small town
61:15 and seeing these alpha and omega couples
61:18 is they keep each other in check because
61:21 we all slip
61:22 no no major slip not infidelity or
61:25 anything that
61:26 you know intense acute but
61:29 when someone gets complacent when
61:31 someone needs a pep talk
61:33 they're right there and if one of them
61:36 gets sick
61:38 the other one stands right next to them
61:40 and gets them through it
61:42 and if whatever reason they pass they
61:45 felt like they lost their
61:47 partner in life and some of them are
61:50 able to reconstitute a relationship with
61:52 someone who's got
61:53 equal stature sometimes they don't
61:56 though sometimes
61:57 in their 70s and they're just like oh
61:58 gosh you know i'll live my husband
62:02 in almost every case in that particular
62:04 realm where i came from
62:06 when you raise kids boy you know
62:10 people worry about when they're young
62:12 about all these put down the toilet seat
62:13 put the cap on the toothpaste
62:15 oh that's probably a good training wheel
62:17 there
62:18 but when it comes to raising children
62:20 how to discipline them and stuff
62:21 hopefully you've had the conversation
62:22 before they enter the world
62:24 so you can kind of not run into conflict
62:26 live
62:27 on tv meaning in front of your children
62:32 usually in my experience the alpha and
62:35 omegas
62:35 don't argue in front of their children
62:37 as a principle if it starts to occur
62:40 whoever's least vested in the argument
62:43 will step forward and say either another
62:46 time
62:47 because we can't we're not home there's
62:49 no place for us to go outside of the
62:51 ear or eyesight of our child we'll talk
62:53 about this later
62:54 and they typically do just automatically
62:56 fall in line
62:58 or they'll simply leave the kids in the
63:00 front room and they'll kind of whisper
63:02 yell at each other in the bedroom
63:05 they don't want to traumatize their kids
63:08 because there is balance and with
63:09 balance you get perspective
63:12 when you're just winging it constantly
63:14 well then you never really know what
63:16 you're doing you're not doing anything
63:17 very
63:17 well at all the other thing is this
63:23 if you're not married yet which i am not
63:28 then there is a hunt for that person
63:34 and to the degree you recognize the
63:37 benefit of such a thing
63:38 you will suspend other endeavors
63:42 at times to prioritize that search
63:46 when you hit well put this way if you're
63:49 young and you're hearing this message
63:51 and you agree with it
63:52 you don't have to then you can
63:56 hunt properly in my opinion
63:59 and once you do find the union with
64:01 someone that is balanced with you
64:02 nothing's perfect okay
64:05 marriage is a job every single day some
64:07 days you have to wake up and
64:08 and choose to love the other person
64:10 sometimes it's just just that's life
64:13 but in the long run it just it turns in
64:15 this beautiful
64:17 logarithmic graph of just happiness and
64:19 balance right
64:22 because i tell you what bothers you as a
64:23 young person doesn't bother you as much
64:25 when you get older
64:27 and you'll inherit new things as you get
64:28 older
64:30 but here's the here's the beautiful
64:32 self-empowering thing
64:33 with a i think a properly balanced
64:36 nuclear family built out of the alpha
64:38 and omega configuration
64:40 you become the most powerful person
64:43 you have ever become in your lifetime
64:46 and it just manifests
64:47 every single day that transpires past
64:50 the point of union
64:52 why because you're not worried about
64:55 that part of your life
64:57 there's balance in the home doesn't mean
65:00 there won't be problems right your kid's
65:01 gonna turn 13
65:03 and discover the opposite sex or
65:05 whatever sex they're attracted to
65:07 again typically an alpha omega family it
65:10 stays off on omega when the kids get
65:11 older because they've been taught
65:13 this is the way it really works and
65:15 they'll also start subliminally if not
65:18 consciously
65:19 noticing families that are struggling
65:21 because it's an
65:22 alpha beta relationship or beta alpha
65:27 for me in my lifetime i have known of
65:30 families that
65:31 had major major freaking problems
65:35 and the husband was a beta and the
65:38 mother was an alpha
65:40 i just heard horrific stories where
65:42 children watched
65:44 family brawls occur
65:47 where an uncle is is beating up his
65:50 sister
65:51 who is the mothers the mother of these
65:54 children and they sat there and watched
65:56 it happen
65:57 and the most sickening thing because i
65:59 knew the father who pretends to be alpha
66:01 it's just hilarious maybe he's grown
66:02 there since he
66:04 watched this occur but the dude stood
66:06 supposedly at the door jam and watched
66:08 his brother-in-law beat up his wife
66:12 when i tell that story to people
66:15 to other alpha males which is the only
66:17 thing i try to hang out with
66:20 there's just this uh like almost
66:23 instinctual
66:26 goosebumps of anger of like
66:29 how could you do that this is your wife
66:32 this is a woman being beat up by a man i
66:35 don't care if it's the brother-in-law
66:37 i'm gonna kick him so [ __ ] hard that
66:39 you know i'll have to wipe the [ __ ] off
66:40 my boot
66:42 because this guy's gonna [ __ ] die i
66:44 mean i'm just gonna beat him to the
66:45 point
66:46 where it's jail time man and
66:49 just to know the guy that did watch this
66:52 and see him at like little family
66:54 gatherings he's not of relation but
66:56 uh and i just see him try to be all
66:59 manly and it's just like dude
67:01 you're a [ __ ] you did a big [ __ ] move
67:04 dude
67:06 you know maybe you've changed and i'll
67:08 give someone that thing but until i know
67:10 otherwise
67:11 man you're just like the epic
67:15 epic pinnacle of [ __ ]
67:18 and you know what it doesn't what if the
67:20 brother-in-law is way bigger than you
67:22 guess what dude if you're an alpha
67:25 you will be a superhuman during those
67:28 kind of situations
67:30 it's not all about being you know a
67:33 brute force person
67:34 a typical alpha male knows when to pull
67:35 back a fight is one of the last things
67:38 an alpha does
67:39 because they have balance they have
67:41 perspective
67:43 they can look at things but once
67:44 something goes hot
67:46 guess what that's why you're an alpha
67:49 that's why alpha's become soldiers
67:52 but what's interesting is if you know
67:54 anyone in the military i've been
67:56 privileged to be raised in the military
67:59 you'll meet say an infantry guy
68:03 and he has one level of processing
68:06 war and then you'll meet like a navy
68:09 seal
68:11 when you meet a navy seal or a ranger or
68:13 a special forces dude
68:15 there's a difference there's a massive
68:18 difference in the intellect between
68:19 these two individuals
68:21 what's the difference have pauses
68:25 inserted in their actions and infantry
68:28 you guys get there too
68:29 the more they spend time in these
68:30 tumultuous situations
68:32 and that's why there's so many hollywood
68:33 scripts there's a great twilight zone
68:36 with leonard nimoy in it
68:39 if you just look that up it's the only
68:41 episode he was ever in but it's about
68:43 um a fight in the pacific rim
68:46 or sorry pacific asian war
68:50 the japanese war with the americans and
68:52 there's two
68:54 little platoons that are
68:58 one of them's hidden in a cave the
68:59 japanese are in the cave and the
69:01 americans are up on a hillside
69:03 and they've both had it they've both
69:05 been at it shooting mortars and
69:07 shooting at each other and then this
69:10 this um went behind the ears officer
69:13 arrives
69:16 i don't think he's a captain or
69:17 something like that nothing he's a
69:19 lieutenant
69:20 and he's all gung-ho boy he wants to get
69:22 his kill count up he's just read the
69:24 books he knows how to do it and he's
69:25 just all gung-ho to
69:27 get in there and kill those japs as he
69:29 said
69:30 and then the irony was he turned around
69:32 his men are trying to talk him out of
69:34 his men are like oh
69:35 we know you're kind we know you're kind
69:38 you just want a little kill count don't
69:39 you
69:41 and he's like what are you talking about
69:42 i'm just doing what i'm supposed to do
69:44 and you should too
69:45 trying to use the book to get them to
69:47 align
69:48 with his personal inequities right
69:53 but he turns around and walks like 10
69:55 feet and all of a sudden
69:57 mr rod sterling turns the guy into a
70:00 japanese
70:01 soldier and he's in the cave
70:04 and all of a sudden the tables have
70:06 turned
70:08 and now he's even got an accent and they
70:10 did a little makeup on him
70:12 and there's everyone else's japanese on
70:14 the set
70:16 and they're sort of like the soldiers
70:18 are sort of uh you know
70:19 talking like the other soldiers on the
70:21 other side i mean maybe we can just kind
70:22 of let them maybe they'll just go away
70:24 you know and there's one officer there
70:26 who's kind of nipping it he's his heels
70:29 because he's not the man in charge he's
70:31 definitely an upper echelon
70:34 japanese soldier but i think there's one
70:36 guy over him who's kind of
70:38 barking what he was barking and he's
70:40 chart he turns
70:42 his whole perspective around because
70:44 they're americans on the other side
70:46 so initially he's doing it because
70:47 they're americans but over the course of
70:49 five minutes to 10 minutes
70:52 he realizes what his men were talking
70:53 about
70:56 and then of course after a little bit
70:58 time passes he walks and turns and also
71:00 he's back to where he was and he's an
71:01 american again
71:04 and he learned his lesson in a really
71:06 short period of time he got a little
71:07 alpha
71:08 lesson and hey relax
71:12 relax you know one of the movies that i
71:16 think
71:16 portrays this extremely well and i hate
71:18 to give you a fictional example as a
71:20 as a way to kind of beacon towards this
71:23 but
71:23 kurt russell's movie tombstone was
71:27 a phenomenal example so kurt russell and
71:31 his brothers
71:31 uh you know they're all different ages
71:33 playing the wyatts whiter
71:35 the erp family but sam elliott's
71:38 character
71:38 is one of the older brothers and sam
71:40 elliott in my opinion
71:42 i've never met the gentleman but i'm
71:44 willing to bet because he seems to play
71:46 a very similar character wherever he
71:48 ends up
71:50 i'm willing to bet he is as pure alpha
71:52 as it gets in the real world
71:54 as well meaning he inserts the pause
71:57 however as portrayed in the fictional
71:59 movie
72:01 there's a point when you have to fight
72:02 back
72:04 and the other interesting thing is that
72:06 we've also had sort of uh
72:08 romantic stories like maybe a king
72:11 arthur franchise or something like that
72:13 where you have honor
72:14 maybe a samurai movie where you have
72:16 honor in installed inside conflict
72:19 where okay we're gonna go at it but
72:21 let's do it honorably
72:23 one of the most famous stories i ever
72:25 heard and i don't know if it's true
72:28 was that a samurai was assigned to
72:30 killing somebody
72:32 and the samurai finally finds this
72:34 target after a really long search and he
72:36 goes up and apparently
72:38 as i understand the technique back in
72:40 the day was that you would read off your
72:42 sort of family heritage to identify who
72:44 you were
72:46 you would read them essentially what
72:48 they're being charged with that would
72:50 result in their death
72:53 and to the credit of the person being
72:56 stalked
72:57 by this samurai he knew a little trick
73:00 he waited till the guy said all that
73:02 stuff and then he spit in the guy's face
73:08 and the samurai just pulled back
73:11 the samurai had his sword out he was
73:13 ready to
73:14 do the old head lobbing thing
73:18 and he put the sword back in his sheath
73:20 and left
73:22 and of course the person listening to
73:24 the story for the first first time says
73:26 why'd he do that he finally found the
73:28 guy that was really hard to find
73:30 why why on earth would he cower down
73:34 and the answer was because a samurai
73:36 doesn't kill out of personal anger
73:39 the samurai only kills out of the duty
73:41 to the empress or the emperor
73:44 and when he got spit on he suddenly made
73:47 the kill personal and that violated the
73:49 code of the samurai
73:51 now imagine that let's just say that
73:53 that either did or didn't happen
73:55 but that's a sam elliott move that's an
73:58 alpha male move
74:01 you will see bar fights that nearly
74:02 happen and someone will be very
74:04 intelligent
74:06 and they'll walk up to those that are
74:08 into this in the dispute and say a few
74:10 little friendly words
74:11 or giving them some perspective and it
74:13 works even when they're drunk
74:14 that's what's amazing about these sort
74:17 of really seasoned alpha male men
74:21 and think about the overhead to society
74:23 with that
74:25 well the overhead that would happen if a
74:27 bar fight occurs we have two injured
74:29 males or more
74:30 maybe someone fatally injured and the
74:33 person who stepped in and
74:34 neutralized the entire situation out of
74:36 pure maturity
74:38 saves society to broken people
74:42 two broken souls that have to wake up
74:44 the next day
74:45 broken or some of them maybe not waking
74:47 up at all
74:49 and it's not as if the alpha looks for
74:51 those situations and enjoys them
74:53 he's gonna wake up annoyed the next day
74:55 that he had to step in at all that his
74:57 life was interrupted but it was
75:00 necessary
75:02 there are wonderful things about how
75:03 we've been set up
75:05 genetically on this world and i think
75:08 that we can look at when countries
75:10 have thrived and when they started to
75:11 fall apart
75:13 it is unequivocal now that every country
75:15 trying to absorb
75:17 all this crazy over the last 10 years is
75:20 not functioning well
75:23 it has given a rationale for
75:26 destructive protests which some other
75:29 individuals use
75:30 as a mechanism for looting and
75:32 destroying people's properties
75:35 people trying to defend their businesses
75:36 have died
75:38 because of these groups doing what they
75:41 do
75:42 i guarantee you at any one of the homes
75:45 of those that are going out and
75:46 destroying countries
75:48 not just peaceful protests that's that's
75:50 fine
75:52 they don't have an alpha and omega at
75:54 home
75:56 at best they've got an alpha beta or two
75:59 betas
76:01 unwilling to engage their children in
76:03 any disciplinary way because they don't
76:05 know how to do it
76:07 now how did these how did this how did
76:09 the disruption in the deception take
76:11 effect well it's because
76:17 the unsuspecting alpha omega
76:20 parents
76:23 did what every person on earth
76:26 should be allowed to do which is trust
76:29 their government
76:30 trust their media trust that movies
76:34 are just simply forms of entertainment
76:36 with a little bit of introspection
76:37 perhaps hidden in the
76:38 subtext but not one that's trying to
76:41 sway
76:42 your parent how your child excuse me
76:44 looks at themselves in the mirror
76:46 creating insecurities that don't really
76:48 have any basis in reality
76:50 nevertheless they absorb them almost
76:52 like a pandemic of its own
76:55 now just closing out i want to
76:58 finish off with sort of a
77:03 an interesting trend that is first sold
77:06 to you
77:07 as a a cliche
77:12 some people have this happen in their
77:13 life and some people don't i think there
77:16 are different reasons for it
77:18 which is typically the midlife crisis
77:22 i think there are real midlife crises
77:24 and i think that there are fake ones
77:26 i think there's the real ones would be
77:30 someone randomly changing their life and
77:33 and
77:33 the archetype of a typical midlife
77:36 crisis is that
77:37 you realize you're leaving your youth
77:41 and you try to desperately grab it
77:45 and so you go off and buy the motorcycle
77:47 you don't know how to drive
77:49 i don't know i don't know what the
77:50 ladies do i honestly don't
77:53 maybe hang out at a nightclub and
77:54 pretend like you're single i don't know
77:56 maybe you are single but these people
77:59 are confused
78:00 they also almost instantaneously regret
78:04 any change they did that is the result
78:06 of this midlife crisis
78:08 it's usually very short-lived and
78:10 sometimes it comes with some
78:12 problems they wreck the motorcycle and
78:14 become crippled and paralyzed and it was
78:16 like what did i do that for i didn't
78:17 even want to do that but i was so
78:19 lost in my my absorption from media and
78:24 movies and magazines and whatever
78:26 that i thought i should uh look like i'm
78:28 25 for the rest of my life
78:31 now the the one that is not a midlife
78:33 crisis that typically gets confused for
78:35 midnight crisis
78:36 is actually a wonderful phase in
78:38 someone's life where
78:41 you as i always say in the analogy you
78:43 were a pinball on the pinball machine
78:45 being controlled by the flippers
78:46 the bumpers the kickers everything you
78:50 weren't scoring anything though
78:51 it was controlling you because when you
78:54 were young no one
78:56 said to you or you never figured out
78:57 that you can actually play your own
78:58 video game you can write your own script
79:01 and so somewhere in your 40s your 30s
79:04 your 50s somewhere in there you figured
79:06 you know what no one that i thought
79:10 well everyone i thought i was impressing
79:11 doesn't exist and so you know what i'm
79:13 just gonna live my life for me
79:14 and do whatever i want to do with my
79:16 life and i'll do no harm while i'm doing
79:18 it
79:19 i think that's what happened to me when
79:20 i grabbed my hair
79:22 i mean a weird little thing i was just
79:25 real busy in my game company it was
79:26 about 2007 and i just stopped cutting it
79:29 and i just kept combing it and combing
79:31 it had that awkward phase you know it's
79:32 all in my face
79:34 and eventually just about the time i was
79:37 considering to cut it back again
79:38 one of my partners who's a female who
79:41 was married to my other partner
79:43 she said uh you know you're really good
79:44 with long hair
79:46 it wasn't this long but when she said
79:49 that i was headed off to the restroom
79:52 at this big law school that we're using
79:53 for our conference room
79:56 then i looked in the mirror and i was
79:57 like yeah you know what
79:59 i really respect her opinion and guess
80:01 what i feel
80:02 pretty good about this i've only grown
80:04 my hair out one time but i never grew it
80:06 out
80:07 i think like i do now where it's every
80:08 single hair is long like i had
80:10 had the party in the back you know that
80:12 kind of thing
80:14 now it does help that i have genetics
80:16 where we don't age as fast
80:18 as other people it's that anunnaki blood
80:20 man
80:21 it's really good for you here's what's
80:23 interesting about this um
80:26 this particular episode and i think a
80:27 lot of the episodes i try to throw at
80:28 you guys
80:29 that are more cerebral the only place
80:32 you get life lessons
80:35 outside of living life yourself which is
80:37 a very slow tumultuous situation where
80:39 you're making a ton of mistakes
80:41 is usually your alpha and omega parents
80:44 it could be your grandparents or your
80:45 parents
80:46 like that that's really who my parents
80:48 were
80:49 they were the mature ones not perfect
80:52 but boy they knew a lot of wisdom man
80:55 sometimes they say things i didn't even
80:57 understand but i chewed on it for two
80:59 decades until i was like
81:00 ding oh my god that's it and usually it
81:03 dinged because i made a mistake
81:05 that would have been avoided had i just
81:07 understood their advice in the first
81:08 place
81:10 but you can go get a phd in college
81:14 you can take every tony robbins course
81:16 insert any other
81:18 dude who's like that you can go into
81:21 business
81:22 you know schools and stuff on the side
81:24 you can go to
81:26 i don't know sound baths and all that
81:28 good stuff
81:29 and they have their wonderful things
81:32 that they will give to you believe me i
81:33 recommend almost all that stuff
81:35 if not every single bit of that stuff
81:37 but what you don't get is life lessons
81:40 so here we are living life where's the
81:42 manual there's no manual
81:45 and the older you get you realize that
81:47 life is actually extremely
81:49 short because even if you live a hundred
81:52 years
81:53 your body is deteriorating quicker than
81:56 your ambitions
81:58 and so okay so let's say you're 70 and
82:01 you know because god came down and told
82:03 you
82:04 you're going to live to be 100. so now
82:06 you're 70 years old going geez man i'm
82:07 going to live another 30 years
82:09 that's a huge life span right there now
82:12 70 is not as old as it used to be
82:14 70 is actually extremely functional my
82:16 buddy said mead lived to be 86 and he
82:18 was
82:18 pretty much painting until about 84.
82:22 so you want to get as much stuff done as
82:23 you can and interruptions in your life
82:27 for mistakes that are avoidable and
82:29 mistakes that
82:30 if you had the right source
82:34 even if you don't agree with the
82:36 suggestions that are coming perhaps out
82:37 of this channel
82:38 you will find the ones that you agree
82:40 with and thus live
82:42 a life more according to your desires by
82:45 arguing with me in your mind there's
82:47 just
82:48 it's like a win-win situation man if you
82:51 dig what i'm saying
82:52 and you find wisdom in it take it roll
82:55 if you're like man that is full of crap
82:57 it's like this because this works for me
82:59 boom you just double down on your own
83:01 beliefs
83:02 positive positive it's just there's
83:03 nothing to it
83:06 so that's really it
83:09 this just came to me a couple days ago
83:11 on the way to articulate this
83:13 i had another conversation tonight on
83:15 telephone with a friend of mine for at
83:16 least two hours
83:17 i thought man it's time to make this
83:19 episode because i'm just
83:21 it's very clear to my mind
83:24 one of the things and i'm going to
83:25 digress heavily here
83:27 and this is going to be just a small
83:29 discussion about other youtube channels
83:32 that i'm seeing plus a lot of
83:33 conversations i'm having with friends
83:36 i'm i mentioned this in a very minor way
83:38 recently but
83:39 i just feel like talking tonight even
83:41 though it's 4 30 in the morning
83:44 there's a some weird thing going on with
83:46 humanity right now that
83:48 i do not believe has been going on my
83:50 entire life
83:51 and it seems to be perhaps a
83:55 i don't know it could be a chemical
83:56 neurological thing we're being poisoned
83:58 or something it could be that's the most
84:00 cynical
84:01 view of that or it's simply a
84:03 degradation in our education
84:06 maybe it's a result of a lack of
84:09 communication with other human beings
84:12 i'm very fortunate that i've created
84:13 this channel where even though i'm
84:15 sitting here talking to myself i have
84:17 your feedback
84:18 and and i just have a regimen i push
84:20 myself every day to come up with a new
84:21 episode it's interesting
84:23 hopefully but repetition
84:26 in speech seems to be
84:30 at an all-time high and i can't
84:32 understand it
84:35 people will or or they'll meander in
84:37 conversation right they'll say uh
84:39 oh this amazing thing happened to me
84:41 down at the grocery store today
84:42 okay and it was like is this this alien
84:45 thing but let me yeah i'll tell you oh
84:46 really let me tell you so okay well you
84:48 know i was at the store
84:49 what's the store name again you know
84:50 it's the one that's got like uh
84:52 pineapple in its name and it's over
84:53 there on silver street you know that
84:55 street you know that street is where i
84:56 grew up as a kid and you know when i was
84:58 a kid and they just meander completely
85:00 away from the store and you're like
85:01 whoa whoa whoa i don't give a crap whose
85:04 first name
85:05 is the manager of the store unless
85:06 that's important what happened to you
85:08 that was so cool with this ufo or
85:10 whatever
85:11 thing you were talking about oh yeah
85:13 yeah yeah i'll get back to that
85:15 blah blah blah blah blah you're just
85:17 like my god what's wrong with
85:19 communication these days
85:21 but the other one that i run into in
85:23 tutorial videos
85:24 and these political videos that people
85:27 make that i watch
85:28 because i'm forced to in some cases
85:31 is they will repeat the same thing four
85:34 to ten times in a row
85:37 not to reiterate throughout an episode
85:41 and maybe not you know like if they
85:43 repeat the same thing between two
85:44 episodes
85:45 because it's still hot or it's something
85:46 they want you to remember totally get it
85:49 but they will simply sit there and loop
85:51 as if they don't have an editing bay
85:53 they're gonna put their movie through to
85:55 go oh my god i just said the same thing
85:56 ten times in a row well let's cut out
85:58 the other nine
85:59 and just say it once take the best out
86:01 of nine you know or best out of ten or
86:03 whatever it is right
86:05 it's a weird thing i wanted to say that
86:08 because there's no way i can make an
86:09 episode on it
86:12 but i want to know if you guys are
86:13 seeing the same thing because it sure
86:15 seems like there's a dumb ring coming
86:17 down on human beings right now
86:19 but i'm thinking because of 2020
86:21 especially
86:22 where inter-human communication has been
86:25 demonized
86:27 to facilitate this sort of degradation
86:29 in mankind
86:31 which is one reason why we got to open
86:32 back up and get everyone back together
86:33 again
86:34 because we weren't too good off when
86:36 this thing started
86:37 got some good english for you
86:41 anyway hopefully you found this
86:43 interesting
