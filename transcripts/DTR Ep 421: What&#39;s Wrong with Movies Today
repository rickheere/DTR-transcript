00:28 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:30 gentlemen on this rather nice cool
00:37 summer evening it's about August 3rd to
00:44 11 to 11 in the evening in the morning I
00:49 guess you could say I thought today we
00:52 would just riff a little because there's
00:58 always a bunch of subjects to talk about
01:00 and we get a little too intense
01:03 sometimes I think it might be nice to
01:06 relax I thought I'd talk about maybe
01:10 movies of today and sort of what's
01:14 what's happening right and what I think
01:16 is happening wrong should just in a very
01:19 generic sense I won't try to put too
01:21 much screenwriting stuff in it story is
01:25 the biggest missing link with what's
01:28 going on today you know I grew up in a
01:33 household where for those of you who saw
01:37 Cable Guy back in the day the Cable Guy
01:40 movie with Jim Carrey and Matthew
01:43 Broderick among other amazing actors Ben
01:46 Stiller
01:46 I think wrote and directed it he's in it
01:49 it was about a guy who was left at home
01:53 with a TV while his mom who was single
01:57 would go out on her dates and so he
02:00 ended up growing inside these shows the
02:02 show's became his life the heroes became
02:04 his heroes all that stuff right
02:07 my dad was definitely not abandoned as a
02:10 kid and had married parents until they
02:12 told my grandfather passed away so I
02:15 stayed together forever but they were a
02:18 little older than him about a decade and
02:20 a half older than most parents and so
02:23 they had already moved into the private
02:24 sector again not all women stayed you
02:27 know barefoot and pregnant even in the
02:30 40s 50s and 60s as much as [ __ ]
02:32 leftist will tell you that crap my
02:35 grandmother was a teacher for 36
02:36 years it was a teacher well before I
02:39 think she even had her first son so
02:42 she's a working mom and it was different
02:46 too because I think I told you that she
02:49 used to work at like a department store
02:52 like a really big one like when they
02:54 used to have been you know like uh I
02:55 don't want to say a name but like a
02:57 gigantic store that would be a big
02:59 anchor to New York City or wherever she
03:03 was in I think Seattle Washington and my
03:07 uncle was a little kid and the the women
03:09 would bring their kids to work and they
03:11 had countertops
03:12 you know he's big giant you know half
03:15 mile long if you added up all the square
03:17 footage of selling all the jewelry and
03:19 perfume and stuff so for a very short
03:21 period of time they lived up there I've
03:23 never been to Washington Washington
03:25 State myself I've been to Oregon having
03:27 been to Washington and the kids would
03:31 just play in a corner he's bring him in
03:33 and put him in the corner is interesting
03:34 but anyway by the time my dad was born
03:36 living in Kansas and again my hometown
03:39 was booming in the 40s 50s and 60s and
03:43 70s and probably about most the 80s too
03:47 but he would go to the movies we had two
03:49 movie theaters in town I worked at one
03:53 when I was 13 my first job I lied and
03:57 said I was 14 it was good seats see
04:01 movies all the time so my father grew up
04:03 with film and for him film was was an is
04:07 to this day he reads books he watches
04:09 films he does like some TV but the TV's
04:11 got to be almost film quality stuff or a
04:14 really good series on TV before he'll
04:16 spend any time watching it he likes
04:20 Dexter I've never seen it
04:21 he liked Babylon 5 which I barely saw
04:25 all the Star Trek's all that kind of
04:28 stuff I don't think he's much into the
04:31 West world or something I think that
04:32 just sort of goes over his head a little
04:35 bit but anyway I was raised watching
04:40 classic films just as much as I was
04:42 watching the most current films my dad
04:44 was a big electronics guy still is but
04:46 he's got all those toys now so we'd had
04:49 the biggest stereo system
04:50 the biggest TV whatever which probably
04:52 that time is about 25 inches in the I
04:55 don't even remember I didn't remember
04:57 the biggest TV we had it was a big
04:59 Zenith that's all I remember
05:01 you had the Macintosh stereo over that
05:03 and he was insane
05:04 so I'd be doing something I'd be
05:08 painting or programming or doing
05:10 something he'd be like get your ass out
05:11 of here right now why would you guys see
05:14 this movie look at that who who's that
05:16 guy right there you recognize the guy
05:17 right there interview all these stars
05:18 who were super famous today but they
05:20 were really young you know it could be
05:22 the me make me watch you know movies for
05:25 the 30s with Humphrey Bogart and James
05:27 Cagney and you love Jackie Gleason and
05:32 just all the classics right so I got all
05:34 this really amazing programming as a kid
05:38 before I began to pick my own films I
05:42 got out of school once in Boston not
05:46 Boston Proper based live in this town in
05:48 Randolph my dad worked in Quincy and
05:50 somehow you went and saw poltergeist and
05:53 I think the Braintree Mall I think it
05:56 was he literally drives by my school to
05:59 pick me up which I usually had to walk
06:00 home he picks me up because you know get
06:03 your friend and but I'm gonna take you
06:04 both to the movies okay if he goes to
06:06 the movies and I'm like I don't know
06:07 maybe he's parents think he's abducted
06:10 without cellphones somehow we were able
06:12 to get it okayed for him ain't take us
06:15 to the theater he dropped us off and he
06:18 said I want you to go watch this movie
06:19 here's the money here's some parkour
06:21 money whatever going to see this film
06:22 and so I got an amazing portfolio of
06:28 films in my system and you're thinking
06:30 about you know between 1975 and 1985
06:33 America created some of its greatest
06:35 films for story and in special effects
06:39 of the yellow star wars all the Indiana
06:42 Jones just you know poltergeist and et
06:46 and Blade Runner and Tron and and jaws
06:50 and Close Encounters of the Third Kind
06:54 and I say Dark Crystal Dark Crystal
06:56 just just tons training places
07:00 the list is insane and I got to live
07:03 through that which was cool and so now
07:06 when I write them I'm looking back on
07:08 those old films going geez why were
07:10 these better
07:10 why were these better they could even
07:13 have bad actors sometimes there's the
07:15 old movie the car amazing 1975 devil car
07:20 it's just it's got some corny ass stuff
07:23 in it but at the same time if you just
07:24 boil it down to what it is why no one's
07:26 remade that movie blows my mind it's
07:29 been they've paid homage to the car
07:31 inside the Simpsons it's cool and it's
07:35 like anyone knows what it is you know
07:37 you'd have to be in your I guess you
07:40 could be in your late 20s to really have
07:42 seen it and so today you know we have
07:47 seen this formula for success completely
07:50 change in films right what our films
07:54 supposed to do but you're gonna drive
07:56 somewhere to leave your house which
07:59 means you're going to be going for the
08:02 more epic experience a bigger screen a
08:04 bigger sound system you're someplace
08:07 other than your house so that's
08:08 interesting you're gonna go for the food
08:11 the experience you know popcorn smells a
08:14 certain way the candy smells a certain
08:16 way for me when I was a kid the Midwest
08:19 it was Twizzlers popcorn and soda and
08:22 then maybe as I got older it was Junior
08:26 Mints we'll compare our candy as
08:30 selections in the comments below but you
08:33 would always go for the hook and the
08:36 first act then some amazing you couldn't
08:40 possibly predict the next act which back
08:43 the old three act days and then this big
08:46 resolution would blow your mind right
08:48 and of course great films go back all
08:53 the way back to the beginning to where
08:55 my teacher you know tell us tells us
08:57 essentially movies like Casablanca which
09:00 is a little too sophisticated for me as
09:02 a kid now I watch it as an adult my jaws
09:04 all over the ground
09:05 especially as I now understand image
09:08 systems and lighting and and how just
09:11 masterful writing
09:13 but I don't expect you to jump on board
09:15 that unless that's something you already
09:17 know but today it's entertainment it is
09:24 not the element of a movie it's really
09:26 not
09:27 you're not going anymore for a story
09:29 you're going for sheer raw entertainment
09:32 which can be anything at all they can
09:35 get away with and there's all these
09:37 really you know lowbrow kind of Slick
09:42 Willy techniques that they're using now
09:44 to try and make a crappy movie better or
09:48 you know when it all comes together it's
09:50 it's phenomenal you know when there's a
09:52 soundtrack that comes together with a
09:53 great movie heavy metal which I think
09:56 came out an 81 it's an animated Mobius
10:00 it's done by a lot of different people
10:02 but it's mainly the biggest artist is
10:05 Mobius and it crazy sci-fi cartoons
10:09 it's got John Candy and it is a
10:12 voiceover work and it has a lot of
10:16 people I think it even has the
10:17 receptionist from ghostbusters does one
10:19 voice in there if I'm not mistaken but
10:22 the soundtrack is you know journey and
10:27 it was a Sammy Hagar and you know just a
10:31 bunch of these amazing bands putting it
10:33 all together so you have a great story
10:34 it's animated by different animators
10:37 which just looks phenomenal so as each
10:39 short story ends and then there's the
10:42 other tie together story on the outside
10:44 with the loc-nar it's just mind-blowing
10:47 you get done with that movie you're like
10:49 I have never seen anything like this in
10:51 my life and now we're 40 years past that
10:55 and I guarantee you you know you're not
10:58 having an experience today that's like
11:00 that you haven't great experiences but
11:03 you're not having that kind of
11:04 mind-blowing experience because
11:05 Hollywood doesn't have the balls to do
11:07 anything like that anymore
11:08 and hopefully through going out of
11:11 business when new companies start to
11:13 make film we're gonna get back to that
11:15 more risky formula but when I was a kid
11:19 the silver screen was where you found
11:22 the finest actors the finest production
11:24 people's finest special effects finest
11:27 ders score you know soundtrack people
11:31 and TV was always sort of the people
11:34 that couldn't get hired in film it
11:37 always you watch a cop show or you watch
11:39 some other show and and I'm talking I'm
11:41 not talking about the legends right the
11:43 legends you know mash and good times and
11:46 the Jeffersons and what is it
11:49 facts of life where there was different
11:52 strokes and like those actors didn't
11:54 screw up lines they always had it
11:56 together you know and there's a dozen
11:58 more and I'm not gonna go down the line
12:00 but but you would find cop shows with a
12:04 bunch of crappy actors and sometimes
12:06 you'd have like an actor who is not so
12:07 good
12:08 and when they first starred and then
12:10 they get really good and then they jump
12:11 into film and we're happy to see him so
12:14 there's that's kind of fun to see the
12:16 rookie card episodes essentially right
12:19 the story was always the thing if you
12:22 didn't have story film never got made
12:24 today
12:26 the films gonna get made everyone's
12:28 hired and you know at some point us some
12:32 words will show up you know I think in
12:37 the days of my childhood films ran the
12:43 business meaning if you didn't have a
12:46 great film you didn't have a business
12:48 today it's the opposite they got a
12:50 business they know how to cut a trailer
12:53 cut a movie poster cut twenty trailers
12:57 they know how to release it domestically
13:01 and then internationally they know how
13:04 to hire the best special effects teams
13:06 and they know if they seriously just buy
13:08 a core amount of special effects big
13:13 scenes that have nothing to do with
13:14 anything relevant or or they do have
13:18 relevance but they don't really pop your
13:20 heart they know if they can create you
13:23 cry one scene make you laugh ten scenes
13:26 kind of generally hold the story
13:29 together
13:29 then you won't [ __ ] and moan about
13:33 losing fifteen twenty bucks a ticket
13:35 going in there they convert them to 3d
13:38 every single time and they make an extra
13:40 four
13:41 million-dollars takes about three to
13:42 seven million dollars to take a 2d film
13:44 make it 3d and they make forty to fifty
13:47 million dollars off of 3d tickets so
13:49 it's always gonna be around China is the
13:53 opposite China loves 3d they're like 90%
13:56 3d 10% 2d I've been told this by a world
14:01 expert the guy that does most the
14:02 conversions in Hollywood I give the guy
14:05 I just watched the latest Godzilla and
14:10 I'm a Godzilla fan loved it so excited
14:15 about this film it was probably the most
14:23 painful film I have seen since the
14:26 remake and wholesale slaughter of The
14:28 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy movie
14:30 which boy I would have walked out of
14:34 that movie had I not taken my girlfriend
14:36 and my mom my stepdad I wanted to get to
14:40 the end of Godzilla to see if there was
14:42 any redeeming quality anything new to it
14:44 and I I just felt dirty after I watched
14:49 that I felt like oh my god I don't want
14:53 any formula of that film to infect me I
14:55 need to set it up as a sort of a
14:59 checksum that if anything I write could
15:02 possibly turn into Godzilla 2019 I need
15:06 to throw it away
15:07 if I want to write a great scene I'll
15:09 look at whatever they did and do exactly
15:11 the opposite if I ever got a chance to
15:13 direct a film I would do the opposite of
15:15 everything that the director chose the
15:18 special-effects I would do a completely
15:19 different every monster looked the same
15:22 it was like they only had a few textures
15:24 to put on the monsters right the the
15:27 whole world was just painted in this
15:28 weird look but I also thought he's like
15:34 I've mentioned recently I think Blade
15:35 Runner 2049 super duper letdown again we
15:41 just watched it in my lounge I had a guy
15:43 walk out other guys are just looking at
15:45 their phone nobody cares that this film
15:47 was on and they are in the exact
15:49 generation that loves Blade Runner 1982
15:52 we now have two Star Wars movies that
15:55 have been released as a sequence from
15:57 the originals we've got rogue one and we
16:01 have solo rogue one gets the best review
16:05 of everybody in the lounge when that
16:07 thing comes on everybody gets through it
16:10 and enjoys it there's still some weird
16:12 scenes in there but overall it holds up
16:16 solo nobody cares
16:19 the guy isn't solo he smiles through his
16:22 lines cuz he's so happy he got a role in
16:24 a movie
16:25 it's just that bad the other two Star
16:28 Wars I mean just go look at the Internet
16:30 the Internet's got a thousand critique
16:32 videos by fans who love the franchise
16:34 who wanted to succeed and they are doing
16:36 beautiful jobs trying to help Disney put
16:40 together something that feels like a
16:41 Star Wars movie it seems like every Star
16:45 Wars movie that's released has feelings
16:47 of the original franchise for me rogue
16:49 one felt felt the most consistent from
16:52 start to finish like a Star Wars film
16:54 made in the 21st century like you would
16:56 upgrade all the techniques right but
16:59 they keeps just inventing brand new
17:02 branches on the story like one of my
17:04 friends said it was a super star wars
17:06 fan he said look I don't mind these new
17:08 Star Wars movies but they're not Star
17:09 Wars movies they need to just say this
17:11 is a in the universe of Star Wars and
17:13 just changed all the names and then
17:15 you've got this other storyline and then
17:17 I think people would accept it but you
17:18 can't say we're going to sequel a film
17:23 series the most legendary film series on
17:25 planet earth either Star Wars bar none
17:27 right all the actors when they started
17:31 we're still life
17:32 all of them but they're not the main
17:35 characters are they because Disney felt
17:37 like oh we have to bring in a new
17:38 generation it's like yes you do but not
17:41 from the first scene people you do a
17:43 whole movie resurrecting the characters
17:46 putting them in scenes where they're
17:48 like I'm too old to be doing this but
17:50 I'm gonna do it anyway you know that
17:52 kind of thing and then middle of the
17:53 second film you start building up your
17:57 brand new characters and by the third
17:58 film you hand the whole franchise off to
18:00 these other kids pal
18:03 there you go
18:05 but they can't see that now here's the
18:09 business problem with us trying to help
18:11 Hollywood even just as fans okay we say
18:15 oh you should change something and then
18:18 someone in the room goes you know who
18:20 brought this person in here is sort of
18:22 the attitude and then it's like we've
18:24 made a ton of money what are you talking
18:27 about
18:27 this made 1.5 billion dollars and it
18:30 only costs 300 million to make what are
18:32 you talking about we just succeeded the
18:34 shareholders are happy studios are happy
18:36 to all the studios are bankrupt right
18:37 now they've borrowed so much money to
18:39 stay alive that it's sort of a
18:42 diminishing return they sort of have
18:43 like a national deficit at this point
18:47 and I want that to change
18:48 I want that to change big-time I'm
18:51 trying to help the process out but you
18:54 know you know me I'm a huge Tron fan Sol
18:56 Tron Legacy absolutely gorgeous film the
19:01 soundtrack is probably the best part of
19:04 the whole film and there's some really
19:06 great things about it the art direction
19:08 I think was great Joe Kaczynski has a
19:10 really good eye for that kind of stuff
19:12 but the story is a sad plagiarized
19:15 version of the first movie and it's a
19:18 tragedy at the end because the main
19:20 character doesn't accomplish really
19:22 anything that was his original goal in
19:24 fact he takes a girl out of the v
19:26 simulation at the end and you're like oh
19:28 really
19:29 what is that going to do right which is
19:31 why I put together my own Tron 3 you can
19:34 read that on the Facebook page what's
19:39 interesting about Hollywood is that it
19:41 you know if something goes bad in the
19:43 world you typically you know like a
19:46 product gets really bad
19:47 maybe the iPhones you get really old the
19:50 MacBooks get really screwed up all the
19:53 parts that remove there's no drive space
19:55 on the thing it's more expensive than
19:57 all the other computers but it's slower
19:59 it may be sexier to be opening it up at
20:03 the at the hipster coffee outlet of your
20:08 choice with your little you know that
20:11 longshoreman hat on in the middle of
20:13 summertime which I just don't get that
20:15 at all man but anyway
20:17 and so maybe you don't buy the product
20:20 maybe you write a bad review about the
20:22 product
20:23 maybe constructive but you write
20:25 something to let the company know and
20:27 their sales dwindle well with Apple and
20:32 even though they do have a lot of
20:33 products and they definitely make gobs
20:34 of money you know that's a slow well
20:39 it's a slow way to communicate with
20:41 Apple that you want them to change but
20:43 it is fairly effective because within a
20:45 year they would see product sales go
20:48 down a little bit
20:50 market share reduce a little bit right
20:53 that's just a hypothetical right not
20:55 trying to pick on Apple at this point
20:57 but for the movie studios they make so
20:59 many films and they know and this has
21:02 been classic formula for Hollywood
21:04 forever which is you make let's say you
21:06 made as one studio you put out 30 films
21:11 well you're only expecting about ma B 5
21:14 if you're lucky to totally blow the
21:17 doors off of your your books and to
21:18 bring home a ton of money and those
21:21 other ones that crashed well you just
21:23 use them for tax write-offs okay part of
21:28 what I think that we're fighting at this
21:30 point has to do with so many films are
21:33 getting made and you know some of them
21:35 if you were to pluck some of the movies
21:37 out of today and move them back and drop
21:39 them into the past some of the more
21:42 excellent ones which actually have
21:44 stories they would be world record
21:47 movies but you know they would bring
21:49 down the house the whole world would go
21:51 and see them 20 times James Cameron has
21:55 this magic touch
21:56 as long as James likes the film you're
21:58 gonna like the film it's just he's a
22:01 master at thought let me think about it
22:03 he went from from what is it aliens the
22:07 sequel he did of course the Terminator
22:10 he determinate her - he does I think he
22:13 did the first one definitely did the
22:14 second one but he just Titanic you know
22:19 when I heard about Titanic I mean I've
22:20 seen it one Jesus I don't even know if I
22:22 saw all the way through once but it's
22:24 not my kind of film but it doesn't
22:26 matter the movie I think is one of the
22:29 was
22:30 number two I think maybe it's number one
22:32 in the world in terms of money because
22:35 it was an international appeal people of
22:37 all walks of life had relatives or at
22:40 least their their culture was on that
22:43 boat you know I so it was interesting is
22:46 fascinating you know how it was gonna
22:48 end generally on the story the boat
22:50 sinks we all know that some people
22:53 survived he did a masterful job and then
22:57 he waits and cranks out this wild thing
22:59 called avatar which a lot of people now
23:01 are tired of hearing about avatar and
23:03 he's making two three four and five now
23:07 so I don't know how he's gonna be alive
23:09 by the time the last film is made but
23:11 he's he's inventing technology to make
23:13 these things faster so hopefully blows
23:16 our minds that you're not gonna see the
23:18 first one until December 2021 Wow no if
23:26 the guy gets hit by a bus
23:27 what happens to that project you know I
23:29 have some at least one good friend who
23:34 was deeply involved with the first one
23:37 but story seems to be the thing that's
23:39 missing for me personally I don't know
23:41 about you but the directions also
23:43 getting super bad things are people
23:47 getting promoted into these positions of
23:49 director and you know some people get
23:52 promoted into this like was it I know
23:55 the guy's background but the dude who
23:57 did thor ragnarok he's as wild dude I
24:01 mean I hope his records clean he
24:02 personally I don't wanna hear bad news
24:04 about the guy like a different dude does
24:07 Marvel movies but that movie was
24:09 hilarious it was a really weird story
24:12 but it was hilarious well that's cool
24:16 and it brings back hope in my heart that
24:20 these films can be made I saw infinity
24:23 Wars the second version second sequel to
24:25 it today and because it's so fresh and
24:28 so new I can't see anything about it you
24:30 know I thought it was it was okay you
24:34 know the the amount of I mean they they
24:39 timed the story's progression and the
24:41 species of the type of story that were
24:43 trying to tell
24:43 had a scientific problem that they
24:46 solved and then that you later got more
24:48 of the emotional implications of various
24:53 characters interacting with each other
24:54 there didn't run anything for you and so
24:57 it's really long it's three hours long
24:59 or very close to that obviously it is a
25:04 complete spectacle of special effects
25:08 and stuff but I will say towards the end
25:10 they created moments where I got goose
25:13 bumps and that's great but what I think
25:16 has occurred is that you have
25:18 special-effects companies that are
25:19 holding the industry together I don't
25:21 think that's any mystery but the thing
25:24 is so much stuff is getting made from
25:25 Netflix to maybe some Hulu originals not
25:29 too much there but Apple's getting into
25:30 the business amazon's already the
25:32 business and then you have the studios
25:34 then you have much independent folks man
25:37 there's like every reality show that
25:39 could ever be told has already been told
25:40 20 times I got into Netflix and I I will
25:45 every once in a while binge the lockup
25:48 shows you know the the reality shows of
25:51 all these prisoners they'll do like
25:52 males and females and then they do spins
25:54 on them from like you know serial
25:56 killers or you know lifers versus the
25:59 people that just go into just jail not
26:01 they don't go to prison and I saw a new
26:05 thing for lockup and I click into it and
26:09 someone has made a fictional series with
26:13 the same name as the reality show I
26:16 don't even know that's legally possible
26:17 I do not know maybe they paid him a gob
26:21 of money to reuse the name but I'll tell
26:24 you what one of the things that's sort
26:27 of shaking the lucidity into me and I
26:31 think it's the same for television
26:33 versus film I think most people most
26:35 people know that television is now
26:38 better than film and part of it is
26:41 because the special effects that are now
26:42 affordable on a television level unlike
26:45 ever before they can create it quickly
26:46 and it looks amazing and doesn't
26:48 bankrupt the the television studio or
26:52 whatever franchise is producing it right
26:55 well what do you get from television
26:57 you get a lot more real estate in time
27:00 to tell your story you have you know
27:04 star trek usually you know the latest
27:06 one can't watch it it's a gag fest but
27:10 the old ones you know from 2000 was it 5
27:13 I'll go back to 87 and then 69 to 67 you
27:19 know in the unites you would get 26
27:21 episodes roughly for a season plus you
27:24 have a one hour or no to our intro which
27:28 is about an hour and a half lead in
27:30 Episode two kind of kick off the whole
27:32 franchise to introduce the characters
27:34 Wow so you get a feature film length
27:37 television show to kick off the
27:39 franchise and then you get 25 40 minutes
27:45 lots 45 minutes lots to continue
27:47 developing the characters that's awesome
27:50 and then you get season after season
27:52 after season to keep building it up and
27:54 you know the stress on the writers is
27:58 intense to keep holding on the the under
28:02 the franchise but when you build a good
28:03 franchise the stories sort of write
28:06 themselves you know a Star Trek what's
28:08 nice about is it just writes itself if
28:11 you stick to the original way they used
28:13 to do things right but look at you know
28:18 carnival which I mentioned a lot I'm
28:19 gonna stick to my the ones that I think
28:22 are phenomenal it went to seasons
28:24 everybody wanted the third they wrote
28:25 the third or most of it and they just
28:27 couldn't keep everybody salary straight
28:29 so when they did Deadwood they signed
28:31 everybody for three-year contracts and
28:33 then again it gets amazing and then they
28:37 can't afford to keep going it's still
28:41 kind of a mystery how that got cancelled
28:43 out there there's some there were some
28:45 disputes on the production side as well
28:49 now we have things like stranger things
28:51 we have west world and there's just
28:54 there's a tremendous amount of amazing
28:56 shows out there what ash forces Evil
28:58 Dead it's a comedy it's hilarious it's
29:01 definitely not for everybody it's very
29:02 comedy bloody but there's just and I've
29:07 seen tons that I forgot their names I
29:09 even watched four seasons of
29:11 100 which when I first watched the first
29:13 shows I was like you but my girlfriend
29:16 at the time was like no no it gets
29:17 better it gets better just keep watching
29:20 and we watch them together so film I
29:24 don't understand why and how things get
29:29 greenlit before stories are finished
29:32 other than things like Star Wars where
29:34 you're like well we're definitely making
29:36 this film get started on spaceships
29:39 outfits locations well do we generally
29:43 have sort of a thumbnail you know idea
29:47 of how the story should go so he knows a
29:49 lot of the locations and things that
29:51 need to happen but you'll have a person
29:53 that just does knickknacks for an eatery
29:57 some restaurants something a little crap
29:59 sitting on the side you know but I
30:02 recently I've been to Disneyland since
30:03 they started the new Star Wars land and
30:06 I'm pretty sure that you know what they
30:08 have done if for those of you don't
30:10 frequent Disneyland or California Park
30:14 you know Disneyland was launched without
30:17 a lot of things working in 1955 and then
30:20 within the next three years a lot of
30:21 stuff got working and people understood
30:23 the original vision but they need to
30:24 start bringing in money as soon as
30:25 possible so the hit critical mass they
30:27 launched the place and they get it up
30:29 there to the point where it's you know
30:31 at times it brings in the most money
30:33 that the Disney franchise has to play
30:37 with right it allows him to acquire
30:41 places like Pixar and Marvel and the
30:44 Hinson Muppet company that kind of stuff
30:47 right when California Park launched it
30:51 was bleak it was just a bunch of kind of
30:54 repurposed carnival rides Six Flags kind
30:58 of purchased the ride and install it and
30:59 paint it give it some Disney spin in
31:02 some cases they had some things that
31:05 were prettier back then that they have
31:07 that they have since torn down later
31:10 they did probably a 50% rebuild of the
31:13 whole place took a bunch of stuff down
31:15 which kind of blew my mind and now it's
31:19 probably as frequented if not more
31:23 frequently than the
31:24 the initial park you know so they did
31:28 the Star Wars land
31:29 I watched of course the thing is is that
31:31 everybody here locally has gone and
31:33 they're like the place is empty and some
31:36 guy his film like an HD version of it
31:38 beautiful camerawork you want a kind of
31:42 an overcast cool day it's June and he's
31:46 walking around and there's nobody there
31:47 you know and maybe he got in there
31:51 before the entire masses were left in
31:53 there but he filmed the place
31:55 head to toe every single attraction
31:58 every single thing that's in there and
32:00 again they've got attractions that
32:01 aren't open yet and they're gonna be put
32:02 in there the reason the reason why
32:05 mentioning this is that I you see this
32:08 beautiful place I mean it's it's bizarre
32:12 for me it doesn't look I would sit this
32:16 way it only remotely looks like Star
32:18 Wars it doesn't really feel like Star
32:20 Wars at all and I can I haven't been
32:23 inside the rides but do you think I even
32:24 filmed the ride in the Millennium Falcon
32:28 and it it was you it must be better when
32:32 you're in it because I wouldn't wait in
32:34 line for what I saw on YouTube really
32:37 sad right but this is how I feel about
32:40 films you have Godzilla it was no
32:44 shortage of great actors the actors in
32:46 the film are showing up for business
32:48 they're not blowing lines they're doing
32:50 great jobs has the girl from stranger
32:53 things in it which she's just a flawless
32:55 lacquer man she's amazing but what
32:59 they've done with the last two
33:01 Godzilla's is they try to build this
33:03 family unit and get you to care about it
33:06 while Godzilla's doing something to save
33:09 the world and of course the family gets
33:11 torn apart and their sacrifice is here
33:14 and there you know always somebody in
33:16 the family dies tries to pull your
33:18 heartstrings out but the problem is is
33:20 you simply don't care that these people
33:23 pass away I mean it's like you kind of
33:25 have that basic instinctive well yeah
33:27 but this movies already been so
33:29 outrageous and you have to live on the
33:32 suspension of disbelief fence to a
33:35 degree that when someone dies it doesn't
33:37 even feel real
33:39 one of the common things is that they
33:41 have too many storylines going and I
33:42 think Godzilla had way too many
33:44 storylines going because you need you
33:47 need time to understand a story and then
33:52 you need time to sew it into your heart
33:54 and if they're constantly changing
33:56 between this group of people with that
33:58 group of people this group of people a
33:59 bunch of scientific military people
34:01 trying to figure out how to handle
34:03 monsters and this is the family unit
34:05 over here and then you just have the
34:07 monsters doing stuff when you divide up
34:10 the economy of the two hours and three
34:12 hours you're gonna make a film there's
34:14 just not enough time to care about
34:15 anything for me I have seen probably
34:18 two-thirds of games Game of Thrones and
34:21 I know that there's a gigantic following
34:24 for this thing for me personally there's
34:27 so many storylines that I just couldn't
34:32 care about anyone and everyone who you
34:35 thought was good turns into a
34:37 backstabber
34:38 some of the backstabbers turned out to
34:39 be good but you don't find that
34:42 information out until last two episodes
34:44 of the last season before the show's
34:45 canceled or you know it concludes right
34:48 you do see you know but they try to do
34:50 now is they lure you with boobies you
34:53 know and nudity and just bloodbath
34:57 carnage stuff which just blows my mind
34:59 because when I was a kid there was a
35:00 standard in the house about what you let
35:02 your kids see and not see you know as
35:05 much as you know it's really funny I I
35:08 think about this moment when I was a kid
35:13 I lived in this one neighborhood of my
35:16 little hometown where it was just I
35:20 don't know man it was right out of a
35:22 Steven Spielberg movie we had these
35:25 houses that were all up and down this
35:27 street and then we had this little like
35:32 I don't know what it was like a little
35:33 forest deaqon a little place to kind of
35:35 sowed all of our houses together even
35:37 though we're in town it's really strange
35:38 but we would play sort of army games
35:42 where even the girls you know we'd have
35:45 these black guns that look like real
35:47 guns and someone look kind of goofy and
35:49 they had these you pull back this
35:50 ratchet thing and you pull the trigger
35:51 and the reticle
35:52 dddddd so it sounds like a gun I
35:56 remember doing this as a kid and
35:58 thinking you know this is awesome this
36:01 was just like pretend land the whole
36:04 neighborhood was like a pretend land and
36:06 of course today you know little kids are
36:09 pulling guns on cops and cops are
36:10 shooting kids in the face because
36:12 somehow the police in my hometown can
36:14 figure out that a kid was playing a game
36:16 and now since I guess one or two
36:19 children have grabbed their father's gun
36:20 now every kid is you know killable it's
36:24 just really strange right and I feel so
36:26 sorry for any of the police officers
36:28 that accidentally shoot people someone
36:31 near the day of our guy pulled a an air
36:33 rifle out of a hotel room if they push
36:36 open the door the guy has an air rifle
36:38 and I can't tell what it is is black you
36:41 know and he comes out and he's trying to
36:43 poof poof poof poof and his dude mowed
36:46 him down he's dead he actually shot his
36:48 partner ten feet on the other side of
36:50 this guy crazy right but the reason I
36:54 mentioned that is that you know violence
36:56 you know we did get a little freaked out
36:58 when kids would get violent like some
36:59 kids would watch something on TV and
37:01 they would get you know a plastic sword
37:04 or something and they'd walk up to their
37:06 sister and poke them in the eye like
37:07 just stupid children
37:09 or they're just just ignorant of what
37:12 they're about to do there's no cause and
37:13 effect in their brain of like I want to
37:16 do what I saw on TV book and there's a
37:19 couple stories I think when I was a kid
37:21 that kids would get knifes and and they
37:24 wonder how they feel and how they work
37:25 and they poke a kid or poke themselves
37:27 or something and it's just saying okay
37:29 that's how I learned now things were hot
37:31 it's a dead is that hot and he was
37:32 untouched Shh remember my finger yep
37:36 it's hot people might think that's
37:39 horrible but it's funny remember my
37:41 there was a soldering iron my dad was
37:43 doing some work yeah I just asked him I
37:46 said is that hot and he goes touch it
37:48 mmm Murr my finger and you know hurt for
37:52 three or four days blistered over and he
37:56 knew it wasn't gonna kill me
37:57 it was like yeah you just need to learn
37:58 that you need to attach that thing to
38:00 your to your brain now you know how to
38:01 get close to it without touching this
38:03 sort of thing right
38:05 and he might digress a little much there
38:08 there was this expectation of substance
38:11 and films back in the day and I don't
38:14 think they the expectation exists at all
38:16 today and it's just nerve-racking it's
38:20 like people will come into a movie and
38:22 say it's amazing and then you walk out
38:25 and my question constantly is what was
38:28 it about and usually I know a great film
38:32 where you're gonna know what it's about
38:34 and then these other films you walk out
38:36 you're like I really don't know but it
38:38 was really neat you don't have to Tron
38:40 Legacy California Park at night
38:44 cannibalized one of their streets in
38:46 this back area and it was called
38:48 electronica and it turned into Tron it
38:52 was kind of boring on the street but it
38:53 kind of gets you into the vibe and then
38:54 you walk through you walked under a
38:56 recognizer which was cool and they had
38:58 this big DJ booth and like I at least a
39:01 thousand to three thousand kids were
39:02 there every single night blowin a ton of
39:04 dough
39:04 of course Disney has to get rid of it
39:06 because it's one of the coolest things
39:08 in the whole park like that could just
39:09 be there forever give me a break
39:11 when's the last time you told any of the
39:13 stories that have rides you know Peter
39:15 Pan was told a long time ago still got
39:17 it right for it you know was the
39:18 Sleeping Beauty still got a castle for
39:20 Splash Mountain which it was it the
39:23 zippity-doo-dah guy still got a briar
39:26 patch ride why get rid of the Tron thing
39:28 it was stupid but they have these kids
39:30 it would make their own lit suits and it
39:33 was so exciting because I thought man
39:35 they're gonna sequel this thing it's
39:36 it's alive again it's a really cool
39:38 franchise in with the special effects
39:40 and Daft Punk and the gang image should
39:43 be really cool they didn't do too well
39:45 in the first one but maybe we'll do
39:46 better on the second one anyway the more
39:48 I had to dissect the film you know I
39:52 thought I mean I walked out of the
39:53 theater after I saw and thought well
39:55 that story was complete trash but I'm
39:58 still happy the franchise got rebooted
40:00 you know but I'd ask these kids who have
40:03 spent countless hours on the franchise
40:06 building their suits and stuff and I'd
40:08 say you know you really liked it didn't
40:10 you yeah oh yeah it's a little great man
40:12 I said okay well what about the story do
40:15 you like the most
40:17 absolute deer eyes oh well I just like
40:21 the way it looked in the way it sounded
40:23 okay remember the first thing I
40:26 mentioned in the beginning episode
40:27 entertainment well they were entertained
40:30 it's just the definition of what movie
40:33 is is kind of turned into a playground
40:34 you go inside this area which is a
40:38 theatre think about a playground theater
40:40 right if you want to go to the
40:42 playground are there rules no you got
40:47 slide yeah swing you get some maybe a
40:50 sandbox or something you can mess around
40:52 in some jungle gym monkey bars whatever
40:55 you're doing whatever you want maybe you
40:57 just swing today that's all you do well
41:00 the film's today I laughed a little bit
41:03 I felt sad I felt great I felt all
41:06 energized the story doesn't have to
41:10 actually make any sense you can just be
41:13 this experience but there has to be a
41:16 reason why be on your television set
41:20 okay cannibalizing the experience has it
41:25 be a reason why people don't want to go
41:26 to films anymore
41:27 go to the movie theater and every time I
41:30 have the organic conversation with
41:32 someone about this everyone admits
41:34 fairly quickly yeah I don't go to movies
41:36 anymore and I say why
41:38 and they go no one really says it's too
41:42 expensive
41:43 some people will but they say you know
41:47 there's just nothing good out oh yeah
41:50 well what do you watch when you're at
41:52 home well they only watch the good
41:54 movies which is just a handful of all
41:56 the ones that are made usually they wait
41:58 for sort of a buzz from their friends to
42:01 say you really got to see this this is a
42:02 really phenomenal but almost without
42:05 trying the television is just kicking
42:07 films ass okay so obviously there's an
42:14 ecosystem and TV today that is missing
42:18 from film today and what do you think
42:21 that is well think about it this way
42:26 a movie is a one time shot it's between
42:30 an hour and a half to three hours long
42:32 and you just have to create a spectacle
42:38 that's going to kind of pass the overall
42:41 litmus test of entertainment and then
42:45 everyone's gonna forget it anyway and
42:47 they leave you know the amount of movies
42:50 I've seen in the last probably three
42:52 years that I don't remember yeah someone
42:55 mentions it to me
42:55 oh yeah yeah that fell on me how that
42:57 was really suck didn't it you know but
43:00 the television shows they absolutely
43:03 have to have story and you know why cuz
43:07 there's an episode to things like black
43:11 mirror are a bit more like film every
43:15 episodes and Alucard experience just
43:17 like the original Twilight zones I
43:19 haven't seen any the latest season
43:21 because absolutely everyone I've talked
43:23 to said they're all horrible and I
43:25 thought yeah someone's gonna say that
43:27 but there probably weren't a die-hard
43:28 black mirror fan and how most my
43:31 die-hard friends are like yeah it's
43:32 horrible they think the one with Miley
43:34 Cyrus has some legs but that's about it
43:36 well that's kind of sad I mean isn't
43:39 that isn't that just sort of a letdown
43:41 so there's some genetic inside of TV
43:46 that is surviving and thriving and
43:49 growing and it is dying in the film
43:51 industry now if you travel in my circles
43:56 people are always trying to penetrate
43:58 the film industry because it is truly
44:01 where you can create a really kind of
44:05 finite moment in time where something
44:07 epic happens I mean think about it they
44:09 never really made I can't say that
44:15 actually a lot of things have been
44:16 sequel that shouldn't have been sequel I
44:17 think poltergeist should have never been
44:19 sequels I feel like they did know they
44:23 were going to sequel Close Encounters of
44:26 the Third Kind I'm going but way back
44:27 for you guys but there's just these epic
44:30 movies that come and they're done boom
44:33 and they just sit there in time as this
44:36 checksum of how amazing people were
44:40 in Hollywood at that time but there's a
44:43 huge genetic difference between a movie
44:45 studio 40 years ago and a movie studio
44:48 today and I remember my friends in the
44:52 industry were warning me this was gonna
44:55 happen and you know it's kind of guy I
44:56 believe them but I just didn't know how
44:58 to frame it in my mind but they used to
45:02 have studios that were fully staffed to
45:05 everything that they did they didn't
45:07 have special-effects back in the day
45:08 that weren't doable in-house and that
45:12 was the cool thing that you know MGM
45:15 would have a group of people that could
45:17 pull off some special effects for some
45:18 sci-fi movies or King Kong movies or
45:20 something like that and then you had
45:23 Universal and probably I'm not saying
45:25 King Kong it's made by this those groups
45:27 but they had it all in-house and so when
45:32 it came to visualizing a film and
45:35 bringing it all together the spine of a
45:38 film in order to get it even remotely
45:41 into the pipeline they were doing almost
45:45 exclusively all original scripts right
45:48 only only big blockbusters went to the
45:51 next one and the next one the next one
45:52 and so that was the name of the game
45:56 everyone was sitting around waiting for
45:58 an original franchise to arrive to blow
46:01 it up today I would say what 50% of the
46:06 films are all sequels or reboots and
46:08 they're always working from someone
46:10 else's DNA in the past of which that
46:12 seems in most cases they didn't
46:13 understand what the original film was
46:15 and so the reboots are like bad
46:18 impersonations but the big change is
46:23 that you had in industry people and say
46:26 Charlie Chaplin's day where he ran his
46:28 own shop right he owned most the real
46:30 estate in northern LA I mean he you know
46:37 some of you live in towns like this town
46:39 this town was owned by a family called
46:41 the Seagrams Seger's Seagram strim
46:43 family and the Slater family I think
46:47 they married each other whatever but I
46:48 live on a street called Slater and they
46:52 owned all the land like
46:53 miles and miles and miles of orchards
46:55 and eventually it was sold off to be
46:57 developed - no there's no orchards it's
46:59 all land
46:59 okay so Studios used to be similar and
47:03 that they had there they had executives
47:07 that had film either experience later on
47:11 they had to have film credentials they
47:14 went to school for something related to
47:16 film either they were a writer
47:19 they were cinematographer they were
47:20 director and you know there's a lot of
47:23 privilege to get into these jobs because
47:25 there's there's only a handful of
47:28 director positions out there of any epic
47:31 size right and so when the scripts came
47:34 in they could look at a script really
47:36 quickly and find out you know we've done
47:38 this before oh we have never done this
47:40 before this will work because of that
47:42 that's been done too many times and
47:45 right from the very beginning the story
47:48 was the make-or-break moment before you
47:51 called everybody else and today they
47:54 call everyone else first
47:56 outside Consulting Group's because these
47:59 these companies have fractured they
48:01 blown up literally like an explosion and
48:04 so you have and I mean that by the way
48:08 what I mean by that is that the
48:11 employees no longer work for the studios
48:12 directly in a lot of cases they hire
48:16 outside firms for everything outside
48:17 people people work for four or five
48:20 different studios
48:22 so Studios no longer have a unique look
48:25 a universal film can look just like an
48:29 MGM Sony film 20th Century Fox will look
48:32 just like some other studio and that
48:36 breaks down the uniqueness of all things
48:39 such that you it would be like buying
48:41 food but you're going to a Chinese
48:44 restaurant and you're gonna get a little
48:46 bit of pasta a little bit of you know
48:49 barbecue from an all-american recipe and
48:51 you get a little bit of Chinese food but
48:54 then you go off to the Italian
48:56 restaurant and you're getting a little
48:57 bit of Chinese food a little bit of
48:59 American food and a little bit of
49:00 Italian food and so everywhere you go
49:04 you're getting tired of everything that
49:06 everyone has to offer
49:07 constantly that's why I think James
49:09 Cameron because he has Wetty and his in
49:12 his own production company he only works
49:15 with two groups and believe me if you if
49:17 you don't do it his way it's the highway
49:19 and he's like you're crawling into my
49:22 mind one of the other franchises in the
49:26 world that was like that was Apple when
49:29 you had Steve Jobs well even with Steve
49:31 Wozniak back in the day you had two guys
49:33 creating their vision it felt different
49:35 than all the other visions Steve went
49:38 off and created the the Macintosh
49:41 totally original looking computer
49:44 changed the entire world then he runs
49:46 away and creates the next computer which
49:48 ended up influencing everything Apple
49:50 did after 1996 you're still living in
49:53 like a Johnny Ives
49:55 Steve Jobs world you know the iPod was
49:58 cool and the iPad was cool and the
50:00 watches are cool and the computers are
50:02 cool as soon as that guy passes away you
50:06 know it's gone it's totally gone it'll
50:09 never return ever until one of those
50:12 guys or gals is born again and so with
50:15 the studio's now you have migrated from
50:18 these people that were heavily trained
50:21 in the industry to get their jobs
50:24 where all the films were amazing amazing
50:27 amazing amazing now did we get some
50:29 formulaic films sure you know the
50:31 sixties there was a lot of what Elvis
50:33 Presley Hawaiian movies and they were
50:35 just sort of fun films no one was going
50:37 for the Oscar review but at the same
50:41 time you had you know Planet of the Apes
50:43 you know like amazing original
50:45 franchises that are coming out of
50:47 nowhere you don't see that much nowadays
50:50 because nowadays as I understand it it's
50:54 more business people people with no film
50:57 experience at all no film degrees of any
51:00 kind meaning any discipline that makes a
51:03 film occur the people at the top are
51:06 business people because there's so much
51:08 writing on the business side of things
51:11 now they do try to hire folks directly
51:14 underneath them that have an eyeball for
51:16 something but here's the problem
51:19 I'll give an example even an absurd
51:22 example because I think the absurdity is
51:25 relevant here I've never worked in the
51:30 shipping global shipping market oil
51:33 products on these shipping barges big
51:37 rigs that take it on domestically trains
51:39 that take you - I've never been in
51:41 industry in my whole life what I know
51:43 about that is what I've seen on a couple
51:45 minutes of TV right and so if I ever got
51:50 that position because I was a great
51:51 business person right and someone said I
51:54 want you to run this this freight
51:59 business okay I know I need to hire some
52:03 people underneath me that know Freight
52:05 because I don't I'll take care of the
52:07 numbers you tell me how something costs
52:09 let's say how much I'm selling a for
52:10 will have a P&L statement and I'd say if
52:12 I got a business or none okay the
52:15 problem is is that I wouldn't be an aid
52:17 level player in the freight business I
52:20 best see to a deep layer because I don't
52:23 know how am I gonna hire an a player
52:26 best I could do is really read someone's
52:30 references have some friends that I
52:33 trust that do know Freight they can say
52:35 you know that guy is huge that girl is
52:36 the best boom boom boom how are those
52:38 and you'll have a company okay well if
52:44 you ever been to a party of Industry
52:47 especially a very feel-good industry
52:49 like Hollywood you will have people bump
52:53 into each other with some cocktails have
52:55 a good little moment what do you do oh
52:56 you do that well I got a job opening in
52:58 you want this I don't know why I try off
52:59 a little while whatever and they commit
53:01 and then it's the game of who made the
53:06 mistake making this movie and so I think
53:12 that if you were to look at the pre
53:14 qualifications for a lot of folks that
53:16 have these very coveted jobs they're
53:19 very talented in something but it
53:21 probably isn't film unless the studio's
53:24 doing really really well at that
53:25 particular time and so it's this
53:29 liability game because people don't want
53:33 to lose the
53:33 positions imagine for those of you have
53:36 ever fantasized about being a director
53:37 on a film lots of people have a vision
53:41 it's extremely tough amazing mental and
53:45 physical job you're up constantly you're
53:48 dealing with you know a million
53:50 different departments you're trying to
53:52 hold a vision together you're gonna get
53:54 tired and you're gonna have to review
53:56 something and you're going to have to
53:58 not make a mistake because your films
54:00 gonna be as strong as its weakest link
54:02 right well what I hear all the time and
54:05 I hear this all the time it's almost
54:08 making me sick that I hear it so much is
54:10 that the reason why Hollywood sucks is
54:12 that no one wants to take credit for a
54:14 flop of any kind it could be the film's
54:17 great but the soundtrack sucks film does
54:20 okay financially but as long as a bunch
54:21 of reviews come in and say it would have
54:23 been a 10 if the soundtrack didn't suck
54:26 whoever is responsible for making that
54:28 soundtrack is never gonna be hired again
54:31 maybe and at least the person who hired
54:34 them for that particular movie will be
54:36 out of the industry and then you will go
54:38 from hero to zero and nobody wants that
54:40 and these hero to zero formulas apply
54:42 all the way up to the top of the
54:44 studio's the executives who make these
54:46 things make these decisions are worried
54:48 about this and I would be too
54:50 which is why I get as informed as
54:52 possible
54:53 you know before I'd ever try to hold
54:55 those kind of positions now sometimes
54:58 the studio's luck out and they find
55:00 directors that are hot you know take Tim
55:03 Burton in the late 80s early 90s my god
55:06 the guy was just Babe Ruth man just boom
55:08 boom boom from Batman to beetlejuice
55:11 Edward Scissorhands Nightmare Before
55:14 Christmas which he just produced someone
55:16 else directed it but I mean seriously
55:18 his visions there's a museum
55:20 installation that travels the United
55:22 States probably does globally with his
55:24 stuff in it you get a Kubrick you get a
55:27 Spielberg you get a Lucas you get a
55:29 Ridley Scott you get a James Cameron
55:31 these amazing directors that just just
55:35 give them what they need yeah they're
55:37 probably gonna get a little over budget
55:39 but they tend to create magic and then
55:43 you hear about films like Blade Runner
55:45 I should say close encounters of Blade
55:48 Runner have something in common which is
55:49 very interesting both directors were
55:53 fired off the film let's repeat their
55:57 title their names Steven Spielberg was
55:59 fired off of Close Encounters and Ridley
56:02 Scott was fired off a Blade Runner but
56:05 you know what they did both of them
56:07 ignored being fired both of them came to
56:10 work the next day continued shooting and
56:12 got the film done and both films are
56:15 just heirlooms to American filmmaking
56:21 desam balls right all films have had
56:24 major funding issues you know Star Wars
56:30 had major funding issues even though the
56:32 first one did great they were gonna
56:34 pinch the second one real hard indiana
56:36 jones had a huge budgetary problem
56:38 Bladerunner that film went bankrupt
56:42 three times he told him at the initial
56:46 onset I need thirty million dollars to
56:48 make this film and they said well we'll
56:49 give you a ten you say it's not enough
56:51 well that's all you got sorry so he gets
56:54 the tin he's only 1/3 done he has to
56:57 bust out of his contract get ten million
56:59 from somewhere else
57:00 busted a contract and the last company I
57:02 believe was the Ladd company which is
57:04 way of that weird tree at the beginning
57:06 of the film they had never done film
57:08 before as I understand it from the book
57:09 called a future new war okay the movie
57:13 is now the ultimate heirloom next to the
57:18 other film that had major major budget
57:20 crisis which is the Wizard of Oz right
57:23 like that went bankrupt don't even know
57:24 how many times it was like five or six
57:26 times it went bankrupt The Wizard of Oz
57:29 Gone with the Wind a Blade Runner or
57:30 considered the top three heirlooms of
57:32 American filmmaking by the people who
57:36 protect film it's amazing and then
57:41 what's interesting is you have folks
57:42 that sort of do what I call the American
57:45 Idol audition these directors that get
57:48 the opportunity to sequel something or
57:51 reboot it and they don't treat it with
57:55 the respect that it needs or they don't
57:57 have the skill set to get to
57:59 the the bass critical mass of what a
58:04 sequel or reboot would need I can't
58:08 mention this director's name but he's
58:09 part of one of the big reboots I just
58:11 mentioned he's never taken any formal
58:15 film schooling he refused to take any
58:18 writing courses to figure out how to
58:20 dissect a good story and he ended up
58:24 slaughtering one of the reboots and it
58:26 story was part of the biggest problem in
58:29 the film
58:31 you have directors who well you know
58:35 I'll just mention one of them not by
58:39 name because I don't know the guys name
58:40 I've seen it written a couple times they
58:42 can't remember it it was so interesting
58:44 to me but Blade Runner for instance was
58:48 reviled for its scene design set design
58:52 the lighting was phenomenal Ridley Scott
58:55 was notorious for forcing you to take a
58:58 million million you know shots until you
59:01 got it right takes and you know that
59:04 Kubrick was the same way
59:06 but you know Kubrick only had a couple
59:08 times when he was dealing with Scatman
59:12 Crothers for The Shining Scatman
59:15 Crothers was 88 when that film was made
59:17 so he was he was entering the point
59:18 where it was hard to remember lines and
59:20 of course if you get nervous and excited
59:21 and you don't want to fail that puts you
59:23 in a fight-or-flight mode which is an
59:26 added extra problem alright so anyway he
59:29 had I just learned this recently it was
59:33 over a hundred takes to get most of
59:35 Scatman Crothers shots done air one one
59:39 particular scene had this big problem on
59:41 that particular day James Cagney had the
59:43 same problem in his career which is why
59:44 he quit
59:45 but CGI Blade Runner that's known for
59:48 volumetric lighting it's film noir which
59:51 is a French style of shooting in that
59:52 sort of dark night look and you I just
59:56 re-watched it the other day and just
59:58 detected it from my brain and there's
60:00 just not a shot in the entire film that
60:03 isn't epically perfectly done perfectly
60:07 done and so you watch the new film
60:11 and it looks like some of the scenes
60:13 were filmed almost like it was sort of
60:19 like one of those tests shots you would
60:22 do just to get the blocking down just to
60:24 kind of get people a bit over lit rooms
60:29 people's faces blown out you know I
60:31 forgot was it's the woman from house of
60:34 cards and Princess Bride right and she
60:38 smokes a lot and she's in her early 50s
60:40 I think and you know her skin isn't
60:43 perfect okay she's just a normal human
60:45 being but what did he do he blew her out
60:48 with so much lighting it was ridiculous
60:50 in it when you light a room I mean when
60:53 you go to a nightclub at night right or
60:55 a nice nice restaurant where you bring
60:58 your date it's not lit with fluorescent
61:01 lights blown completely out so if you
61:03 drop something on the ground you could
61:04 just still read it you know it's not
61:06 that way the best steak houses in the
61:08 world have low ceilings and this nice
61:10 lighting and you know beautiful mood
61:12 music not that film that film has at
61:14 least a third of its shots utterly
61:17 blowing out the guy even arranged the
61:19 cameras he's filming the floor which is
61:20 all sterile and and clean when the rest
61:23 of the rooms trying to look complicated
61:24 I mean it was just the most rookie
61:29 cinematography and direction I've ever
61:31 seen out of a movie that was supposed to
61:34 be massive it's already got massive
61:35 story problems right are you just bored
61:38 to death but there are a couple scenes
61:41 where it feels exactly like Blade Runner
61:43 when running it's a Ryan Gosling yeah
61:48 well the main character goes down to he
61:50 hangs out with some prostitutes right
61:52 and that was very Blade Runner Sh every
61:54 time they turned is seen over to the
61:56 special effects team and they just had
61:57 the whole city and the spinners the new
62:01 spinners flying through the city well
62:03 the special effects team watched the
62:05 movie and they know what a scenes made
62:07 out of and that's when the scene looked
62:08 proper and so I think that we have lost
62:12 the art of filmmaking just in
62:14 compositional ways you know the new
62:17 Godzilla film they got really into this
62:20 thing and a little bit of it's in the
62:22 infinity infinity Wars series
62:24 as well but I think it works with of any
62:26 words because they break from this look
62:27 and they use this this atmospheric smoke
62:33 sparingly the the little scene that had
62:36 an emotional feel of the atmosphere and
62:39 that's very important right those of you
62:41 play World of Warcraft you know when you
62:42 go into a different world it makes you
62:43 feel different inside the colors are
62:45 different and then the storylines that
62:47 the action matches look right well in
62:50 Godzilla it's this volume this crazy
62:54 particle system you know this is sadness
62:56 very dreariness the entire film and they
62:59 keep trying to create every single shot
63:01 tries to be way too epic and again you
63:05 know if you ever watched the movie
63:08 brainstorm there's a scene in that film
63:11 where a guy realized that he he bought
63:14 it there was some it was a movie about
63:16 how he could record all of your emotions
63:18 and you play it back on a headset and
63:19 you have all the emotions and all the
63:21 feelings like you're there well one guy
63:24 from the laboratory is this kind of
63:27 squirmy guy he takes one of the lab
63:29 girls home and they have sex and they
63:30 record it and then he starts selling
63:32 that renting out his contraband to the
63:35 other lab guys and this one dude who's
63:37 probably in his 60s he takes the orgasm
63:41 and he cuts it and he loops it and he
63:44 just plays it and he's sitting in his in
63:46 his study at his house and he's just
63:48 going he just keeps orgasming great and
63:51 Christopher Walken finds him knocks it
63:53 off his head and he's all screwed up he
63:55 ends up in the hospital but then
63:56 afterwards he goes about a month later
63:59 he's like oh my god I feel like a new
64:00 man you know somehow it made him younger
64:01 whatever but if you were to truly do
64:04 that your body would cancel it out right
64:08 your brain does that that's why you have
64:10 to take more drugs you know if you're if
64:12 you're drug addicted person you always
64:13 have to take more because your brain is
64:14 canceling out most of the effect if you
64:17 drink alcohol talk to doctors somebody's
64:19 been an alcoholic their entire lifetime
64:21 they drink but they're not getting that
64:24 high they used to get they get this
64:25 weird thing you get the anger algorithm
64:28 because there's bodies being attacked
64:29 and they don't know what's going on it's
64:31 such a except [ __ ] right
64:33 well movies are trying to pop you too
64:36 much in my opinion is some case
64:38 is a lot of times you can see the
64:41 budgets right you'll have films where
64:44 nothing's going on for the first half of
64:46 the movie and they're trying to hold the
64:48 you know like the Godzilla reveal and
64:51 you get it you got to be careful with
64:53 that you can't get in he's a pop so you
64:54 gotta be maybe opening scene where you
64:57 see Godzilla you know maybe just a part
65:00 of him or the affected him or maybe the
65:01 bad guy is the only one you see and you
65:03 kind of get the idea of the threat in
65:05 the film and then we dive back down to
65:08 the people we find out what they're
65:10 thinking and then you have like kind of
65:12 a good middle battle and in a gigantic
65:14 in battle it's like these formulas have
65:16 been out forever
65:17 how many of you have seen you know
65:19 movies with like like rocky fights well
65:22 what happens with a rocky fight well
65:24 rocky comes out of swinging and he's
65:25 these nail in it for the bots the first
65:27 third to 40% of the fight and then the
65:30 the opponent starts tearing him a new
65:34 one and you feel like all his lost
65:36 Rocky's on the ground now he can't even
65:38 spell his name anymore doesn't know
65:40 where he is and somehow he's a hero he
65:44 is rocky he wakes up there's his mind
65:46 kicks the other guy's butt and he finds
65:48 all this unspent energy and he has and
65:51 then we're all hooray hooray and the
65:52 movies over all monster fights are
65:55 exactly the same way that the Godzilla
65:57 fight at the end of this film which is
65:58 not just one fights this huge cluster
66:04 again the effects are done well I just
66:07 think that the the the monster designs
66:10 were in some cases amazing and brilliant
66:13 course Godzilla's locked he's locked the
66:16 way he looks and he think he looks great
66:18 but they took one other monster and gave
66:20 him Godzilla's entire texture and so he
66:23 shows up and you're like oh that's a gal
66:26 Zil is shaped like a moth you know it's
66:28 not Mothra it's just different one
66:29 maater looks kind of neat but then they
66:33 they try these little attempts to create
66:35 you know personalities with these things
66:36 and you're just like you know don't
66:38 don't do that you don't have enough time
66:40 you're not cutting enough time in your
66:41 film to have me care about this
66:43 particular monster just get on with the
66:45 destruction right but they take fight
66:48 scenes from monsters and they drag them
66:50 out too long
66:51 and of course what's happening at the
66:53 executive level someone's pitching the
66:56 film and in this fight see oh man we're
67:00 gonna blow it out it's we're pulling out
67:01 all the whistles and all the you know
67:03 whatever bells and it's gonna last for
67:06 30 minutes and you're just and the execs
67:09 like that sounds great entertainment the
67:11 tickets paid for now you know like when
67:13 they pay their 15 bucks to see this film
67:14 they're not gonna complain well by the
67:18 time they get done with this film
67:19 you're so spent and you're not really
67:22 that rewarded that you won't see the
67:25 film twice you know films don't have any
67:29 depth nowadays depth is what may should
67:31 go back to see it twice some people went
67:34 back to see The Sixth Sense several
67:36 times just make sure they got all the
67:38 the clues that would have revealed the
67:40 ending to you earlier
67:41 that's huge I rewatched Blade Runner
67:44 recently right and I've been taught how
67:47 to write films by the best teacher in
67:49 the world I've been to him three times
67:52 I've devoured his book probably more
67:55 than any science in the world I know
67:57 what I'm supposed to do but I rewatched
68:00 I felt when I thought wow that film
68:05 breaks almost every screenwriting rule
68:08 or guideline my teacher never says their
68:10 rules bases their guidelines he breaks
68:12 them completely he was at Hampton
68:16 Fincher and David peoples for a Blade
68:17 Runner okay so if I were to take that
68:22 script today it had never been made and
68:24 I bring it to my teacher and I narrate
68:26 it to him over some $7,000 session you
68:29 can have with my teacher he probably got
68:32 me and say man you're missing everything
68:34 you're missing it's what kind of film is
68:36 it again oh yeah you're missing suspense
68:38 you're missing this you're missing that
68:41 apparently not so perhaps as writers
68:47 we're getting too formulaic you know
68:52 there's a great book out there called
68:54 gödel Escher Bach and it brings together
68:57 mathematics poetry physics and it
69:02 teaches you how
69:04 true art is a bunch of different things
69:08 occurring at the exact same time like
69:11 it's one thing to listen to classical
69:12 music it's another thing to listen to
69:13 classical music in the form of an opera
69:16 extra dimensions you have some acting
69:19 going on you had some singing going on
69:21 you've got the music and all the
69:23 textures of the instruments how did
69:24 someone arrange the orchestra to do this
69:26 how did somebody all the costumes how
69:27 did someone pick the actors if you
69:29 actors really fit the roles it's all
69:31 this multi-dimensional stuff which is
69:32 what film does right I think James
69:35 Cameron gets it James Cameron creates
69:38 this amazing tone all the way through
69:40 his film he's bringing new special
69:42 effects he's bringing a new story he's
69:44 bringing you individual characters
69:48 Prince if you really want to learn a
69:51 great methodology of breaking formula
69:56 and succeeding Prince changed his sound
70:01 and his instruments every single album
70:05 and it was almost to the point where it
70:07 was annoying to have to throw away
70:10 everything you loved about the guy and
70:11 relearn this dude where he is today at
70:13 that particular time right when he did
70:16 for instance he did 1999 is his fourth
70:21 album and very polished very interesting
70:25 and they did he blew that way with a
70:28 proper ring and then he comes out with
70:30 one called around the world in a day and
70:32 also marago whoa what's that and then he
70:34 can't was sign at times completely
70:36 different lovesexy completely different
70:40 and we're having to relearn this dude
70:42 and then we realized Jesus this guy did
70:45 create fantastic music almost every
70:47 single time he touched any instrument I
70:49 don't like every single song you did in
70:51 the 90s but that's when they really
70:53 pulled the cuffs off and he was just
70:54 look I just want to make music if you
70:56 like it you like if you don't I'll make
70:57 more don't worry about it right and he
70:59 delivered he was really pretty hot about
71:01 the time he passed away but for me if
71:07 you want to be an artist you have to
71:09 understand your discipline to a level
71:11 that you can recreate magic every single
71:14 time it's not a one-hit wonder thing you
71:17 can create one great album after
71:18 another after another and you're not
71:19 doing it necessarily all in a vacuum
71:21 that's the other misconception you are
71:24 relying on mega talented people to help
71:27 you out but your job as the creator if
71:29 you get so lucky as to be like a
71:31 writer-director which happens every once
71:33 in a while then you have these
71:34 masterpieces that can come out because
71:36 you are controlling the tone of
71:37 everything
71:38 think about the John wick movies they
71:40 have a feel John wick has a spectrum of
71:43 things he will do and won't do and you
71:45 figured that out and you rely on Keanu
71:47 Reeves to hang onto that character he
71:49 shows up to work he practices all of his
71:51 martial arts and gun work on his private
71:55 time so when the movie comes around he
71:57 doesn't let anybody down if anything
72:00 lets you down and maybe just be because
72:02 you've seen the formula a little too
72:03 much but you know I think you go in
72:05 thinking that it's cast beautifully it's
72:08 shot beautifully and so those things
72:10 happen those really good ones what I'm
72:13 not seeing and maybe there's attempts to
72:15 do this what I'm not seeing is Studios
72:20 figuring out what they're doing right
72:22 and then stopping the press post
72:25 motoring that that film and then going
72:28 okay it's not that I want you to copy
72:31 this film but the very theory and theme
72:34 and discipline that made this film
72:36 amazing it needs to be the same exact
72:39 extent that you're doing with the budget
72:41 that you have you know what was it I
72:45 recently saw a special on Revenge of the
72:47 Nerds unbeknownst to most people Revenge
72:51 of the Nerds was actually supposed to
72:53 flop the I don't know I can't remember
72:56 what company actually made the film but
72:58 they were deliberately trying to create
73:01 a piece of crap so they would lose a
73:03 bunch of money and they could pull a
73:05 bunch of loss I put a bunch of loss on
73:07 their books it got to the point where
73:10 one of the producers who's now famous
73:13 for doing what he did he would show up
73:15 to these because they filmed it off
73:16 outside of a couple universities right
73:19 the guy would show up and you know get
73:21 lobster and and just blow all the money
73:24 on food and stuff not really leaving a
73:26 lot of money for the film production but
73:28 then everybody making the film was able
73:31 to partake
73:32 and then they were like no we want to
73:34 make even a better film now because
73:35 we're being taken care of so much but
73:37 this guy he's trying to throw money away
73:39 eventually obviously the film was for
73:43 those of you didn't live at the era it
73:44 was a blockbuster a total blockbuster
73:46 they did a sequel on it right and so I
73:50 don't know that that's being done it
73:55 would seem that you know quality over
74:00 quantity is always the successful
74:02 formula I think that it is a very
74:06 difficult industry because there are so
74:10 many stories being told per second today
74:12 that we are now at an epic level of
74:15 filmmaking
74:16 I don't know that America has ever been
74:17 at this level of unique filmmaking in
74:20 its history and we've had some pretty
74:22 hot eras where films are being cranked
74:24 out constantly then we have tons of
74:26 stinkers right tons of them more crappy
74:29 films and good films even before the
74:32 1985 okay but it does seem like we're in
74:36 really low single digit percentages of
74:39 any film that anyone wants to see at all
74:41 let alone twice but there are formulas
74:45 to make films so interesting you have to
74:48 see them twice when I saw momento it's
74:51 about the guy that has the the amnesia
74:54 he wakes up every day and forgets
74:55 everything happened the days before his
74:57 whole life before is a mystery she ends
74:59 up writing on his body things he needs
75:02 to remember that was so intriguing I
75:05 didn't really think the film was like
75:06 mind-blowing I thought it was really
75:08 good but I bought the collector's
75:10 edition a memento because I thought I
75:13 need to understand this film from just a
75:15 filmmaking standpoint and I don't think
75:18 I ever cracked it open and watched it
75:19 again but that's what it did it put more
75:22 money into the bank of the movie studios
75:25 because they created a little bit of
75:27 intrigue with me right so I'd be
75:30 interested in your take as to what one a
75:33 couple questions how many films do you
75:36 see nowadays that you actually go to the
75:38 theater sit down pay for the experience
75:40 go for it I will say that the one thing
75:43 I didn't mention at all was that the
75:45 movie theater
75:46 Cheng's let themselves it probably is a
75:50 matter of attrition for the lack of
75:52 ticket sales because movies weren't
75:55 being made fantastically but my last
75:58 probably half dozen experiences the
76:00 movie theater were horrible but had
76:02 nothing to do with the movie it had to
76:04 do with the stinky theater you know
76:07 people bring in their kids there and the
76:10 kids aren't gonna watch the film but
76:11 they're running around the theater
76:13 during the film had you know a whole
76:15 string of like really old people behind
76:17 me with their food and just making a ton
76:20 of noise the point I can't even hear the
76:21 film it's very distracting they wouldn't
76:23 wait to something loud happens they know
76:24 the old people they just they don't have
76:26 any empathy towards the world anymore
76:27 it's really funny but then the last
76:30 couple times I've gone these theatres
76:33 are now policing the audience heavily
76:37 they come in several times they look
76:40 around and make sure no one's talking
76:43 too much I just haven't had a problem
76:44 with the crowd in a really long time and
76:46 the theatres seem to be pretty clean the
76:48 now that I've seen my own technology
76:51 combinations using other companies to
76:54 make LED theaters believe me once they
76:57 can get led into the movie theaters
76:59 which is probably 10 years from now
77:01 you'll start going back to the movies
77:03 just to see it because it's phenomenal
77:05 and if we can get the 3d coding we
77:07 created in there which will be a
77:09 requirement to get it in there 3d will
77:11 we'll come back in a huge way in the
77:14 movie theater not so much in your in
77:16 your house but again they have to make
77:19 great films that are meant for 3d for
77:20 that to work that's something else
77:22 that's missing so you know let me know
77:28 you know your opinion of television
77:31 versus film just any reason why you
77:35 either think it's coming back or failing
77:37 why do you stay home I'm interested I'm
77:41 interested from a writing standpoint
77:43 what turns you on
77:44 what kind of films really become
77:46 heirlooms to your family like which ones
77:48 do you own at home that regardless of
77:50 download streaming or whatever you just
77:52 had to physically buy it because when
77:54 the powers when the Internet's out you
77:56 want to be able to throw this into a
77:57 blu-ray player and see
77:59 a VHS player the amount of people in
78:04 Hollywood I talked to you that are
78:05 actually in the industry who within 30
78:10 to 60 seconds of the subject of
78:12 Hollywood in the industry being brought
78:14 up in a conversation to work within even
78:17 though they get their paychecks from the
78:19 industry they're all telling me film is
78:23 dead I've heard this for 10 years
78:26 straight almost as an epidemic of
78:28 Tourette's out of their mouth so one of
78:31 the other problems might be that if you
78:33 hire a bunch of people that think it's
78:38 dead then how does anyone love the
78:41 industry enough to make it better I
78:44 think there could be some serious DNA
78:47 change and changes in the industry just
78:50 it's just a scramble it up at some point
78:52 the CEOs are going to go out of business
78:53 financially they're just simply gonna be
78:55 seized
78:56 they'll have movies in the pipeline
78:57 movies in the movie theaters it'll be
78:59 like an airline going out of business
79:00 where you just you're sitting in the
79:02 airport and your flights cancelled
79:05 there's no refund when that occurs I
79:07 hope that a renegade team of truly
79:12 enthusiastic filmmakers start to create
79:15 films with whatever money they can get
79:17 ahold of and create brand-new franchises
79:19 and have a couple big hits that let them
79:21 relaunch a smaller company browse and
79:24 just you know rent the soundstages rent
79:26 everything you possibly can until you
79:28 could buy your own place right that's
79:29 how it all started in the beginning they
79:32 built those big studios and those big
79:34 stages because it was cheaper when they
79:36 wanted to film New York City
79:38 I think Wonder Brothers and Paramount I
79:40 both have you know New York in in their
79:43 back lot you just walk around I've
79:45 walked around Paramount's I bought
79:47 myself one day it was so if I got lost
79:49 and I'm walking around and I'm dressed
79:51 just like your average studio dude
79:54 because I'm all casual and I got my pass
79:57 the stuff to be in there and I'm just
79:58 [ __ ] her and I was like I was
80:00 absolutely late for my meeting but I was
80:01 like you know eivol apologized for being
80:04 late to the meeting because I was an
80:06 ancillary member to the meeting at that
80:08 particular day and I just walked around
80:10 I was like man I wonder what was found
80:11 here
80:12 it's crazy it's nostalgic it's
80:15 interesting I would say if you're young
80:17 and you're seeing the end of this which
80:20 is probably very few of you
80:22 there's probably if you're interested in
80:24 in filmmaking one is cheaper than it's
80:27 ever been in the past I would say
80:29 definitely get into your older films and
80:31 understand them try not to listen to too
80:36 many naysayers with classic classic
80:38 films you know I was told a long time
80:40 ago and I took acting school or acting
80:42 classes they said don't ever make fun of
80:44 Shakespeare because it will remove all
80:47 doubt that you have no idea what you're
80:49 talking about and so there are certain
80:51 films out there that you don't like the
80:54 ones I've mentioned that I think are
80:55 heavily celebrated in world history you
80:59 just don't make fun of them if you don't
81:00 get it then you need to get it you have
81:02 to look at it from the perspective of
81:04 the culture that watched it when it was
81:05 famous you know Wizard of Oz 1939 first
81:09 color film with gone with the wind
81:10 coming up same same exact year color as
81:13 well gone with the wind is the number
81:15 one grossing film in the world in the
81:18 world per capita of the money not as
81:20 rereleased over 40 times that's how they
81:22 get that kind of cash but you know 1936
81:27 Snow White because we were in the
81:30 depression come out of Vietnam in 1974
81:34 and then you just got boom boom boom
81:36 boom boom all the way from 75 to 85
81:40 phenomenal years storytelling is I think
81:44 very important for Humanity as most
81:46 writing teachers will tell you which is
81:48 why I'm glad TVs doing great I really
81:52 don't have other than just normal cable
81:54 television which is awful and fake news
81:56 and the advertising which is just enough
81:59 to make you want to leave this dimension
82:02 of universe right
82:03 other than that crap that no one watches
82:06 anymore
82:07 good pay pay to play television is is
82:10 the best it's ever been it's anyway let
82:14 me know what you think in the comments
82:15 really interested in your feedback this
82:17 episode sort of for me too but if you
