00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:34 deep thoughts today we're gonna explore
00:39 this this mr. new mission to the moon
00:46 2024 apparently NASA's come out with
00:51 this new budget that in four years time
00:56 we're gonna put people on the moon we're
00:59 gonna put a check on the moon although
01:02 the fact that they feel like they have
01:03 to say the whole thing about the woman
01:05 factor you know well we're gonna put a
01:08 woman this time oh well then I guess
01:10 we'll support you because you know women
01:12 are really weak and they need a lot of
01:13 help yeah you know getting on Space
01:16 Station's oh wait no they're your main
01:18 characters on nearly every single
01:20 mission besides the goofball that plays
01:22 David Bowie so we're going back to the
01:25 moon according to NASA here okay so it's
01:32 always this rollercoaster we hear this
01:35 all the time again it was gonna be 2018
01:38 I think Elon Musk was gonna be on Mars
01:41 personally personally walking out of his
01:43 own spacecraft he says that kind of crap
01:45 and then it never goes anywhere and then
01:49 it's like everybody just forgets it but
01:51 that logical Arab we went on the moon in
01:53 1969 at most NASA's going back to
01:57 Terrigen that's what NASA is gonna do
02:00 just like all the movies out there
02:03 they're going back just 3d software so
02:07 what they're doing now isn't it
02:09 interesting I'm just gonna pull back a
02:12 little bit before we dive into the
02:14 lunacy of this 2024 mission because the
02:18 mission statement and the project is so
02:22 aggressive it is comical alright but now
02:28 what's going on in the world with space
02:32 programs sorry a little bit of Bed Head
02:33 here everybody's going to the moon with
02:38 probes
02:39 I mean China's
02:40 twice with these little Rovers China
02:43 just did a spacewalk the narration on
02:46 the spacewalk for China was was really
02:52 the funniest thing I've seen in a long
02:55 time
02:55 he's leaving at the seas waving at us
02:57 he's waving a well what do you think
02:59 he's waving at some alien driving by
03:01 it's really funny if you haven't seen it
03:04 it's it's it's measurably different than
03:07 the spacewalks that we have filmed
03:10 personally because we slow everything
03:13 down and this dude's out there just
03:15 going way up high and WHAM he's putting
03:17 his clip on he's jumping out sort of
03:19 what you'd expect it to look like to be
03:20 honest but China is the one with all the
03:23 air bubbles in most of their space
03:25 station incidents I mean they're the
03:29 ones with the literally a water bubble
03:31 that went up hit the shield hit that
03:34 started the glass plate of his helmet
03:36 and then it went right up the contour
03:37 and then it's also kind of wobbling this
03:40 thing which is air you know whatever so
03:45 China's been there supposedly to the
03:46 moon twice apparently it's made out of
03:48 brown dirt and all those little tiny
03:52 pock marks that NASA filmed in 69 to 72
03:55 I mean every place they ever landed none
03:58 of that exists as soon as China goes
03:59 there and then supposed that supposedly
04:03 they landed on the backside of the moon
04:04 which is the most cratered fricking
04:07 place in the entire moon and it's smooth
04:11 as glass just a couple a couple things
04:13 here and then of course China's Rovers
04:15 they just can't seem to last more than
04:16 about 48 hours who else went up there Oh
04:20 Israel Israel tried to go up there they
04:24 did a little bit of Photoshop work
04:26 because it didn't make it he crashed
04:29 actually I don't know why it would crash
04:31 I guess maybe they didn't want to quite
04:33 throw down on the fake photos of what
04:36 this place looks like and then I read an
04:39 article yesterday that India is gonna be
04:42 on the moon with a rover or with some
04:44 sort of probe very soon within the year
04:47 or something like that it's been like 20
04:49 20 or something like that
04:51 so I made an episode which I think is
04:53 extremely accurate more I see crap like
04:56 this the more accurate I think it is
04:57 which is to say NASA I said NASA for
05:01 sale I think there's more to it than
05:04 that I think what's going on is they're
05:08 buying everybody off for this 2024 crap
05:12 because the problem is is who would have
05:14 the technology to be able to prove
05:16 whether or not we went up SpaceX is
05:19 doing fake stuff constantly all right
05:21 all these boosters that land back down
05:23 on the ground no one's ever there to see
05:24 it happen but it does it you know this
05:27 fake booster that lands in the middle of
05:28 the Atlantic Ocean on a floating barge
05:31 really yeah because you know exactly how
05:34 aggressive the ocean is gonna be that
05:35 particular day and you're just
05:36 guaranteed to risk I don't know how much
05:39 that booster thing's worth eighty two
05:42 hundred million I don't know what that
05:43 thing costs but you're willing to risk
05:45 it no but if NASA was going to fake the
05:51 moon landing in 2024 which again hey
05:56 I followed the news I watched YouTube's
06:00 I look at liberal news I look at
06:02 conservative news how is it the NASA
06:06 greenlit and deployed a budget for the
06:10 2024 landing of the man on the moon
06:14 first female on the moon is about to
06:17 come here and it's not in any national
06:20 news I seem to remember when JFK
06:25 announced we were going to go to the
06:26 moon it was sort of a big deal people
06:29 got into it but if if there's any truth
06:34 to the things that I've told you guys is
06:36 that you know when you lie about having
06:41 accomplished something or even when you
06:43 do accomplish something the kids of the
06:45 world don't want to do it again which is
06:47 why the lie of that magnitude is so
06:49 destructive to our society
06:50 if you lied and said you had
06:52 supercomputer technology when you just
06:54 have a bunch of people behind a wall
06:56 pretending to be the computer you know
06:59 talking in perfect artificial
07:01 intelligence because it's real
07:02 intelligence on this side of all we keep
07:03 passing our turn
07:05 that no kid is ever gonna create the
07:07 real [ __ ] we're not gonna do it because
07:10 they think their parents have lied to
07:12 them that it's already happened the
07:15 other thing is is that the well we're
07:17 gonna get into this thing I guess we
07:18 might as well just dive into us I just
07:20 reviewed the mission statement of this
07:21 whole thing and all the different
07:23 requirements and what have you the whole
07:26 thing super duper coughs of somebody's
07:29 sitting in the Oval Office and saying
07:31 well [ __ ] it let's just fake it let's
07:33 just fake it come on let's just do it
07:35 I'll give you all the money you need how
07:37 much money you need to fake it that's
07:38 what it feels like to me because you
07:41 have the project to Ryan missions for
07:45 those of you don't know it was uh it's
07:48 actually greenlit still they actually
07:50 greenlit it flew it canceled it and then
07:53 secretly greenlit it again it was
07:54 strange but they said look we can't put
07:58 human flesh through the Van Allen belts
08:00 it will cook and kill all human life
08:03 with every craft that we have created up
08:05 to the Pointer project Orion getting
08:06 greenlit which was like 2015 2014-15
08:09 somewhere in there and so they said
08:11 they're gonna do a bunch of unmanned
08:12 missions but he bunch of sensors where
08:15 the humans would be and then they push
08:16 this thing through the Van Allen belts
08:17 comes back down and I mean they have to
08:19 stick that thing up there you know they
08:21 started a thousand miles okay so you're
08:24 gonna have to go at least in the heart
08:26 of this thing fifteen thousand miles up
08:29 and then bring it back down and then
08:31 take a look at the sensors so they fly
08:34 this one mission it's not publicized on
08:37 TV I mean I never saw it bart sibrel
08:40 called NASA right after they got done
08:42 and said may I have the data please that
08:44 you found because I want to know whether
08:46 or not the Van Allen belts are lethal
08:47 and they said no sir it's classified
08:51 it's a medal of matter of national
08:53 security
08:54 okay well then obviously the belts are
08:57 extremely lethal and they can't surmount
09:00 the problem you can't have the data
09:03 because in 2024 we're gonna lie about
09:05 being there being back to the moon and
09:08 this data is going to improve once again
09:10 that you can't go so we're going to keep
09:13 it a matter of national security now I
09:16 honestly expect them to release that
09:17 data
09:18 modified because no one can confirm it
09:21 except maybe Russia they've got the
09:25 boosters to pull this off I'm not
09:29 convinced China has a functional space
09:31 program I'm just not I hope they do but
09:34 I just don't think there's anything you
09:37 could put past them to create a sense of
09:39 communist pride in that country but I
09:44 read that you know the mission stuff
09:45 this morning and based off a post the
09:48 Tim made on a Facebook page and there
09:53 the whole platform is based off the
09:55 Orion capsule so the Ryan capsule is
09:59 gonna be put on the SLS
10:00 it's it's a Cadillac guys so funny we
10:04 want from the Saturn five to the SLS why
10:08 not call it something like I don't know
10:10 enigma or I don't know jeez some some
10:13 insight word there's like a lie so
10:17 they've got this sort of like you know
10:19 it looks like a falcon 9 type
10:22 configuration 2 boosters central central
10:25 tank looks like space shuttle technology
10:29 basically with the well the Orion thing
10:32 on the top and this thing is so
10:36 aggressive it's unbelievable we are
10:38 suddenly without ever being on the moon
10:40 and even if you believe that we were in
10:42 1972 okay so we haven't been there in 47
10:45 years and they're going to they said
10:47 they're going to the moon to stay this
10:49 time
10:51 okay really
10:54 you know all about how to be in whatever
10:58 one-sixth gravity you know how to
11:00 sustain yourself I mean we have done a
11:02 tremendous amount of research since I
11:05 was a kid I mean again Omni magazine of
11:08 any if anything excuse me made it a
11:12 ritual a little great magazine how the
11:15 hell'd that magazine cease to exist I
11:17 mean seriously I think that magazine
11:18 would do so well today but anyway it was
11:21 like a was like a fun little science
11:24 magazine with these different articles
11:25 but they always put anybody who was
11:27 designing the Japanese had designed a
11:30 cool way that based on what they were
11:31 told by
11:32 so what the that the soil was made out
11:34 of they were going to heat it up and
11:37 create these you know walls it's almost
11:40 like mud hut walls but using moon dust
11:44 but it's all hexagonal and module so you
11:47 just make one shape and then you can put
11:50 these things together and create a whole
11:53 city up there I thought that was pretty
11:55 cool
11:56 you'd be pretty caveman II up there but
11:58 you know again but that we think the
12:00 data from NASA is complete [ __ ] so
12:03 what can you do I mean imagine the damn
12:06 thing is like some soupy dust and you
12:10 try to land and you simply just sink
12:12 into the ground it's like quicksand I
12:14 don't think that's the case but I mean
12:16 imagine that was the case or imagine
12:18 there's pockets all over the surface of
12:19 the Moon they're like quicksand and
12:20 these dudes are like doop doop you know
12:23 and it's like a scene right out of
12:25 Blazing Saddles
12:26 but the budgets coming in I guess for
12:29 2020 it's one point six billion to get
12:32 this thing rolling seems like it's not
12:36 even remotely enough to pull this thing
12:38 off and again what's really really funny
12:42 about this idea of being there in 2024
12:46 and we're gonna go down the idea that
12:48 someone may have released a ton of
12:49 covert technology that'd be the only way
12:52 that this could really occur but they
12:55 wouldn't be using a fuel rocket most
12:57 likely they would go back to von Braun's
13:00 original plan which is to ferry fuel to
13:03 a space station and take off from the
13:05 space station to the moon come back to
13:07 the space station and drop back down to
13:08 earth
13:09 it's a beautiful plan it'll most likely
13:11 be the way it's done back in the day or
13:14 sorry from back in the day but we have
13:18 the battery problem that is a gigantic
13:22 problem for the whole mission to this
13:25 day for 2019 you're not going to be
13:29 taking up you know a half a ton of
13:32 lithium batteries that are situated
13:35 inside of like a Tesla cart you know
13:37 under the frame of the car you're not
13:41 gonna have that capability so how are
13:44 you going to again I mean
13:46 I think it would be amazing to challenge
13:48 all the colleges of the world to create
13:50 a spacesuit that can handle the
13:52 conditions that nASA says are up there I
13:53 mean I know I'm beating it to death but
13:55 the idea is part of your suits to a tee
13:59 the backside of your suit is negative to
14:01 a tee how do you keep an astronaut up
14:04 there for days without cooking or
14:07 freezing to death how do you balance the
14:09 whole thing out how do you pressurize it
14:11 after pressurization how do you make
14:13 sure all the joints can move perfectly
14:16 remember what the deep-sea diving suits
14:19 look like right it's like a Robbie the
14:21 robot arm joint it's a circular seal
14:26 there's a valve sealed circular joint
14:29 that allows them to turn their arms and
14:31 stuff that's been around for 35 years
14:34 but seals don't work in the vacuum of
14:36 space they don't so you got a huge
14:41 problem on your hands cloth and rubber
14:42 and I don't know some sort of synthetic
14:46 polymer is probably the only way you're
14:48 gonna be able to create a fabric that
14:50 can handle those conditions I mean I
14:52 want to see it I want to see a room
14:56 that's heated up to 280 with some
14:59 technique of freezing the backside of
15:00 the suit I just imagine if you turned
15:04 your shoulder to the Sun then almost 80%
15:08 of your body's now freezing to death I
15:10 mean something that would freeze you in
15:12 seconds 280 below oh my god our guys in
15:16 the Antarctica are 60 below and they got
15:19 to be SuperDuper careful about how they
15:21 walk outside at 220 degrees further ask
15:28 a pilot how fast you would freeze that
15:30 the doors came off at 30,000 feet if you
15:33 didn't fly out of the freaking plane
15:36 everyone freezes instantaneously so
15:39 how's this gonna work when you run the
15:41 place off of you're gonna have to have a
15:44 limb again another lamb out there
15:46 they're talking about a vehicle that's
15:48 going to be able to house four people
15:50 that's what the Orion capsule is
15:52 supposed to be able to to hold how many
15:54 people are going down how many people
15:56 are staying in space is is still a
15:57 two-man team down two-man team
15:59 circling the moon adding an extra person
16:01 for the moon orbit and the entire
16:05 mission breakdown reads exactly like the
16:08 Apollo mission ever-increasing orbits
16:11 getting closer and closer to the moon
16:13 doing some moon orbiting stuff first you
16:17 know sending people out there and then
16:19 back there talking already about the
16:22 Apollo 13 sort of scenario this Ryan
16:25 capsule has to keep everybody safe even
16:28 in the face of emergencies well yeah it
16:32 does it does but now what if this is our
16:39 president with space force and he's done
16:41 some questions and again that the gloves
16:43 are off the black hats who've been
16:49 running things and Cove you know keeping
16:50 things very covert they're no longer in
16:54 power like they used to be the generals
16:56 are able to move around inside the
16:57 technical envelopes that we have created
17:00 perhaps perhaps a bunch of it's not
17:02 secret to generals who knows I don't
17:04 know but they have a new they have a
17:07 bunch of new technology it's actually
17:09 never been used and so they are now
17:12 looking at a bunch of different platform
17:14 technologies that can help us up there
17:17 now honestly speaking like I said in one
17:21 of the previous episodes they don't need
17:22 any new technology they just need to
17:24 rebirth the saturn v it did the job
17:27 completely all right just do that build
17:32 the f1 boosters use rote memory in your
17:34 computers I mean that stuff works so
17:36 good didn't it whatever the hell you did
17:38 inside of a hundred pound backpack to
17:40 provide infinite oxygen for these guys
17:42 and keep them from boiling or freezing
17:45 to death just do that you don't need
17:47 anything else you don't need any new
17:48 technology what's taking so long
17:50 why did you need Project Orion in the
17:52 first place we didn't need it before why
17:55 do you need it now
17:56 hmm and they made this distinction in
17:59 the in the copy on the website which was
18:01 really funny it said this system has to
18:05 take care of astronauts because it's
18:09 gonna take days to get back not hours
18:13 No yeah 250,000 miles away yeah we kind
18:17 of assumed it's gonna take a little
18:18 while to give home and get there and all
18:20 that stuff I mean wow that's like that
18:26 paragraph was written for someone in the
18:28 what the 30s the 1930s right because
18:31 Timmy from 1955 who watched all the
18:35 television shows sci-fi movies and
18:37 listen to radio he would know that she
18:40 would know that Sally who would know
18:41 that it's like Martin Short that weird
18:45 character used to do of course I know
18:48 that well why wouldn't I know that so
18:50 let's say there's a treasure chest
18:51 somewhere in the military and they are
18:53 uncovering all this wild stuff at Los
18:56 Alamos labs wright-patterson Air Force
18:58 Base area 51 maybe as for and they're
19:03 going to get there through some
19:04 techniques that are new well if you
19:09 build a big replica of the Falcon 9 then
19:14 you're using old technology fuel
19:16 propellant methodologies of getting
19:18 there okay
19:20 well there are some major problems with
19:23 leaving Earth's gravitational force
19:24 there's some major problems with the
19:26 slingshot theory again the slingshot
19:29 theory requires a couple things to be
19:31 true but the number one thing it that
19:33 has to be true is that the engine that
19:35 is pushing the object in this ever
19:38 falling orbit around the Earth right
19:42 that's what orbit is you're falling down
19:44 what you're falling around the earth
19:46 because it's you're you've been pushed
19:48 so quickly that you're being held by the
19:50 ether I'll push which is gravity now
19:53 you're gonna have to somehow hit the
19:55 boosters on this thing and you're gonna
19:58 need an amazing amount of thrust to
20:00 create a boomerang effect you're gonna
20:03 need to Alip make the orbit elliptical
20:06 such that you get this acute slingshot
20:08 thing just in theory I think it's a
20:10 bunch of crap but just in theory you're
20:12 gonna have to have that well what's left
20:15 after these things launch the center you
20:18 know rocket goes the two boosters go the
20:21 boosters come off pretty quick the
20:22 center Rockets gonna go it's super heavy
20:24 it has to get rid of its
20:27 relative mass as quickly as possible and
20:30 now you get this little thing this
20:32 Apollo or sorry Orion capsule now which
20:36 looks just like the Apollo capsule and
20:39 it's gonna have to SuperDuper slingshot
20:42 itself push itself I don't think the
20:45 design even remotely insinuates that
20:48 that's going to happen or that it's
20:50 possible to happen but that's what
20:52 they're saying it's gonna take place all
20:53 right
20:55 thing is is once you start doing the
20:57 slingshot maneuver
20:59 NASA's always lied to you about how this
21:01 works
21:02 they've always shown you a perfectly
21:04 circular orbit and somehow there's a
21:06 sling shot that goes on but when they
21:08 showed you the the orbital probe on
21:12 Jupiter not on Jupiter but around
21:15 Jupiter they're showing you a full
21:17 elliptical orbit that keeps descending
21:19 down to more of a round one and then it
21:21 plunges into the surface of Jupiter but
21:24 the chronology is backwards in that
21:26 model it's going so fast right this this
21:30 probe to Jupiter's going faster than the
21:33 orbit of Jupiter I love these ideas
21:34 right this relative super weak force
21:37 gravity is gonna supposedly completely
21:39 negate all the momentum and trajectory
21:42 and vectors of this thing prior to
21:44 getting to Jupiter I mean this shit's
21:45 never been explained but anyway so it
21:48 starts off with a gigantic elliptical
21:50 thing because it was going so fast it
21:53 was gonna go by and then it gets grabbed
21:56 and then it descends that at least has a
21:58 little bit of sense to it for me but to
22:01 start off a little puny speck in space
22:06 and I mean if you think about how tiny
22:08 the Orion capsule is let's just say the
22:11 Ryan capsule was twice the size of your
22:13 house and you got a normal 1200 square
22:17 foot house so it's 2,400 square foot
22:19 house and this thing it's already in
22:22 some normal orbit around Earth and
22:25 somehow this little tiny speck ok the
22:28 Earth's like 8,000 miles in diameter
22:30 roughly 70 100 miles 24,000 miles around
22:33 okay which is the the journey this
22:36 thing's gonna have to make and it's
22:37 going to go burst and it's going to
22:39 supposedly start creating
22:40 this thing and then it's going to escape
22:42 somehow like it the last second is gonna
22:44 go forget that gravity over there we're
22:46 going straight this time which needs
22:49 more propellant I mean the amount of the
22:51 amount of fuel you need to pull all this
22:53 off is non-existent one little spout out
22:57 the back you know those close-up shots
22:59 you always see from SpaceX so much crap
23:02 but Lee SpaceX is you know primarily
23:04 saying they're just resupplying the
23:06 space station that makes sense to me
23:08 you got just about enough to hit about
23:10 250 miles up there you go here's your
23:12 lunch see you later because the space
23:14 station will be going at relative
23:16 velocities based on boosters to put it
23:19 in space in the first place we could
23:21 always catch up with it because it's
23:22 within the envelope of what man has put
23:24 in space that there you make sense to me
23:26 well don't we've done oh no no no I
23:28 don't know but if they open the treasure
23:31 chest of special technology I think it's
23:33 probably safe to say they wouldn't be
23:37 using a booster fuel like liquid fuel
23:42 propellant technology they wouldn't they
23:46 would probably be using some sort of
23:47 antigravity technology using
23:50 electromagnetic waves to start creating
23:55 these you know vacuums in space these
23:59 ether ol vacuums at least more of a
24:02 vacuum than you know absolute ether
24:06 where it would normally exist in the
24:07 ship would just lift into the pocket and
24:09 there you go
24:10 it's you know it's really funny as I saw
24:12 the was watching a special on f1 racing
24:15 and they were talking to one of the best
24:19 aerodynamic guys and he was taking a
24:22 piece of paper and he was simulating the
24:25 old wing technology which is you blow
24:27 over the top of a piece of paper and
24:29 it's normally hanging straight down in
24:31 front of your face it starts to lift up
24:33 because that's the way a wing works and
24:36 the idea is you're pushing the ether
24:40 with your breath
24:41 thus the air and you're creating a
24:45 negative pocket of pressure which is
24:47 causing the paper to go up it's the same
24:50 principle of all the gravity and ether
24:52 in the universe
24:54 there's one book of physics folks
24:56 there's not 22 books of physics and when
24:58 Hawking does gravity it's made out of
25:00 apples and when Newton does that it's
25:02 made of oranges it doesn't work like
25:04 that it's one set of rules that's the
25:07 way it works so I think that we would go
25:12 there with completely different
25:14 technology because I hardly think that
25:17 NASA 1995 was that they went and raided
25:20 that siberian warehouse to buy all those
25:23 boosters that the soviets had packed on
25:25 ice in 1973 not really on ice but you
25:30 know I'm saying they they put him away
25:32 they had two and a half times the
25:34 booster power of the top boosters that
25:36 NASA had in 1995 but the Russians said
25:41 look even with a bigger rocket than your
25:43 Saturn 5 and our boosters they provided
25:47 two and a half times more power per
25:49 booster we did the math and we cannot
25:52 get to the moon more importantly I
25:55 believe how they they frame the the
25:57 statement was we can't escape Earth's
25:59 gravity which again is what von Braun
26:02 costly said you know man you guys if you
26:04 want to get out of gravitational pull
26:07 you're gonna have to push SuperDuper
26:10 hard SuperDuper hard and we simply don't
26:14 have that right now now what would be
26:16 SuperDuper exciting we're gonna get into
26:19 Terrigen before we get over here well be
26:22 super duper exciting is if NASA
26:24 obviously came clean didn't give a year
26:28 they didn't say 2024 I mean you know a
26:31 dream what is it a goal without
26:33 deadlines a dream I understand that
26:35 we're talking about keeping people safe
26:37 we're talking about a true long-term
26:39 project living there building Space
26:41 Station's what are you gonna build it
26:42 out of how do you gonna get materials up
26:44 there if you're gonna transform this the
26:47 soil of the moon and you don't know what
26:50 it's made out of then what do you bring
26:54 to mess with it do you have some generic
26:56 thing maybe they do some generic fusion
26:58 engine they can make it anything that
27:01 you want it to be maybe now if they
27:05 truly did that copper
27:07 and again this is like I mentioned this
27:09 all the time and I mentioned to people I
27:12 guess I have mentioned it to people that
27:14 are really into this kind of stuff but I
27:16 can't remember if it was Scientific
27:18 American I think it probably was that
27:21 covered the 500-pound slab of copper
27:25 that was slammed into the South Pole ish
27:28 part of the Moon to kick up a bunch of
27:30 dust that we could then look at through
27:32 a spectrogram look at how it bends light
27:35 and figure out what these elements are
27:36 that are on the surface of the Moon why
27:39 they use copper because copper was easy
27:41 to subtract out of the spectrum and you
27:45 don't have to worry about it being a
27:47 compound that's going to be interfering
27:50 with what's there well if they did that
27:53 then maybe they do have some parallel
27:55 data about exactly what the surface is
27:57 made out of now the weird thing was that
28:01 the way that they covered for having
28:04 supposedly been there six times and put
28:07 the foot on the ground and picked up
28:09 plenty of rocks and plenty of samples
28:11 and supposedly brought the back ha ha ha
28:14 ha ha they said it was to see if the
28:18 South Pole had something unique like
28:20 perhaps carbon dioxide frozen or oxygen
28:23 frozen or something like that as if the
28:26 composition at the bottom looks anything
28:28 different than the center when we just
28:29 look at it with the naked eye you know
28:31 when we before we started doing Terrigen
28:35 versions of Mars you look at Mars
28:40 through a telescope way back in the day
28:42 and it looked like it had a you know a
28:44 white pull at the bottom and a white
28:46 pull at the top so that makes sense that
28:50 you'd want to know what's up there but
28:52 the moon is it's you know have you ever
28:55 seen it full because you can see the
28:56 whole thing you can see the top and the
28:58 bottom in the middle and the sides so
29:00 there you go and the one thing that you
29:04 know this is kind of off topic but it's
29:05 sort of on topic I don't talk enough
29:09 about how SpaceX does their launches
29:13 because the Hollywood millennial you
29:18 know almost like a fake Hillary Clinton
29:21 you know where she gets up there's like
29:23 20 people there she's in front of a
29:25 green screen at least four or five times
29:27 she's coughing her guts out you got
29:30 people holding cell phones filming a
29:31 podium and they're in the foreground but
29:33 if you look on the cell phone there's no
29:35 one at the podium because she's not
29:37 there cuz it's it's composited together
29:39 I mean how pathetic is that right so
29:42 SpaceX has always got a bunch of
29:44 Millennials around watching TV and again
29:47 it's that whole thing well I know we
29:48 went to the moon cuz I saw it on TV well
29:51 that's what they're doing again so his
29:53 money olds feel amazing and it just
29:55 they're you could just see the applause
29:57 signs going on in your head every time
29:59 it's like now we scream guys yeah you
30:02 know and then your narrators your
30:04 narrators slash hosts of the launch it's
30:09 just like watching an eSports you know
30:11 Blizzcon event nothing scientific about
30:15 it nothing organic about it and the kids
30:18 aren't sitting out there by the landing
30:20 pads when these Rockets come down
30:22 backwards I want you know I want a
30:26 thousand kids with a thousand cell
30:29 phones a bunch of them conspiracy guys
30:33 and gals like us out there holding these
30:36 phones I don't care for with the other
30:37 raw a bunch but I want to be able to
30:39 livestream these things coming back down
30:42 to earth and some some real rugged dude
30:46 some triathlon conspiracy guys out there
30:49 on the Pacific era Atlantic Ocean
30:52 watching the one land out there and he's
30:53 filming that - of course I probably
30:56 miraculously jump off a bridge in
30:58 Arizona right after he gets done with
30:59 the footage but we need more evidence of
31:03 this stuff being actually true
31:06 now these Rockets lunch okay I do think
31:09 I do think that that much occurs it's
31:11 just this this budgetary thing that
31:14 these boosters come back down to the
31:16 ground and then what's strange is like
31:18 they don't get as much money because
31:19 they're supposedly reusing these
31:20 boosters but you know who knows the
31:22 [ __ ] that's going on to put all this
31:24 together there's no excuse why the
31:27 public isn't there in droves watching
31:30 these things land we should have a
31:31 hundred shots of these things landing
31:34 the second there's any SpaceX launch
31:36 there's none we set at my smoke lounge
31:39 and we have probably watched at least
31:41 four SpaceX launches you know
31:44 quote-unquote live through YouTube feeds
31:49 last time they shut the feed off before
31:52 the booster supposedly successfully
31:54 landed in the Atlantic oceans like we
31:56 weren't able to see that at these
31:57 literally cut the feed and went right
31:58 back to the beginning and so we're like
32:01 oh I guess we're watching this again
32:03 mm-hmm but now what if NASA's for sale
32:07 they're selling this for national pride
32:09 to all the countries of the world that
32:11 can pay a price we're offering it as a
32:14 discount to third world countries but
32:16 anyone that could sit there and confirm
32:19 that we're not going to the moon they
32:20 have the telescopes they've got the
32:22 radars and so they're like okay here's
32:24 the thing
32:26 how'd you like to make your people think
32:29 that you're a hell of a lot smarter than
32:31 you are okay well we've got this turnkey
32:36 special effects team at JPL NASA and you
32:40 just kind of come up with the logo or
32:41 something you brand it you localize the
32:45 whole thing you know what are you gonna
32:46 call your capsule go get some mythology
32:48 out of your past or whatever the god of
32:52 destruction Shira is actually taken by
32:54 the here certain Hadron Collider so
32:56 don't use that one but we'll get you up
32:58 there and and your people will be
33:00 absolutely drunk on how amazing the
33:02 leadership of your country is because
33:04 look what you did you got them to the
33:05 moon and a probe they're not gonna
33:09 physically get on the moon for another
33:11 10 20 years but as soon as that becomes
33:13 a turnkey we're gonna sell you that as a
33:15 disc at a discount to just don't say we
33:18 didn't go don't even try to to watch our
33:22 Rockets go up there or if you do we're
33:24 gonna provide you the equipment and it's
33:26 gonna go ping right at the right time
33:28 and you're gonna feel like we went up
33:30 there that way we have full full-blown
33:33 collaboration with all of our allies to
33:35 say we went up there okay it'll be
33:39 interesting because Russia hasn't put
33:42 anything on the moon that I know of in a
33:45 really long time even a probe a fact I
33:47 don't even know if the
33:48 ever done a probe up there but you can
33:49 expect Russia to do it as well but the
33:53 theory is is one of a diminishing return
33:55 in my opinion because again if we lie
33:57 one more time and say we've been up
33:59 there when we're not going up there then
34:01 we just pulled back another generation
34:03 two kids that will never go into
34:05 aerospace they'll never go into you know
34:08 the sciences that would actually get us
34:10 there and they're gonna falsely believe
34:12 that we've got technology to pull this
34:14 off
34:16 and again you know I say this with sort
34:20 of a theoretical mind of course but
34:22 imagine we did have an earth killer
34:26 asteroid coming in for whatever reason
34:30 everybody picked it up it's so damn huge
34:32 and it's coming right at us this is not
34:34 gonna be a close flyby it's gonna kneel
34:36 us maybe doesn't completely rip the
34:38 earth to pieces but it's gonna be I mean
34:40 the three that hit was a Jupiter 20
34:43 years ago one of them was bigger than
34:45 the earth so if that's true because
34:48 Jupiter has these little marks in it now
34:50 if that's true then there are superduper
34:53 earth killers out there that would just
34:54 wipe us out of the universe but now we
34:58 need to get off this rock and everyone's
35:01 gonna Co how the hell did we do this we
35:03 you know we gone to the moon several
35:05 times so now we just need to split and
35:07 go to go to Mars we're gonna pull out
35:09 like secret UFO technology and then
35:13 rescue all the you know the Monarchs and
35:15 the bankers of the world the true B Ark
35:19 but you know like I said was it three
35:22 months ago four months ago President
35:24 Trump was talking to the folks at the
35:26 space station he's got two astronauts up
35:29 there and he's asking this female before
35:32 they went on air you know what's it
35:36 gonna take to get to Mars and she said
35:39 Oh sir you know it's gonna take at least
35:40 till 2030 to get there and he goes well
35:43 what if I gave you it goes well why is
35:44 it gonna take so long she goes well we
35:45 don't have the money and uh and she get
35:48 he goes well hey what if I just gave you
35:50 all the money that you needed uh of
35:54 course she hasn't you know she's not
35:55 briefed to talk about those kind of
35:56 things
35:58 she's so sure that it's gonna be twenty
36:01 thirty but she hasn't
36:01 like that's what I've been told and uh
36:03 now all the sudden were sixteen years
36:05 ahead of schedule sorry six years ahead
36:09 of schedule four years is not enough
36:14 years for NASA to surmount all of the
36:18 technical difficulties and potential
36:20 dangers to get us from here to the moon
36:23 and to go along with their mission which
36:25 is never to leave that's sort of what
36:27 the mission says I love the mission I
36:28 think it's great I hope it can be done
36:32 one day and we move as quickly as
36:34 possible but this idea that you know for
36:37 years you're going from zero to hero in
36:39 four years oh well if we were only four
36:42 years away from going to the moon then
36:44 what took us so long to go back
36:47 especially when all of the Orion project
36:49 stuff is still covert okay so I was at
36:58 my lounge last night and we're bored to
37:01 death we've already seen everything keys
37:03 not dropping much and so we decided okay
37:08 let's search on the latest and greatest
37:14 sorry my Birds are distracting me here
37:17 so I decided to search on the latest and
37:19 greatest photo real video game engine
37:22 demos because III is coming up here in
37:24 Los Angeles it's the big giant expose of
37:28 video games and Unreal 4 has been out
37:31 for about a year now it's not quite
37:34 released yet well actually it is
37:36 released excuse me but the the the real
37:39 big photo real shits just starting to
37:40 happen here and there's this company
37:43 called quick cyl or qixels or something
37:45 like that I think they're out of
37:46 Australia I think but they are now
37:49 scanning environments like they can I'm
37:53 not sure how they do it if they drone it
37:55 or the 3d camera the thing or you know
37:57 whatever but they've got this technology
38:01 now that can pretty much render real
38:04 time 90 frames a second photo real
38:08 environments and I mean you just look it
38:12 up look up Unreal 4 and I think it's
38:15 quick soul I think it's qu IX al I think
38:18 that's the name of the company they came
38:20 out ten years ago and showed their
38:22 engine off and people thought they were
38:25 lying then they just were quiet five
38:28 years later they came out with another
38:29 demo and now they've got this
38:30 integration with Unreal 4 and it's
38:33 unbelievable what's going on inside of a
38:36 computer
38:37 a consumer computer as I understand it
38:41 they're not using workstation cards
38:43 video cards and for those of you don't
38:45 know the video cards you typically buy
38:47 on your computer are consumer video
38:49 cards even if they're amazing they're
38:50 considered consumer cards you go up to
38:53 your workstation cards and this is what
38:55 a 3d animator would use at a 3d house
38:58 right they start about 800 bucks
39:00 your your P 4,000 Nvidia card and up to
39:06 like the p6 thousands and even further
39:08 but some of these cards are like six
39:11 thousand dollars there are fifty nine
39:12 hundred bucks so we have the ps4 now is
39:18 damn near photo-real and humans are
39:22 still a little wonky but you know
39:23 there's there's a lot of they could get
39:25 photo-real inside of a computer easily
39:27 okay and this is real time why am I
39:30 saying real time a lot because when you
39:32 need when you can actually do it in a
39:34 computer and you don't have a time limit
39:36 and you're rendering it this is where
39:38 you get those Mars movies there is not a
39:45 problem
39:45 rendering anything that they want to
39:50 render and what's interesting about the
39:52 moon now is that technically speaking
39:55 we've got the satellite technology to
39:58 look at the moon we have telescopes here
40:01 on earth including the array telescopes
40:04 which taken a bunch of light data and
40:07 mulch it together digitally until it
40:08 creates this beautiful perfect image but
40:11 think about it we can look at the moon
40:13 now at a level that's pixel perfect I
40:18 mean you ever wonder why they can or how
40:22 they can read your license plate here on
40:24 earth starting in about 1982
40:28 and I had a relative my uncle was
40:29 involved in some stuff where he saw that
40:32 take place he came home he's like oh my
40:34 god this is amazing what we're able to
40:36 do and of course the Google Maps is
40:39 heavily limited in terms of the zoom
40:42 that we get down on the ground but they
40:44 go all the way down man I mean they
40:46 could figure out what you're reading on
40:48 a newspaper you know when I say that
40:51 it's obviously weather permitting and
40:52 all the all the factors have to be
40:55 together but if they want it they'll get
40:56 it they'll just keep flying over you
40:57 until it's all perfect and so if you
41:01 needed to create a vr of the surface of
41:05 the Moon and they know exactly every
41:07 time it's full they build these
41:10 observatories way way up on mountains
41:13 above the clouds and so the amount of
41:15 like local distortions minimal they have
41:18 had for 25-30 years now
41:21 these array telescopes that can they
41:24 literally Bend the mirror that's that's
41:27 listening to the slight if I may mix
41:30 metaphors such that if they think it's
41:33 disordered up there they bend it down
41:35 here and they correct for it I was
41:40 involved with some pretty hefty VR
41:44 camera technology as a consumer of that
41:47 technology but I went and visited this
41:49 company that makes the jaunt camera just
41:55 look up the way it sounds John in fact
41:57 what's strange is they pulled all the
41:58 webpages off their websites but you can
42:01 still rent it it looks like a pumpkin
42:03 but it's an 8k 360 camera and I sat down
42:08 there and talked to one of the lead
42:09 engineers of this thing and he explained
42:11 to me how even inside this pumpkin
42:13 camera they're distorting the lenses
42:16 based on the heat inside the inside the
42:20 pumpkin because when it's really bright
42:22 on one side of your camera and dark on
42:24 the other side of the camera this side
42:25 of the camera distorts all the lenses
42:27 and as all the CCDs are taken in the
42:30 analog data and converting it to digital
42:32 it gets so hot that it starts melting
42:34 the camera inside if they don't put
42:37 cooling in there it's probably one of
42:40 the most ingenious
42:42 consumer technology pieces in the world
42:44 I guess it's 150 grand the first ones
42:48 were estimated to be about 250 grand
42:51 it's amazing it has a bunch of flaws in
42:54 it still but it is still the best 360
42:56 camera in the world and they are
42:57 supposedly designing a 16 K version of
42:59 it so we'll see but we'll see how that
43:03 company fares over time because they're
43:05 so ahead of the curve there's no place
43:08 to show one of their videos in the world
43:10 and its totality you can look at it in
43:14 VR goggles but you're not seeing the
43:15 whole thing around you like you would
43:17 normally see it and that's the theater I
43:18 was trying to create so what is the
43:21 traditional game that they play with
43:24 Mars well you use this technology use
43:29 all of your optics that you possibly can
43:31 on earth to get the best picture of Mars
43:33 you possibly can and then you try to
43:34 estimate what the surface might look
43:37 like based on all the data you're
43:38 getting now if if there is a method of
43:45 getting a satellite to Mars to at least
43:47 do a reconnaissance orbit around it
43:49 which I'm not convinced that that's
43:51 possible I want that to be possible but
43:53 again the slingshot theory is still
43:55 largely a big cartoon that was drawn by
43:58 you know the Disney team back in the
44:00 mid-50s they could really render the
44:05 surface to look fairly close to what it
44:07 really is if they could get out there
44:10 but what is what are the Mars rovers
44:12 require in terms of the hoax being
44:15 portrayed to the world
44:18 well it takes far-ranging Vista pictures
44:22 which always have a lot of anomalies in
44:25 them especially the scene between the
44:26 sky and the ground and the first 10
44:29 years from about 2001 up it had a weird
44:34 digital seem in it as if they were
44:36 somehow doing some real lazy compositing
44:39 of the two you know the sky and the
44:41 ground which doesn't make any sense to
44:43 me because we've been able to simulate
44:44 that for years and then the next thing
44:48 we see are really close proximity shots
44:50 of the ground so the things like looking
44:52 down at the ground and there's a bunch
44:54 of like little
44:55 spheroid rocks which we found all over
44:58 earth now it's you know it took us took
45:00 us like 15-20 years to start reporting
45:02 oh yeah these things are fighting on
45:03 Mars that we told you only exist on Mars
45:05 yeah there's a bunch of them on earth
45:07 too okay
45:09 it just gets better and better right so
45:12 they take these little arms that arms
45:14 pull on these little rocks in and then
45:16 it shaves it with a little you know
45:19 razor blade spinning saw they look at
45:23 the cross-sections or supposedly trying
45:25 to find out everything about this place
45:27 but now what I think the public does
45:31 that gives them an advantage is that
45:34 because the public looks at a picture of
45:36 Mars and in some cases it looks like
45:39 Iceland some places looks like Greenland
45:41 and and other locations that people have
45:45 mentioned but some of it looks out of
45:48 this world
45:48 it's like those rock formations don't
45:51 exist on earth at least the average
45:54 human being hasn't seen those kind of
45:55 formations on earth so that must be real
45:57 because it's different than Earth and if
46:02 someone were to believe okay all these
46:03 shots are taken off of landscapes on
46:06 earth but then you're gonna fail that
46:07 test because there are definitely
46:09 synthetic shots as well but there's a
46:12 project product
46:13 excuse me out there it's been out since
46:14 the 90s about 96 I think is the very
46:17 first version that ever had but it's
46:19 called Terrigen it is the product that
46:21 Hollywood uses to create 3d terrains
46:24 that are absolutely positively photo
46:27 real and you've seen them in all the
46:29 movies that you've ever watched where
46:31 they have wild terrains now what's
46:34 interesting is as most movies are fairly
46:36 sci-fi science fiction and so if you
46:39 watched guardians of the galaxy or
46:45 valerian or something like that you're
46:48 gonna see terrains that are stylized to
46:50 be very specifically fake you know it's
46:53 got a comic book feel to it and so when
46:56 it transitions over to like the Martian
46:58 movie then you have very literal
47:02 translations of what we believe is up
47:04 there and of course the colour registry
47:07 is way different because there are
47:08 we physically on mars and these these
47:11 astronauts are up there walking around
47:12 sort of like Total Recall when back in
47:15 1988 when you know our sports [ __ ]
47:19 there that I think was those shots were
47:24 all done with physical models because
47:25 Terrigen didn't exist and I'll just
47:29 remind you very very quickly I met two
47:32 guys actually three guys but I had a
47:35 conversation with two of them that said
47:38 when they got done making Tron in 1982 I
47:44 said well where did you guys go after
47:46 that did you work on last starfighter
47:47 did you work on did you go to ILM like
47:50 where'd you go what we went to JPL oh oh
47:55 really
47:56 what'd you do at JPL we created 3d
47:58 terrain software oh well how long did
48:03 you work there 13 years so 1982 13 years
48:08 up but she was 1995 well we put a rover
48:13 on on the Mars in 1993 right the little
48:17 guy if I got that right
48:19 but they pointed this other dude and
48:21 said he still works there and this guy
48:23 was like eavesdropping on our
48:25 conversation like crazy would not come
48:27 out to join the conversation I mean why
48:28 the hell wouldn't you join a
48:29 conversation if someone goes and he
48:31 works there right now why wouldn't you
48:33 come out the guy was completely by
48:34 himself I mean we had a party of people
48:36 in this palacios two-story suite in San
48:40 Diego the whole top of the building man
48:42 and I felt like it was we had two
48:46 stories on this thing but anyway this
48:48 guy's walking he doesn't walk out to say
48:49 hello what are you guys talking about
48:53 hmm so terror gene comes out three years
48:58 later as a commercial product okay
49:03 you know I was brought into a company in
49:06 Los Angeles to potentially use some
49:08 technology like I've said in previous
49:10 episodes where they had facial
49:13 animations absolutely photo real and I
49:17 watched them with my own eyes I watched
49:19 a I think it was a Asian woman
49:24 controlling a African tribal man's face
49:27 and this was like absurdly perfect this
49:31 was not Jeff Bridges in Tron Legacy
49:34 looking like some bizarre smooth dover
49:37 freakazoid character this was every
49:41 wrinkle in this guy's face his skin
49:43 moved properly the mouth moved at the
49:45 right pace you know because 3d mouths
49:47 never move quite right at the right pace
49:50 and because we're familiar with reality
49:52 we know what it looks bad the teeth
49:54 looked perfect they weren't these
49:56 porcelain perfect teeth that even Unreal
49:59 4 still has a problem getting teeth to
50:02 look photo-real and again I'll remind
50:05 you that there was there were
50:06 photographs back during that day in
50:08 September 2001 they came out and over
50:12 the next two years that linked the guy
50:15 they said who did it with some other
50:16 guys and then later the BBC said oh yeah
50:19 we actually paid to have that rendered
50:22 and composited together
50:24 and I'm looking at this photograph going
50:26 my mind cannot tell that this is fake
50:29 and you know I mean I have the tippy
50:33 tippy top brain to notice composite 3ds
50:36 work but man I'm closed just because
50:39 I've been around it for so long so they
50:42 have the technology to prepare this
50:47 entire thing like a movie production all
50:50 pre done pre orchestrated they've had 50
50:54 years to think about how they got it
50:55 wrong and they're gonna get another four
50:57 years to think about it and so they may
51:04 lock this thing down now could they go
51:08 could this be one of the situations why
51:11 don't you know we're gonna get into a
51:12 few other things too but could do we
51:14 have enough technology today to pull
51:16 this off
51:18 well if they're unwilling to give bart
51:20 sibrel the radiation readings from the
51:23 Van Allen belt I would say they got a
51:26 pretty big reason why that's the case
51:28 well they can't do it but what would be
51:32 one of the things you would want to do
51:35 and they could do this too I mean they
51:37 could fake what I'm about to talk about
51:40 except the terrain but they could fake
51:43 that too but they've got you know six
51:46 landing sites on the moon with
51:50 supposedly the kickstand with limb is 15
51:54 16 17 have moon Rovers out there they
51:59 should have the foot prints they should
52:00 have all the wheel marks they should
52:02 have everything up there exactly the way
52:05 it was left well we've got continuity
52:09 experts in Hollywood that recreate
52:11 movies all the time that haven't been
52:12 made for years when Peter Hyams created
52:14 2010 a Space Odyssey in 2013 1990 1984
52:18 god I always get that you're mixed up
52:21 well Kubrick even though he didn't
52:24 destroy all of his stuff in 2001 it was
52:26 still archived away and Heinz did not
52:28 have access to that my buddy Sid worked
52:30 on 2010 and so they had to watch 2001
52:35 over and over and over again to rebuild
52:37 the Odyssey the ship that went to
52:40 Jupiter they could do it but the problem
52:44 is is the terrain so we have two
52:47 missions that reused terrain blatantly
52:52 claiming that the mountains are so far
52:54 away they look exactly the same on a
52:56 twelve hundred mile diameter ball which
52:59 is absolutely absurd you think seeing
53:03 the Statue of Liberty from 60 miles away
53:05 is absurd having two landing sites look
53:09 exactly the same and I mean exactly the
53:11 same is like quadruple absurd so I think
53:16 we have to accept the fact that they
53:21 could facsimile this thing take so
53:23 perfect if you thought the moon footage
53:27 from 1969 on TV was powerful enough to
53:30 convince
53:31 you know a world that we went to the
53:34 moon and a bunch of people still can't
53:35 read linguish that story because they
53:38 saw it on TV
53:39 brace yourself for 2024 now do we have
53:44 junior astronomers that have enough
53:49 technology today in the 21st century
53:53 it's gonna be the second it was gonna
53:55 really be the third decade of the 21st
53:57 century right we're finishing it up by
53:59 2024 we're in the middle of it right are
54:03 they gonna be able to take their 10,000
54:04 power reflector telescopes on a
54:07 particular full moon day and be able to
54:12 see these ships going to their
54:17 destination little tiny specks going to
54:20 their destination firing their retro
54:21 rockets all this other stuff I
54:24 personally don't know I haven't done
54:26 that can they
54:29 can we see it from here on earth I
54:32 haven't done the research to find out if
54:34 we can I have seen incredibly close-up
54:37 shots of the moon from here but the
54:40 magnitude of what we're talking about is
54:42 pretty pretty huge what we need to know
54:47 is with the most powerful amateur
54:49 telescope though someone could get their
54:50 hands on what is the resolution of the
54:54 Box the fust room that we can see with
54:56 this lens and we look at it how many
54:59 square miles is in the shot because we
55:01 need it to be less than a mile to be
55:04 able to see something that's just going
55:06 to be a few feet in diameter what if
55:10 that thing's 20 feet in diameter that's
55:13 bigger than this patio patio I'm on
55:16 right now is probably 12 foot diameter
55:17 probably so even if it was this big it
55:22 would be too small I would think now I
55:25 don't give this disclaimer enough in my
55:29 episodes so let me just put it out there
55:31 because I think a lot of you feel
55:32 exactly the same we don't say it enough
55:34 so we do come off like complete jerks
55:36 most the time no one wants to believe we
55:39 didn't go to the moon nobody
55:43 maybe a foreign nation doesn't want to
55:45 believe it but as Americans we want to
55:47 believe we went we do and we want to
55:51 believe that we can get back in 2024 we
55:53 do we want to know why we didn't go back
55:56 for 50 years or for 47 years or whatever
55:58 why didn't we go back with all the
56:01 superior technology why did they abandon
56:03 the platform that took us to the moon
56:05 why did they get rid of all the evidence
56:08 of how we went you know again they said
56:11 they have lost nearly everything
56:14 although the rote memory modules somehow
56:17 resurfaced and some guy found him in a
56:19 trash bin and gave it to this other guy
56:22 who didn't reverse engineered the
56:23 program out of the rote memory it's it's
56:26 a joke I mean like really and the thing
56:30 is is this guy is trying to say he's got
56:32 the actual modules from the limb really
56:37 you you the astronauts when they were
56:40 climbing back into the lunar module
56:43 thing they pulled the memory out about
56:47 all this stuff with them so they'd be
56:49 extra heavy for no reason whatsoever
56:51 yeah that's what this guy said in this
56:53 video these are the actual ones that
56:55 went to the moon's like no one's going
56:58 to take the lifesaver out of the the
57:01 limb to take it with them why would you
57:04 it didn't the program didn't change it
57:08 just was there you know so I mean anyway
57:11 it's trying to button up a problem I
57:13 think that people started realizing just
57:17 the whole story that someone's like oh I
57:19 found the Ark of the Covenant because
57:20 people doubted it existed it was found
57:23 in a trash bin and I got it on loan and
57:26 I've got my buddy who's a radiologist
57:28 it's gonna scan the Ark of the Covenant
57:29 and it's really there's too much of the
57:35 mission that is always shrouded in
57:37 complete mystery it's too much of the
57:40 mission that is only communicated in
57:41 animations again some of these Caltech
57:45 guys that have put the the capsule that
57:48 supposedly lands back on earth they put
57:51 it through engineering software at
57:54 Caltech and release the animations and
57:56 they said no matter how
57:57 we throw this thing at the atmosphere of
57:58 the earth there is nothing what we are
58:01 capable of doing putting outside thrust
58:03 on this thing to keep it stabilized such
58:05 that the blast shield bottom part of it
58:06 the opposite side of the bullet is
58:08 stabilized to reenter Earth's atmosphere
58:11 the thing always starts to spin
58:13 extremely violently and any human being
58:16 inside would be ripped to shreds and I
58:19 mean ripped to shreds so there's that
58:23 problem but for me this this thing
58:27 getting greenlit this return to the moon
58:29 in 2024 never hint hitting national
58:32 press or international press the the
58:37 article that was linked on our page is
58:38 some kind of obscure science website but
58:40 I did go to NASA this morning and looked
58:43 up the whole mission thing so they're
58:44 doing it it's not a joke I mean in terms
58:46 of their pitch to us why isn't this in
58:51 like why isn't this a big deal would
58:54 this be a huge deal you've got fire the
58:57 wheel and getting to the moon and then
58:59 you're going to do it again and it's
59:01 like yeah whatever gonna come the moon
59:03 whatever well it was gonna be a chick on
59:06 the thing yeah okay so what's gonna
59:11 happen with the camaraderie around this
59:13 mission okay well everybody who's
59:19 hanging on to the old moon mission thing
59:21 they're gonna be trying to throw it in
59:23 our face like crazy believe me we're
59:25 gonna be objective we're gonna watch it
59:27 we're gonna see if there's again a brand
59:29 new platform you know for all we know
59:31 they've been studying it for 47 years
59:34 and they finally cracked it and when
59:36 they finally cracked it they're like
59:37 president we can do this so go ahead and
59:41 give us the money but there's a catch
59:45 isn't there there's a huge catch if they
59:50 really go to the moon and what does that
59:53 catch well they've already shown us what
59:57 the place looks like in a studio and
60:00 they've already shown us what it looks
60:02 like to jump around on the moon and how
60:03 you magically float on the moon we've
60:08 seen the surface of the Moon we've seen
60:10 how
60:10 the dirt sticks to the legs of the
60:12 astronauts we see that even though you
60:16 have a ten thousand pound thrust motor
60:18 there's no sign of any debris on the
60:20 legs of the limbs the little sheath on
60:24 the bottom of the booster just comes off
60:26 right next to the booster no burn marks
60:30 it doesn't come off back when they
60:32 turned it on like a you know a couple
60:35 miles away it no it stays right there
60:37 with what the limb absolutely hilarious
60:42 right are they gonna repeat all these
60:43 mistakes are they going to attempt to
60:47 land next to anything they've done
60:48 before I mean it's a big place so if
60:51 they give us excuses about what we can't
60:53 crash into the old stuff we don't want
60:55 to take that risk so we're gonna land
60:57 really far away from it I mean
60:59 eventually if their plan is true they're
61:02 gonna stay up there forever so they're
61:04 gonna be able to drive over to all six
61:06 of the previous missions which means
61:08 they better look exactly the same as the
61:10 time life photographs that came back
61:11 from these astronauts with Hasselblad
61:13 mounted to their chest with no view port
61:16 all of the lighting issues they have
61:20 well we're gonna have to explain how
61:22 five light sources show up in a
61:23 particular shot how Buzz Aldrin crawling
61:28 down the back of the limb is fully lit
61:29 with hot spots all over his body even
61:32 though he's in the shadows it'll be
61:35 interesting to see if they make the
61:36 doorways any bigger inside the limb
61:38 that's gonna land on the moon the next
61:40 time is it gonna look like a bunch of
61:41 tent poles again a bunch of construction
61:44 paper where you know again if you look
61:47 at the limb in a photograph those really
61:49 high-definition pictures of the limbs
61:51 that landed on the moon just look at
61:53 them it is the most hastily stapled
61:59 scotch tape together thing you've ever
62:01 seen I mean there's people that I think
62:03 make a very good case that there really
62:05 looks like there's tape holding things
62:08 together but a lot of the flat black
62:11 panel or whatever this this paper this
62:14 may be thin steel or whatever it is it's
62:17 not straight it doesn't create a seal
62:19 you can see you know like they think
62:21 these these edges don't come together
62:24 what NASA can't do that I don't buy that
62:27 for a split second there's more ornate
62:29 craftsmanship in a in a kitchen table
62:33 made in the 1850s than this limb made
62:35 1969 where all the seams fit together
62:39 you know as beautiful crafts but cause
62:40 little pieces together all butts
62:42 together perfect there's more
62:43 craftsmanship and a mosaic in a temple
62:46 and Pompeii then there then there is in
62:49 this limbs construction and what's with
62:53 all the foil what's the what's the huge
62:56 technological advantage of this was a
62:59 copper foil all over the place is it to
63:02 reflect heat because last time I
63:04 remember photoelectric effect is pretty
63:06 intense and wrapping it in a conductive
63:08 material would just mean the whole thing
63:11 would start generating electricity on
63:12 the outside are the suits gonna look
63:15 different are they going to need this
63:17 gold-plated mask so that we can't see
63:20 the astronauts face inside the actor
63:22 suits because it's not really Buzz
63:25 Aldrin it's not really Neil Armstrong I
63:28 mean they use those in the ISS so it's
63:32 gonna be an interesting next decade you
63:36 know depending on how old you are let's
63:43 say you're in your 20s and let's say you
63:46 live to be at least in your 80s then you
63:51 have 60 years left on this world and in
63:54 the form that you're in right now if
63:57 they're going to land there in 2024 and
63:59 you live another 60 years which means in
64:02 four years they're gonna be on the moon
64:04 and according to their mission statement
64:06 they're not leaving they're gonna be
64:08 able to space stations and I don't know
64:10 aqueducts and whatever the heck they're
64:13 gonna build up there right in your
64:16 lifetime you should personally be able
64:18 to get a ticket to go to the moon and
64:19 visit the Club Med up there in your
64:22 lifetime you might be in your 80s when
64:24 it happens but you should be able to do
64:26 it and all the solar radiation that is
64:30 again I can't stress with you guys
64:34 enough when I sat across the table from
64:36 the two guys that retire
64:38 / resigned out of NASA Ames because they
64:43 were realizing they were on a project to
64:46 go to Mars and it wasn't gonna happen in
64:48 their lifetime and that they were well
64:51 one of the guys said that he was told
64:52 flat out that we didn't go to the moon
64:55 the other guy was sitting right next to
64:57 him so I assume he knows that it's true
64:59 as well but the guy next to him said
65:00 look cuz he looked at him he says well
65:02 what was the latest because you stayed
65:03 longer than me the other guy who was
65:07 looking over his shoulder during the
65:09 conversation I mean literally looking
65:10 over his shoulder to see if anybody was
65:11 listening he kind of like brought his
65:14 head down and he goes well like he did
65:17 want to be having this conversation
65:18 that's what you have to know man the big
65:20 guy was like hey no big deal man
65:22 we didn't go you know get it through
65:25 your head and I didn't again I couldn't
65:27 process the information at the time but
65:28 he goes we realized that we had to just
65:32 to survive
65:33 ambient solar radiation before the Van
65:36 Allen belts before any coronal mass
65:38 ejections or anything else going on up
65:41 there we'd have to lace the capsule in
65:44 six inches of water to fend off the
65:47 radiation wow I mean isn't it
65:53 interesting that water is such a great
65:54 insulator water being a super dense
65:57 version of ether it even moves like
66:01 ether just a lot slower so it disrupts
66:06 the same thing that it's made out of
66:09 because it's denser it absorbs it it's
66:11 beautiful
66:11 concrete's also an amazing insulator so
66:16 just an astronaut standing on the moon
66:18 in a spacesuit not encapsulated in six
66:22 inches of water on all sides should be
66:25 eaten eaten alive why does a Space
66:27 Station person have no problem
66:29 potentially space walking if that's true
66:31 because they're way underneath the Van
66:33 Allen belts they're 250 miles up and the
66:37 Van Allen belts really start around
66:38 1,000 but again according to NASA in
66:41 1998 the space shuttle went up too high
66:44 and everybody got sick and the mission
66:47 had to be aborted go look up the
66:50 mission history and NASA and there's no
66:53 record of that event occurring even
66:55 though it was reported in CNN and CNN
66:57 scrubbed the article - I realize so bart
67:00 sibrel is the guy we have to trust with
67:01 that particular piece of information but
67:04 he made his first movie a funny thing
67:07 happened on the way the moon in 2001 so
67:10 he was only three years away from that
67:11 article releasing and he was absolutely
67:14 a pioneer and a researcher and
67:17 everything being released about space
67:19 technology space travel because he was
67:22 compiling the stuff for nearly ten years
67:25 prior to making his film because he was
67:27 approached in the early 90s I think they
67:30 got the year right butts and somewhere
67:31 in the early 90s he was approached by
67:33 the gentleman that handled all the
67:35 documentation for the Apollo missions
67:37 who came out afterwards and said look we
67:38 didn't go to the moon I was at the tippy
67:41 top of the pyramid in in NASA and he
67:44 goes one of the last reports I saw was
67:47 that it's a ten thousand to one odds
67:48 that the Pala missions could ever safely
67:50 get to the moon and return a man back
67:53 safely so he briefed Bart and Bart said
67:58 you know I don't want the headache of
68:00 being chased around by a bunch of black
68:01 suits so he didn't do it for nearly ten
68:04 years and finally he hunkered down and
68:06 got it done and again everything Bart
68:10 told told you in that movie and in his
68:13 second movie astronauts gone wild I
68:15 think released in oh three it's exactly
68:18 what the guy told me across the table
68:19 and again you have to know I was given
68:25 the holy grail of at least the basics of
68:28 what Bart put in his movie in 2001 by
68:30 this dude across the table who worked at
68:33 NASA for almost 15 years and another guy
68:37 I don't know how long the guy who worked
68:38 for them but I know he quit in around 88
68:40 89 and I couldn't process the
68:45 information I didn't go home going oh I
68:47 bet this is gonna be the case right
68:49 anyway I hope you feel me like that's
68:52 about all I need to do right now if you
68:55 have them into deep thoughts radio.com
68:56 please go that's where all the feeds are
68:58 audio/video lock facebook group a
69:00 Twitter page a patreon account a PayPal
69:02 link
69:04 and that's all I'm gonna go for there's
69:05 also season one remastered link up there
69:07 if you want to see those so until the
69:10 next episode take care of yourself and
69:12 someone else and I'll see you in the
69:14 next deep thoughts over now
