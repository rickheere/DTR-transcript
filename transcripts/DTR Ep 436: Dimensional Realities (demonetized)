00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen it's somewhere in the 50s out
00:36 here just stopped raining it's raining
00:39 for a couple days alright so today I'm
00:45 gonna pierce a little deeper into the
00:50 notion of multiple dimensions of
00:54 existence I almost want to call this
00:56 like my dimensions of reality but think
01:02 some people are gonna use the keyword
01:03 injured of interdimensional realities so
01:06 we'll see how we title this thing in E
01:08 and you guys already know I don't even
01:09 know looks like that got more
01:11 information than I do so I did a whole
01:14 episode on interdimensional beings I've
01:17 talked about loosely at one episode at
01:22 least this notion that and I've heard
01:26 this now since I had the Epiphany I
01:28 think it's almost like epiphanies are
01:30 dropped on the world as a whole and then
01:33 we all have them and we all go off and
01:34 create our original comments using these
01:37 epiphanies then we all find oh my god
01:38 you had that idea too and it was like
01:39 when did you have that let's write on
01:41 the same week I recorded this you know
01:42 and so I do think that stuff's just
01:47 dropped on you but I am watching the
01:50 show fringe like I keep telling you guys
01:51 I'm on season 2 now I'm about to start
01:55 it and I would just say without
01:57 mentioning anything about Fringe it's
01:59 very inspiring in this subject matter
02:01 because the writers are very very
02:04 informed about all things let me just
02:06 tell you it's a great show anybody likes
02:08 this show deep thoughts radio you will
02:11 love fringe period as I smoke this stick
02:16 my buddy Dave gave me it saboteur oh so
02:22 far so excellent but I've been telling
02:25 with this whole thing of you know when
02:27 you get into conspiracies which are
02:31 conspiracy facts you have the situation
02:36 where there's just we
02:37 disconnect with humanity for the very
02:39 first time in your life you see see
02:42 things from a different perspective and
02:44 you can't find anyone else at times -
02:48 that believes anything that you're
02:50 saying it's a very strange experience if
02:54 you want to simulate this go to SpaceX
02:56 just before a launch get the microphone
02:59 or they're charging up all the actors
03:01 pretending like they give a [ __ ] about
03:03 anything and then start telling how you
03:05 do we didn't go to the moon everyone in
03:07 the room will categorically reject
03:09 anything you say no matter if you've got
03:11 video of the Capricorn set proving that
03:18 this is fake and that's a weird
03:21 experience now again there's been a lot
03:25 of work to create cognitive dissidence
03:27 from foreign nations to the United
03:28 States they claim they succeeded in 80s
03:30 I think they did it just got worse but I
03:35 started to talk to enough intelligent
03:39 people who don't do any research that I
03:42 got this weird sort of little illusion
03:44 that maybe there is like multiple
03:48 dimensions of reality but they also tend
03:51 to talk to each other and I used to have
03:53 this joke that you know like a Robin
03:56 Williams had multiple personalities but
03:59 the only differences they were all
04:01 exactly his age exactly his gender and
04:04 when maybe and they all went by the name
04:07 Robin Williams and so he was popping in
04:10 and out of like different personalities
04:12 just like Sybil but they all responded
04:14 to hey Robin hey mister blames oh yeah
04:17 what you know it's like he did that
04:19 obviously incubated all these characters
04:21 Jonathan winters did it Danny Kaye did
04:23 it Jim Carrey did it anyone who does
04:27 impersonations has this talent a writer
04:31 does it without impersonating you just
04:32 create all these different characters
04:34 right and you're very observant in
04:36 reality but the more that you dig down
04:41 into the very fundamentals of mass
04:43 energy I think it's a little bit tougher
04:47 with Newton it's a little bit Newtonian
04:51 physics
04:51 a little bit tougher with I think even
04:53 perhaps quantum mechanics because
04:57 quantum mechanics is trying to create at
04:59 least as it was initially taught to me
05:01 in the 70s in the early 80s it was
05:04 initially taught to me that you need
05:05 quantify and quantifiable packets of
05:07 energy that they tried to you know
05:09 maintain order from now they fully
05:12 acknowledged the atom and the Heisenberg
05:14 uncertainty principle and all these
05:16 things but it all comes down to even in
05:19 quantum physics they believe that energy
05:21 vibrates now because they have created a
05:25 very tangible model of mass energy they
05:29 acknowledge that you know energy is over
05:32 here and mass is over here then through
05:35 a equals MC squared which is a bunch of
05:37 you know logical thinking was not
05:40 invented by Einstein the algorithm was
05:42 finished the year before he was born and
05:44 goes back all the way to Newton's time
05:46 frame when you burn a log it didn't take
05:49 a genius to go man that thing was solid
05:51 and now it turned into flames and now
05:53 it's smoke and if we gather up all the
05:56 smoke and all the ash we do not have
05:58 enough mass to make the log so a bunch
06:01 of it just changed into pure thermal
06:02 energy and it's now in the universe
06:04 becoming something else right so yeah
06:07 that's how the theory came around it
06:09 wasn't Einstein at all and that guy's a
06:10 total fraud go see my final episode in
06:13 season 4 which I guess is 400 and then
06:19 we had the the CERN Hadron Collider and
06:23 what was a bunch of dark rumors about it
06:26 and they did st. tannic rituals and
06:28 stuff and the basement really not the
06:30 same from the Christian Bible but Shira
06:33 the god of destruction you know these
06:36 kids man they're just [ __ ] in the head
06:39 it's all I got to say let's get in
06:41 worship of Cthulhu somebody's got a good
06:44 stocking stuffer this year
06:46 yeah it's called you don't exist anymore
06:48 okay exceptionally low IQs have not read
06:53 the story of Faust you know signing a
06:55 deal with the devil and think you're
06:56 gonna get anything out of it
06:57 then watch ghostbusters two men but once
07:00 you free yourself up
07:02 and I'm not going to bore you guys with
07:05 another
07:05 I'm gonna say that we're either and I'm
07:06 gonna go through a little bit either
07:07 stuff with you but don't worry it's not
07:09 gonna become some massive ether all
07:11 episode but when you realize that all
07:16 all mass energy it's made by one
07:19 particle and it doesn't have a charge
07:22 but the way it behaves is the way that
07:24 we give it a charge spins one way it's
07:26 an a you assume it's another way it's
07:27 positive but that every every single
07:30 thing that you think exists in the
07:32 universe a proton a neutron a cork your
07:36 dog you you are the collection of a
07:43 bunch of I don't want to say
07:47 serendipitous and I'm not talking about
07:50 the intent of God over evolution or
07:52 anything like that but you are you're
07:55 the current that is water you know I
07:59 just had to put this analogy out there
08:01 in case someone hasn't been to the
08:02 channel before if I took a sink of water
08:05 and I pull the drain out and it starts
08:07 doing a little tornado vortex and I
08:09 pointed it and I go what is that you go
08:11 that's a little vortex or current or
08:13 whatever you want to call it tornado and
08:15 I could be a jerk and go well that's
08:17 just water yeah yeah I know it's water
08:20 but it's doing something what's a bubble
08:21 it's still water it's just shaped like a
08:23 sphere right little oxygen in the center
08:28 now if I could just say look you know
08:31 that there's a force of Direction going
08:34 on that tornado now I want you to erase
08:37 the water in your mind but keep the
08:40 force model exactly where it was that
08:42 created that funnel that force model
08:46 which is a turns in the Fibonacci
08:48 pattern or the fractal it's what you are
08:52 we're probably more Mandelbrot set than
08:55 anything these infinitely complex
08:57 fractals fractals but flowing through us
09:00 through us and every probably every
09:03 direction that's out there is ether
09:05 behaving like water but because you
09:09 don't see it because it's moving 50
09:11 times the speed of light and you don't
09:14 have the capability of just stopping one
09:15 a little ether a pixel in your hand it
09:18 is synthesized
09:19 you however 50 times it's be like you're
09:22 being resynthesized constantly it does
09:26 have the ability to slow itself down
09:30 even though it's moving extremely
09:32 quickly through your system it doesn't
09:34 turn into the chemistry effect of
09:36 turning into flame so you don't just
09:39 spontaneously combust but imagine if
09:43 spontaneous combustion which is
09:45 obviously a rumor from the past I called
09:47 it the old-fashioned divorce settlement
09:49 was some anomaly in the Earth's behavior
09:52 some anomaly that happens in a room you
09:55 don't hear about anymore so you know
09:57 they have to be in the era that this was
10:00 being claimed and the photographs of
10:01 spontaneous combustion bodies it's just
10:03 really interesting like a whole guy's
10:06 body's gone everybody's from his calf's
10:08 down to his shoes he's perfectly fine
10:11 and only the skin at the top of like
10:15 each leg is seared but the rest of its
10:19 okay I mean the rest of it down below is
10:20 okay but the body's gone above actually
10:22 word used to say people fell asleep with
10:24 like cigarettes in their hands and that
10:26 would burn them up come on come on these
10:29 photographs what would happen if you
10:31 caught on fire and aren't you made of
10:33 mostly water you might set your shirt on
10:36 fire but you're gonna burn the place
10:37 down if you're getting it so hot your
10:40 body's just melting off the top of you
10:41 right but now imagine that the current
10:46 gets disturbed and it does unravel who
10:49 you are and there's a bit of thermal
10:51 discharge at the fringes which is at the
10:54 one I really remember is two legs and
10:56 shoes in front of a chair and then there
10:59 was sort of a black imprint where the
11:00 person was but the cloth on the chair
11:03 although damaged wasn't like you know it
11:06 was like a flame thrower that did it it
11:08 was like something happened so quickly
11:09 about the time the flame was there it
11:12 was gone such it really just singed the
11:15 fabric and didn't completely burn the
11:16 thing to the ground so if you saw a
11:19 chair it's all burned out and there's
11:21 the cloth is gone you're looking at the
11:23 wood framework and its burned too and
11:26 you have two legs sitting there you
11:28 could do the I dropped my cigar I was
11:30 really tired
11:31 but interdimensional living or
11:36 dimensional living it's hard for us to
11:39 grasp it on one level and then not so
11:42 hard on another level the hard one it's
11:46 tough for us to grasp is that we don't
11:48 have anything in another dimension okay
11:54 I'm gonna get to paranormal a second
11:55 done a daily basis if I went over and
11:59 shook your hand I've touched your hand
12:01 you feel my hand I'd feel your hand and
12:03 we do the greeting ritual however you
12:08 can right now I can move my hand through
12:10 the cold 55-degree night and I can feel
12:14 a little resistance from the atmosphere
12:16 I can't see it it's there now some
12:21 people in the paranormal world believe
12:23 that they are seeing a ghostly dimension
12:27 right they can feel cold and hot places
12:31 in rooms I don't know if anyone's ever
12:34 try to explain it but I had this weird
12:37 thing that happens I think I may have
12:39 mentioned it once before but I will get
12:42 by both my grandmother's starts thing
12:46 one of my grandmother's I don't think
12:48 wore any perfume and one of my
12:52 grandmother's didn't and it's that
12:55 grandma perfume it's a synth it's more
12:58 flowery it's more old-fashioned when
13:01 perfumes started getting mass-produced
13:04 in the 20th century
13:05 you know the my grandmother that war was
13:08 born in 1912 so you could just die
13:10 yourself back to the sense that she
13:12 became attracted to and then she
13:15 maintained that preference even though
13:16 she bought a new sense in the future it
13:18 was a really old-fashioned smell and
13:20 it's not something that I ever run into
13:23 anymore because the old ladies of today
13:25 are different they have a different
13:28 scent preference right so I'll be
13:34 walking around my world usually always
13:37 in my home that's the other weird thing
13:40 in fact it is it's now I think about
13:43 it's only bevor been in my house
13:44 I will turn a corner do something and a
13:48 wolf I get this absolute smell of my
13:51 grandmother and I guess it's sort of
13:54 unfortunate mother grandmother didn't
13:56 wear perfume so I don't know what she
13:58 would do however over my bed again tell
14:00 me she's on the other side but so you
14:04 get these little imprints and you like I
14:06 would sit there like I still do it I
14:08 mean it's probably once a year I
14:09 probably get this and it's it's
14:14 interesting you know and I believe in
14:16 spirits I do so I kind of like I pause
14:20 for a second you know my grandma what's
14:22 up you know and how's life you know
14:25 nothing ever happens beyond that point
14:27 but that's strange because the scent
14:30 will last I think within reason at least
14:35 a minute if not a little bit longer than
14:37 a minute and so then I usually nowhere
14:43 near eating food I'm nowhere near
14:45 drinking anything I'm not putting on
14:47 freshly laundered clothing I'm not
14:50 exposing myself to any element that
14:52 would be necessarily triggering
14:55 randomness in my nose that then creates
14:57 a what they call the flavor flavor is
15:03 the combination of your tongue giving
15:06 you taste and your nose giving you smell
15:09 flavors that is the two things
15:11 in-between this is obviously more smell
15:15 right so I think that there's dozens and
15:23 dozens of things that we experience that
15:25 we just blow past and like when I did
15:29 that bilingual aphasia aphasia episode
15:33 you know I asked my buddies right after
15:35 I did the episode what do you think man
15:37 what do you think about bilingual
15:39 aphasia well it's when you wake up and
15:42 you can speak another language you can't
15:45 speak your language you need more or
15:46 you're speaking in a British accent for
15:48 the rest of your life
15:49 and boy do you get that West world host
15:54 expression on their face when they're
15:56 seeing something they're not supposed to
15:57 see
15:58 you get an answer that is the equivalent
16:00 of I don't know it doesn't look like
16:02 anything you show them a photograph of
16:04 something right they're not supposed to
16:06 see it's almost like there's neural
16:09 inhibitors and man without significant
16:12 enlightenment which is you learning
16:14 about things and expanding your thinking
16:16 where you just they can't hear you I
16:20 can't see you they can't process
16:21 anything you're saying strange but if we
16:26 were to say the only thing that these
16:30 currents were talking about can bump
16:33 into our other currents that are
16:36 obviously at the vibrational frequency
16:39 that we're at and this is done a new
16:43 idea you've heard this a thousand times
16:45 in sci-fi movies and television shows
16:47 and then you're able to interact with it
16:50 there's plenty of shows and movies that
16:52 have dealt with you know people
16:55 resonating massive the will the
16:57 Philadelphia Experiment where they
16:59 resonated a ship to be out of phase with
17:02 this world and then all the people fell
17:05 inside the deck and that's a really
17:08 interesting thing because we definitely
17:12 had a lot of amazing sci-fi writers at
17:14 the time you have to know that these
17:16 people weren't stupid well the Worlds
17:18 was written in 39 38 right amount of
17:22 science fiction popping out the world
17:23 back in the day was really amazing so
17:24 someone being able to think that up is
17:26 definitely a possibility but the
17:29 Philadelphia Experiment really occurred
17:31 and I probably should do a whole episode
17:32 on it right
17:33 I was raised with the movie that was
17:36 made in the 80s and so for me it was it
17:39 was almost this did happen and it was
17:42 exactly like the movie that's sort of
17:44 what I felt like when I was a kid being
17:45 raised with the film but it was based on
17:49 a Tesla theory as I understand it I'll
17:52 go research and get all that good stuff
17:53 for you but it was resonating the ship
17:57 at its own frequency because the ship is
18:00 connected with steel anyone on the deck
18:03 with rubber shoes right is not going to
18:06 inherit a solid transformation and
18:09 they're not going to get the same
18:10 vibration up there
18:12 limbs to go along with the ship at the
18:15 same rate so here goes the ship into
18:19 another dimension but the human beings
18:20 on it are maybe changing not changing
18:24 fast enough so they start sinking into
18:26 the ship you know the whole thing was
18:29 they did this and you know part of it
18:30 was the idea to transport the ship from
18:34 point A to point B really fast which I
18:36 think it's just well like a
18:38 teleportation thing right I do believe
18:41 that if we ever do come up with
18:42 teleportation of any kind it's going to
18:45 be not us necessarily doing what
18:47 happened in Tron where you're taking
18:49 apart every atom and then recreating it
18:51 on the other side eventually quantum
18:53 computers will get us to that level and
18:54 which are gonna find out if we have a
18:56 soul but I think teleportation is going
19:00 to be based on folding space and I know
19:05 that sounds rather dune or sci-fi but I
19:07 really think that that's we're going to
19:08 take place they're gonna take space and
19:10 it's full integrity and then just warp
19:13 your body to another location or create
19:16 this doorway and you're going to walk in
19:17 you're gonna pop out the other side now
19:20 whether or not you increase you still
19:22 are having to travel the distance who
19:24 knows right they want to take a bubble
19:26 around you and then just push the bubble
19:29 with you standing in it to Mars or to
19:31 the moon or across the country or
19:34 whatever right before you get to that
19:37 you have to ice down the theory of what
19:39 the hell you're talking about you have
19:41 to understand mass and energy
19:42 beautifully well you know I'm always
19:46 complaining that ether was a race from
19:48 the science books when [ __ ] Einstein
19:51 came around right they just used him as
19:53 a tool to erase what we learned from
19:56 Tesla but what was the damage of doing
20:00 that most of us say man we would have
20:01 free energy right now if Tesla had his
20:03 way and you're right but what other
20:07 research imagine this we know from
20:09 Faraday to Tesla the ether is the way
20:12 the world works okay they used it in all
20:16 of their inventions they used it in all
20:18 of their science these are you know all
20:21 Volta all these dudes okay
20:24 now they shut it off for us in the early
20:28 20th century with some bogus experiments
20:31 and just people didn't know that stuff
20:33 was so advanced for the average human
20:35 being back then the telegram was
20:38 probably the average knowledge of a
20:39 human being and even that was a tiny
20:41 reservoir of sentient beings that
20:44 understood that the technology they had
20:46 to carry a message on a wire for
20:49 hundreds and hundreds of miles that was
20:51 not easy it's not just a matter of
20:53 pumping energy in so the military and
20:59 other privately funded laboratories got
21:02 to continue decade after decade after
21:06 decade understanding ether understanding
21:12 how this place has really put together
21:13 at least a hell of a lot more than
21:14 anyone who doesn't believe in it they
21:18 had tons of stuff that was in Tesla's
21:22 office when he died at 85 years old
21:24 Donald Trump's uncle retrieved at all
21:27 okay what could you gain knowing
21:32 something about how the universe works
21:34 and then when you build the world's
21:37 largest machine a 10 billion euro
21:40 machine which then inherited another 10
21:42 billion dollars with the repairs and
21:43 upgrades you know it's on the what is it
21:49 Switzerland in France
21:50 something like that to do what to slam
21:53 two protons together come on I mean yeah
21:57 you might have like a list of things
21:58 that you want to find out about the
22:00 universe but 10 billion euro plus
22:03 another again it's in several stages
22:06 they blew it up at first and they had to
22:08 fix it and the ante upgraded it's a
22:10 money pit then they lied and said they
22:13 found the the Higgs boson god particle
22:19 which boy when just go see my episode on
22:21 CERN you'll laugh your head off I think
22:23 it's the season 1 it's been really well
22:26 received seriously
22:30 how would you conduct experiments to
22:35 discover whether or not you're right or
22:37 wrong
22:38 about the fact that maybe were in one
22:40 infinitesimal slice of the frequency
22:43 range just like a radio I mean you know
22:48 it's not a big deal just dial down to
22:50 the 88.5 and get the classical channel
22:53 and go up to 106.7 get k-rock and los
22:57 angeles and you know it's it's like you
23:01 don't quite understand it still a black
23:02 box but still you can figure it out in
23:06 your brain well yeah it's that
23:06 frequencies and then you know you know
23:08 whatever okay
23:09 well it's right there in front of your
23:11 face a little bit of proof then you can
23:13 have a whole reality I mean imagine this
23:16 okay we've got this big right wing left
23:18 wing hate pool going on right all right
23:21 so on one channel it's a liberal channel
23:25 espousing the divine intent of the Lord
23:31 and Savior Hillary Clinton and then you
23:33 go over a few frequencies and you're
23:35 living in red state Donald Trump world
23:38 maybe another one over your libertarian
23:41 now you know if you listen to just one
23:43 of those channels you don't go to the
23:45 other ones because you don't like those
23:46 people you know like the way they think
23:47 you're in a totally different dimension
23:49 of reality how your brain is being
23:51 propagandized and synthesized it's
23:54 completely different you're going to be
23:56 a different person and the people who
23:57 listen to those other channels you're
23:59 going to believe intimately most likely
24:01 a bunch of stuff that's different from
24:04 other people well that's a way of
24:07 measuring reality and that's where we
24:10 get the scientists that say oh there's
24:12 more dimensions right they're looking at
24:14 different metrics more physical metrics
24:16 time metrics and if you want another
24:19 analogy to simplify that short people
24:22 have a different dimension of reality
24:24 than tall people completely different
24:27 they see the world totally different
24:30 than each other those of us who are more
24:34 intellectual we program we you know we
24:38 sit in Sound Studios or whatever we
24:42 don't have the dimension of reality that
24:45 NFL football football player has and so
24:49 they're being hit constantly by does
24:52 and dozens of hundreds and hundreds of
24:54 other players over course of one season
24:56 and we're not used to being in my world
25:00 when I'm not used to being you know hit
25:03 by a linebacker or a tackle or something
25:06 right but they are so their perception
25:10 of reality their day-to-day churn is
25:12 completely different the way they see
25:15 the world is different you take a
25:16 football player and put them in a bar
25:18 and call him a name that dude has been
25:21 hit hundreds and hundreds if not tens of
25:24 thousands of times since high school up
25:26 to their professional career and you
25:29 wonder why they can just snap the neck
25:30 of their girlfriend and end up on TMZ
25:32 and go to jail us nerds you know we're
25:35 sitting there going honey are you happy
25:37 you know dare you talk to me like that
25:39 so it's a different world but what was
25:45 really strange as I was showing that one
25:46 of my family members some conclusive
25:48 proof about 9/11 the physics I'm the
25:52 physics major great I mean I'm it's been
25:56 my whole life since I learned about the
25:58 first thing at nine years old the person
26:01 I'm talking to has never ever expressed
26:05 a single fact about physics her entire
26:10 life
26:11 ever ever ever but when I showed her
26:15 something that broke her kubler-ross
26:17 effect right the the denial came in then
26:25 the anger came in was actually denial
26:29 first and anger and I was looking at her
26:32 going well it's right in front of your
26:35 face I mean this stuff doesn't happen
26:37 it's not possible to happen go buy a
26:42 book somewhere and read it just look up
26:45 that basic thing right there and they
26:49 couldn't really interact with my
26:53 dimension of reality this is the way I
26:55 saw it and I was kind of going and they
26:58 believed everything everything it's
27:00 official story man I mean their official
27:02 story aficionado right which
27:04 utterly indoctrinated and a friend of
27:08 mine reminded me today that anger in
27:13 general is the sign of a low IQ which is
27:20 why I'm always telling you that the
27:21 Bible makes God look like a [ __ ] God's
27:24 getting angry all the time how do you
27:25 get angry first you get surprised and
27:29 then you can't resolve it any other way
27:34 now we're all guilty of it there's
27:37 something that makes every single one of
27:38 us angry to the degree you're becoming
27:41 more angry by little things constantly
27:43 constantly if change your life man
27:46 because you need a you need a life where
27:48 you're happy because that's where you
27:49 boost your IQ and you boost your
27:51 integration with the world in most cases
27:55 you need some crazy scientists or
27:57 Hermits here and there but the more I
28:00 because there was a phase with this
28:02 person my family where I was like all
28:04 right will you allow me to send you some
28:06 more things I won't send anything that
28:07 hardcore saying some other things fun
28:10 things sure I'd sent him over later on
28:14 you know we don't talk that much so it
28:15 was kinda like later check-in hey you
28:17 see that thing I did and you know I just
28:21 you know well you know what they say and
28:23 then here comes a bunch of fishel story
28:24 stuff as long as anyone wrote a debunk
28:26 article on something boy that was the
28:28 other way out of the game right and you
28:32 start to realize you know it may just be
28:33 simply the cowardice soul of this
28:35 particular human being and the
28:37 intellectual in capability to engage
28:44 reality and figure out what's going on
28:46 all right those are blissfully happy I
28:49 guess that's cool you know I'm not
28:51 looking for that person to help us in
28:52 the truth battle for sure but the
28:55 interdimensional thing is interesting to
28:57 think that we have and I said this in my
29:00 time episode back in season one I think
29:04 a season one I don't think I think I
29:06 just called it time because I was into
29:08 really cool short titles but I think
29:11 that I probably should have called it
29:12 you know does time exists and I don't
29:14 know if that's what I call I can't
29:15 remember
29:16 but the way I've described time and
29:19 reality for two-and-a-half decades is
29:23 that I see the universe as an infinitely
29:26 dense Borg cube or maybe sphere to be
29:29 more default shape and every possible
29:35 variation of all possible reality not
29:38 impossible reality so there's a lot of a
29:41 distinction right like I can't stand on
29:43 this patio no matter how big I make my
29:47 thighs and any other reality and just
29:50 jump to the moon that's never gonna be
29:52 possible as far as I know
29:54 so that doesn't exist anywhere in the
29:56 timeline me getting to the moon probably
29:59 exists whatever the [ __ ] that thing is
30:00 but impossible things don't occur so
30:04 everything they're happening everything
30:05 that's happening this is part of my law
30:07 of attraction episode way back in the
30:09 day was that I do believe that your
30:12 frequency of preference and gullibility
30:16 and I would say buy into reality all of
30:21 which we all have okay is that we are
30:24 picking the next second of our reality
30:26 according to our vibrational frequency
30:30 so you have two metrics we're gonna
30:33 measure here your vibrational frequency
30:36 has infinite futures and infinite pasts
30:38 everything you could possibly do since
30:40 the day you were conceived in your
30:42 mother's womb you have done you just the
30:46 only are only experiencing one linear
30:49 path to the sort of illusion of time
30:52 right as things change there is sort of
30:54 a ticker of I started this episode and
30:57 I'm 34 minutes into the episode pricasso
31:01 where you see it and so there's time
31:04 passing but it's in my head but it's
31:05 because I'm memory I know what I did
31:07 before therefore I could acknowledge
31:09 memory they prophesize and theorize that
31:12 I prophesized but they theorized that
31:16 our postulate that man had a point in
31:18 time where we didn't have the developed
31:20 memory that we have now which i think is
31:23 kind of logical depending on how we were
31:25 created and so we were more iconic
31:27 languages to here now
31:29 we had you know if yesterday was gone we
31:31 didn't remember it and you just think
31:34 you could fall in love every day with
31:35 your wife or husband or anything be cool
31:37 eventually you look at your dog go why
31:40 do I have this old thing with me here it
31:41 looks like it's about to die but now the
31:44 second metric is what frequency are you
31:46 on
31:47 what are you vibrating in alright well
31:50 what's your current so imagine let's use
31:54 electricity as a little bit of a
31:57 methodology which kind of ties back to
31:59 the radio analogy because you have a
32:01 certain wave of energy that's the radio
32:03 is picking up and it's being modulated
32:05 so you can hear sound but you're
32:08 vibrating at say one volt or one amp
32:12 let's put that one so we have a flow so
32:15 it's one amp and you deal with other one
32:18 amp beings because that's the only thing
32:20 that you can see with your eyeballs and
32:22 it's the only thing you can feel with
32:23 your hands your planet disk whatever
32:28 your bedroom this microphone is all one
32:31 amp it says all I can interact with but
32:35 because numbers are infinite
32:37 theoretically one point zero zero zero
32:40 zero zero one amp now maybe there's a
32:44 ghost there because I can kind of see it
32:46 but I can't see it can't touch it maybe
32:49 there's a certain threshold of amperage
32:51 I mean this is a bad analogy but there's
32:53 a certain threshold of frequency but you
32:55 have to be a certain next notch over
32:57 before you can see it but it seems to me
32:59 that whatever that if this is true okay
33:02 this may not be [ __ ] but if this is
33:04 true that there are multiple dimensions
33:06 that it seems as if they are all most
33:08 efficiently perfectly separated from
33:10 each other there was an episode of Star
33:12 Trek which was then lifted for fringe
33:16 but it's the mechanism that there was an
33:20 episode where they visited this planet
33:23 yet this was a subplot as a matter of
33:25 fact I believe it's in Voyager and there
33:30 was a I think it was a whole race I
33:32 think it was definitely a person but if
33:35 they got mad in a room everyone else got
33:38 mad in the room if they were happy in
33:40 the room everyone got happy but if there
33:42 was an icky
33:43 motion like you're taking that from me
33:45 don't take that from me and everybody
33:47 would like blow up on each other and get
33:49 mad and punch each other out okay
33:52 so we talked about the black Apple I
33:56 talked about the idea that when you have
34:00 a black Apple habit and for those of you
34:01 haven't seen the episode called the
34:02 black Apple it is about these external
34:05 visions that you adopt as your own
34:08 thoughts but they're not your thoughts
34:09 it's kind of speculative future that
34:13 usually goes negative now if you
34:15 speculate positive it could be that
34:17 they're in even proportions but when you
34:19 specularly positive you've had a good
34:21 day you just feel good right and you
34:23 assume everyone's having a good day and
34:25 then when you talk to someone you assume
34:26 them into a good condition and you have
34:28 a good conversation I like hanging out
34:30 with then they're always making me feel
34:31 better then you have your debbie downer
34:33 that is always where I want you know
34:36 they're always drawing in the worst
34:38 things right which is why it's very
34:41 important to me that you protect your
34:42 children from negativity in from you to
34:46 your kid from the world to your kid and
34:48 you're always asking your child what do
34:50 you want to be when you grow up what do
34:51 you like to do you know what should we
34:53 do today and you let the kid choose
34:55 because the kid is gonna pick something
34:57 cool I know a lot of my friends
35:00 especially rocker buddies of mine that
35:02 had kids later in life and they always
35:05 tell me the same thing they like these
35:06 kids made me younger I was getting old
35:09 but then I took care of this little boy
35:11 or this little girl we built Legos and
35:13 played dolls and whatever it's a big
35:15 tough rocker guy with tattoos all and
35:17 playing dolls you know and it just made
35:19 him younger because the frequency off
35:22 that kid is infecting them and they look
35:26 younger they you know I'm it's like
35:28 crazy you think you don't have the
35:29 energy on man I could never have a kid
35:30 at my age and then boy you have a kid
35:32 and you're like man it saved me you put
35:35 20 years on my life you know so I
35:38 started thinking about this more and
35:39 more especially due to Fringe I don't
35:41 know anything for you but it's all I'll
35:43 say
35:44 and it all starts I dia that like man
35:48 you are we all you know living in this
35:51 multiple dimensional reality and the
35:54 Mandela effect which again a lot of
35:56 people just poo
35:57 Mandela facts because they're scared of
35:59 paranormal realities they're scared of
36:02 things unraveling and being different
36:04 than what they thought it was going to
36:05 be and you know there's definitely fake
36:09 Mandela's and modèle effects that are
36:10 just lapses in history because there's
36:13 like two people who remember it the
36:14 other way but that maybe it's true for
36:17 them don't know but there are millions
36:19 and millions of people that agree one
36:21 way and probably hundreds of millions to
36:23 create one way and then another group of
36:25 the same size goes the other way what I
36:29 really started think to the Mandela
36:30 effect because of the Eli Whitney
36:33 situation the guy that invented the
36:35 cotton gin and me being brought up my
36:39 whole life that he was a black guy and
36:40 everyone I know thought he was a black
36:42 guy and then finding out later he's a
36:45 white guy from Yale University who will
36:48 skull bones activity my mind was blown I
36:51 was like oh my god this is definitely a
36:54 real situation and again I the day I
36:56 found that out for those of you see the
36:58 episode I went to my business partner
37:00 who was 71 at the time and the other guy
37:05 that was probably 55 57 1957 we're in
37:11 this beautiful laboratory it's a bunch
37:14 of LED screens were and we're inventing
37:16 this LED 3d theater which you guys will
37:19 eventually see in your lifetime and I
37:22 can unequivocally tell you hit my
37:23 partner and I put that together it's
37:25 awesome but I said hey guys we heard the
37:29 Mendell effect they go now what is it
37:30 and I said well let me just give you a
37:32 little test here and I got okay and I
37:33 said what do you remember about Eli
37:35 Whitney the guide that made the cotton
37:36 gin and they go I'm looking at them
37:39 across the room I've got my 71 year old
37:41 partner next to me and I got the 57 year
37:45 old guy up at the command center dishing
37:49 out the media and they both said in
37:51 unison well I don't remember much but I
37:56 know he was a black guy I said yeah
38:00 so do i but guess what he's a white guy
38:03 from you three of us born at different
38:06 times different parts of the country I
38:09 mean my buddy was raised in
38:11 hiroshima okay he's a white guy whose
38:14 father was a test pilot the other dude I
38:17 don't even know where he's from he's
38:18 from the Midwest somewhere bounced all
38:20 over the world the ID the IQs in the
38:22 room you know the three of us combined
38:24 it's really high and we all have it
38:26 wrong my family again my great great
38:30 grandfather made an invention based on
38:32 the cotton gin as I was told and the
38:34 irony was that the guy who picked cotton
38:36 solved the problem because he watched
38:39 his hands pulling cotton off of a branch
38:41 and realized that he was taking another
38:42 branch and he was winding it up winding
38:44 up all the cotton on another branch and
38:46 then pushing into his bag and it's that
38:48 what he did it and so they just made a
38:49 machine that did it all right and there
38:54 are other black inventors the people
38:55 said no you know you're thinking about
38:55 that guy and that guy existed too
38:58 exactly the way I remember him but this
39:00 dude was black all right it's all over
39:03 the web in black history months Eli
39:06 Whitney guy created a cotton gin alright
39:09 and there's a ton more so how does this
39:12 happen well I had this previous
39:15 experience my family member going my god
39:17 do you live in another reality that you
39:19 can discern reality it could be or it
39:21 could be just again cowardice so who
39:23 knows hard to tell but I started
39:26 thinking about the Mandela effect just
39:28 being an organic thing it ties into my
39:31 other episode consensus reality which is
39:33 we are all conceding that this is the
39:35 reality that we're in so that adds an
39:41 interesting dimension of reality which
39:44 is like if I can't touch another reality
39:47 because it's on a different frequency
39:49 either above or below the frequency that
39:51 I'm at then how does this history seep
39:54 into this reality and I think
39:58 consistency ality is really where
40:00 Bendele effect is if there's any organic
40:01 nature to it which is sort of a whole
40:03 nother conversation of reality where
40:08 it's not like we didn't exist in their
40:12 dimension and also we came into their
40:13 dimension and said by the way we
40:15 remember things differently like well
40:16 yeah you're not even from our dimension
40:17 oh yeah okay something organic spread
40:20 across that situation if it is indeed
40:22 real
40:23 but there's this conversation which I
40:26 may another episode about which is the
40:28 interdimensional alien theory an SGD sgt
40:32 report just did an episode where they
40:36 were talking about the I'm still
40:39 watching the episode where they talked
40:40 about how aliens are not coming from
40:42 outs outer space they're coming from
40:43 another dimension yeah it sounds good
40:46 sci-fi ish but they're supposedly some
40:48 paperwork that documented this that the
40:51 governments of the world through massive
40:53 observation and putting a lot of money
40:55 into it and kids
40:56 supposedly communicating with these
40:57 individuals that that's sort of the way
40:59 that they were told that this sudden
41:02 appearance of UFOs were happening in how
41:04 they left now they tend to fly up up and
41:07 away write something that's interesting
41:09 so I mean if you're flat earther with a
41:11 dome overhead our firmament water yeah
41:15 what's that what's what are you opposed
41:17 that are going up into the air and
41:18 disappearing all right I got any more
41:22 flutter stuff for a while so I'll start
41:25 thinking if you wanted to build a
41:26 machine that's gonna check this out and
41:30 there's all kinds of movies where they
41:31 create you know dimensional portals to
41:34 go into another dimension so it's like a
41:36 wall that's open and you can go through
41:38 it right not a teleportation necessarily
41:42 it's just ripping a hole between two
41:43 dimensions there's been so many movies
41:45 one of the Doctor Who seasons with Matt
41:48 Smith I think was entirely based on that
41:50 idea with the RIP in the wall season one
41:53 which was brilliant by the way but I you
41:57 would think that you would have to
41:59 control a fairly large amount of energy
42:03 whether it's a big hole or a little hole
42:05 I don't think it really matters but what
42:09 were the big rumors about the CERN
42:10 Hadron Collider they're trying to rip a
42:13 dimensional hole between an evil
42:16 dimension and our world so that the you
42:21 know the God of Darkness or whatever is
42:23 going to come through and then you know
42:25 all these Faust idiots are gonna get
42:28 wiped out they can they're getting some
42:30 oreo cookie and milk reward right so I
42:34 started starting to parse this whole
42:36 thing of
42:37 if you did accelerate protons of all
42:39 things in some giant circle faster and
42:43 faster and faster and faster faster and
42:45 then you collide them together hmm
42:47 does that really spell Anna dimensional
42:50 door hmm I don't know that stopping it
42:54 would would be the way you would do it
42:58 when you just keep it going like a
42:59 Stargate you just keep going and going
43:01 and going and going
43:01 and then stuff starts popping through
43:05 the Hadron colliders been going for what
43:08 a decade and some change now I don't
43:11 know I don't know if we have any more
43:14 darkness that we ever that we've ever
43:16 had in the past that we've had far more
43:19 insane eras of mankind with you know
43:23 massive crusade killings and other just
43:25 bloodbath way before any certain a drunk
43:27 ladder was built so I'm not convinced
43:30 anything's happening there makes really
43:32 no logical sense to me at all but where
43:35 is the common denominator a scientific
43:41 experiment slash maybe category of
43:45 science where you hear about time travel
43:49 teleportation and interdimensional
43:53 science it's usually all surrounding
43:59 electromagnetism electromagnetic waves
44:04 because that is gut it has to be okay
44:08 the most the most unequivocal way to
44:12 start disturbing all the ether winds
44:15 that we are made out of and you know
44:18 it's again it's sort of like that I've
44:21 been using this analogy a lot this
44:22 season but it works great which is you
44:25 know the the bridge back in the 30s it's
44:28 was hit by wind frequency and it flopped
44:31 apart these HAARP antenna of which was
44:36 patented to create earthquakes is based
44:38 on the theory that you throb electricity
44:42 at a plate in the ground and it
44:45 resonates with the plate until
44:47 eventually the plate does what it would
44:48 naturally do which pop
44:50 when it pops you get an earthquake it's
44:52 so it's an amazing weapon because it's
44:54 completely untraceable unless we start
44:57 looking for discharges of HAARP antennas
45:00 which they're built way up in Alaska
45:03 where you got to fly and land to get to
45:04 them right there's no way we can go you
45:07 know binoculars and go oh my god they're
45:09 doing it they're doing it oh it
45:11 discharged no I'm watching it hit the
45:13 ionosphere in a particular direction it
45:15 looks like it's going to south or 80
45:18 degrees or whatever and then all sudden
45:21 there's Fukushima all sudden there's an
45:24 earthquake in Indonesia we don't know
45:26 because we can't track the front -
45:28 because they put it so far out in the
45:30 middle of nowhere
45:31 isn't that weird that where they would
45:34 pick the most hostile expensive location
45:37 to build HAARP go with the California
45:40 desert men it's huge you go out to
45:43 Kansas mow down some grass and some
45:45 wheat fields and just pay the farmer for
45:48 the lease on the land and build these
45:50 antennas so we can all see what's going
45:52 on oh but it's a weapon
45:56 Tesla when he was in his Colorado
45:59 Springs experience I mentioned often
46:00 because I want you to remember the
46:03 Colorado Springs experiment proved there
46:06 was a plasma core to earth and because
46:08 there's a plasma quarter earth we will
46:10 have no problem
46:11 eventually siphoning out of the bowels
46:13 of the earth infinite electricity we
46:16 don't need any power plants we just need
46:19 transmission wires and if we resurrect
46:21 the tower the Tesla's building
46:22 it'll be beamed into our homes totally
46:25 non-lethal my computer will just work
46:28 right there without any plugs in it you
46:30 know the any power supply in it just
46:31 like all Tesla's machines maybe not
46:35 every single one he ever made but the
46:36 ones that Mark Twain kept saying you
46:37 know everything's on and there's no
46:39 wires anywhere but he said that when he
46:43 did his experiment he used two Tesla
46:45 coils one giant one and one small one he
46:48 put I believe the experiment was half an
46:50 amp into the ground and he siphoned out
46:52 infinite energy he had a standing
46:54 lightning bolt for 60 seconds I mean
46:56 let's all be quiet for 60 seconds to
46:59 think about a deafening lightning bolt
47:02 wrapping him
47:03 in electricity and so he's in there it's
47:07 going they're both waiting for it to
47:09 stop but it's not stopping because it's
47:12 infinite so he had his assistant have to
47:14 break the circuit to stop the siphon but
47:19 he said that when he was looking at his
47:20 assistant this is fairly well-documented
47:23 he said assistant looked like he was in
47:25 a different time
47:26 meaning moving a hell of a lot slower
47:28 then he was moving and because he is so
47:33 autistic aliy amazing at seeing
47:36 everything I'm currently reading a book
47:37 that he wrote in 1919 we'll be doing a
47:40 Tesla episode this season he
47:43 meticulously broke things down and
47:44 what's craziest is ADHD analysis of
47:47 things listening to him talk about how
47:51 he sees the world how he parses every
47:53 day I'm sitting there going this is the
47:55 first dude who's ever talking like the
47:57 way I think you know I bet a lot of you
47:59 do too I totally recommend the book you
48:03 don't want to read it just get it on
48:04 audio what was going on the room massive
48:09 electromagnetism and I mean massive
48:12 amounts so he immediately started
48:15 working on that technology is sort of a
48:17 side project you know maybe some
48:19 interdimensional stuff maybe didn't know
48:21 what to call it you know it's just that
48:24 thing that happens the anti-gravity
48:28 engines that were theorized in the
48:31 dozens by the mid-60s here in America
48:34 and around the world were all based on
48:37 electromagnetism controlling the ether
48:42 all winds are on a ship to get it to
48:44 move around Bob Lazar workouts if he
48:47 believes in it and those is what he's
48:49 talking about
48:49 the one thing he keeps describing is an
48:51 ether wind propulsion system using
48:54 antimatter engines all right so what did
48:59 the black apple thing there's nothing
49:02 more than leakage from realities that
49:06 are right in front of us and it's
49:09 informing us backwards because we do
49:11 it's happening at a different time too
49:13 it's happening at the exact time we are
49:14 now
49:15 but it's the worst possible choice that
49:18 we could do with our life and one of us
49:20 is doing it in fact infinite amounts of
49:23 us are doing everything horrible that
49:24 could happen next
49:25 you're being suspicious you're you're
49:28 getting angry and then what if you had
49:31 PTSD stuck in you as well a horrific
49:35 event that you've forgotten but you
49:37 still the trauma in your system so now
49:40 you're trying to pick the best second in
49:41 front of you but because you have a
49:43 predisposition of an unsorted
49:46 unrecognized event your history your
49:49 subconscious is tuned to the bad from
49:52 time to time as you have swells of it
49:54 come and go right go see my episode on
49:58 PTSD for help with that but it really
50:01 does start to explain some of the
50:05 anomalies that we never talk about why
50:08 is that person who's always chipper and
50:11 always happy always winning costly never
50:15 gets sick never gained a pound always
50:17 employed best-looking husband
50:19 best-looking wife best-looking kids
50:20 smartest kids every opportunity falls in
50:23 their lap maybe it's because they are
50:27 just a tuning fork to that frequency and
50:31 as they pick the next second in this
50:33 infinite infinitely dense sphere of
50:36 possibilities that's the one they pick
50:39 so now think about this and I've
50:42 mentioned this in other episodes but
50:45 well it's it's hard for me to talk about
50:48 us tapping into another dimension where
50:50 all sudden people start to show up in
50:52 our world that you know like someone
50:54 else rented this house an infinite
50:55 amount of times and I don't live here
50:59 and so maybe one dude who's like
51:03 insomnia Q sitting on this porch at a
51:05 different time and all sudden I see the
51:08 guy he looks over and sees me like oh ho
51:12 and then we both fade away from each
51:13 other's world because the vibrational
51:14 anomaly of the universe you know resets
51:18 itself or rebalances itself but imagine
51:21 we we start creating these engines we
51:26 start playing in again top secret
51:28 laboratories that would have you and
51:30 imagine they just they just create like
51:34 a Stargate but it's really tiny on a
51:35 table I mean the three three feet in
51:38 diameter or something and they just
51:39 start winding up a bunch of
51:41 electromagnetic frequencies for all
51:43 different directions
51:45 spoiled around the Stargate going in a
51:48 straight line around the Stargate are
51:51 going to circle you know around it and
51:53 they just keep looking and looking and
51:54 looking and eventually through just
51:57 sheer computer control on the
51:59 frequencies everything that could
52:01 possibly happening low frequency high
52:03 frequency agitated frequency sake of
52:05 geometry frequencies the whole sudden
52:07 they look through and they see a whole
52:08 other world maybe they see the one that
52:12 they're in but it's a few minutes later
52:14 and once you have that little clue oh my
52:17 god if you were a scientist and you were
52:19 treading create product a and you just
52:22 have to be playing with light or
52:23 magnetism because that's sort of the
52:24 basis of the product you're trying to
52:26 improve or create but then you see like
52:30 another dimension through this hole and
52:31 you're like oh [ __ ]
52:33 I don't think I'm making a TV 2.0
52:36 anymore I think I'm making whatever this
52:38 thing is and then you start incubating
52:40 it up people find out you do it and they
52:44 put a lot of money behind you and kick
52:46 you out the project or suck you in for
52:48 the rest of your life the guy in Coral
52:50 Castle had a magnetic wheel I don't
52:54 think he was dealing with anything
52:55 interdimensional but it created his
52:58 power source why else would he have the
52:59 thing and he always one thing all these
53:03 people say he was always going in here
53:04 and winding that thing up and he had
53:05 powerful in a while and he'd do it again
53:07 so a little interesting we want control
53:11 over our lives at the most fundamental
53:14 level that we discern as our
53:19 participation in our choices we do not
53:22 want complete control over our autonomic
53:25 health system we don't want to have to
53:27 think about every breath but now that I
53:30 just told you about thinking about
53:31 breathing for the next 60 seconds you're
53:33 gonna think about breathing we
53:35 definitely don't want to control all the
53:36 atoms in the universe whatever they're
53:39 made out of we want the universe to be
53:41 on autopilot
53:42 based on hopefully rules that we can
53:45 learn such that we don't you know walk
53:48 into a fire that wasn't there before
53:49 right the interesting thing about the
53:53 higgs boson particle was the whole
53:56 argument about a stable universe
53:59 singular universe or a multiverse and so
54:03 when they found the Higgs boson particle
54:04 directly in between the two theorized
54:07 frequencies I mean you knew you were
54:09 being had man give me a break
54:12 they just wanted to give that guy
54:14 because one of them's dead ones alive so
54:16 that I think it's Higgs that was alive
54:18 if they want to give him the prize the
54:21 Nobel Prize for this whole thing and
54:22 just basically create a success story
54:24 for the CERN Hadron Collider which was
54:26 having all kinds of delays and problems
54:28 so they needed to have a press moment so
54:30 I used to invent this particle and say
54:31 it's there and then just kind of hedged
54:34 their bets put it in between I assure
54:37 you in your future you will find out
54:38 that that's all fake not that it really
54:41 dictates much but the multiverse theory
54:44 for these gullible physicists who built
54:48 this thing there's a documentary with
54:50 the two guys who helped perfect what
54:54 frequency each one of the theorized
54:56 particles would show up or the Higgs
54:57 boson would show up at one again being
54:59 very stable when being very unstable
55:02 because it was halfway towards the
55:05 unstable one the guy who had the stable
55:06 Theory wrote a article was interviewed
55:09 several times he's like I'm really
55:11 concerned why you concern because the
55:14 whole universe could come unraveled at
55:16 any minute it's much more fragile than
55:17 we ever thought drama drama drama grant
55:20 grant grant guy never has to get a real
55:22 [ __ ] job in his life right
55:24 unbelievable
55:25 nice maybe we all picked the wrong jobs
55:27 it just reminds me of that scene in
55:29 history of the world part one where Bill
55:33 Brooks walks up to was it Maude Harris
55:35 said her name and she's the unemployment
55:38 office in Rome back in Caesars day and
55:41 he has to go get his unemployment he's
55:42 dressed like a you know average Roman
55:44 citizen she's the same on the other side
55:46 she said behind this window with like
55:49 the little cutout and he and he goes he
55:52 goes next and he's like okay what's your
55:55 job and he go
55:56 stand-up philosopher and she says she
56:00 you see her sigh like oh my god like
56:01 that's a real job and she was okay did
56:03 you [ __ ] today and Mel Brooks goes
56:06 no and she goes well did you try to
56:09 [ __ ] today yes you know it was just
56:12 a brilliant summation of a lot of folks
56:17 that hide in academics you know God
56:20 bless them some of them like a like a
56:22 Marshall McLuhan or Jean Baudrillard
56:26 the real deal guys man they're super
56:28 natural human beings that thought on a
56:30 level that forgot to wait another
56:32 hundred years for a couple more of those
56:33 guys so the reason I mentioned that
56:37 stability instability thing is that yeah
56:40 I don't know about you but my entire
56:42 life it's been very stable you know I
56:44 haven't had I haven't turned into a frog
56:46 and turned back into a human I haven't
56:48 had my car turned into a blow-up doll
56:50 and then back into a car so things are
56:53 pretty stable so I don't think we have
56:56 anything to worry about with the
56:57 operating system of the universe and
56:59 like I always say I want you to remember
57:01 that a program that is perfect is by
57:06 definition a program that is true right
57:09 so when we feel and we are that program
57:12 too right we're just as perfect as
57:15 everything whether or not we just you
57:17 know in pick like ethical things or
57:21 moral things it's all relative man right
57:24 to us but we still are who we are
57:27 Hitler never spontaneously combusted to
57:33 the demise and and disappointment of
57:35 several people right so my question is
57:38 at this deeper phase of the episode are
57:42 there elements of our inspiration like I
57:45 was saying seeing echoes from a from a
57:48 parallel universe that is the black
57:50 Apple and if we are allowing the put it
57:55 into real terms here if we allow the
57:58 ruling class of this world to destroy
58:01 the world and I don't mean Death Star
58:04 destroyed
58:05 I mean wars wars wars economic bust bust
58:08 bust bad education
58:10 answer divorce your spouse whenever
58:13 there's a bad problem in life then work
58:15 anything out
58:16 no one ever dies married anymore that
58:19 kind of world and there's political
58:23 paradigms on top of that there's racial
58:25 paradigms on top without their sexual
58:27 orientation paradigms on top of that
58:29 it's just getting worse and worse and
58:30 worse I think we had racism fairly well
58:33 under control and now it's sort out of
58:35 control again sorta at least in the
58:38 press the fake news so if we are
58:41 inspired by echoes of parallel universes
58:44 because of this inner dimension ality of
58:46 our actual existence then it's
58:52 imperative that we reset the planet that
58:56 purging these negative people it's real
58:59 important but now the question always
59:02 comes up that's like okay like I just
59:05 told you if Tesla and everyone back
59:10 before him in electronics knew about
59:12 ether and they shut it off for us in the
59:15 school don't even teach us Tesla ever
59:18 existed I mean how he never killed
59:21 anybody he never necessarily backstabbed
59:25 anybody he just was this dude on his own
59:27 creating all this wild stuff but it was
59:28 always a threat to those who wanted to
59:30 charge money for everything and control
59:31 us right he was trying to create the
59:34 death ray to stop all wars well that
59:38 guys against the bankers don't even
59:39 teach anybody he exists meanwhile he was
59:43 hitting homeruns like Babe Ruth on a
59:46 repeat loop right so what if they knew
59:50 this what if they knew there's a warrant
59:53 we live in their lap of luxury you know
59:55 we get to read kids and have st. nasty
59:58 parties with Gwen Stefani right and Will
60:01 Ferrell they're choosing the best
60:04 seconds because that's all they know and
60:06 whatever satanic second they want to
60:09 choose they still love it it's whatever
60:10 they want to choose but we're sitting
60:12 down here eating the scraps of their
60:14 evil fighting among each other getting
60:17 divided up by theories paradigms
60:21 hmm so I kind of want to always
60:26 encourage you folks and again I'm
60:27 speaking an idealistic goal of which
60:30 even I obviously being human as you
60:33 struggle to achieve at least you know
60:35 I'm struggling to achieve it I'm
60:38 struggling every day to go I used to
60:40 really think really super negative
60:41 thoughts about that but now I'm kind of
60:43 alright I'm seeing it from their
60:45 perspective a lot more because I'm
60:46 getting more mature with my age right
60:48 thank God that happens with age Jesus I
60:50 you know I always I was always told that
60:52 one gets real cynical as one gets older
60:54 and that's a slippery slope that's easy
60:57 to fall down but I'm fighting it because
61:00 I don't want to turn into that a crabby
61:01 old bastard no one's gonna want to take
61:03 care of a bastard right I just won't do
61:07 it plus I just have a mantra in life of
61:09 trying to be cool and relaxed you know
61:11 and you know they're not gonna hit
61:15 practice makes perfect if you don't
61:16 practice it what's gonna happen to you
61:18 what's the opposite of perfect so I'd be
61:21 interested in your knowledge about this
61:24 your opinions about this again the more
61:26 detailed you get the better and by the
61:29 way we've had some of the most amazing
61:31 comments in this last seven days this is
61:34 um this is November 20th so the week
61:39 before this man I just had some cool
61:42 comments about someone explained the the
61:47 phone issue I mentioned where the phone
61:50 kept falling on the ground my am I being
61:51 psychic episode a great explanation of
61:54 this other race of beings that I guess
61:57 are well-known among certain people and
61:59 they have these missions that go on now
62:02 whether or not that's true or not
62:03 doesn't even matter it was so cool
62:06 someone chimed in today and said that
62:08 they have experimented with gravity
62:10 using five ton ingots of lead with a 1
62:17 gram of platonow up play diem and
62:23 couldn't find any influence of the big
62:26 ingot 5 ton engine on this little tiny
62:29 particle and so was one Graham thing and
62:32 he was well within the range that should
62:34 start influencing
62:35 relative some pull towards the ingot
62:37 because it was so damn much right my
62:40 physics teacher in school told me once
62:43 which I I cringed a little bit when he
62:46 said it but he goes whoa talking about
62:49 gravity and he said well you know when
62:51 you get passed by a big semi on our
62:55 little two-lane roads in Kansas he goes
62:57 don't you feel the gargle wham towards
62:59 there towards the he goes well he goes a
63:01 bunch of that is wind the majority of
63:03 that force is wind of course but he goes
63:05 there's a fair amount as gravity as well
63:08 yeah I don't know that gravity has that
63:10 much of a pull and and I'm not talking
63:12 about the phenomenon gravity that we
63:15 know is all [ __ ] we're talking about
63:16 your theory of gravity why we're held to
63:19 this plant sunny we were getting some
63:23 really good things but yeah if you have
63:25 seen videos or read books about this
63:27 definitely Lincoln below what I really
63:30 want to know is if we were to being
63:33 again have the deep thoughts radio
63:34 college and we had this division that's
63:38 going to look for interdimensional
63:39 existence and again we have to start
63:41 from a completely shrouded pass because
63:43 I'm not sharing any of their information
63:46 what experiments would you do to try and
63:50 see this other dimension have you ever
63:52 seen something that makes you believe
63:54 there is one and you know paranormal is
63:56 definitely a whole realm which is
63:58 potentially another dimension I don't
64:00 know how to be very frank with you you
64:06 know a spirit coming into your world and
64:08 saying hello and whatever way they do it
64:10 mind's eye apparition in the room if
64:13 they exist I think there's a million
64:15 ways to explain that I mean they're very
64:16 intentional ways that they can vibrate
64:18 you know just II throw winds I can just
64:22 vibrate the ether winds in your room and
64:23 they're gonna create a photonic
64:25 wave a verb right which is a photon and
64:28 you start seeing this little apparition
64:31 of the room so that's that's pretty good
64:32 now the weird Michael Jackson one where
64:34 the shadow walks by my god what a
64:37 stretch man but the other one is you
64:40 know like we sing Walt Disney or my
64:41 grandmother right after she passed you
64:45 know those are in my mind's eye they're
64:46 not in
64:47 the world that anyone can see there in
64:49 me so I don't know how is that happening
64:51 it's not happening on my on my visual
64:54 cortex it's happening in some other
64:56 dimension of my third eye perceiving
64:58 reality what the dude was you know both
65:01 of them talked to me both of them told
65:03 me something very important I didn't
65:05 know my grandmother was ill enough to
65:06 die and she said she had already died
65:08 and went to the side and then two
65:09 o'clock I got the call which is two
65:11 hours after I woke up and my mom's
65:13 telling me how her mom passed I was like
65:15 oh [ __ ]
65:15 but she came to me today and then Walt
65:18 pointing me directly to Bob ger at the
65:20 park okay that's oh that's pretty
65:25 you know something else going on folks
65:28 so how would you build that wing but we
65:32 need obviously we we could go to the
65:35 equipment route you know the and there's
65:38 other research programs I should
65:40 probably mention too which we all know
65:42 about which is if someone really showed
65:45 super psychic capabilities of any kind
65:50 you would imagine and we've heard about
65:52 these programs where the intelligence
65:54 agencies have funded multiple billions
65:57 of dollars of research into remote
65:59 viewing which I've only episode on and
66:02 you know anyone who shows paranormal
66:04 capabilities they bring them in they
66:06 find them they hear the rumor about them
66:08 and they send black suits down they go
66:09 grab them and you know they do treat
66:11 them with the velvet glove treatment so
66:15 that they they're not traumatized the
66:20 I'm gonna try to do an episode on
66:22 telekinesis I don't know if I can pull
66:24 it off for an entire hour but you know
66:26 I've seen videos of guys doing things
66:29 and of course the skeptic Society guy
66:30 busted a bunch of them and it's almost
66:33 he's busted so many of them you know
66:35 okay some trick we don't know how the
66:37 trick works but they're doing
66:38 heavy breathing on objects they they
66:43 just do all kinds of wild techniques the
66:44 guy it was the famous one from the
66:46 that's incredible show back in the day
66:49 it was the white guy just like a ninja
66:52 some like martial arts looking guy hit
66:55 like Spock hair he was a white guy and
66:58 his whole thing was he lay a phonebook
67:00 on the
67:01 the table and he would think about it
67:04 and think about it and then he would
67:05 kneel down and move his hand and a whole
67:07 page would flip over and a skeptics guy
67:11 so brilliant an expedition he goes ah
67:14 man that's an old parlor trick and he
67:16 goes watch and he is what the guy is
67:19 doing is he's lining himself up with the
67:21 page perfectly with his nasal cavity and
67:24 as he brings himself down he's bringing
67:27 a wave of wind with his body and then
67:30 he's exhaling an exact point where it
67:32 gets underneath the page and flips it
67:33 over and he did it and you're like oh my
67:36 god Wow look like magic a second ago
67:38 look like supernatural and just some
67:40 little parlor trick but there's a lot of
67:43 like carnival type shows where they'll
67:46 you know back in the was at the Dust
67:51 Bowl era and even in the 1800s
67:53 you know these circus owners would hear
67:57 about a rumor of some kid in the you
67:59 know the back in the Ozarks or something
68:01 has got some capability and they track
68:03 him down and try to get him in the show
68:05 you know whether it be a trick or not
68:07 they don't even care so maybe there's
68:09 some solicitation for folks almost like
68:11 an American Idol audition where we're
68:13 like okay if you think you got something
68:14 you can recreate just know you're gonna
68:17 be surrounded by scientists no you're
68:19 gonna be surrounded by skeptic society
68:21 people or form of magicians and every
68:23 trick in the book
68:24 so if you're coming in pulling off some
68:26 stunts you better be really good and
68:30 otherwise you know we want to know if
68:32 you really have this capability and the
68:35 other one is astral projection which you
68:41 sort of loosen your soul from your body
68:43 and you astral project and I have so
68:45 many friends that will say I studied
68:48 astral projection and then immediately
68:49 was able to do it
68:51 and I'm sitting there counting on really
68:54 you just read a book about seeing ghosts
68:55 and all sudden you see him that's pretty
68:57 amazing right for me well then I was
69:00 trying to tell another friend of mine I
69:02 said look in my dreams as of right now
69:06 in my life are there alternate realities
69:10 I mean I they're not this reality I mean
69:12 in terms of like feely touchies if five
69:14 senses
69:15 but boy take away the senses that you
69:18 don't get in a dream but the the linear
69:21 Ness
69:22 of my dreams are it's it's like picard
69:25 in the episode in Star Trek we get
69:28 sucked into it to a probe and must have
69:31 lived like 50 years in this other world
69:32 and then pop back in his body was only
69:35 gone like 30 seconds but he just lived
69:37 50 years and he had a really detox out
69:40 of that whole thing he had a whole
69:41 different wife and kids and he was a
69:43 grandfather and all this that planet was
69:45 exploded and was this message in a
69:47 bottle basically sort of was brilliant
69:49 when I go to bed I dream the other day
69:53 that I was standing in line at like a
69:56 soup like a like a Walmart kind of store
69:58 it wasn't Walmart but it was like a
69:59 really cool store with all kinds of wild
70:01 stuff and I'm standing in line the whole
70:02 time with friends and I'm talking to
70:04 them and we're advancing slowly through
70:06 the line and it's like you know it was
70:09 real time they even got up when the
70:11 restroom came back went right back in
70:13 the dream now I'm in the parking lot
70:14 we're all chilling out and you know the
70:17 fashion was amazing like everybody's
70:19 clothing was really cool and the cars
70:20 were really cool it was like what am i
70:23 doing like am i sensing it another
70:27 dimension of life that I have actually
70:29 lived at maybe this exact timetable but
70:32 the whole world went a different route
70:33 and it's much better and euphoric
70:35 because that's the world I love to dream
70:37 about so when I get out of this world
70:39 and I put my head down on my pillow I
70:41 just immediately floated into that world
70:43 because that's where I want to be and
70:45 you know why do you take negative things
70:48 from your dreams or sorry from your life
70:50 into your dreams you might have a
70:51 frustration dream if you've had a
70:52 problem you haven't solved in this with
70:55 this particular world what if it's all
70:57 just frequencies man you're just taking
71:00 the square peg and putting it in a
71:04 square hole but if you made it a round
71:06 peg before you went to bed you'd have a
71:07 round dream you know I'm saying so I'm
71:12 trying to sift through things that we
71:15 just take for granted because nothing is
71:17 just happening for granted this world
71:20 doesn't exist for granted I don't give a
71:23 [ __ ] what you believe about how the
71:25 world shaped or evolution versus
71:27 creationism
71:28 matter this place exists and it's pretty
71:31 intentional at least it is for us from
71:34 our perspective right you're
71:38 intentionally listening to me right now
71:40 everything about that you know and so I
71:44 am glad that we can send this through a
71:46 camera and share experiences I would
71:50 tell you this before I close off if we
71:53 ever did get to create our at little
71:54 university the first thing I would do is
71:57 have someone write a piece of software
71:59 if it doesn't already exist and drag
72:01 every single comment out of YouTube and
72:03 then the first team that creates the
72:06 universe that he's gonna comb through
72:09 all the comments and take anything it's
72:12 been intelligently put together that has
72:14 a you know a thread someplace else you
72:17 should read this book I had this
72:18 experience and it's super detailed and
72:20 that's just what we'd forged the first
72:22 objectives out of it would be all your
72:24 comments cuz boy it's it's just a
72:27 treasure trove let me tell you just
72:29 getting better every day and I will say
72:32 for those of you there's a couple of you
72:34 out there that are going back and
72:37 watching all the old episodes I can see
72:39 you marathoning through them and there's
72:42 one of you you know you are and you're
72:44 tough just posting tons and tons of
72:46 comments the comments are very heavy
72:49 right now and all that you don't see
72:51 them all but I get you know every single
72:53 one of them put in this feed man it's
72:55 like it's everything I can do just to
72:58 read them once let alone reply to you
73:00 guys so if you're feeling like you're
73:03 owed or response the answer is yes you
73:05 are owed a response
73:06 I'm trying to get in there and do that
73:08 for those of you just drop compliments
73:10 here and there you know I'm you know how
73:12 it works you I don't you know i'm i
73:15 really i'm reluctant to go thank you
73:17 thank you thank you thank you thank you
73:18 and all of them but that's how I feel so
73:20 if I thumb your comment up I haven't
73:22 said this in a while that's my thank you
73:24 number one but I'll do like every third
73:27 one or so and especially if someone
73:29 seems like they're brand new to the
73:30 channel man I've never been here before
73:31 this is really cool I usually drop that
73:33 person you know personal note just to
73:35 say thank you so much for visiting that
73:37 sort of things so it's cool but
73:39 definitely dig in man because it's you
73:41 know
73:41 find the subjects that you dig and
73:43 that's where we get to deep thoughts
73:44 radio calm because that is the that's
73:47 the cornerstone of the entire pyramid
73:49 it's the pyramidion sitting at the top
73:51 of our awesome truth pyramid someone
73:54 asked me today if I was a freemason I
73:56 want to answer the pub answer the
73:58 question publicly it's sort of a funny
74:00 question absolutely not but I did find
74:04 out when I was my early 40s that my
74:07 grandfather and I actually should have
74:10 known this because his grave has the
74:13 Masonic you know thing on it because
74:16 every old man in my hometown we had a
74:18 Masonic Lodge down the street and I have
74:20 really no idea whatever went on and he's
74:22 in that lab and in the lodge there was
74:24 never any bad rumors about the place
74:26 they would raise money for kids
74:28 hospitals and that kind of stuff so it's
74:30 probably the underlying good guys down
74:32 below but he was in the Freemasons and
74:36 the fact there's a pentagram
74:39 I think I'm my grandmother sigh would
74:41 you like oh geez and she knew that was
74:43 there he died way before she died so he
74:46 dead at 59 I think she died
74:49 83 but yeah not a freemason not gonna
74:55 join my neighbor across the street
74:57 joined the lodge the Elks Lodge and he
74:59 they've come over several times and said
75:01 man we know you we know the
75:04 conversations you have he goes man we
75:05 have these kind of lame conversations
75:07 you should really join cuz you really
75:08 spice up the conversation I'm kind of
75:10 like man if my listeners found out I
75:12 joined any of these places I'd be killed
75:15 so I'm just I got my own brain I'm gonna
75:18 stick with it it does fascinate me what
75:21 goes on in those places but anyway back
75:23 to the website there's a search field
75:24 that's the first cool thing you can do
75:26 is type in whatever word you're
75:27 interested in there's probably more than
75:29 one video about it but this category
75:31 list I don't mention every single time
75:33 but there's like moon episodes you know
75:36 again the moon episodes are the most
75:37 popular ones there's all my dream
75:39 episodes we don't learn how to write
75:40 screen plays get into that I guarantee
75:43 you my screenplay episodes have all the
75:45 stuff you never hear from Hollywood and
75:47 it's not in any of the books or if
75:49 you're going to get them up from all the
75:50 books that I own out of 30 books
75:54 I'm probably contributing at least 1/3
75:56 more than all the books that I own which
75:59 is the reality of the job there are two
76:02 feeds for video one is YouTube of course
76:05 then one is bit shoot and I'm stopping
76:07 for bid shoots you guys understand it is
76:10 the competitor to YouTube with no First
76:13 Amendment problems ok so please go over
76:17 to [ __ ] you can create an account if
76:18 you know the link to the channel is
76:21 right there for my site if you're on
76:23 YouTube you don't need to watch anything
76:25 I pitched you but please make a
76:27 subscription over there if you could
76:30 just subscribe to the channel before you
76:31 leave that'd be great because I think it
76:33 ups my rank or whatever and being shown
76:35 on the front page of whatever but it's
76:37 growing it's cool there's plenty of
76:40 links for the podcast just get over
76:42 there with your favorite device it'll
76:43 link up just beautifully there are three
76:46 social media outlets the first one that
76:49 I always love to talk about is the
76:51 locked Facebook group it's locked
76:53 because we have to keep out all the
76:54 trolls and your employers and people you
76:57 don't want to see your open mind you
76:59 know but we have just the greatest group
77:01 of people I mean it's certified every
77:04 day you know our membership is actually
77:06 not going up that much so I assume that
77:08 everybody wants to get in is in and I
77:10 understand if you hate first book I
77:12 understand the other ones twitter
77:15 twitter is actually picking up traction
77:17 a lot of retweets from folks I super
77:18 appreciate that as well and then the
77:22 competitor to Facebook which is mine's
77:23 calm just like Facebook except for way
77:27 prettier a lot more features and it's
77:30 all blockchain as I understand it so
77:32 that's super cool so I put all the
77:34 episodes up there as well the other
77:37 category of links is the the donation
77:40 capabilities patreon is pretty much
77:42 stated ten sponsors that got $34 so to
77:46 all 10 of you you're in the credits
77:48 thank you so much but anyone who's ever
77:49 contributed in the credits there's some
77:51 people that somehow got on the patreon
77:54 list but they never donate any money so
77:56 I don't know how that works but if you
77:58 get on patreon you get these episodes a
77:59 little bit ahead of everybody else at
78:03 least 80% of time usually
78:05 the other one is PayPal directs and
78:08 again we've had a few contributors thank
78:09 you so much and the other two products I
78:12 want you to have one to cut off the deep
78:14 state which is get off Chrome get off
78:16 face era Facebook Firefox get under
78:19 brave browser change your search engine
78:22 to DuckDuckGo it's getting so popular
78:25 it's getting a little slow which I'm
78:26 willing to wait but no one tracks your
78:28 stuff and brave knocks out all the deep
78:31 state it's beautiful
78:32 if you want to believe you got a VPN
78:34 protection go ahead and do that there
78:36 was an article released the queue linked
78:39 to today on the BBC website which is
78:42 proving what I would keep telling all my
78:44 closest friends the pretty good
78:45 protection PGP to protection is [ __ ]
78:49 okay you are not safe sending any
78:53 information over the Internet
78:54 period I don't give a [ __ ] what your
78:57 hacker friend told you if you transmit a
78:59 packet in United States of America and
79:01 the NSA cannot crack that packet within
79:03 seconds you're gonna have black coats at
79:06 your house and they are going to [ __ ]
79:09 you up so just have fun with that
79:11 because it's a felony that you know
79:12 you're it's a law
79:13 you don't even aware of but that law has
79:15 been in effect as of the mid-90s okay I
79:18 got friends you kind of laugh at that
79:20 and I'm like okay dude
79:22 travel at your own risk if they're not
79:24 getting you and you think you're
79:25 committing a crime well they know you're
79:26 committing the crime there's something
79:27 got down to your level yet so brace
79:29 yourself the other one is Backblaze
79:31 backup software I saw this as an
79:33 affiliate off of either sgt or maybe in
79:37 pursuit of truth or something like that
79:39 probably sgt great software seven bucks
79:42 a month infinite backup for two
79:44 computers get it it's awesome beefed up
79:47 your connection at your house uploads
79:49 more important and your download for
79:50 that particular product of course i have
79:52 a three hundred mega bit up and down
79:53 from frontier and it's awesome and last
79:58 but not least there is an all-new
80:00 remastered season one so if you're
80:02 looking for season one episodes on this
80:04 channel you're gonna see it start at 101
80:07 the reason for that is i use a bunch of
80:09 proprietary music they struck them out
80:12 for all kinds of stupid reasons so i
80:14 remastered them all made them better
80:16 balance the audio fixed a bunch of
80:18 pauses
80:19 and um zand throat-clearing and all that
80:21 other crap so some of the episodes are
80:23 damn near Tim and it's faster than they
80:24 used to be those are all linked also on
80:26 the website so if you want to just find
80:28 the episodes that are all open and ready
80:30 to go just go to the website and
80:31 download it's cool anyway until the next
80:35 episode take care of yourself and
80:37 someone else in this dimension that
80:39 we're in and I'll see you in the next
80:40 deep thoughts over now
