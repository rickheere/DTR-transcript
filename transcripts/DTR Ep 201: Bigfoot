00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:34 deep thoughts today we're going to talk
00:37 about a subject that I get requested and
00:39 prob about every half year and I've
00:44 thought about doing this for quite a
00:45 while the main reason why I've delayed
00:47 is that it doesn't interest me that much
00:50 however I think I've now kind of thought
00:53 it through a little bit on how to add
00:55 something else to it we have all these
00:59 things that go around civilization all
01:03 these stories and all these beliefs and
01:06 what's interesting is is they're luring
01:09 enough to stay in the I guess in the
01:13 current of man's consciousness but
01:16 what's fascinating is that there are so
01:19 many they'd never get it analyzed beyond
01:23 just sort of an ankle deep dive into the
01:28 subject matter and Bigfoot is one of
01:31 those things we have held this belief
01:35 for so long and even the deepest studies
01:40 that I have seen by anthropologist who
01:42 have made three-hour videos on this
01:43 stuff essentially filming a lecture it's
01:48 amazing how even in some of their most
01:51 brilliant dives into this and I'll try
01:54 to repeat some of the ones that have
01:55 really impressed me
01:57 no one goes back to the inception of
02:00 what we're really insinuating by saying
02:02 if these things exist I mean really
02:06 exist what would that mean what what
02:10 would it mean for them to survive the
02:12 annals of time
02:13 what would it mean for them to be out
02:16 there right now and what would it mean
02:21 if we found them because you know we
02:24 talk about aliens a lot on this show and
02:26 I feel like well that makes sense an
02:28 alien if you go see the movie the
02:29 episode I made called alien promise any
02:32 of the alien episodes there's a lot to
02:37 the concept of an alien arriving right
02:40 but Bigfoot we're talking about maybe if
02:45 all the cartoony Hollywood portrayals of
02:49 bigfooter are a hundred percent correct
02:52 you've got this sort of tame you know
02:57 guy from the Goonies and you're going to
03:02 somehow have you know and afternoon
03:05 lunch with them in the canyon or in the
03:07 forest so let's review sort of the
03:11 pop-culture version of the story then
03:14 we'll try to dive down into the
03:15 anthropological insinuations of his
03:18 existence some of the imperative facts
03:22 that they suggest so a face value there
03:27 is this neat belief and sort of a
03:30 ghostly character that lives in the
03:32 woods and the forests of the United
03:34 States of America and other similar
03:35 terrains I don't believe it's ever been
03:38 sighted in the deserts it's always got
03:41 some lush green which you know
03:44 considering how much we're shutting that
03:45 [ __ ] down you know if you ever go in
03:48 your attic and start moving stuff around
03:50 or you're deconstructing doing a demo on
03:54 a home or something you'll bump into
03:57 little nests right of things that you
03:59 didn't know we're there bumblebee nests
04:01 The Lost nest you know something else
04:03 gross and you'd think that with all the
04:06 deforestation that's going on in the
04:08 United States of America and abroad that
04:11 you bump right into a Bigfoot you know
04:14 harem or something no such claim right
04:18 but the idea is that there's this
04:20 massive population of hominid / Yeti
04:26 species that are out there and again
04:28 we'll go scientific in the next second
04:29 here but it's out there they have this
04:34 really SuperDuper thick coat of fur on
04:38 them like a bear but it almost seems
04:41 like per capita of square footage on
04:43 their body
04:43 that they are more hairy than anything
04:47 in the forest besides perhaps like a dog
04:52 whereas you know a bear actually you
04:55 know has some some shorter hair in the
04:57 in the face region thus allowing its
05:00 contours to come out so we can see its
05:01 eyes clearly its nose clearly its teeth
05:04 but every time we see any one attempting
05:08 to film our claim that they have filmed
05:11 a Bigfoot it is sort of that silly
05:15 costume where the the designer just kept
05:19 putting you know werewolf face hair on
05:22 it to the point you look straight at it
05:23 in the face and you can't make out any
05:24 features I've never seen any features
05:27 and I've seen quite a few of these first
05:30 a lot of them have turned out to be
05:31 hoaxes but but just at face value you
05:36 have individuals in the forest who come
05:39 back and claim they film Bigfoot now
05:44 let's look at some of the sightings over
05:46 the years you know you have the initial
05:50 sightings were sort of extremely distant
05:54 well I would say you know compared to a
05:56 normal shot of someone you would take
05:58 saying cheese fairly good distance away
06:01 give you a couple hundred yards and they
06:06 walk across some terrain they give a
06:09 little bit of a look and they walk into
06:11 the forest and you know obviously with
06:16 little bit better equipment you have
06:17 individuals now analyzing every single
06:19 frame of the super aged super you know
06:21 16 cameras and insinuating that that the
06:27 pixel data means something more every
06:30 year right you know at first it was did
06:32 meet anything a lot of the tissue
06:35 movement or the fur movement on the
06:37 outside of being and now in the last
06:39 five years or so they're now saying oh
06:41 that's subdermal muscle tissue and see
06:44 how it it does indicate that this is a
06:46 real leg of a giant beast because you
06:49 know you couldn't possibly fake such a
06:51 thing in a costume and you know in some
06:54 some perspectives they seem very
06:57 convincing you're right you know big guy
06:59 inside of a hairy costume is going to
07:02 look silly no matter how much he or she
07:04 tries to imitate some sort of monkey
07:08 because we aren't monkeys unless you've
07:11 you know we're trained by some mime
07:14 company in Paris you're not going to
07:15 have specific know-how about how that
07:18 works right you know that super
07:21 convincing one in 1967 or you know a
07:25 couple guys took a shot of this thing
07:26 walking sort of through some driftwood
07:29 area off of Beach right into the some
07:32 extreme coasts right into the forest
07:36 that's been the one that's lasted the
07:38 longest and then for several decades
07:42 after that one particular moving shot we
07:44 had these still shots big creature
07:49 walking in a particularly remote area of
07:52 the world and then we crossed into the
07:56 21st century now all of a sudden we have
08:02 a new twist to the formula we have let's
08:06 do it with infrared cameras a lot of
08:09 hunters you know put these cameras in
08:10 the forest I could kind of see what the
08:13 movements are or whatever some of them
08:17 are just you know Forest Commission
08:18 people looking at what the traffic is
08:20 population-wise of a particular animal
08:22 to see if they need anything about it
08:26 but now we've got the cub that's the new
08:29 one it would have forgot not only the
08:33 Bigfoot but we got her cub because they
08:36 theorized the one at 67 was a female
08:38 you know suggesting had boobs and that
08:40 kind of stuff I think that's fairly
08:44 interesting because I think of a bunch
08:45 of guys work to fake a Bigfoot sighting
08:48 in 1967 the last thing they would say is
08:51 let's make it a chick
08:53 right it's not gonna happen but I look
08:55 at that shot and you know and again it's
08:57 just sort of like looking at the moon
08:59 and theorizing that every bump and nuke
09:02 and cranny up there's a Space Station
09:04 yeah I didn't see any tits on this thing
09:07 but you know maybe I just don't know
09:09 enough about Bigfoot taxidermy
09:12 consequently the the name Bigfoot is
09:15 sort of a weird evolution in chain of
09:18 events in the late 19th century you have
09:21 a Native American name chief Bigfoot I
09:24 guess was notorious for trying to chase
09:27 a grizzly bear in the area that was
09:31 killing tons of wildlife and they ended
09:35 up calling the bear Bigfoot after chief
09:37 Bigfoot and then within five or 10 years
09:41 the first reporting's of these giant
09:43 Yeti things were being passed around
09:46 campfires and someone started calling it
09:48 Bigfoot
09:49 I guess the they used to call used to
09:55 call it the hairy man or the was it the
09:58 wild man those was like the really old
10:01 names for this thing so I believe that
10:04 we have seen in our own lifetime the
10:06 evolution of the hoax you know and the
10:08 last was like 10 years ago or so there
10:12 was the the group and somewhere in the
10:15 you know Midwest Ozarks area that said
10:18 they had a Bigfoot in a.m. in a
10:22 refrigerator in some freezer and it went
10:26 on for months and months and they kept
10:28 releasing photographs of this thing
10:30 inside of a freezer kind of revealing a
10:33 little bit more a little bit more and
10:34 eventually the police showed up or
10:36 someone showed up and they had to admit
10:38 it was a hoax that they had bought in a
10:40 big costume and then filled it up and
10:43 it's it's a fun thing to go through that
10:46 experience because obviously you know it
10:49 brings out the child and all of us who
10:51 ever believed in magic so for a little
10:53 while you're like wow you know there's
10:55 this thing and then the oil to the story
11:00 is you know be careful about what you
11:02 believe before you put some effort into
11:03 it right so what's the scientific theory
11:07 behind Bigfoot where does this species
11:10 come from why do people remotely believe
11:14 this stuff well for a creationist it
11:19 doesn't go down at all that would mean
11:23 that God created this bizarre kind of
11:25 preman as if God has to you know he's
11:28 all-knowing but then he's got a beta
11:31 test a few creatures of beforehand right
11:34 you know for any of us that have sort of
11:38 thought about you know the the notion
11:42 that God would just create man because
11:44 God wanted man there'd be no need for
11:48 gorillas chimpanzees yetis there'd be no
11:52 need for anything that's sort of on our
11:54 level of competitiveness in the food
11:57 chain around here right there just
11:59 wouldn't but your common evolutionist
12:02 you know will try to tell you that
12:03 obviously man came for monkeys but for
12:05 some reason monkeys are still here and
12:09 you know if you really look at that
12:11 association between the two you have
12:13 your anthropologists that will tell you
12:17 that you know there's not a single bone
12:21 and a man's in a monkey they just say
12:25 they go look they I know they look the
12:27 same in their range similarly but when
12:29 you really look at the actual detail of
12:31 the bone it is completely re-engineered
12:33 to be better not necessarily stronger
12:37 more efficient for converting energy
12:39 calorie into actual emotions and I would
12:43 argue I'm not quite convinced I mean you
12:46 goddamn a monkey can fly out a jungle
12:48 like crazy just using his four fingers
12:51 on each hand before the thumb but the
12:56 idea is that there was this evolutionary
12:58 chain of course and at some point there
13:01 was a missing link this dark period
13:04 where we can't find any skulls that
13:06 attached the monkey skull to a homo
13:08 sapien sapien and in that time in that
13:12 missing time all the previous skulls
13:15 seem to match they just get a little bit
13:17 bigger the brain cavity gets a tiny bit
13:19 bigger but it's always per capita
13:21 the overall size of the skull so it's
13:24 just like taking it and zooming it up in
13:25 3d software as opposed to actually
13:28 making the brain cavity larger when you
13:31 get to our human skull it's completely
13:36 reengineered on virtually every level in
13:39 every single minut detail within within
13:43 the skull it makes us who we are without
13:46 this the tiniest chamber change in the
13:49 vocal you know nasal canal we can't
13:51 speak syllables without increasing the
13:54 brain cavity in disproportion to the
13:57 rest of the skull as compared to the
13:59 predecessors in the monkey world we
14:02 don't have the the visual cortex the
14:04 eyeballs the ear hearing the thoughts
14:07 all that good stuff
14:08 so there's really no correlation besides
14:11 two eyes and nose a mouth and two ears
14:14 and what we have with the monkey world
14:17 and scientists who aren't trying to well
14:23 basically any scientists that can think
14:24 for themselves all right will agree and
14:27 that I've got this opinion really from
14:29 them and certified by them that there is
14:32 no real correlation between the two the
14:34 missing link is really indicative of if
14:39 you're God believer and a creation
14:41 believer that's when guy came in and
14:42 went boom Homo Sapien if you're more of
14:46 an alien type person that's when the
14:48 aliens landed spliced into indigenous
14:49 life took what was good left foot was
14:52 bad and made human being
14:53 maybe modeled after themselves outside
14:56 of those two explanations I have no
14:58 explanation there's a mystery as to why
15:00 hundreds of millions of you know if not
15:03 billions of years of our evolution is
15:05 completely missing physically right and
15:09 you know one of the assertions was that
15:11 man went into the forest went into the
15:15 jungle excuse me
15:16 any vegetation spot and then as every
15:19 single evolutionary connection species
15:23 between monkeys and man died in the
15:25 forest that they were consumed by the
15:27 forest consumed by the animals and
15:28 that's why there are no bones
15:30 the notion okay that
15:33 Kees lived in the desert is preposterous
15:37 so all the other skulls lasted in the
15:40 same exact environments there is no
15:42 reason why some specific geographical
15:45 location makes us all go away for
15:47 several hundred million years while we
15:50 get to homeless Nubian Savior right but
15:54 where does that apply to Bigfoot
15:56 well Bigfoot is this other sort of
16:00 mystery we do have gigantic skulls you
16:04 know that again I haven't seen a gorilla
16:06 skull I mean I have seen a real skull a
16:08 couple times on you know online picture
16:12 presence presentation stuff but in terms
16:15 of you know how how the evolution goes
16:18 from even the prehistoric monkey like
16:21 creatures up into what might be you know
16:24 gorillas a chimpanzee you know haven't
16:26 had someone laid out perfectly but there
16:30 is a bone trail a hominid Yeti a much
16:35 larger skull version of the previous
16:37 predecessors before the missing link and
16:40 it's big except while the human being
16:45 was being reengineering to be able to
16:47 have all these capabilities vocally the
16:50 hominid didn't have any that it kept its
16:52 sort of rhesus monkey interior canal
16:56 right its gorilla canal it's you know
17:00 chimpanzee canal so it cannot articulate
17:03 syllables as far as we know these these
17:06 skulls couldn't do it what it could do
17:09 is how and I imagine that you know it's
17:16 not like a piccolo can't bust your
17:17 eardrums but much larger apertures can
17:21 make much larger sounds so one of the
17:26 things we're missing from all these
17:28 sightings is a hearing we don't hear
17:34 these creatures howling as far as I know
17:37 of course there's plenty campfire
17:39 stories to say that's the case but we're
17:43 going to get into the the photography of
17:46 these things and the recording of these
17:48 things since cellphones have now all had
17:51 HD cameras for over ten years right now
17:55 anthropologists are divided on Bigfoot
17:58 of course obviously the majority don't
18:01 want to be scrutinized in any way shape
18:03 or form so they come out wildly against
18:07 any belief in such a thing does it mean
18:11 internally that they don't believe it
18:13 it just means overtly they're not
18:15 willing to admit it right and there's a
18:18 lot of people like that who have their
18:20 own shows on YouTube on their own shows
18:22 on the Internet they believe they just
18:24 have the balls to admit it but for the
18:27 few that really really believe in
18:30 Bigfoot they're they're torn between the
18:36 sightings and the footprints that are
18:38 supposedly been recorded by travelers
18:44 you know footprints and mud that dries
18:49 footprints and snow one of the first
18:52 photographs ever taken was in the late
18:54 fifties of what looks like a pretty
18:57 silly footprint and what's really silly
19:00 about it is that they only ever take one
19:04 photograph of one foot they never take
19:08 the whole path like Danny and the
19:11 shining right
19:12 they never have like the whole thing and
19:14 once you follow where the hell is going
19:16 at least you could report to the
19:18 authorities yeah I went up into that
19:19 cave right there and then the
19:21 authorities could swoop in and see if
19:23 it's real aren't the experts right and
19:26 you know what's funny about it is that I
19:29 don't think there's been a human being
19:31 but hasn't stepped inside snow and
19:34 realized that you can become an artist
19:35 the second that you step inside snow you
19:40 can take your own footprint and add to
19:42 it you can draw on snow make an angel in
19:45 the snow and so
19:48 you know snow prints a the one I saw was
19:51 you know had a big pronounced big toe
19:53 it's just silly
19:54 it didn't match any of the other
19:55 footprints I've ever seen to be clean so
19:57 when the footprints don't match each
20:00 other right we're talking about a
20:01 species here that can mate with itself
20:03 and procreate but so someone said you
20:07 know humans do have strange feet but you
20:09 know you can get a small female
20:11 footprint and a gigantic you know
20:14 barbarian man footprint and yeah they're
20:17 going to look way different one's going
20:18 to be a teeny tiny sized one and the
20:20 other one's going to be you know size 20
20:24 but the anatomical placement of bone
20:29 structures padding on the feet will
20:31 generally be generally fairly similar
20:35 within a particular region right we use
20:38 planes cars trains on automobiles to
20:41 travel around the world and cross mate
20:46 right I mean we have like a five foot
20:49 one latin woman from North or South
20:52 America fly up to Norway and have babies
20:56 with a guy who's seven feet tall you
20:58 know as a white guy and their kids are
21:00 going to be an interesting mix of the
21:02 two right probably extremely bad I say
21:06 but inside of the United States of
21:09 America your your biggest species
21:12 difference between a Bigfoot concept
21:14 would be a Yeti spotted up in Washington
21:17 State and a Yeti spotted in Florida yeah
21:23 you might get some pretty different
21:25 strands there but the anthropologist
21:30 that I've listened to about the Bigfoot
21:33 footprints have to do with the way that
21:37 the footprint has been created
21:38 chronologically when you slow the
21:40 footprint down in essentially
21:43 milliseconds thousands of a second their
21:48 assertion at least one gentleman's
21:50 assertion which I think was very fairly
21:52 well explained and fairly believable was
21:56 that if you were to build a footprint
21:59 in some hard plaster and then you were
22:04 to take that footprint and you were to
22:05 push it into the ground you're not going
22:09 to get an actuated footprint meaning all
22:12 the different joints inside the bone
22:14 structure in our feet are not going to
22:16 be chronologically and printed inside
22:20 mud right because what happens with the
22:22 human being well we have an arch we've
22:24 got a heel we have the padding right
22:27 before our toes our toes are all
22:28 individually connected objects your big
22:31 toe is going to potentially hit the
22:33 surface a little bit stronger than your
22:35 little toe and so there is a
22:39 chronological science to the way of
22:41 footprints created when they look at
22:44 real human being footprints right are
22:46 real creatures so I saw a presentation
22:49 once where a guy went through a bunch of
22:51 footprints of so-called you know Yeti
22:55 Bigfoot imprints and he called us some
23:00 hoaxes and and again what was funny
23:05 about all these was that there was only
23:07 one real good footprint the rest was all
23:10 kind of weird like they didn't want to
23:12 take the same mold like they had fake if
23:15 you had fake feet right made of rubber
23:18 made of other plaster someone's hand
23:20 carved something and then when you push
23:21 it into mud it looks organic and you
23:24 kept using that mold over and over and
23:26 over you might have carved a hair carved
23:29 a mole carved something that was
23:31 temporary and it's not going to look
23:34 right six footprints down and so they
23:36 simply don't do it they just do the one
23:37 and you know the other one too is that
23:40 these footprint sightings where they
23:42 take casts this individual had actually
23:47 done the casts himself on a couple
23:48 occasions but you have people doing
23:52 casting and then bringing it to experts
23:53 and so in that room we're only dealing
23:55 with a piece of artwork really you know
23:57 you don't have to prove you ever found
23:59 anywhere on the ground but the gist of
24:03 that example is that there are
24:04 footprints out there that appear okay
24:07 and this is only if the science is
24:09 correct I
24:11 this guy I forgot his name but you know
24:14 he claimed that there was a whole
24:15 division of scientific research that has
24:18 analyzed the chronological creation of a
24:21 footprint and you know I have a buck 10
24:24 e1 who's got that degree so for me it's
24:26 like oh wow that's really weird I guess
24:29 if that's true
24:30 that's pretty impressive but he had
24:33 found a couple footprints that he
24:35 thought were very very real and a lot of
24:37 it has to do with the way that the edge
24:39 of the footprint will actually displace
24:41 mud and that because the epidermis skin
24:45 is stretching and and you know yielding
24:48 to the bone and the muscle tissue
24:49 underneath that it's got a weird thing
24:51 in the first part of the foot that hits
24:53 the ground up to the last part that hits
24:55 the ground there's a distinct difference
24:57 in the way that the skin manipulates the
25:00 mud sounds good right so the big
25:05 question after you look at some of the
25:07 science we've got bones suggest that
25:10 these things did exist in some realm we
25:14 have footprint experts we have people
25:17 that look at the movies and the
25:19 photographs and say they're seeing
25:20 subdermal muscle tissue even breasts and
25:24 the story just keeps getting updated and
25:27 they say well why can't we find these
25:29 things I mean seriously it's a it's it's
25:32 one thing to say you can't find a small
25:34 thing because they're small a weird
25:37 species of ant right
25:40 imagine someone said you know I found
25:43 this whole colony of ants and instead of
25:45 having to telescopic hexagonal eyes they
25:50 have these uh you know these eye grids
25:53 that they have we had three of him one
25:56 big one big cycloptic ant its whole head
25:59 was just nothing but an eyeball and they
26:01 seem so much more intelligent and we sat
26:03 down the head coffee and talked about
26:06 the birds you know that finding that
26:09 thing would be astronomically against
26:12 right there finding a big giant
26:16 population of humanoid creatures that
26:20 are standing upright
26:23 anywhere I mean it seems like seven feet
26:26 is sort of the minimum height of these
26:28 things seems hard to believe doesn't it
26:32 they do say the world is a big place and
26:34 as I've cited in previous episodes touch
26:38 on the subject the panda bear was
26:40 something that was theorized to exist in
26:42 1800s and Japan now Japan has really
26:48 rocky terrain in various places very
26:52 formidable stuff they built golf courses
26:54 where they've had to like slice off the
26:56 top of mountains to make flat spots to
26:59 drive the ball to right but these
27:02 death-defying bridges that put them
27:04 together right but supposedly they
27:07 search for this thing for 70 years never
27:09 found it until Teddy Roosevelt's child
27:12 was over there exploring walks inside of
27:14 a hut and sees the skin of a panda bear
27:17 hanging on the inside of a hut and he
27:20 says where you know take me to this
27:22 creature and they took him down to a
27:25 waterfall and sure enough they're
27:27 crawling all over the bamboo down there
27:31 boom it's discovered seventy years of
27:34 theorizing it hundreds of thousands of
27:37 years of telling folktales about it and
27:39 it exists the unicorn was found so has
27:45 this been a case with Bigfoot I mean if
27:49 the if the panda bear was discovered the
27:51 turn of the 20th century are we just a
27:55 few decades away from discovering
27:57 Bigfoot hmm well let's let's keep track
28:02 of the individuals that have devoted
28:04 their lives to finding it and the
28:05 individuals that seem to always find it
28:07 the people that seem to find it are just
28:10 your average Joe some guy out there
28:12 hunting some God there fishing some God
28:14 they're shooting he's in the woods and
28:19 the footage is always always always
28:23 office gated by bushes and trees except
28:27 for the one in 1967 and there's a couple
28:31 little photographs here and there with
28:32 you know big giant looking man way far
28:36 away on a Vista edge
28:37 sort of thing taken by like you know Boy
28:39 Scout leader
28:41 you know pedophiles or whatever but we
28:45 don't seem to be edging closer to
28:48 getting a really good shot of these
28:50 things right they don't seem to get any
28:54 clearer they seem to have the cub
28:56 formula in there and you know the
28:59 interesting thing about the cub formula
29:01 is that you would probably be coaxed in
29:04 a child or you know on some weird
29:09 extreme case I guess you can say that
29:11 someone could have a little bear with
29:12 them you know good luck getting a bear
29:15 away from its mother
29:17 but the hoax would have to take on you
29:20 know some extra players in the
29:21 reenactment but I'll tell you what in
29:24 today's age you know I'm a little
29:27 cynical about how difficult it would be
29:29 to keep a child or keep a child quiet as
29:32 after participating in something that
29:34 might grow to be fairly famous you know
29:39 we all remember the what is it the
29:43 inflatable UFO that supposedly had a
29:45 child in it we all woke up that morning
29:47 went to work by 2008 somewhere in there
29:50 we're all watching it on the news to see
29:53 if the guy and then eventually the boy
29:54 admits he was hiding in the Attic the
29:56 entire time because his father was
29:59 creating a stunt to make them money I
30:01 mean the funny thing is if you think of
30:05 a child weighing at least 80 pounds
30:07 inside of an inflatable balloon and
30:10 you're sitting there going yeah what
30:12 [ __ ] balloon could lift an 80 pound
30:14 kid without being fairly large right the
30:17 boy everyone wanted to believe it right
30:20 now and look at this thing I was at this
30:21 side breakfast cafe when it was going
30:23 down I'm sitting here the whole time I'm
30:27 telling her I was like there's no way
30:28 that thing can hold up a child I mean
30:30 that's maybe a baby but Donna I don't
30:33 like a twelve-year-old kid for Christ's
30:35 sake and sure enough that was the case
30:38 with Bigfoot sightings I'm not sure but
30:42 again they're they're getting clever
30:44 they want to try to create organic
30:46 excuses why you can't see the thing
30:48 clearly
30:49 we've had a few billionaires publicly
30:54 say they're going to find Bigfoot and
30:56 they're going to use infrared to find
31:00 them which i think is fantastic right
31:03 now let's uh split that hair first one
31:05 second
31:08 infrared definitely shows you where
31:10 something is that's barring heat inside
31:14 of a forest floor jungle floor or
31:17 whatever your problem is is that for you
31:20 to know what something is you have to
31:22 track two different things there's a
31:23 there's a overall mass imprint meaning
31:27 how big is the blob in your infrared
31:30 camera you know there's a difference
31:32 between a moose and a mouse right and
31:35 then you have to take a picture of the
31:39 thing from such an angle that you have
31:41 pattern recognition meaning you're
31:43 looking for a biped two legs two arms a
31:47 body and then hopefully if you're
31:51 finding them in their indigenous
31:53 wildlife there'll be some form a family
31:58 right now the thing is is if this is
32:02 some sort of humanoid it would be and it
32:07 were to be alone all the time then it
32:10 would the the isolation property slash
32:14 attribute of this particular life-form
32:16 would be the most unique thing about it
32:18 because look at every but other biped
32:20 species that we have on earth right so
32:25 obviously human beings are extremely
32:27 social I mean if there's any does any
32:30 species that has isolation and is going
32:33 to sit you know by themselves and think
32:35 it's probably us but your monkeys of all
32:38 species their harem base their pack
32:42 animal based they do not sit out there
32:45 on their own on a branch apes same exact
32:49 thing very pack animal very harem based
32:52 and they stay together
32:53 most creatures of that ilk
32:58 behave like that Wolf's are pack animals
33:00 lions are pack animals you know
33:02 and so for the Yeti to be this
33:06 isolationist is a really weird twist now
33:10 it is larger so it is formidable it will
33:14 be able to survive confrontations
33:17 perhaps even with the grizzly bear who
33:19 knows when grizzly bears are if you
33:21 stand them straight up easily ten feet
33:24 tall in some cases right polar bear is
33:26 even bigger but don't think about the
33:29 birthing process okay at some point
33:33 there has to be a mechanism by which
33:35 this creature is going to go and
33:37 procreate and if they're walking around
33:39 willy-nilly all by themselves which is
33:41 keeps the conspiracy hoax people in
33:45 business right then how does the male
33:48 find the female how does that work
33:51 there's so few of them that we can't
33:53 just walk into the forest and find it
33:55 but somehow they're finding each other
33:57 and screwing I find that really hard to
34:00 believe there are migratory animals
34:03 where you have penguins that will go off
34:05 in different directions and the
34:07 offseason then they come back to you
34:10 know Club Bona locks down in Antarctica
34:13 and they make whoopee and put it up put
34:15 it all together and have their kids
34:17 somehow they can monogamously find their
34:19 mate - which is really wild so if there
34:22 was any migratory quality to this animal
34:26 to this hominid and again you have
34:28 different species supposedly and you
34:31 know with all the folktales then you
34:34 would think that there would be
34:35 literally sort of highways of broken
34:38 branches and well-traveled paths with
34:42 their migratory movements and at some
34:44 point okay during that spawning season
34:49 they would be together in mass I just
34:54 think about the sex smell going through
34:57 that forest then you have a birthing
35:00 process
35:01 alright well you're going to be talking
35:03 about a big giant female carrying an
35:06 infant in her womb for god knows how
35:09 long
35:09 human beings carry for nine months well
35:12 it might be logical to assume that they
35:14 might carry longer ten months twelve
35:16 longer but during the birthing process
35:19 one thing is for certain it is not going
35:22 to be a pleasurable experience for the
35:24 female no birthing process ever is
35:28 something gigantic coming out of your
35:30 vagina right so I'm willing to bet that
35:33 during some birthing process you would
35:35 have a lot of noise in the forest if
35:37 there is any sense of a spawning season
35:41 what we are suggesting is that over the
35:44 course of perhaps a month or so every
35:46 female that's alive and the species is
35:48 getting knocked up and so they go out
35:51 and now you have sort of a bunch of
35:55 female yetis out in the forest birthing
35:57 and screaming and howling with with you
35:59 know essentially a cannon for a skull
36:01 that's going to be heard for miles let's
36:05 just put that way well sometimes
36:08 birthing processes go wrong right
36:11 sometimes animals died during birthing
36:14 now there's a big [ __ ] stupid-ass
36:15 rumor created by the Rockefeller
36:17 Foundation who essentially created the
36:21 hospitals that we go to today that it's
36:23 very dangerous for you to have babies at
36:25 your house you must pay hospital to do
36:27 it there's laws even fascinating you
36:29 can't do it in your house without
36:30 permission all this other horseshit
36:32 we have been procreating for years and
36:35 jungles and deserts and there ain't no
36:38 problem with us having kids
36:40 yes idea that the females died during
36:41 birthing process like you know if you
36:44 don't go to hospital it's like they want
36:46 you to believe the two thirds of all
36:47 females died giving birth obviously not
36:50 right is it gooey and messy and bloody
36:55 yeah it is what you know what irony that
37:00 one of the most disgusting processes
37:02 bears one of the most beautiful
37:04 processes you know spiritually you know
37:08 it's hard to get any higher than that
37:09 but now you have a Bigfoot female with a
37:13 child okay and this child is so what is
37:20 it a there's a mare is it capable of
37:23 walking in the first 60 seconds is it
37:25 completely fully formed or its eyes open
37:29 hmm probably not probably not probably
37:32 Harry probably got that going on but
37:34 then she's gonna be lactating she's
37:37 gonna be a little lethargic as she is
37:39 trying to feed her offspring and what
37:42 does she feed them you can survive on
37:45 milk for a little while I guess but at
37:47 some point they need to eat what they're
37:48 made out of right go ask any wildlife
37:52 you know expert how much food an
37:55 elephant has D every single day just to
37:57 stay alive so the more body mass you
38:00 have the more meat you have to eat you
38:02 just do it ain't a vegetarian I
38:06 guarantee you so now you have
38:10 potentially a slower-moving female a
38:12 female that's most likely going to
38:14 create a nest of some sort to just kind
38:17 of take the edge off of you know the
38:19 requirements to move around in the
38:21 wilderness to survive because she's got
38:23 some stuff to take care of a baby so
38:28 wouldn't that make them much easier to
38:29 find and where's the male because the
38:32 male stay around is the male book no
38:36 one's ever claimed to have a male/female
38:38 baby cub situation but then again you
38:41 know bears are the same way right I've
38:43 never seen a male bear a female bear and
38:45 a bunch of Cubs it's always if you see a
38:47 cub run your ass off because the mom was
38:49 really close by she'll rip you to shreds
38:51 which brings us to our next subject out
38:56 of all of the videos that have been
38:58 captured of these creatures supposedly
39:01 again there's way more hoax hoax
39:05 photographs and videos that are revealed
39:07 later to be such things than there are
39:09 ever anything where someone sticks to
39:11 their story right but why hasn't a Yeti
39:17 a Bigfoot come right out of human being
39:19 and you know you could dream up a whole
39:23 scenario where you know it bites the
39:26 human rips its arms off punches it does
39:29 whatever has to do hit it with the big
39:30 giant stick and squash a human being or
39:34 at least come up like an elephant does
39:36 in the Safari Inn at least showboat and
39:39 say get back
39:41 get back or I will [ __ ] you up right
39:45 there's none of that these things are
39:48 the most docile beings out there hell
39:51 maybe they are vegetarians I guarantee
39:53 if they were vegetarians you would see
39:56 the forest floor clean where they have
39:59 to eat right the difference between like
40:02 a jungle that bears a lot of fruit and a
40:06 forest that just basically has a lot of
40:08 trees is that you don't have a lot of
40:10 edible vegetation and to my knowledge
40:12 and a forest right you can eat berries
40:15 only for so long before you start
40:17 [ __ ] your guts out right and I bring
40:20 you these YouTube ads sponsoring moments
40:24 one at a time so if we're trying to talk
40:28 about strategically finding these things
40:30 and by the way the billionaire's never
40:31 found these things they never ever found
40:34 these things and I remember watching at
40:37 least a few 20-minute reels of infrared
40:40 photography down on areas where there
40:43 were so many sightings that you know it
40:45 was like just a matter of going out
40:46 fishing and you get your own picture of
40:48 Sasquatch right no one ever found
40:52 anything the more official the equipment
40:54 becomes it's almost as if they disappear
40:57 I'm going to do a separate episode about
40:59 giant human beings because I think
41:03 that's a completely different thing and
41:04 I think that that's much more legitimate
41:06 than the Yeti and now as a tiny little
41:10 segue into that room as it relates to
41:15 Bigfoot the assertion with the giant
41:18 humans there's a there's a just a couple
41:21 people trying to associate the two and
41:23 what they were saying and they've got
41:24 these weird photographs of these sort of
41:27 well especially in Asia - or the average
41:30 height is pretty consistent for a
41:33 particular region you know whatever the
41:35 height is because they intermingle with
41:37 their own you know their small
41:39 collection of families they keep the
41:40 height a certain point which you have
41:41 these gigantic offspring that have been
41:45 photographed and one of them was given
41:46 like a female name she was a female and
41:48 she was massive she was
41:51 some are seven feet or above in this
41:53 particular village and someone had they
41:58 create this folktale story and again it
42:00 may be true who knows but her relatives
42:03 were all named as well and they were
42:05 basically saying any one point in time
42:07 this particular village in Asia had this
42:10 Yeti gene pool that was going through
42:13 and and some brave guy you know decided
42:16 to mount this gigantic being and get it
42:20 pregnant so there is and there are
42:23 excuse me
42:25 various tales that have been correlated
42:28 with this sort of it you know the reason
42:30 why they call it a Yeti offspring is
42:33 that it didn't have the vocal capability
42:36 in the skull to speak but not so that
42:39 suggests that even though there were
42:41 somehow not a species barrier between
42:45 this hominid offspring and a human being
42:48 meaning they could procreate with sperm
42:50 and they get along well that obviously
42:53 you're going to be rolling the dice to
42:55 see how your skull manifests and so but
42:58 they were saying that this being was
42:59 very very docile very sweet and they
43:03 were given our name like Susie or
43:05 something like that right and there's
43:07 photographs I think it's kind of late
43:10 eighteen hundreds early nineteen
43:11 hundreds but you can't tell because in
43:13 these remote areas in Asia there's at
43:16 the time they were fifty to one hundred
43:18 to two hundred years back in the more
43:20 agricultural revolution and not even the
43:22 revolution but just more agricultural
43:24 society so you can't really can't really
43:26 tell unless you read the fine print so
43:30 what are the other options well we have
43:36 we have essentially two of the primary
43:38 options which is these things are real
43:40 and that they are very elusive there is
43:42 somehow somehow your explanation we can
43:47 we will at some point find them like
43:50 panda bears and somehow the way that
43:53 they traverse the world and hibernate
43:56 and come out and what-have-you it'll all
43:57 be explained right they they would
44:00 probably most likely have to hibernate I
44:02 don't know four fifths out of the year
44:04 and they only come out
44:04 1/5 out of the year maybe they live in
44:07 the ground or whatever who knows but
44:09 again hair a hairy body suggests a need
44:13 to protect against the elements and to
44:15 keep yourself warm during the winter
44:17 season so big giant super dense hairy
44:20 bodies are typically very active in the
44:22 winter years of where they're ever
44:25 they're discovered and again I'm not
44:30 terribly familiar nor am I going to get
44:32 into the the sort of offshoot which is
44:36 your more snow Yeti or your white a bomb
44:40 little snowman sort of thing because
44:41 it's all the same information but simply
44:44 put on to ice and put into the more
44:47 Arctic territories I think it becomes
44:49 harder to believe in the Arctic world
44:51 even though they're white like a polar
44:53 bear and you could look down and I see
44:54 them
44:54 infrared would pick them up but their
44:57 ability to harvest food would be pretty
45:00 easy to find because anything in an
45:02 Arctic Territory has to fish or dies and
45:05 so especially a big giant being like
45:08 that and we would definitely definitely
45:10 definitely find a polar bear and a Yeti
45:13 duking it out somewhere blood trails
45:15 everywhere and at some point ok the
45:18 polar bear is going to kick its ass it's
45:20 going to eat a cub
45:21 it's going to pick on a youthful getti
45:25 and it's going to win hands down and
45:27 we're going to find these skulls and
45:28 these entrails all over the place and we
45:30 don't and I think it's a little bit of a
45:33 stretch if not a massive stretch to
45:35 assume that every person to find such a
45:36 thing is some in some some
45:38 conspiratorial science community that
45:41 works for the Smithsonian they're all
45:42 trying to constantly keep everything
45:44 from being discovered I don't buy that
45:45 for a second so the other of the two is
45:49 that it is all a hoax and they're all
45:51 fake every single one of them and it's
45:53 simply a campfire tale that has been
45:55 massaged into reality but because you
46:00 know depending on how you view your
46:02 reality maybe you think it sucks maybe
46:04 you're really pissed off that magic
46:06 isn't real that you hang on to this and
46:09 you know you know deep down the side
46:10 you're not doing anyone any harm
46:12 you're just having fun you know it's
46:15 funny too cos as a digression
46:17 if you go camping and you do have a
46:20 fireplace that you could nerve fire pits
46:22 that you can build or you can rent and
46:24 turn on or whatever and you're all
46:26 sitting around with your family members
46:28 you wish wish wish wish you were good
46:32 storyteller and you had some spooky
46:33 stories that no one had ever heard that
46:35 you could grip everyone around the fire
46:37 and for her moment the suspension of
46:39 disbelief is augmented by the fact that
46:42 you're out in the wilderness which is
46:43 not where you natively live typically
46:45 and you're entertaining and everyone's
46:48 having an adrenaline rush and a dopamine
46:49 rush rate as a result of you recalling a
46:53 story water maybe some of the more
46:55 outrageous possibilities I'm just I'm
47:00 just going to throw these out there
47:01 because I made a joke once a long time
47:03 ago about this sort of assertion and it
47:07 never left me but it was very
47:09 interesting this is just downright funny
47:16 we talked about the fact that with other
47:20 disciplines in science that we study on
47:23 this show and coast to coast gets into
47:25 it and everyone gets into it on the
47:26 internet that the idea of
47:29 interdimensional life is very
47:32 interesting now usually when you think
47:35 of under dimensional life we typically
47:38 think of it in our brain as an
47:39 interdimensional something more
47:41 sophisticated right because if something
47:43 can find a way to traverse between
47:45 realities it's you know it's just
47:50 basically shifting their ability to be
47:52 seen or whatever we always think of it
47:56 as a UFO an alien race something with a
48:00 fair amount of intelligence that is
48:04 somehow figured out how to manipulate
48:05 the dimensions of reality and move
48:08 between them right so that our eyes can
48:10 see them and there's you can see us as
48:12 sort of thing but I made a joke once
48:15 which is stuck with me when it comes to
48:17 Bigfoot that you know imagine a being
48:23 that for whatever reason you know we
48:27 talked about earlier about the migration
48:29 for mating you know Sam
48:30 swim back upriver to their meeting pits
48:34 and they mate and they go back down
48:35 that's how they live imagine a race a
48:39 primitive race not completely primitive
48:42 in the brain they actually have a lot
48:43 more brain power than we give them
48:45 credit for but because they have howling
48:47 skulls they can't articulate perhaps
48:49 between them there they're more you know
48:52 mental telepathy sort of communication
48:54 techniques but what if their migration
48:59 is interdimensional they can move
49:03 between dimensions we don't think about
49:06 that because they look like primitive
49:08 beasts but the reason why they can
49:10 appear in our world seem to harvest
49:13 something that they want here which I
49:15 would only imagine would be food supply
49:17 maybe it if you were to take it to the
49:20 latest incarnations of the conspiracy
49:22 slash hoax people they're bringing their
49:25 cubs here because perhaps it's safer
49:27 here than where it is or where they go
49:29 and they're not wearing a pip-boy on
49:32 their arm and you know teleporting to
49:34 the Institute they are what's a fallout
49:37 joke for all units reference they are
49:41 organically going through some membrane
49:45 and coming into our world it's just
49:47 something that's there perhaps their
49:49 their bodies and their frequencies can
49:52 do it and well ours can't now part of
49:58 this is a good little sci-fi premise for
50:00 anyone who's daring to go out there and
50:02 write a Bigfoot movie but honestly
50:04 unless it's a complete hoax
50:06 that would be my only real idea for how
50:10 these things could constantly be cited
50:12 but lack all those other elements and
50:14 all those other very imperative
50:17 behaviors that I just named in this
50:19 episode or described great the sad part
50:23 is is what would we do if we found them
50:26 let's say we found them what would
50:29 happen then we found the nest or
50:33 someplace that we've just overlooked
50:34 it's a particular cave catacomb of caves
50:38 if any of you haven't been to Missouri
50:41 if you
50:43 especially for those have been to
50:45 America yet if you want to see something
50:48 really mind-blowing and I know that this
50:51 geographical reality exists in other
50:54 areas of the world so I apologize for
50:56 being so myopically American with my
50:59 example here but Missouri has some very
51:01 interesting caves that are so dark I
51:05 can't see your hand in front of your
51:07 face if the lights are off
51:11 Mark Twain integrated a lot of these
51:14 caves and these little catacombs into
51:16 his writings for Mark from Huckleberry
51:18 Finn right if they're real you know I'm
51:24 always talking about I come from Kansas
51:25 the west side of Kansas is flat like the
51:28 Truman Show east side of Kansas starts
51:31 getting buckled and hilly and I mean we
51:35 have areas we have like my family owns
51:37 land that's so crazy bumpy you would
51:41 look at it from the highway ago that
51:43 looks like a pretty much a flat field
51:44 that you could plow you plow it straight
51:47 and then you can start growing stuff and
51:49 when you get a 4x4 out there and you
51:52 just try to drive across it you realize
51:54 you can't because it's just just crazy
51:57 there are three foot for foot ups and
51:59 downs the point the car will be upside
52:01 down in a split second and you'll be
52:03 stuck but anyway Missouri's got some
52:06 pretty interesting areas and once you
52:08 see these catacombs and these crazy
52:10 caves there is a slight anthropological
52:15 uneven know what the hell you would call
52:17 the people that would study the living
52:19 versions of these things but you could
52:20 think that they could have made their
52:22 homes inside these caves and again my my
52:26 assertion is I don't think they'd be so
52:27 hairy because I'm not sure there'd be a
52:30 need for but you know caves are cold so
52:31 whatever but the idea is if they were
52:33 ever found what would America do let's
52:38 just let's just keep it here because we
52:40 know how our press likes to exploit
52:42 things what would be the fleet of
52:45 helicopters that be flying over these
52:47 things terrifying them what would be the
52:50 amount of I don't know military
52:52 personnel that would move in to to
52:55 isolate them perhaps you
52:57 build some type of enclosure and then
52:59 maybe that kills them because they need
53:00 to actually move in a much larger circle
53:02 you know the Shoshone Indians were
53:05 slaughtered in Utah by the Mormons
53:08 because the Shoshone Indians were very
53:11 nomadic they moved in a gigantic loop
53:14 according to the seasons so when it was
53:16 really cold they went down towards
53:17 Mexico border
53:19 when it was very hot they went up north
53:21 and Utah and they were always just in
53:23 the best climate and so when the
53:26 settlers moved in they cut the loop off
53:28 and then they were stuck in Utah in
53:30 winter when they were never used to
53:32 freezing their butts off and so when the
53:34 Mormons moved in and killed over 450 of
53:37 these Shoshone Indians it was like you
53:41 know frozen wasps being sprayed by some
53:43 bug killer you're just here in
53:46 hypothermia what the hell you gonna do
53:49 so it might be that not discovering them
53:53 if you love them and if you like them
53:55 and if you like the story of them and
53:57 you like sighting them every once in a
53:58 while probably acting as sort of like
54:03 that guy in Indiana Jones 3 right the
54:06 guy that was trying hit the tattoo on
54:08 his chest you know the double cross on
54:10 his chest his whole thing was you're not
54:12 supposed to find the Holy Grail because
54:15 you will screw up the balance of the
54:17 world and of course that Templar theme
54:20 was like I'm so [ __ ] glad you're here
54:22 I can go relax in heaven that we would
54:25 rip them apart wouldn't we i holy spot
54:30 zoos and water parks god bless them I
54:32 think that they are the worst idea I
54:35 personally I only have a few friends
54:38 that have animals but I think that they
54:41 do exactly what needs to be done to have
54:43 an animal and a lot of people just get
54:46 animals to appease the children for a
54:48 few years until the children give a [ __ ]
54:50 don't give a [ __ ] about the animal and
54:52 then it just sits there suffering
54:53 alright yes it's fed yes is bade there
54:57 one small house the place to sleep but
54:59 you know animals are extremely social
55:02 beings and you really need to devote
55:05 it's it's like having a baby for the
55:08 rest of your life they don't
55:10 a little bit smarter they get a little
55:12 more calmer as they go and only live
55:13 about between 8 and 15 years right but
55:18 only those who really dedicate
55:19 themselves I think do do animals any
55:22 justice and I can't imagine that the
55:23 masses that would rush in to see a Yeti
55:26 a Bigfoot would be able to resist the
55:31 idea of capturing one and putting it in
55:33 captivity and I'm sure that man would do
55:37 that before learning anything about the
55:39 Bigfoot right the the big-game hunters
55:42 would move in and you know do it on
55:44 behalf of some zoo somewhere in the
55:46 world or some natural wildlife for our
55:48 guests they could say well you know it's
55:49 got its got like 40 acres to mess around
55:52 on which wouldn't be enough so in
55:56 summary I think that the thing that we
55:59 can learn about Bigfoot is that we we
56:03 like to believe in things without really
56:07 thinking anything through and there's
56:09 really nothing wrong with that
56:10 especially if we plan to do no harm you
56:12 know it's just like hey you know I love
56:15 it when a new Bigfoot story comes out
56:16 and someone's doctored up some you know
56:20 footage so I can see one and I can
56:22 believe for at least that day or that
56:23 week or that month that maybe they are
56:25 real just as long as we have no intent
56:28 to go capture them to mess with their
56:31 lives to scare the crap out of them to
56:33 blow up their ecosystem you know you
56:37 know what really surprises me is that
56:39 supposedly again they fall in the Ozarks
56:42 you know that's raining sorry only they
56:44 fall in there but they always are
56:45 discovered in sort of the more Foresti
56:47 areas of the United States of America
56:51 what I don't understand is why they
56:53 wouldn't be all over South America you
56:55 know and I'm sure their sightings down
56:56 there that I'm unaware of but think
56:58 about the lush lush forest and jungle
57:01 down there where these things could just
57:03 blow up population-wise they could to
57:06 eat fruits and there's all kinds of
57:08 vegetative vegetation and rodents and
57:10 and big gain that they could eat down
57:13 there and they never seem to make it
57:14 down there if the evolution has put
57:19 forth by anthropologist is true that
57:22 after
57:23 a missing link phase which again is this
57:27 very mysterious phase of our creation
57:30 the hominid survived
57:33 of course monkeys and apes survived too
57:35 but again we were supposed to evolve
57:37 from them which doesn't make any sense
57:39 we're just had one renegade species for
57:42 those of you don't know potassium is one
57:44 of the most naturally radioactive food
57:46 supplies that we eat that are found at
57:48 bananas and one of the things I always
57:50 thought was kind of interesting is that
57:51 monkeys like bananas right and monkeys
57:55 are always at the epitome of the
57:59 evolutionary model right the picture of
58:00 evolution is the monkey that you know he
58:02 stands upright over your millions of
58:04 years and becomes man and the idea is
58:07 that radiation and minut amounts are
58:10 lots of consumption through lots of
58:13 consumption would be bombarding our DNA
58:15 creating mutations and of course the
58:19 heavy mutations might well the the
58:23 deform mutations which would be
58:25 cancerous as long as the veining doesn't
58:28 drink diet coke and put a cell phone to
58:30 its head it's perhaps fighting off and
58:32 excreting all of the tumorous cells
58:36 while the mutations that actually are in
58:40 conjunction with survival of the fittest
58:42 get the privilege of continuing to move
58:45 up the chain of evolution right a little
58:51 anecdote off to the side here the day I
58:53 learned that potassium was radioactive
58:54 was when I was training some some
58:58 programmers from a nuclear power plant
59:00 and they came in and we had a whole
59:03 spread for them at lunchtime because
59:05 they were there for about a week
59:06 learning from us on how to do this and
59:09 we had bananas on the table and they go
59:10 oh this is great we get to eat bananas
59:12 and I looked at him funny like well
59:14 what's the deal and they go well we
59:16 can't have bananas at work and I said
59:18 why because well it's so radioactive
59:19 that it sets off all the meters when we
59:22 go inside and so they don't let us eat
59:24 bananas at work and that's when I
59:26 learned that potassium was very
59:27 radioactive which is funny and again
59:30 we're not talking about bars or uranium
59:32 or anything but enough to set off
59:34 sensors which is pretty cool and and
59:36 another little
59:37 is that I was watching some Border
59:39 Patrol show on Netflix kind of learning
59:43 about how customs works which is
59:44 actually pretty fascinating and they had
59:46 a woman that drove through the turnstile
59:49 and she set off a radioactive meter that
59:52 you know since is whether someone's
59:54 bringing in some sort of radioactive
59:55 material for perhaps dirty bomb and they
59:58 pull her into the lobby of this customs
60:02 check in place and they put a Geiger
60:04 counter on her and she's setting off the
60:07 Geiger counter check Oliver you know
60:09 main heavy garments off like her winter
60:11 coat that kind of stuff so they could
60:12 see she's just wearing normal blouse and
60:14 whatever pants and she goes oh you know
60:18 I've had an isotope inserted injected
60:20 into my chest to see you know to find
60:24 clogs and stuff my arteries and that
60:25 kind of stuff so I just had that a
60:26 couple days ago and so that's how
60:29 sensitive our sensors are which is for
60:32 me just utterly phenomenal they could
60:34 find a little tiny isotope now what a
60:36 crazy thing to do right don't ever put
60:37 that [ __ ] in your body maybe it died but
60:40 not a frickin radioactive isotope so
60:45 anyway I hope you feel me I hope this
60:46 was entertaining for you guys for those
60:48 of you wanted me to cover Bigfoot it's
60:50 been on my mind for two seasons straight
60:52 and I just couldn't figure out a way to
60:53 do it to add anything to it but the more
60:56 I thought about it the more I had this
60:57 frustration inside myself of going come
60:59 on guys there's a lot of things that
61:02 aren't being addressed after hundreds of
61:04 years of having seen these things
61:05 supposedly and and we're just not taking
61:08 the conversation beyond you know tabloid
61:10 magazine so hopefully this did the trick
61:14 anyway deep thoughts radio.com for all
61:17 the feeds as I always say if you're on
61:20 video there's audio for your car if
61:22 you're on audio there's video in case
61:24 you're sitting at home you want to stare
61:25 at somebody smoke cigars and black and
61:27 white it's on iTunes just in case you're
61:29 an Apple person and it's on vid me in
61:33 case you want to see season one
61:36 unscrewed with by YouTube's copyright
61:40 stuff so the main thing is that season
61:42 one what I did was I opened every
61:44 episode oh I shouldn't say every episode
61:47 open probably 2/3 of the episodes with
61:49 some my favorite music
61:51 and just to kind of jazz up the theme
61:53 sometimes the music's perfectly on point
61:55 where the name of the song is related to
61:58 the subject uncovering but YouTube you
62:01 know shits all over itself if you use 15
62:03 seconds of a song while iTunes can play
62:04 you a minute of the song without any
62:06 problem how does Apple have the right to
62:09 play one minute of a song but you can't
62:10 do it on your videos stupid if you're in
62:13 Germany I guarantee you because Germany
62:16 has a big problem with the honoring the
62:20 copyrights of intellectual property in
62:23 America for some weird reason music
62:26 companies just have elected to block any
62:28 any copyright use in Germany because I
62:31 guess I don't know what the deal is if
62:33 Germany actually allows you to scrape
62:35 music for free or I don't know what the
62:36 deal is but if you're in Germany and I
62:38 know there's a couple of you out there
62:39 go to vide look up deep thoughts radio
62:43 it's got to put radio on the end
62:45 otherwise you're going to find Jack
62:46 Handey videos but anyway thanks for
62:50 joining take care of yourself and
62:51 someone else and I will see you the next
62:53 deep talks over now
62:55 [Music]
