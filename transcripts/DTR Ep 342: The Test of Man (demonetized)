00:00 [Music]
00:34 good evening good afternoon good morning
00:37 ladies and gentlemen
00:39 welcome back to deep thoughts as I set
00:44 up here in the garage on this rainy day
00:49 I'm tucking in a weird cadence because
00:51 I'm also trying to multitask my brain to
00:53 draw a nice halo of fire on this punch
00:59 stick here this is the neighbors watch
01:03 the Super Bowl it's Super Bowl Sunday
01:06 and nourish truly could give a [ __ ] I
01:10 mean how many [ __ ] times and you see
01:11 the Patriots in that [ __ ] game just
01:14 call it the Patriot Bowl who's gonna
01:15 play that Patriots this year what would
01:18 you have the LA Rams there so that's
01:21 where my loyalties lie a team made up of
01:24 people who aren't from Los Angeles will
01:26 be my total rooting favorite alright
01:32 today's episode comes from me to you I'm
01:38 calling it the test of man and what does
01:41 that mean well it has to do with this
01:46 idea that the evilest people who have
01:50 ever been created on this planet tend to
01:54 have the skillset to rise to a position
01:57 of absolute power no having said that we
02:02 do have the was that the burden of the
02:05 King which is whoever becomes king will
02:10 be vilified hated despised because the
02:15 Kings hubris and the entire position of
02:19 its definition is one of you're
02:25 responsible for fixing everything for
02:27 everyone and the second you can't do
02:29 that well then you're an [ __ ] right
02:33 so no king and no queen could ever solve
02:36 all the problems for everybody because
02:39 some problems you own personally no
02:41 one's there to save you
02:43 of course the King understands that but
02:46 they never have the intelligence tower
02:47 where the
02:48 communicate such a thing but having said
02:51 that again we have some evil people but
02:55 I want to parse what I mean by evil
02:57 because there's probably some
03:00 circumstances where these individuals
03:01 would look at me and say we're not evil
03:04 you dumbass people are sheep people are
03:07 cattle people are worthless people are
03:10 lazy and they tend to congregate and
03:16 then they don't like us and I would say
03:19 then don't take the [ __ ] job don't
03:21 make the position because that's not
03:23 exactly true if your people are lazy
03:26 they lack vision
03:27 it's just simple they lack vision what
03:31 do I mean by vision
03:32 well something that's attainable within
03:34 their circle that you could educate them
03:36 by increasing the standards of Education
03:40 within your country within your nation
03:42 region you could pass on any wisdom that
03:46 you have instead of coveting the [ __ ]
03:49 giving everyone the power of
03:51 self-governance
03:52 you don't have to tell someone what the
03:54 [ __ ] do right now if you have a bunch
03:57 of balloons because you just are all
03:59 climbing out of some cave from somewhere
04:02 and one of you is ahead of all the rest
04:04 then you know that the only thing you
04:06 can do are the best thing you could do
04:10 sorry
04:10 is to teach them what you know instead
04:12 of trying to police them with [ __ ]
04:14 big clubs to do what you want them to do
04:18 the elite are absolutely [ __ ]
04:21 terrified of overpopulation but they
04:23 won't take the tact that education not
04:26 indoctrination the [ __ ] identify as a
04:28 goddamn you know water lily instead of a
04:31 human being right they want to keep
04:34 their power structure over you by never
04:37 telling you the complete truth and
04:39 that's reprehensible now what is tested
04:44 man all about well
04:48 it would seem that we have been put here
04:54 quite intentionally either we have been
04:58 put here by an alien being around the
05:01 time of the missing link or we have been
05:05 put here by a divine creature we also
05:09 may have been put here simply by a bunch
05:11 of computer programmers which is what
05:14 was alluded to in the movie Tron in 1982
05:17 towards the third act when Tron and Yuri
05:22 and Flynn were all on the solar sailer
05:24 and he just diverted power with his
05:27 hands he put one arm in and he diverted
05:30 so they could make it jump and he says
05:33 well how did you do that you know like
05:35 you should be dead and he goes he was a
05:39 power of you know beam of energy can
05:41 always be diverted Elementary you know
05:43 physics or whatever he said and he goes
05:44 because I want you guys call a user
05:47 meaning he's one of us right he went
05:50 down into the computer that's the best
05:52 thing about that [ __ ] movie is the
05:54 user metaphor yeah what stronsay gonna
05:58 pity any of you guys didn't get to grow
06:00 up with this film because god damn it it
06:02 changed my whole [ __ ] thinking about
06:05 everything this one line but I'm about
06:08 to share he goes well if you're a user
06:10 then this was all according to a plan
06:15 Jeff Bridges looks at him like you wish
06:18 you know Charles look at him like well
06:22 isn't that true I mean Christ if you
06:25 have the power to create our world isn't
06:28 this all according to a plan why would
06:31 your infinite intelligence to create
06:32 everything that we see somehow subdue
06:38 right so that's that's us potentially
06:44 with our Creator right we we believe
06:48 that God is is like so amazingly
06:51 omnipotent and brilliant that every
06:55 single thing is according to a plan but
06:58 now here's the thing even if earth
07:00 wasn't
07:01 created specifically right God just
07:05 pushes an algorithm generates a bunch of
07:07 random planets generates a bunch of
07:10 random beings now what you end up
07:11 calling the [ __ ] place well that's
07:12 just us we can Apple go
07:14 you know it's not his choice necessarily
07:18 right okay but now you let it simmer you
07:22 let this whole little formula summer and
07:24 you find out that sort of the scumbags
07:28 of your algorithm which may not be
07:32 scumbags in the eye of God they get in
07:34 there and they [ __ ] ass into power
07:36 and the control [ __ ] they [ __ ] put
07:41 one they invent vaccinations and they
07:43 put them in our [ __ ] kids right
07:47 unbelievable but they start wars they
07:52 get us all fighting each other now
07:55 here's the thing what if our Creator is
07:57 looking for an aggressive gene right in
08:01 the show Star Trek especially in the
08:03 Star Trek Enterprise with Scott Bakula
08:06 and company they invented this race
08:10 called the Xindi which is actually a
08:13 bunch of races together as I remember
08:17 actually let me backtrack because
08:19 there's actually a better example I
08:21 apologize Deep Space nine oh do they had
08:26 this oh do was a shape shifter and the
08:29 race that actually ran the galaxy was
08:31 his race which he had never met and they
08:35 had actually engineered I believe this
08:36 other race with this milk that had to be
08:42 ingested otherwise they'd feel pain but
08:44 anyway the predator race is also
08:46 supposed to have engineered the alien
08:48 race right there there's this sick idea
08:51 that you know someone wants to create a
08:53 very aggressive soldier but now someone
08:57 with the wherewithal to genetically
08:59 engineer something wouldn't just drop us
09:01 off and leave right maybe they created
09:04 it and then they left and then it's like
09:06 well whatever that's just you know it's
09:08 just now fodder for the universe to eat
09:11 up maybe they live maybe they don't
09:12 we'll see what happens we don't care
09:14 became we got what we want right here
09:16 right other theories of man's creation
09:19 have to do with sort of like your your
09:24 alien participation you know the
09:25 Egyptians might have come down and they
09:28 were the actual individuals from the
09:30 Stars and so they just start to populate
09:34 with their own race there's no
09:36 intermingling with any of the hominids
09:37 they just are able to do it because it's
09:40 congruent with their biped configuration
09:45 maybe there's a secondary race like the
09:48 the greys that engineer a couple
09:53 genetics together themselves with the
09:55 hominids and they get the homo sapien
09:57 sapien it would appear that the oldest
09:59 recorded history is the african what you
10:05 would call black race
10:08 we know that when blacks procreate for
10:12 infinite amount of time they will create
10:14 an albino black which then passes for
10:17 what we now call white people and when
10:21 we have one listener who actually was a
10:26 minority she was half
10:29 I believe Latino half a Native American
10:32 who wanted to be identified as white who
10:36 absolutely hated that statement that
10:40 albino black people turn into white
10:42 people you could have a bunch of white
10:44 people have babies and they'll never
10:46 have a black child shows good lineage
10:48 that represents where we are but the
10:52 test of man is about the notion that
10:54 somehow all of these evil people have
10:58 been allowed to get to power which I
11:01 don't necessarily absolutely believe the
11:03 way I'm saying this but to test the
11:07 integrity of man himself and I say him
11:11 and a by gender away so don't get all
11:14 butthurt that's to the new listeners but
11:19 the idea is do you have what it takes to
11:23 fight opposition because think about it
11:27 would you want to be in a house with a
11:29 bunch of lazy complicit people who have
11:34 an excuse why they can't do anything
11:36 ever hey you should make your business
11:38 more successful and I'm lazy well you
11:43 should you know stop what you're doing
11:45 since you seem to hate it so [ __ ]
11:46 much because you complain about it so
11:47 much you should go do something else I
11:50 know these people
11:52 un-fuckin'-believable how they live
11:54 their lives and they just sitting there
11:56 just negative constantly and you're just
11:59 like goddamn [ __ ] I've cut my own blood
12:02 line out of my [ __ ] life from the
12:04 [ __ ] like that when you're a parent you
12:06 have a kid you want to see your kid get
12:09 out there and kick some ass right they
12:11 don't have to do what you want them to
12:13 do they don't have to make as much money
12:14 as somebody else or anything like that
12:16 that's not what what we're talking about
12:19 here but you want to see them be clever
12:22 you know be like ah man you made it
12:24 through college that's cool
12:25 doesn't have to be college but you made
12:27 through some schooling and you you got
12:29 that job that you wanted that's awesome
12:31 and you had to fight for it because
12:33 there was a lot of folks going for that
12:34 job and you made it cool you know power
12:38 to the people that you knocked out of
12:39 the ring maybe they get it next time
12:41 around well they find something else
12:42 that they love but there's this
12:45 interesting thing of how do you build up
12:47 muscle in the human body
12:49 well you tear it by challenging it and
12:53 then you repair it and when it repairs
12:56 it repairs the more muscle in the tear
12:58 and you get bigger that's how you get
13:01 stronger all right
13:04 the kid who's an 18 year old who's been
13:07 a stockman for two years at some kiddin
13:10 B store or some sort and then he goes
13:11 into the Marines he's gonna do way
13:14 better than the kid who's been sitting
13:15 at Starbucks getting his free internet
13:18 to play World of Warcraft right that
13:21 kid's gonna roll along and potentially
13:23 die jogging down the street there was
13:26 this kid there was this Blizzcon they
13:29 had where a big fat kid got up and he
13:31 was trying to do the undead dance which
13:34 is his crazy heavy metal head banger
13:36 jump up and down thing he jumps up and
13:39 down he breaks his [ __ ] leg
13:41 the bone between your knee and your
13:43 ankle right just breaks that
13:44 son-of-a-bitch right in half and all I
13:47 could think of was fluoride it gives you
13:50 osteoporotic right it infects your bone
13:52 marrow with [ __ ] aluminum dust but
13:55 this kid he also just weights a goddamn
13:57 much he broke his leg jumping up and
13:59 down
13:59 holy [ __ ] what's wrong with our nation
14:01 he's not passing the test of physicality
14:04 at least right this saddens my soul man
14:08 what if our Creator was testing us what
14:12 if the craters like alright guys you
14:13 know yeah let you have the 1975 to 1991
14:18 reprieve in this world - the British
14:21 trying to grab the Falkland Islands why
14:25 the [ __ ] you would fight for that place
14:26 I don't know but America lived a pretty
14:28 goddamn good life I mean we had disco
14:31 and rap and metal music we had you know
14:34 role I should say rock and roll
14:36 initially and it became glam metal and
14:40 it became heavy metal thrash metal rap
14:43 got into gangster rap from classic rap
14:45 and we said a good world until grunge
14:49 came around and took a [ __ ] on
14:50 everything right and more so the
14:54 socialist the socialist idea of just
14:59 hitting like [ __ ] peasants when
15:01 you're privileged white kids just makes
15:03 me want a [ __ ] girl so God says you
15:06 know hey I'm gonna let this place go
15:08 dark in fact I'm gonna help people come
15:10 up with this goddamn idea that my music
15:12 should be negative all those uplifting
15:15 major Keys all gone it's gonna go super
15:17 minor key and you're gonna you're gonna
15:21 be me and the corner kind of [ __ ]
15:26 right nothing uplifting black people are
15:31 gonna be turned into their own nemesis
15:33 by promoting [ __ ] are you know women
15:37 are [ __ ] and hoes do tons of [ __ ]
15:40 weed you know when you're on bottom why
15:44 not just stay on bottom right now with
15:47 again there's great things that come out
15:49 of all suffering in terms of music that
15:51 you're like oh that's a great song
15:53 but I got to listen to the music wall
15:55 being on top in the 90s right so if I
15:59 listen to you know sipping on gin and
16:02 juice and all that [ __ ] and it's like
16:04 well I'm on top making more money than
16:06 my parents so I'm okay
16:08 I could even smoked a bowl every day if
16:10 I wanted to and I'd still be on top for
16:12 a little while until the bull finally
16:13 brought up my [ __ ] brain but whatever
16:15 World War one was a bunch of [ __ ]
16:19 they knock off this guy Franz Ferdinand
16:21 who again was an absolute idiot he drove
16:23 past his assassins who were gonna bomb
16:26 him and then he drops off his wife comes
16:29 back because his buddy got hit in the
16:32 first attack and so he drives back to
16:35 visit his buddy at the hospital and when
16:37 his Houston saw him and blew his brains
16:39 out but that supposedly pisses everybody
16:41 off to have a world war I don't think so
16:43 it was a way for everyone to borrow
16:46 money against fiat currency owned by the
16:49 you know Rothschild pace who were Empire
16:52 World War two well they built up Hitler
16:56 from scratch to protect Europe from
16:59 Stalin who was threatening to roll over
17:02 France where all the bankers were which
17:04 is why Paris just surrendered to Hitler
17:07 when the Americans wouldn't get into it
17:09 well they orchestrated this false flag
17:11 called Pearl Harbor Japanese bomb us
17:15 they definitely did some major damage
17:18 and God bless the souls that suffered
17:20 that day but they strategically had it
17:23 bombed in a way that had they flown a
17:25 little bit further inland they would
17:27 have knocked out all of our shipyards
17:28 repair facilities submarines and a bunch
17:31 of other stuff we would have been in
17:33 really bad condition but they didn't now
17:37 we're in the war
17:38 borrowing money when that was over well
17:41 we got a little bit of a reprieve right
17:42 for about six years until the Korean War
17:45 starts the police it's not a Korean war
17:48 it's a Korean police action and we're
17:51 over there for four or five years just
17:54 invading sovereign land under the guise
17:57 of fighting communism after we got out
18:01 of that well back into Vietnam repeat
18:03 the same exact [ __ ] going on
18:05 in Korea but in a different country for
18:08 the same ludicrous reasons by 75 it's
18:12 all over and again we get a 15-year
18:14 reprieve until Saddam Hussein asks the
18:16 State Department permission to invade
18:19 Kuwait the State Department says go for
18:21 it mr. CIA agent and he invades them and
18:24 then all of a sudden Saudi Arabia says
18:26 what the [ __ ] did you do telling that
18:27 guy he could go into Kuwait you know
18:29 where he's going next right over us
18:32 and so we asked him to get out and he's
18:34 like hey dude I asked permission I'm
18:36 [ __ ] embedded and so we went over and
18:40 did a light attack on him which is not
18:42 to go into Baghdad you have the highway
18:45 to hell where all these people died 18
18:48 war dogs just [ __ ] mowing down people
18:50 then everything's pretty cool the
18:52 Internet's blowing up Bill Clinton's
18:55 raping people and playing saxophone on
18:57 the Arsenio Hall Show 2001 poof reality
19:03 gets absolutely [ __ ] shattered we
19:06 still think to this day that we need
19:08 [ __ ] terrorists protection in
19:09 airports which is a crock of [ __ ] we've
19:12 lost all of our goddamn freedoms we're
19:13 completely easy dropped on the only one
19:16 that we don't have terrible problems
19:19 with there's probably the first three
19:21 amendments our first three of sorry Bill
19:24 of Rights so the freedom of speech the
19:26 right to bear arms and their right to
19:28 not how soldiers in our house right
19:31 everything else is going to [ __ ] the
19:34 Mueller and invasion of you know Trump's
19:39 attorney at the Trump Towers
19:40 there's no client/attorney privilege
19:43 that's being honored by the President of
19:45 the United States right or the Senate
19:49 right they're just allowing our [ __ ]
19:51 rights to be eroded communications
19:54 companies are forced to eavesdrop on us
19:57 and give all the information to the NSA
20:00 now there might be a technicality again
20:03 I think we're trusting the NSA a lot
20:05 more than we used to but technically it
20:08 could simply be by taking a copy of all
20:11 the communications in the world and
20:12 never looking at it you're not violating
20:13 the Fourth Amendment you have to get a
20:16 FISA warrant
20:18 to look inside and therefore we maintain
20:23 our basically our fourth amendment I
20:26 think that's the way it works and
20:28 therefore I think we're okay but I think
20:30 there are algorithms that are searching
20:31 the gathered data to look for trends the
20:35 tests of men are all these pedophiles
20:37 and child traffickers all over the world
20:39 to test man to see if we will stand up
20:43 we've got a religious institution called
20:44 the Catholic Church which is the single
20:46 most organized and protected pedophilia
20:49 human trafficking organization on planet
20:52 Earth and the Italians sit there like
20:54 nothing's [ __ ] happening
20:55 I mean isn't that [ __ ] unreal believe
20:59 me you you touch an Italian mobsters kid
21:04 the level of destruction that will
21:06 happen to your family and to you will be
21:10 as intense as humans can conceive but
21:15 you look at this Vatican place and
21:16 you're like wait a minute
21:17 that place is utterly packed with child
21:22 touches the current Pope as of 2019
21:25 comes from Argentina his [ __ ] Church
21:30 down there is absolutely packed to the
21:32 brim with these [ __ ] touching
21:34 kids so they organized a flight so all
21:41 these people come up from Argentina and
21:42 they fly through Cuba and they [ __ ]
21:44 shoot that plane down killing 13 people
21:46 from his little diocese or whatever the
21:49 hell you call his little pedophile ring
21:51 down there and it's like poof poof well
21:54 they're all dead now you know they got
21:55 the ultimate punishment so in a way we
21:58 served them but I'm sure there's some
22:00 guys down there they got we're in the
22:01 plane they were like [ __ ] I didn't touch
22:02 anybody but myself what would the test
22:07 entail all right well there's pedophiles
22:13 all over Hollywood there's not a
22:16 pedophiles but then there's people that
22:18 just force themselves on people but
22:21 we're we're so disappointed that the
22:24 people that we worship might be involved
22:28 with this kind of stuff that we tend to
22:30 go well you can't because it's time
22:32 you know and the girl on Twitter that
22:34 said that Tom Hanks bought her at the
22:37 age of 13 from her father who has 65,000
22:40 viewer of followers if not more by now
22:43 it's probably eight month old statistic
22:45 why isn't she being sued for defamation
22:47 that's a horrible horrible accusation if
22:50 Tom Hanks has nothing to do with her
22:53 then I would personally want him to be
22:56 exonerated from such an accusation and
22:59 then you look at his Instagram Twitter
23:02 feed and it's the most bizarre thing
23:04 you've ever seen in your life Joe Biden
23:07 is was on camera look up creepy Joe
23:10 Biden on YouTube the guy is pinching the
23:13 breasts of children he is putting his
23:16 junk against kids right on camera he was
23:21 involved with a lot of swearing in
23:23 ceremonies a lot of visits to the White
23:26 House and he would take the girls from
23:28 aged I'm Dean old enough to stand up on
23:31 their own he'd start there and then he'd
23:34 go all the way up to kids that are
23:35 probably about 16 17 years old and
23:39 during a swearing-in ceremony for the
23:42 kid's father the girl wants to sit
23:45 between her mother and her father on the
23:47 other side of the mom and Biden will
23:49 grab her arm hard you can see it on her
23:52 face like Jesus Christ you know and he
23:53 pulls her but before he does that he
23:55 reaches into his pants and adjusts his
23:57 [ __ ] junk and then he pulls her over
23:59 and then he stands there with her
24:02 hanging arm in her left arm he's trying
24:04 to put his dick on her left arm inside
24:08 his pants and you can see this girl who
24:10 should be paying attention to the
24:12 ceremony to her right where her father
24:14 is being sworn in for some reason
24:16 senator or whatever and she will hold
24:20 her arm her left arm way way away from
24:24 him because she feels the bump this guy
24:28 has grabbed the little boobs of tiny
24:30 little girls training bras you can even
24:32 see the training bra underneath the
24:34 blouse of the little girl and Joe
24:36 Biden's little hand goes down he's also
24:38 got his hand going through their hair
24:40 and he's he's whispering to her and you
24:43 see Jeff Sessions water SWAT his hand
24:45 point they all know he's a [ __ ]
24:48 pedophile but he's talking [ __ ] about
24:50 drunk I think you see the dark and I
24:53 think you see the light the dark always
24:56 slams the light De Niro makes Cape Fear
25:00 what skate fear about molesting a little
25:03 girl that's what the movies about he was
25:05 he got a [ __ ] problem finding other
25:07 scripts I don't think so but no he plays
25:12 one of these creepy [ __ ] pedophiles
25:13 and then talk [ __ ] about trumple hanging
25:15 out with the spirit cooking Lady
25:17 Democrats just tried to pass a goddamn
25:20 abortion law that says you can kill a
25:22 [ __ ] child all the way up to nine
25:24 months some of the reasons submitted to
25:26 their committee was well can a woman
25:29 choose not to have a child because it's
25:31 gonna make her vagina loose yes
25:34 can a woman choose to do this simply
25:38 because the child's got Down syndrome
25:39 yes any excuse any excuses the head is
25:44 crowning to the vagina that doctor can
25:47 go through a two-hour procedure to kill
25:49 that child the test of man is here my
25:51 people I don't mean to sound like some
25:54 goddamn religious nut but even if God
25:57 doesn't exist come on folks we're being
26:01 tested here we are being tested we're
26:03 being tested by people that think that
26:05 were too goddamn stupid to stand up for
26:07 our own again Democrats all live in
26:10 these gated communities with huge iron
26:15 fences slash cement fences around their
26:18 homes but they don't want a border on
26:20 the south side of the Americas because
26:23 all of the politicians in those states
26:26 the rumor is that they've all been put
26:29 there by the cartels slash alphabet
26:32 agencies and if they allow a wall to be
26:36 constructed on the state that they are
26:37 part of California Nevada Arizona and
26:40 Texas that they'll be murdered
26:44 unbelievable I'm not sure I believe that
26:47 but there's got to be a reason why
26:51 aside from importing voters you can't
26:54 import enough people to really sway the
26:57 vote to be honest
26:58 my opinion not yet the Mexicans I talk
27:00 to in my County here they're not there
27:03 for a border they're like yeah you want
27:06 a bunch of people coming up taking our
27:07 jobs either because they're going to
27:09 come for our jobs we mow lawns and
27:11 they're gonna mow lawns too we work as
27:14 you know short-order cooks they're gonna
27:15 become short-order cooks we want to keep
27:18 our jobs plus usually as long as the
27:22 immigrants can understand who is lying
27:24 to them they will always side with the
27:27 person who's telling the truth so let's
27:30 look at the Democratic Party for a split
27:32 second and there's evil on both sides of
27:35 the fence but it's being cleaned out at
27:37 a such a rapid pace by the Trump
27:40 administration everyone has been served
27:43 little paperwork and I'll give you a
27:46 republican paul ryan paul ryan organized
27:50 helped organized isis with hillary john
27:56 mccain obama he was photographed with
27:59 one of these Isis operatives after being
28:01 selected by John McCain look up John
28:05 McCain with Isis in Google and hit
28:08 images you'll see the complete traitor
28:11 that [ __ ] was and then look up
28:13 John McCain Forrestal accident which was
28:19 an accident but he got a hundred and
28:21 sixty-five of his own Air Force / Navy
28:25 folks killed and wasn't even in the
28:28 report of it occurring because his daddy
28:31 and his granddaddy were Navy Admirals
28:34 and they said don't let my grandson /
28:37 son be in the report so the guy causes
28:39 the death by what starting his his jet
28:43 which shook the jet so much a missile
28:46 fell off flew across the aircraft
28:49 carrier rainin you know slams into some
28:51 other planes setting off a bunch of
28:53 bombs over there 18 people remain
28:56 missing I don't even know where their
28:57 bodies were John heroically pops the cap
29:01 capsule lid on his jet rolls down jumps
29:05 10 feet down and rolls through the fire
29:07 cuz he's such a [ __ ] hero and then
29:10 goes downstairs helps push
29:11 few ammunition rigs off the side of the
29:15 boat and then he gets tired of that and
29:17 he goes into the officer's club and
29:19 watches the fire from in there all of
29:21 his buddies are dying that's why that
29:23 Navy called him No Name and then he gets
29:25 shot down all his injuries for from his
29:29 getting shot down not from being
29:31 tortured gives up all of our positions
29:33 all of our numbers off our strategies to
29:35 the Vietcong and yet he was allowed to
29:38 be celebrated as a hero there are real
29:41 heroes that we should be worshipping
29:43 they're not worshiping but celebrating
29:45 honoring he's not one of them his
29:50 daughter later tweeted after he died you
29:52 know something too effective I love you
29:54 daddy wherever you are
29:56 well it's hope he's in a hole in Gitmo
29:59 the Q phenomenon the q and on phenomenon
30:02 it's just so amazingly interesting you
30:07 know for me the verdicts still out on Q
30:09 it does seem like he has a proxy to
30:13 Donald Trump due to his tip-top
30:16 tippy-top comment I mean come on either
30:18 the Trump administration is watching the
30:19 q posts and having fun with it or he is
30:22 involved he even predicted with the damn
30:24 photograph the exact [ __ ] hotel in
30:26 Singapore where Trump was gonna go visit
30:28 Kim Jung like two weeks before it
30:31 happened he predicts John McCain's death
30:33 not only to the [ __ ] day but to the
30:35 goddamn minute 4:28 p.m. unless someone
30:38 messed with the clocks which I don't
30:40 think is possible because the second
30:41 time Q posts its screen captured and
30:45 even if you could mess with the hour by
30:47 taking it you know different time zones
30:49 pictures of different time zones the
30:51 thing is is when the server has its own
30:53 time zone that posts and becomes fixed
30:55 and you got the minutes right
30:57 4:28 p.m. and who the hell ever reports
31:01 someone's exact time of death perhaps
31:05 besides perhaps a person who was
31:10 executed in a prison you know getting
31:11 lethal injections but I would I would
31:14 bet that if I had a doctor right here
31:17 from a prison institution I go if you
31:20 had to really predict the minute that
31:21 the chemicals killed the guy could you
31:23 really know
31:24 you know without a stethoscope just
31:27 right on his chest you know hearing the
31:29 heartbeat fail or having a machine that
31:31 doesn't ping anymore so what would be
31:33 the priority of man being tested because
31:37 we're being tested on multiple levels
31:38 aren't we I don't actually know because
31:42 I haven't put a tremendous amount of
31:43 thought into this which one is more
31:44 urgent it seems that there are several
31:47 agendas that are as urgent as others
31:50 child trafficking child pedophilia I
31:53 think has to be one of the tip-top
31:55 things that we go after we have to
31:58 protect our children which means the
32:01 Catholic Church has to be disband and
32:06 disowned by every nation on planet Earth
32:08 their land has to be taxed I think
32:12 they're all their monies have to be
32:13 seized I think the church has to be
32:15 forced to cease to exist just simply due
32:18 to the pedophilia that is all over the
32:21 place I think the place needs to be
32:22 [ __ ] rated like every goddamn Church
32:24 Catholic Church on planet earth needs to
32:27 be rated by the top authorities of that
32:30 country and all of the information every
32:33 [ __ ] whereabouts of every single
32:35 [ __ ] Catholic priest none has to be
32:38 inspected I think every single claim
32:40 against the church has to be inspected
32:42 against whereabouts of these individuals
32:45 and I think that the victims need to
32:46 have reparations in proportion to their
32:49 suffering that is drawn out of the
32:52 treasures of the church if nothing else
32:55 if they run off and hide all their
32:57 [ __ ] treasures then one we need to
32:59 put them all in [ __ ] Gitmo until we
33:02 figure out what that [ __ ] is but nothing
33:03 else we saw the land we saw everything
33:08 we get rid of that scourge on the
33:11 [ __ ] face of the planet and then we
33:14 move down to all the derivatives of
33:16 Christianity till we find who's doing
33:20 what where now because it seems that
33:21 preachers are just goddamn pedophiles
33:25 you know again my my youth minister guy
33:28 named mark McDowell was busted at
33:31 Pepperdine University put in handcuffs
33:33 sentenced to two years in prison denied
33:35 everything but had five charges
33:38 and the word sodomy came up in his
33:40 charges there are [ __ ] everywhere and
33:43 they get off like nothing happened man
33:46 half the time right because the judges
33:48 are something
33:49 have some sympathy [ __ ] bone for
33:51 these people I don't know how it works
33:52 man
33:53 now every circumstance is different
33:55 again I had a friend in high school he
33:59 was 17 his girlfriend was 16 I think
34:02 then he crossed the 18 barrier and they
34:06 were six months apart in age and so she
34:09 was 17 and a half he was 18 but her
34:11 father was a sheriff in some County
34:13 neighboring County to my County and he
34:16 got put in jail for underage sex because
34:21 the sheriff knew how to follow the
34:22 paperwork and knew that he was older and
34:25 she didn't have parental consent which I
34:28 think my hometown there was a girl again
34:30 I've said it once before our girl was 14
34:32 years old dropped out of junior high
34:33 became a mom married her 15 year old
34:36 boyfriend all families consented to it
34:39 and they turned out to be pretty damn
34:42 awesome but they also lost contact with
34:44 all of us there's no high school reunion
34:46 and if we see them we just don't know
34:49 them because they're like oh you know
34:50 they they were the ones that dropped out
34:51 of school way back a long time ago but
34:54 they spoke well they were well
34:55 articulated and raised some decent kids
34:57 but didn't that sound like heresy didn't
35:00 sound like I was trying to destroy the
35:01 Catholic religion I'm sorry the
35:03 Christian religion excuse me
35:05 it's not what I'm trying to do there's
35:08 plenty of organizations that keep their
35:10 their whistle clean what form of
35:14 religion would come out of the Christian
35:15 movement if you could make sure that if
35:18 you're going to practice the Christian
35:21 faith that you have extra eyeballs on
35:23 all your personnel to make sure they're
35:25 not touching the kids one of my close
35:28 friends here in Los Angeles the preacher
35:30 was dude the Biden Biden thing her
35:32 beautiful daughter started complaining
35:35 that the preacher always grabbed her and
35:38 pushed him back against his junk and she
35:40 didn't have a way to really describe it
35:42 but they finally just said okay well
35:44 we're gonna keep an eye on you and see
35:46 if this happens again and sure enough
35:48 they caught him doing it and they do
35:49 went to jail
35:51 what's up with these [ __ ] men they're
35:54 easy to find they're [ __ ] easy to
35:56 find but that's just one category of the
36:00 test the other tests that I think we're
36:02 starting to pass with the very first
36:03 time in a very long time is the notion
36:06 of propaganda fake news there are people
36:11 on CNN ABC NBC CBS MSNBC CNBC Comedy
36:20 Central that lie 24/7 and I mean
36:25 absolute mockingbirds candidates who did
36:29 their internship at the CIA
36:31 un-fuckin'-believable obsessed with
36:35 stories that have no backing evidence
36:37 whatsoever big nothing burgers and
36:41 there's more than one nothing burger out
36:42 there and we allow them to get hundreds
36:46 of millions of dollars a year for lying
36:49 to us now it's a free market it's a free
36:52 world you know I think that the Senate
36:56 should pass repast the law that says
36:58 that if you [ __ ] lie on the news it's
37:01 a felony with hefty goddamn mandatory
37:06 jail sentences and not only is the
37:10 broadcaster the individual sorry the the
37:12 spokesman of the network immediately
37:16 guilty of the felony but every single
37:18 person all the way up to the editor goes
37:20 to jail I think the board of directors
37:23 should go to jail so Alice what does an
37:26 Anderson Cooper lies having been a
37:28 Mockingbird candidate and the CIA hat
37:30 being a [ __ ] Vanderbilt himself his
37:33 mother's involved in one of the most
37:34 satanic [ __ ] cults on planet earth
37:36 his brothers probably [ __ ] sacrificed
37:38 in this cult the god Tim Pope at the
37:40 time when Pope back where is the same
37:43 [ __ ] name like the current one does
37:44 too from this satanic cult and the guy
37:48 lies to the American people about
37:49 something hands behind your back
37:53 [ __ ] this is gonna be tight and
37:56 this is gonna hurt and you're never
37:57 gonna see the light of day you want to
38:00 turn in all your buddies maybe maybe you
38:03 see the light of day
38:05 but you're gonna do some mandatory time
38:06 my friend but now what would the test
38:09 sort of be you know what would be the
38:11 end results for the test the test I
38:14 think is it's almost like the Super Bowl
38:18 how [ __ ] ironic I didn't plan this
38:20 but you have the test between evil and
38:24 good all right who's gonna win I don't
38:30 know
38:30 get your [ __ ] popcorn it's gonna be
38:31 awesome right maybe our creators don't
38:34 give a [ __ ] who wins they just want to
38:36 find out who does win but you would
38:40 think you would think that if these evil
38:43 [ __ ] win it's sort of like the
38:46 Klingon Empire right how do you get a
38:48 promotion the Klingon Empire you have to
38:51 kill your superior that is simply the
38:53 way it works you don't get elected to
38:55 take over you kill your superior so if
38:59 you have a bunch of these evil [ __ ]
39:01 making it through this test and being
39:04 allowed to continue to prosper then as
39:07 soon as they have the ability to ascend
39:09 to some celestial realm they are going
39:12 to try and kill God because that's the
39:14 kind of people they are so that's why I
39:17 think that there's a simple choice and I
39:20 think that's why my episode my
39:23 particular definition of an NPC it's not
39:28 just a Mockingbird person but an actual
39:31 simulated human being that is down here
39:34 to [ __ ] with us to see if we've got the
39:37 the Moxie to stand up for ourselves
39:41 right how many videos do you see where
39:45 you feel good about the bully beating
39:47 the [ __ ] out of the little kid not too
39:50 many I would imagine less you're a sick
39:52 [ __ ] right some psychopath but when the
39:56 scrawny little kid punches the oversized
39:59 fat kid who's two grades higher than him
40:02 picking on him because he hates himself
40:05 because he's allowed himself to eat too
40:06 many [ __ ] pieces of pie and he gets
40:09 leveled by some scrawny little kid
40:11 happened in my hometown all the time you
40:14 feel this joy of God come through your
40:17 system
40:18 when you see the little guy take out
40:19 Goliath you do believe me that is an
40:24 algorithm of truth of defending yourself
40:26 against evil now it's not that we
40:30 necessarily want another young kid to
40:32 perish or suffer some you know permanent
40:37 damage we don't want the fat kid to die
40:39 all of a sudden we want the fat kid to
40:41 learn what the hell he's doing because
40:42 he has a lesson to learn as well and the
40:44 only way he's gonna listen is when he
40:46 gets clocked in the chin and he passes
40:48 out for five to ten minutes and he
40:52 realizes that's not a way to live and
40:54 bullies always back down once they get
40:56 leveled it's just the case talk to any
40:59 anyone who's ever been bullied they'll
41:02 tell you the same same thing man stand
41:04 up for yourself plus if you're being
41:06 bullied well you're gonna feel amazing
41:08 once you stick up for yourself just try
41:09 not to break the law you don't need to
41:11 be in prison simply because someone else
41:13 was being an [ __ ] to you right now
41:16 well I'm ranting on about how we should
41:19 solve some of our problems I also need
41:21 to put in the narrative that there are
41:23 people like George Soros and the deep
41:26 state in general that are definitely
41:28 trying to create civil wars all around
41:30 the world because as long as there's
41:32 civil wars they can do a bunch of weird
41:33 [ __ ] while we're not paying attention I
41:36 definitely believe that this Muslim
41:38 immigration movement into Europe was to
41:40 create a civil war within Europe the
41:44 funny thing was they so cut the balls
41:47 off of everybody in Europe and too many
41:51 people in Europe are willing to have
41:52 their balls cut off that and again the
41:56 yellow vests
41:57 two thumbs up a for the day a plus for
42:01 the day any of those people that are
42:02 fighting back because they are the
42:07 they're the archetype of man somebody
42:11 who's like you know I [ __ ] you I'm not
42:13 I'm not putting up with your macron
42:16 Rothschild goddamn agent being my
42:19 president sorry but you know we know
42:24 that across Europe as these Muslims have
42:26 raped and murdered and destroyed cities
42:32 because they're [ __ ] Neanderthals
42:35 right now the people that stayed in the
42:37 Middle East are not like these people
42:39 let's make a distinction but the people
42:41 that are migrating in are the bottom of
42:43 the barrel that's why they're not taking
42:45 any of their own immigrants right
42:46 they're not cross immigrating into other
42:48 countries in the Middle East they're
42:50 coming straight to this soro sponsored
42:54 invasion but they RAM sack a street and
42:58 then if you take a photograph of it you
43:01 can be put in jail over there if your
43:03 daughter is raped and murdered [ __ ]
43:06 like 12 year old kids you can't report
43:08 it to the police because they won't file
43:10 your report because merkel the daughter
43:13 of a da [ __ ] hitler go look that [ __ ]
43:17 up you know hitler and his wife
43:19 retreated to argentina hope that's not a
43:21 big shock to you guys he lived
43:23 approximately to 1965 the wife lived
43:26 about 1968 Merkel well she could have
43:29 been born anywhere along that line she
43:31 actually changed her birthday to be her
43:33 father's birthday
43:34 but her technical birthday's 1954 I will
43:37 tell you I got a mother who's 70 she
43:39 looks about as old as my mom and that
43:41 would have been 1946 doesn't matter she
43:44 could have been born in 54 but then
43:47 she's raised by the Russians in East
43:51 Germany supposedly right and that's why
43:54 she never says anything bad about Putin
43:56 or the Russians because they took care
43:58 of her as a kid now it's weird that two
44:00 of her childhood friends are also
44:01 equally
44:03 raised in a peasant community in East
44:06 Germany and they're all three of them
44:08 are like absolute mega successful and
44:12 either running bizarre child trafficking
44:14 corporations or countries the two many
44:19 Europeans are so docile which I don't
44:24 understand necessarily I don't
44:27 understand how they got that way
44:28 nationalism too many wars they fought
44:30 between each other too many Versailles
44:33 treaties where they were like you can't
44:35 have a standing army you can't defend
44:37 yourself crazy [ __ ] I don't know I don't
44:41 understand it I don't live over there
44:44 but the yellow vests
44:46 are probably one of the most encouraging
44:49 things I have seen since probably the
44:54 protests of Vietnam that happened when I
44:57 was a little kid and it's a sad thing I
45:00 mean you look at the protests of Vietnam
45:01 think about it obviously we don't want
45:04 to disrespect soldiers that are being
45:06 drafted into the military okay
45:09 they had no choice people so they're
45:12 drafted and then you know once they're
45:14 drafted by the deep state because they
45:17 convince the US military that there's
45:19 something worth fighting for it Vietnam
45:22 okay it's your son it's your brother
45:25 it's your father and they're being
45:28 sucked into this war and they have no
45:29 goddamn choice so what do you want for
45:32 them you want them to come home safely
45:34 which means you don't want them to die
45:35 and so when they come home safely from
45:38 this forced war people were spitting on
45:43 them it's like what the [ __ ] people I
45:47 know your hippy and you know you've got
45:49 it plenty of money to sit around in
45:51 communes all [ __ ] day but I don't get
45:54 it
45:55 protest the war all you want yellow
45:57 chair senators for creating the draft
46:00 but don't piss on the guys and girls who
46:03 had to go over and do it and what the
46:05 hell was the difference between the
46:06 Korean War and the Vietnam War people
46:08 didn't come home from Korea that I know
46:10 of and get spit on luckily we have
46:13 solved that problem I think for the for
46:16 the most part soldiers that come home
46:17 today are revered for being soldiers
46:21 even though the theatres of war that
46:24 they are forced into in Afghanistan and
46:26 Iraq and various other locations that
46:30 are usually kept quiet because we're not
46:33 supposed to be in certain countries or
46:34 at least trading number with respect
46:35 when they get home they're not failing
46:39 the test our soldiers are not failing
46:41 the test especially if they come home
46:42 safely they've passed a horrible test
46:45 that they shouldn't have been pulled in
46:46 in the first place and we should be very
46:48 thankful that anyone would join the
46:50 military to defend the Constitution of
46:53 the United States but now we have to
46:56 make sure as citizens
46:58 that we also defend the Constitution
47:02 United States we don't allow our gun
47:05 rights to be compromised we don't allow
47:07 freedom of speech to be compromised now
47:11 let me make a distinction of what I said
47:13 earlier about newscasters going to jail
47:15 for lying to the people it's one thing
47:18 to have an opinion like I have right you
47:21 have an opinions argot they're like
47:22 [ __ ] we all have them right it's
47:25 another thing to prop yourself up as an
47:27 authoritarian of actual reality and lie
47:31 about people causing them you know in
47:36 some cases extreme grief there's this
47:40 thing that recently happened with a kid
47:43 who had it stand in front of the [ __ ]
47:45 crisis actor Native American who lied
47:48 about his entire military record in
47:50 Vietnam said he went to Vietnam but he
47:53 didn't go
47:53 he was an air conditioned no he's a
47:55 refrigerator repair guy who never went
47:58 overseas telling the press just kind of
48:01 riding the fine line between I went to
48:04 Vietnam and I didn't but I was a Vietnam
48:06 time soldier you know just trying to lie
48:09 then you have these black guys that are
48:11 over there
48:12 you weren't like any black guys that I
48:14 know on planet [ __ ] Earth with some
48:17 Israeli [ __ ] Alliance thing okay why
48:21 man the free speech on them but they
48:23 exacerbated the situation the white kids
48:26 just sitting there going Jesus you got a
48:28 drum in my face he's a child he is a
48:31 [ __ ] child by any standard right he's
48:33 a very young man this put that way and
48:35 he's just keeping his cool and he knows
48:37 if he reacts he's gonna be in trouble
48:39 and he didn't all the kids behind him
48:41 were cool he's black guys you're yelling
48:44 all this [ __ ] racist [ __ ] then the
48:47 Native Americans are the black guys get
48:49 into it I mean unbelievable right but
48:54 that's that was their opinion to do that
48:57 and that was their freedom of speech to
48:58 say all those things okay but then the
49:01 press got on top of it and started lying
49:02 about all the events that occurred lying
49:05 about the events that occurred told you
49:07 things that happened that didn't
49:10 happen you can just watch the [ __ ]
49:14 video it was a catastrophe for you for
49:17 all the mass media wasn't it because
49:19 they all had to run around deleting a
49:20 lot of tweets but you know what is it
49:24 BuzzFeed didn't retract it CNN didn't
49:27 retract it and we're sitting on the
49:29 sidelines going alright we do our
49:33 research we find out this is all
49:34 [ __ ] and we dislike those [ __ ]
49:36 Bocking bird chills for what they are
49:39 but you know a good majority way over 50
49:43 per 1 percent of this country believe
49:46 everything that they were told
49:48 I keep people in my life that believe
49:51 everything that they're told because I
49:52 want to find out how bad it is right
49:54 it's pretty [ __ ] bad it is pretty bad
49:58 man so are we passing this test I don't
50:03 know I would say the people that are
50:06 following queueing on and again I'm
50:09 gonna say this over and over and over
50:10 and over even if he's a live-action
50:12 role-playing exercise even if he's some
50:16 weird psy up you know everyone could be
50:18 deceived into some light and then the
50:21 door shut the lights turn off and it
50:22 goes dark so everyone could be pipehype
50:25 herd into something really negative i
50:27 would say that the check zone for Cuba
50:31 not being real
50:32 at least in his intent is he's waking up
50:35 the minds of tens of millions of people
50:39 on this planet which is still a minority
50:40 right again
50:42 500 million that's like one person
50:46 little over 1% of the population so even
50:49 if he had 500 million people he's only
50:51 got 1% of the population but there's an
50:54 interesting thing that the Western world
50:56 controls the the benefits of the third
50:59 world countries and so if you can just
51:01 convince Western world's to wake the
51:03 [ __ ] up put on a yellow vest and change
51:06 the world or however you can do it in
51:09 your region then that is not something I
51:12 think that any deep state official would
51:14 ever want to have happen this there
51:16 there's not a real case for the FOA
51:19 wakening of mankind
51:21 because cue wakes you up to everything
51:24 the pedophilia the banking the
51:27 manipulation of resources and countries
51:31 that take them over the the whole the
51:33 whole point of the book economic hitman
51:37 right the economic hitman book
51:39 unbelievable
51:41 I made a episode that I pulled because I
51:45 think the evidence of what I was trying
51:46 to make a point of dwindled considerably
51:49 which is why I made it a special report
51:51 in the first place but it was called a
51:52 cue a non moment which is what if the
51:57 cue and on guy dropped the video that is
52:01 rumored to be out there of Hillary
52:03 Clinton and UBA UBA Dean killing raping
52:06 and killing a small girl on Lolita
52:08 Island owned by Jeffrey Epstein who
52:12 again just got away with [ __ ] highway
52:14 murder when it comes to human
52:16 trafficking because he's got everyone by
52:18 the balls cuz he has a bunch of [ __ ]
52:20 video tapes of everybody raping
52:21 everybody and we allowed it to happen
52:25 Hugh doesn't want a lot to happen Donald
52:29 Trump it doesn't want to allow it to
52:30 happen but there's gonna have to be a
52:32 big takedown before this guy sees any
52:35 justice but again like I said in the
52:37 Karma episode if Jeffrey Epstein died
52:39 today of some mild heart attack or even
52:42 a severe heart attack or got
52:43 electrocuted or lethal injection he will
52:46 have lived 95% of his entire life
52:49 exactly to his demonic [ __ ] desires
52:53 and whatever we do to that guy from this
52:56 point on it will never serve any justice
52:58 to him whatsoever these people get away
53:01 with highway murder so usually in the
53:04 conversation where it looks like
53:07 humanity has to take a stand
53:10 otherwise humanity won't exist anymore
53:12 there is the question of okay yes we all
53:17 agree we need to make some changes how
53:19 do we make these changes do we get
53:22 militant do we simply vote hmm I think
53:30 the number one thing we can do at this
53:31 point is to solidify the definition of a
53:34 Democrat
53:35 an individual that endorses people that
53:39 are known for killing raping child
53:43 trafficking pay-to-play organizations
53:45 like the Clinton Foundation
53:47 people who sell our uranium to the enemy
53:50 people who sell the launch codes and of
53:53 our secret communications methodologies
53:55 to the enemy people who don't really
53:58 have Harvard degrees because a prince
54:00 and Saudi Arabia got your degree
54:02 purchased for you people with fake birth
54:04 certificates people with fake war
54:07 Records like John McCain who were
54:09 complete goddamn traitors people like
54:13 John Kerry that run around trying to
54:15 keep horrible Iranian deals going when
54:19 it undermines the absolute strength of
54:22 the United States of America and the
54:23 rest of the world
54:24 poor Vince Foster is shot in the back of
54:27 the head rolled up in a carpet and found
54:28 in some park and his death was ruled a
54:33 suicide so all the cops that are
54:35 involved in that the coroner's that do
54:37 that stuff people organized false Flags
54:40 school shootings that really kill people
54:43 all those people let's define them all
54:47 as Democrats and move them all into the
54:49 same camp they believe that they have
54:53 essentially a satanic rule over mankind
54:56 and that they don't have any need for
54:58 empathy whatsoever it is their ilk
55:02 against our ilk but just like the movie
55:06 bug's life from Pixar they're just a few
55:08 [ __ ] grasshoppers and there's a whole
55:11 [ __ ] ton of us ants
55:13 I would like to wager we're the
55:16 grasshoppers they're the ants but they
55:18 put on masks and they've a doctrine
55:20 aided us to not understand that we're
55:22 all equally capable of kicking ass and
55:25 taking names the weirdest thing is is
55:28 that because we're good people because
55:30 we care about other people
55:32 we're empathetic towards other people
55:34 suffering is it that God wants us to
55:37 turn the cheek and take it hmm well for
55:43 those of you believe Christianity and a
55:45 lot of other religions God has been a
55:47 wrathful being many times
55:50 so I find it interesting the people that
55:52 believe that God would have a guy
55:53 threatened to kill his son you know put
55:56 a [ __ ] dagger right up to his goddamn
55:58 throat and the guy goes just kidding or
56:02 when Moses comes down off the hill with
56:05 his tablets and says this is your last
56:08 chance [ __ ] get off that golden
56:12 calf over there otherwise shits gonna go
56:15 down and they're like [ __ ] you man and
56:17 all this Lightning comes down boom and
56:19 everybody dies well it seems that God
56:22 doesn't play games does he I'm not sure
56:26 that's God but isn't it absolutely
56:29 positively easy to confirm the Chuck
56:33 Schumer Nancy Pelosi atom shift and all
56:38 the people that support them and get on
56:40 their bandwagon are all [ __ ]
56:43 criminals that work for the deep state
56:45 is it not completely obvious a big chunk
56:48 of California just vaporized there is I
56:53 think proof positive that some sort of
56:56 weapon was used to do it
56:58 you've got neighborhoods that just the
57:01 houses are white ash but there's still
57:03 trees in the front yard that are green
57:06 there was one where there was a road
57:08 that went way out to a house and it
57:10 burns straight to the ground but all the
57:12 trees around that house all the way back
57:14 down the road are fine no burn marks at
57:18 all so how the hell of the house burned
57:20 down either that guy engaged in the
57:22 worst idea of insurance fraud or someone
57:26 hit his house with some goddamn weapon
57:28 set it on fire this so happens all the
57:32 houses that burned down really coincide
57:35 with where they want to put the
57:36 high-speed rail I don't know if this
57:38 next thing I'm about to say is true but
57:39 I've heard from million developers up in
57:41 Santa Rosa and what is it Calistoga that
57:48 Governor Jerry Brown is involved in the
57:51 land development organizations that just
57:55 seem to move in to buy the land every
57:56 time there's a big fire up there Jerry
57:59 Brown was also linked to a weapons
58:02 Factory was a chemical weapons Factory
58:05 in Syria that was bombed when they did
58:07 the fake gas attack which was fake
58:11 it was orchestrated to justify what is
58:15 111 Tomahawk missiles going into Syria
58:17 and bombing all these strategic targets
58:19 none of which were Russian very few
58:22 Syrian soldiers were hurt this is per
58:25 their own press but Trump wanted to get
58:28 rid of some strategic targets that were
58:31 part of the deep state organization and
58:32 he did it are we passing the test do we
58:37 understand what the test is do we
58:39 understand the severity of the test how
58:42 important it is at this point to start
58:44 making distinctions imagine a video of
58:47 just the stuff we know about Biden
58:50 grabbing kids boobs rubbing his junk up
58:54 against girls
58:55 the next frames is this is a Democrat
59:00 play De Niro saying he'd take Trump
59:02 around the back and punch him in the
59:03 face or whatever Biden said it too and
59:05 then play the spirit cooking lady
59:09 dumping pig's blood all over an idol and
59:11 writing up on the wall that if you you
59:13 must slice the back of your left finger
59:15 and left middle finger and eat the pain
59:17 and then show De Niro at dinner with the
59:21 spear cooking lady show Obama with this
59:25 little tiny girl with a band-aid on the
59:26 middle of finger of his left hand show
59:29 John Podesta holding up his hands like
59:30 this with some Masonic [ __ ] in his palms
59:32 with a bandaid on his left middle finger
59:35 show John Podesta allegedly torturing a
59:41 kid in a shower with a bunch of [ __ ]
59:42 glow lights making him scream his
59:44 nickname Skippy then play the interview
59:47 with Tony Podesta saying you know when
59:49 John was a kid we used to call him
59:51 Skippy these are your Democrats this is
59:54 a Democrat right I never would have ever
59:57 thought that we would have it all
60:01 aligned on one party side in my lifetime
60:04 I thought it would always be both sides
60:07 right was it Lindsey Graham the senator
60:11 potentially was on the inside helping
60:13 out all these deep Staters and
60:15 eventually Trump got
60:16 him and said either you flip and become
60:20 an ally or you're [ __ ] and when John
60:23 McCain died on the at the funeral you
60:26 have the two generals that kept their
60:30 eye on Lindsey Graham while he was
60:32 hugging who Abidine right the woman from
60:35 the [ __ ] Arab Brotherhood who got top
60:37 security clearance in 1996 because of
60:39 the Clintons with no background check
60:42 whatsoever and if you haven't read the
60:45 website for the Arab Brotherhood you
60:47 need to go look that up because it's
60:49 world domination by absolutely
60:51 destroying everyone else's religion but
60:52 Sharia law but he hugged her a couple
60:55 times and then he looked really [ __ ]
60:57 nervous at the funeral and then the
61:00 general looked over and went like this
61:02 with his finger like we got your number
61:04 [ __ ] we're gonna have a little
61:06 meeting tonight and then eventually
61:08 Lindsey went over and talked to one of
61:10 them and the next day I believe it was
61:13 the very next day during the Cavanaugh
61:15 hearings Lindsey Graham said mr.
61:19 Cavanaugh could you please explain to us
61:21 how a civilian could be tried in a
61:24 military tribunal since it's reserved
61:27 for military personnel only and they
61:31 cited the case from I believe the
61:32 Nuremberg trials where civilians who
61:36 colluded with the enemy were actually
61:38 able to be tried in military tribunals
61:41 case law right in front of everyone's
61:44 face right when Z was on the other side
61:47 the very next day that Bush senior's
61:50 funeral December 5th supposedly there
61:54 was some really damning testimony going
61:56 on in the Senate and then they dropped
61:58 seniors body and I've never seen Jeb so
62:02 [ __ ] happy then at his dad's funeral
62:04 laughing up a storm right until as soon
62:09 as the this casket went by the camera
62:11 the secret agent bald guy behind George
62:15 Bush jr. started passing out all these
62:17 pieces of paper really thick pieces of
62:19 paper and everybody thought it was just
62:22 a thought it was a you know a piece of
62:27 paper regarding the funeral you know
62:28 here's your program for the funeral
62:29 but you know that works when you walk
62:31 into a church you get the program at the
62:33 door jam you don't get it inside the
62:35 goddamn sum ceremony
62:36 especially when the caskets being passed
62:38 out there's a video of Laura Bush
62:41 seeming very disturbed and a cry state
62:46 which you would assume cuz it's a
62:47 funeral George Bush jr. is standing up
62:49 to his dad's casket again his dad could
62:53 be alive his that could be of dead
62:55 before the fifth and they just rolled
62:56 that body out right on top of this
62:58 moment where this Senate or II said it
63:01 testimony was going to occur I don't I
63:02 don't know if that aborted the testimony
63:04 or that covered it up but you see Laura
63:07 Bush and she's reading this thing and
63:09 she's disgusted and Jeb is looking at
63:11 his brother and he's got this really
63:13 happy face until Laura goes look and he
63:18 looks down at it and within a split
63:19 second this is what's strange he didn't
63:22 have enough time to really read anything
63:23 he looks over at someone else in the
63:27 distance with this face of like oh my
63:28 god come on you didn't do this at my
63:30 dad's funeral [ __ ] you were just
63:32 [ __ ] happy as a clam two seconds ago
63:34 and everyone's looking at this
63:36 mysterious envelope Hillary Clinton and
63:39 Bill got there's Barack Obama and the
63:41 ship Michael Obama got there's the Bush
63:44 family got there's now milena is also
63:46 holding a piece of paper but she even
63:48 looking at hers everyone got served
63:51 potentially so who knows what's going on
63:55 right but now imagine that you have
64:00 grown-ups coming to the White House
64:02 cleaning up the mess the NSA is not your
64:06 enemy they're actually your defender the
64:09 military isn't really there actually
64:11 your defender for the first time in a
64:12 really long time these generals got
64:14 [ __ ] sick and tired of this crap and
64:17 again the way I see it is that the the
64:20 stories come out too many times this
64:21 archetype of a story is repeated itself
64:23 over and over and over again which is
64:25 that the the NSA started spying on the
64:30 world and right after 9/11 right and I
64:33 think they started bumping into the
64:35 child trafficking [ __ ] and I think that
64:37 they got utterly mortified by what was
64:40 going on it was a lot more severe than
64:41 they thought and I
64:43 some of these guys again they're
64:44 sweethearts there they absolutely fight
64:46 for their country they believe in the
64:48 Constitution and they went this is bad
64:52 this is really bad let's start an
64:55 investigation to figure out how far this
64:58 rabbit hole goes right and I think they
65:02 found that it was everywhere and it was
65:06 in the politicians that tell them what
65:09 to do they control their budgets and I
65:13 think that they got real quiet right
65:16 it's my personal belief that the day
65:18 that the White House dropped the fake
65:21 birth certificate of Obama which we've
65:23 now confirmed as someone else's birth
65:25 certificate he and the Italian forensics
65:28 team figured it out
65:29 they found the original and confirmed
65:32 that 76% of the pixels were identical to
65:34 this other guy's birth certificate Trump
65:38 was going after the birther issue trying
65:40 to knock out Obama and I think someone
65:42 just whispered in his ear chill out dude
65:45 we got a much bigger purpose for you you
65:49 know how you said you'd run for
65:50 president if things got really shitty
65:52 well we're gonna get you in and we're
65:57 gonna get you in because you stand for
65:59 what's right people also stand for
66:01 what's right and we're simply going to
66:03 protect the vote for the very first time
66:05 in a long time now we know that voter
66:07 fraud is still going on like crazy and
66:09 the crazy thing is every single [ __ ]
66:13 time we find votes that have been cast
66:16 by dead people illegal immigrants every
66:20 single time they're Democrat votes so
66:23 what do you think that's the Republican
66:24 Party doing that [ __ ] the real party is
66:27 in the direct center again when I go
66:30 back to the Midwest I don't hear any
66:31 radical right-wing ideas right again
66:34 like I've said in my entire life of my
66:36 hometown there were two people I met
66:39 which was the son of the vice principal
66:41 of our junior high I guess he was
66:45 confiding in me in front of a couple
66:46 other people at a Pizza Hut on Cherry
66:48 Street which is now something else that
66:52 maybe it still is I don't know but he
66:55 talked about the blacks
66:56 now they were you know invade the
66:58 country or whatever like what the [ __ ]
67:00 are you talking about this what your
67:02 father taught you cuz they're already
67:04 here and they help build the country you
67:05 idiot and then my my cousin's wife's
67:09 father said the same [ __ ] blacks
67:13 invading America and I'm like what the
67:15 [ __ ] are you talking about dude invading
67:18 one of their new boats coming over from
67:19 Africa you [ __ ]
67:21 [ __ ] racist no one else in my family
67:24 no none of my other friends have ever
67:27 said anything like that ever dan if we
67:31 all told a bunch of racist jokes yeah
67:32 but let me tell you big [ __ ] spoiler
67:35 pulic jokes were the number one jokes
67:37 when I was a kid
67:38 second - no that was the first the
67:41 second was the Ethiopian jokes which
67:43 went around when I was a kid but all the
67:46 racist jokes from like way back in the
67:48 30s and 40s yeah no you're my final old
67:52 guy saying that but he's sitting right
67:54 next to a black guy or who's telling a
67:55 white joke you know it's just we're all
67:58 buddies we're all like Richard Pryor
67:59 disciples that are just like hey where's
68:02 having fun blowing off steam we know
68:04 that we're different and this is the way
68:05 we get to know each other and laugh
68:07 about it right but no one is ceasing to
68:10 help their friend because of a skin
68:12 colour right stupid but that's no longer
68:17 the way it is anymore
68:19 we've cleaned it up I think one guy that
68:22 I haven't done a an episode on and I
68:24 don't think I could probably do a full
68:26 episode on the guy but I want to throw
68:27 out some props is Julian Assange Julian
68:31 Assange is probably one of the single
68:33 biggest heroes including his team of
68:35 course for getting Trump into office and
68:39 to expose a ton of the deep state and
68:43 coincidentally again in the Democratic
68:46 Party number Mexicans were taco truck
68:49 voters the amount of slurs against
68:52 blacks are countless candace owns is
68:55 unshackling as she would metaphorically
68:59 put it the blacks from the Democratic
69:01 Party she's saying look they're
69:03 exploiting you and they've always been
69:05 exploiting you /us she's one of the most
69:08 brilliant
69:11 women on planet earth she just happens
69:14 to be black which is awesome so she can
69:16 get people to listen to her you know
69:19 she's like I'm one of you look we've
69:20 been completely duped by this thing the
69:22 Democrats voted against abolishing
69:24 slavery they found the [ __ ] KKK but
69:28 you'll hear that [ __ ] on Facebook by
69:31 some ignorant Hillbillies who still
69:33 believe the Democratic Party is the
69:35 party for the minorities what a [ __ ]
69:37 joke I think the number one thing that
69:40 we need to do to start passing the test
69:43 is starting to wake the [ __ ] up the
69:46 start calling it like it is and stop
69:49 worrying about some goddamn useless
69:52 social justice warrior who is
69:55 unemployable contributing nothing to
69:57 society draining the the coffers of
70:00 halls you know socialistic programs
70:03 trying to make the world more
70:04 socialistic so again rich people have
70:08 all their money stolen and again there's
70:10 some rich scumbags yeah I get it but
70:13 what if you personally make a ton of
70:15 money and someone says I need your money
70:16 to pay my bills again the still phrase
70:20 right socialism only works until you run
70:22 out of other people's money and that's
70:25 the truth we are nowhere near Gene
70:27 Roddenberry's vision of the future
70:30 that's where we need to go but we're
70:32 nowhere near that right now so we need
70:35 to stop pretending that that's where we
70:36 are I just watched a great there's a
70:39 great channel on YouTube called
70:40 simplified and it's about history this
70:44 guy does these cartoon versions of
70:45 history and again a lot of his history
70:48 is the official history so some of you
70:50 will gag with some of it but he just
70:53 covered the in fact it was a slight he
70:58 covered it too but there's a different
70:59 channel too it's very similar to him
71:00 these cartoon History Channel's what it
71:03 was called
71:03 extra extra history I think is what it's
71:06 called and he did one on the opium wars
71:10 of China where Britain and the Honorable
71:14 Eastern Indian company forced opium into
71:18 China because they had a huge trade
71:21 deficit with China when they tried to
71:22 buy the black tea from
71:24 and eventually China was like hey you
71:27 guys are really you know engaging in a
71:34 bunch of weird behavior in our Docs and
71:36 so we want this to end but you know
71:40 Britain uses soldiers and it's Indian
71:43 mercenaries to go in and destroy China
71:46 until the Emperor conceded importing
71:49 tons of opium that's grown in India at
71:51 the time to get the whole country strung
71:53 out on this stuff and so eventually
71:56 China got everything under control but I
72:00 believe it's called something like the
72:02 unequal treaty something like that it's
72:05 still in the psyche of Chinese people
72:08 today that whitey engages in horrible
72:13 trade agreements they lie they renege on
72:15 their agreements and so now when we try
72:18 to deal with them in the modern world
72:20 they still hold on to that old period
72:23 and they hold on to America like they
72:25 held like they hold on to England even
72:28 though the entire dream and idea of
72:31 America is to break free from the
72:32 monarchy of Europe that caused the
72:34 problem in the first place but the
72:36 reason why we have some some
72:39 subconscious problems dealing with
72:42 Chinese is because the Britons invaded
72:46 China and really wracked their brains
72:47 for what white people do someone didn't
72:53 have a moral fiber to stop those wars in
72:56 the first place in fact a lot of people
72:57 that were dignitaries from China from
72:59 England actually had a moral fiber and
73:01 were fired because they tried to in the
73:04 war and in the bloodshed you know
73:06 history repeating itself is one of the
73:08 biggest diseases man has your average
73:11 Democrat does not research a single
73:13 [ __ ] thing but when they talk to you
73:16 they talk to you as if they're absolute
73:17 authorities on things
73:18 the press is pre censored like Rod
73:21 Serling said I'm gonna say this a
73:22 million times this episode I mean the
73:24 season right go watch the 1959 interview
73:29 with Rod Serling just before the
73:31 Twilight Zone aired and he talked about
73:34 pre censorship he said they're finding
73:36 people like
73:37 rachel maddow who believes everything
73:39 she's [ __ ] told repeats it on the
73:42 news as official history is official
73:45 current events and she's lying through
73:48 her [ __ ] teeth obsessed with this
73:50 nothing burger that is the Russian
73:52 collusion story
73:54 she's pre censored to think that
73:56 Republicans wouldn't let her be gay
73:58 and so in her mind I believe she
74:02 believes that if she lets Republicans
74:04 gain the Supreme Court positions and the
74:08 9th district positions and the border
74:10 positions for the judges that are
74:11 dealing with illegal [ __ ] immigration
74:15 illegal immigration let's say it again
74:17 that the whole world will come to an end
74:19 again I live in a Republican County that
74:23 is packed with LGBT people I don't see I
74:28 don't see gays being pulled into the
74:30 street and beaten alive quite the
74:32 opposite
74:33 right they're everywhere and everyone's
74:36 okay right but the lies construct fears
74:41 which motivate people to act a
74:44 particular way but it's all based on
74:46 what lies right we need to start passing
74:51 the test we need to start standing up
74:55 for what is unequivocally right which is
74:59 do no harm to other people again
75:02 any people that you think are bad are
75:04 they doing you harm well if they are we
75:06 got to push back until they do no harm
75:08 right illegal immigration does harm it
75:12 does it takes away jobs from people here
75:13 in this country we can solve for that
75:16 problem we need to figure out where they
75:17 can work and where we can work and then
75:19 invite them into those positions legally
75:23 we need just speed up immigration we
75:25 need to probably increase the number of
75:27 people that we bring in legally we need
75:29 to build our [ __ ] wall okay just like
75:32 all the Democrats and celebrities have
75:33 around their houses right we subsidized
75:37 walls all over the world especially in
75:39 Israel go askew Israel if their wall
75:43 works it works it works everywhere right
75:46 but as I said in my border episode it's
75:48 not to hurt illegal immigrants
75:51 it's to cut off the drug trade cutting
75:54 off the slush fund that these deep
75:55 Staters used to do all their nasty work
75:58 but I have found friends of mine that
76:00 are trying to do good and they devote
76:03 their whole life to it
76:04 and they put their reputation on the
76:06 line in fact some people are very famous
76:07 people but in there you know they got
76:11 their skin in the game as deep as you
76:13 can put it in the game and so I think
76:15 that a normal citizens and this is
76:18 happening all the time right with the
76:19 YouTube channels out there that are for
76:21 truth are the most popular channels on
76:23 YouTube and of course YouTube being a
76:25 deep state organization is trying to
76:27 censor them I think we've seen in
76:30 history several several times this this
76:33 methodology that works really really
76:35 well which is we lose track of what evil
76:38 is because evil is always trying to
76:41 disguise itself as a sheep right the
76:43 wolf tries to put on the sheep's
76:44 clothing constantly and they try to go
76:48 for your heartstrings and they try to
76:49 attach truth to lies they try to attach
76:52 agendas to lies they try to chat attach
76:55 prosperity to demise and we need to
76:59 start parsing this and it's starting to
77:01 occur right people were utterly
77:03 horrified at this nine-month abortion
77:05 thing that went through our country a
77:07 couple weeks ago and that's fantastic
77:09 that they had this uprising and to think
77:13 that people would still side with a
77:15 Democratic Party after such a thing
77:17 would be remotely considered is [ __ ]
77:20 be on me right you're way beyond birth
77:23 control at nine months in my opinion
77:25 sorry folks that's just my opinion the
77:28 fact that we have preemie babies that
77:30 are born at six months that grow up to
77:32 be perfectly healthy humans should be a
77:34 good sign as to what you're actually
77:35 doing there you're killing a human being
77:38 like a [ __ ] totally sentient being
77:41 that are starting to have dreams that's
77:44 starting to kick you know that stuff
77:46 happens really early in the process and
77:49 there's people waiting to adopt children
77:51 all over the world who are good parents
77:53 all right so you don't want to have the
77:56 kid fine you want to make a cool 50
77:58 grand
77:59 have the child safely and make fifty
78:02 grand and that's a small price
78:04 usually it's way higher than that I
78:06 think it was $55,000 in the year 2000
78:10 when one of my employees was trying to
78:12 adopt a child all right you don't want
78:16 the burden of having the child fine
78:18 you don't want to hurt your junk down
78:19 there get a c-section there solutions
78:22 sorry you're in that problem but there
78:26 are solutions that don't have to include
78:29 the death of a person the idea that if a
78:32 pregnant woman gets killed in a car
78:35 accident due to a drunk driver the drunk
78:37 driver is not only charged for the death
78:38 of the mother but the unborn child
78:40 okay so we're acknowledging as a society
78:43 in the modern form of [ __ ]
78:45 intelligent thinking that that baby
78:46 actually is a sentient being that
78:48 deserves another charge
78:49 oh but as long as the doctors got a
78:52 [ __ ] you know command from the mother
78:55 to kill the child it goes in this
78:57 two-hour procedure of cutting the kid up
78:58 and handing over all the parts to these
79:00 adrenochrome freakazoids right we have
79:03 so many doublespeak situations in this
79:07 world for instance if a person solicits
79:10 sex from a prostitute in America and I
79:14 think most of the states in this Union
79:16 then it's it's a jailable offense right
79:21 you've you've solicited prostitution but
79:23 as long as you hire a person to have sex
79:26 with you and you have a video camera now
79:29 it's called porn and it's completely
79:31 legal you did a drug test on everyone in
79:34 the room half these people are [ __ ]
79:36 strung out on meth or coke or something
79:38 else
79:39 heroin they're being manipulated by
79:41 drugs to give up sex for their next hit
79:43 doesn't that sound like a bunch of [ __ ]
79:46 to you we need to start passing this
79:49 test you know and it's going to be
79:53 communication and education we have to
79:55 go for the people in this world that are
79:57 most likely to listen and they will
80:01 continue spreading it and again all the
80:04 sheep in the world what is their whole
80:06 method of life their mo is be on the
80:09 winning team regardless of Satan is the
80:11 [ __ ] captain of the team or God as
80:13 the captain of the team they're just
80:15 docile ignorant human beings
80:18 when I say ignorant very specifically
80:20 most people haven't heard the truth
80:22 about a lot of things or they haven't
80:24 heard it in a way that they can digest
80:25 it they'll hear that 9/11 was an inside
80:27 job but they'll they didn't take physics
80:32 in high school right hopefully this show
80:35 is helping you guys figure out where
80:41 where we can make some change right and
80:44 again you guys are brilliant on your own
80:46 which is beautiful so you have methods
80:48 of communicating they're far more
80:50 accessible than my methods of
80:51 communicating my methods appeal to you
80:53 guys that just want to hear it raw
80:56 rated-r for real right one of our
81:00 listeners put put one of those up a
81:02 picture said that in our Facebook feed
81:04 and what's funny about that is I have
81:06 artwork on my computer from three years
81:08 ago probably even four years ago when I
81:11 was doing in kilcher radio and I was
81:13 gonna bumper every one of our episodes
81:14 with that plate but I decided not to do
81:17 it because it was gonna add more editing
81:18 for the podcast side of things this
81:22 would be a big dead spot in the podcast
81:23 I don't have to manually cut off every
81:26 single time I make an episode so I
81:27 didn't do it what I really want to
81:30 galvanize you guys with at the end of
81:32 this episode is that this is now a
81:33 charter for any of you that care we have
81:37 to start passing this test which means
81:39 we have to start taking verbal action to
81:42 educate folks on the craziness of the
81:46 whole thing again probably one of the
81:48 best things that you can repeat for
81:50 people to hear to get them out of this
81:52 psychosis out of this hypnotic [ __ ]
81:55 Satanist ik world that we're in is to
81:57 say look the Catholic Church is the
81:59 single most guilty organization
82:02 organized organization with attorneys
82:05 and [ __ ] trillions of dollars sitting
82:07 in the basement of the Vatican to
82:10 perpetuate human trafficking child
82:13 molestation around the world the case
82:16 study I mean Jesus Christ if I had my
82:18 own little company out here and I had
82:19 all the employees of my company globally
82:22 doing what the Catholic Church did you
82:24 would Lynch me and the company you're
82:28 the biggest pedophile [ __ ] runner on
82:30 planet Earth was what you'd say
82:31 but for whatever reason because Jesus is
82:34 on top of this fake organization that's
82:37 anything for Jesus where I go look up
82:39 the Viper Room in the basement of the
82:41 Vatican that'll blow your [ __ ] mind
82:43 it's being run by the darkest forces
82:47 that we have allowed to manifest on this
82:48 planet I think it's time to make a
82:51 change folks it's time to call it out
82:54 for what it is if you're a Catholic go
82:55 find another church go find another
82:58 church and then look up the history of
83:01 that particular church find a little
83:02 tiny building in your town that just has
83:05 a group of people they're not affiliated
83:07 with any other national chain they just
83:09 have their own donation plate they've
83:11 built a building they worship Christ
83:13 that is their belief system they don't
83:16 violate any of that is anyone perfect no
83:18 of course not but overall everyone's at
83:21 least trying and they're not crossing
83:22 those thresholds of absolute Saint
83:26 mystic behavior anyway I know you feel
83:29 me
83:29 hopefully this episode is a little
83:33 invigorating for you I know we all live
83:35 for this stuff I'm losing my lights I
83:37 better get out of the garage it rained a
83:39 little bit I think it's gonna rain a
83:41 little bit more for the next three or
83:43 four days here if you haven't been to

83:47 feeds from audio to video there's a lot
