00:36 well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
00:39 welcome back to deep thoughts you know I
00:43 have tried to record an episode about
00:46 racism three times and I think one case
00:50 I had a technical difficulty but the
00:52 other two cases I created videos that
00:54 are probably about an hour and 45
00:56 minutes a piece and watching him back
01:01 they just didn't accurately get to the
01:05 point in my opinion I mean I kind of had
01:08 ups and downs so this will be the fourth
01:10 time I'm gonna try this and we'll see if
01:12 we can't get this right but I thought it
01:14 might be actually a fairly decent time
01:16 to try again given sort of the climate
01:19 of what's going on right now in 2017 so
01:24 what's the status right now I'm gonna
01:25 get very current events which I'd you
01:27 know I usually steer away from current
01:29 events because then it makes the episode
01:32 seem like and I want to watch this this
01:34 is all about the past this will not be
01:37 all about the past no matter when you
01:40 find it right now we have this what I
01:44 believe to be sort of a pathetic attempt
01:49 to be intellectual which is during
01:52 sporting events all around the United
01:54 States right now people are taking knees
01:58 during the national anthem and this is
02:03 being sort of set up as disrespectful to
02:06 the country to the national anthem
02:10 what's kind of interesting about it is
02:12 the kneeling is
02:13 what you do before God and LL Cool J had
02:17 a cool video yesterday morning he said
02:20 take two knees and pray to God that you
02:23 don't divide our country and allow it to
02:26 be conquered by other sort of how I
02:27 interpreted it I guess it was like 1891
02:30 when the very first person stood up and
02:34 saluted with a hand over their heart the
02:37 national anthem and it wasn't until
02:39 Woodrow Wilson got into office in the
02:42 early teens of the 20th century that he
02:45 made it sort of the policy again it's
02:49 not breaking the law you know and I've
02:52 talked about the whole thing of you know
02:54 the Prussian education system and how
02:57 one of its big objectives is to create
02:59 nationalism and it's interesting because
03:02 nationalism
03:03 I mean recognizing your nation as having
03:08 its own sovereign laws and borders and
03:10 all that good stuff it's to a younger
03:17 privileged crowd of people they don't
03:22 recognize its importance now what you
03:25 don't want to have is a propaganda laced
03:27 government that uses the national
03:30 patriotism to lie about things you know
03:33 to make you believe something that's not
03:35 true I don't think is what's happening
03:39 when it comes to the national anthem but
03:43 this whole thing is being construed as a
03:45 really as a black specific act of you
03:52 know racial awareness like the poor
03:56 hundred millionaire NFL players who are
04:00 you know range from the age of like 20
04:02 to 35 are taking these as if they have
04:06 suffered suffered the slings and arrows
04:08 of outrageous misfortune right you know
04:13 they make more money than every single
04:15 person in the theatre aside from the
04:17 owners and the coaches and they have
04:19 something to complain about right but
04:23 this episode's going to be about racism
04:24 I think there's been some lar
04:27 advancement some great advancements in
04:29 the definition of racism and that you
04:34 know a lot more people understanding
04:35 that it's really culturalism right
04:38 doesn't really matter what color your
04:40 skin is it does in some cases directly
04:44 correlate with a particular culture but
04:49 think about all the white people in
04:50 America are far from you know melted
04:54 together into some culture that is
04:57 singular right the South actually
05:00 different than the north the East Coast
05:01 and the west coast are different you
05:04 know go to Louisiana and then go to
05:05 Mississippi two totally different worlds
05:08 in they're right by each other the same
05:11 goes for all races you know it would
05:15 have to be a teeny tiny race to have
05:17 them all act the same you know and again
05:20 I'm not familiar with all races but you
05:23 have a pretty good experience what kills
05:26 me about these these sports players is
05:28 that I feel like it's obviously a
05:33 privilege it's a privilege to do this
05:36 when you don't have to fight for your
05:37 country I'm sure that racial things have
05:40 happened to pretty much everyone in the
05:43 world you know there's probably a few
05:46 places on earth maybe where everyone's
05:49 exactly the same same race but I don't
05:52 know maybe 20 families that make up a
05:54 community and no one ever travels
05:56 anywhere all right well you know that's
05:58 got to be a single percent if not less
06:01 but anyone who's moved around I'm
06:04 telling you it doesn't matter what color
06:05 you are you will hear raesha s-- racial
06:07 stuff now some folks here at really bad
06:10 they and they get chased down and they
06:12 get into fights and some people get you
06:14 know maimed or murdered I still think
06:18 that's in the modern world I think
06:21 that's pretty rare right there was a
06:24 time in America before Martin Luther
06:25 King when the blacks and the whites
06:28 which were really the only two races
06:30 that were SuperDuper acknowledged in the
06:33 country well we had a really good group
06:37 of Asian folks have been here since the
06:39 1800s help
06:40 the railroads and stuff from San
06:41 Francisco everything else is pretty
06:46 pretty marginal like single-digit
06:48 penetration from other countries at that
06:50 point but we had the blacks and the
06:51 whites and they were segregated right
06:54 Black's went to one school whites went
06:57 to those school white kids got the
06:58 better teachers the black teachers got
07:00 the worst teachers supposedly right
07:02 there are water fountains you literally
07:05 were not allowed to drink at a
07:06 particular water fountain if you were
07:08 black you had to sit in the back of the
07:12 bus couldn't enter in restaurants
07:14 through the front door couldn't live in
07:17 communities with other whites nowadays
07:20 that's illegal
07:21 it's a desegregation you're caught doing
07:24 forcing anyone do that kind of [ __ ] you
07:27 earned so much trouble in this country
07:29 so it's progress it's one of the few
07:32 sets of laws that have benefited man
07:33 since people been you know since the
07:37 folks that are still alive I've been
07:38 alive right your baby boomers they got a
07:40 beautiful upgrade people like me I was
07:44 born into the upgrade and so I don't
07:46 know the difference as much what's
07:50 interesting now is that where you used
07:52 to have a white kid sitting in a class
07:54 with a privileged white teacher or a
07:56 black kid sitting in a school the black
07:58 teacher who may or may not be great we
08:01 don't know let's just say you take the
08:05 racist as racism assertion no I'm having
08:09 such a hard time saying that today then
08:11 you would have to assume that the the
08:13 black kids didn't have the best teachers
08:16 now I've actually heard it argued by
08:18 some black friends of mine that they
08:21 actually got superior education in the
08:23 segregated school system and the
08:26 interesting thing was is that there's
08:30 been all these studies about the power
08:33 of a black male with in a black culture
08:35 and it's very interesting that that when
08:41 you know kids that are black go to white
08:43 schools and they have to go up with a
08:45 white female teacher the amount of
08:47 respect they're willing to give her
08:49 it really is she has to earn it
08:53 it's not given so I've got some friends
08:57 of mine that believe that the best way
09:00 to teach a black student male or female
09:03 is with a black male teacher or very
09:07 strong a black female teacher just
09:10 interesting I have no reference of
09:12 whether or not that is actually true but
09:16 today white kids sat next to black kids
09:20 and brown kids it's all brown
09:23 you know Asians Mexicans everybody we
09:27 all sit together now in school and you
09:31 sit shoulder-to-shoulder and so at that
09:35 point the only metric left is really
09:38 where do you live in the United States
09:39 do you live in a ghetto do you live in
09:41 an urban sprawling neighborhood so based
09:46 on the district taxes how much does your
09:48 school district pay teachers to teach
09:53 I've had several friends of mine in fact
09:55 I still know ten I'm an acquaintance
09:58 friend of mine who teaches in the
10:03 ghettos and the Inland Empire here in
10:07 that Riverside and I've heard that you
10:11 know it doesn't matter what race you are
10:12 these kids are strung out on [ __ ]
10:14 and they fight and they will not pay
10:18 attention to the teachers half the time
10:21 Common Core has helped them because
10:23 finally they can offer some passing
10:25 grades to the idiots but today you sit
10:29 next to whoever you think has got the
10:32 privilege due to their skin color their
10:34 eye color their hair color and so now
10:38 the algorithm is who pays attention more
10:42 to the teacher who does their homework
10:47 who subscribes to good culture who
10:50 describe who subscribes to bad culture
10:52 meaning you know self-destructive
10:54 gangster [ __ ] or maybe some form of
10:58 academia that actually is employable
11:00 trade you get good at computers you good
11:03 at musical instruments you can mix a
11:05 song
11:07 fix a roof fix an engine so what ends up
11:12 happening is is you we we have actually
11:15 made some serious progress in my opinion
11:16 and leaning out the excuses they're
11:20 still excuses out there that I think are
11:21 fairly legitimate several hundred years
11:26 of repression will mess up a genetic
11:29 strand it just does but I do believe
11:34 that one can recover fast right and
11:39 being poor does not equal being less
11:44 intelligent I know some rich white
11:47 people who are as dumb as hammers you
11:51 know so one does not equal the other
11:55 Morgan Freeman was asked once you know
11:58 how do you get rid of racism and he says
12:00 stop talking about it I think that's
12:05 interesting what could he possibly mean
12:07 I mean don't we need to take a knee to
12:10 show how [ __ ] profound our brain
12:13 cells are it's not the way to do it and
12:16 one of the smarter men in the world says
12:20 don't talk about it anymore
12:21 I think what he might be saying is
12:28 telling someone that it exists is the
12:30 first thing that you can do to injure an
12:34 individual's perception on things just
12:36 like the CNN guy that thinks that you're
12:39 not allowed to tell kids in the ghetto
12:41 that they're ever going to escape
12:43 because according to his Ivy League ass
12:45 he was the only black guy that got out
12:48 of the ghetto
12:48 oh maybe wasn't he morning to get him
12:50 maybe he had a silver spoon and he just
12:52 wants to keep his fellow black people
12:54 down only I get to be the black guy on
12:57 television who interviews on CNN you
13:01 stay down there where you are Morgan
13:05 Freeman turns the guy and says [ __ ]
13:07 right I just mentioned this on another
13:08 episode I'm gonna go for it again cuz
13:10 we're right there he says how dare you
13:12 tell a kid that they can't escape
13:15 right
13:17 the CNN reporter his game is to make
13:21 sure that his little coveted spot and
13:24 CNN is not contested by any one of his
13:26 fellow black males the more he could
13:29 keep what's his and call his mommy and
13:31 tell her how great he is that's his game
13:34 and I've seen this a million [ __ ]
13:36 times in the Bay Area selfish
13:41 incredibly narcissistic super ender
13:47 educated in the ways of the world fairly
13:50 educated in the ways of indoctrination
13:52 and academia but you know what it's like
13:56 to have someone full of a bunch of
13:57 knowledge and then someone having some
13:59 wisdom knowledge experienced Morgan
14:03 Freeman sitting across the table and
14:05 elder is wise CNN guy lives in complete
14:10 [ __ ] propaganda lies right he's used
14:16 to sitting there getting paid to
14:17 [ __ ] people you must think he's a
14:21 lot better than everyone else in the
14:23 ghetto to say oh no you're relegated to
14:26 this you can't get out watch CNN will
14:29 make sure that the blacks don't escape
14:31 the ghetto except this one this one guy
14:34 it looks like a girl you know he escaped
14:37 that's all right Anderson Cooper well
14:40 he's straight up Vanderbilt grandson
14:43 trained in the CIA it's no wonder he's
14:47 an anchor on CNN right cuz fake news
14:49 right I'm always talking about Richard
14:52 Pryor in the show and I did an episode I
14:56 don't even know which one I was talking
14:58 about Richard and one of the cool things
15:00 about Richard is that he was able to get
15:03 us to get along by representing the
15:08 goofiness of white people and the
15:10 goofiness of black people because that
15:12 was really again that was the big
15:13 concern in the 70s was those are the two
15:15 races everyone else was kind of minding
15:17 their own business or their penetrations
15:21 United States was negligible and there
15:24 was a quick interview with him with this
15:25 weird guy I've never seen him before him
15:28 goofy white guy and he was asking
15:33 richard pryor about somehow you know
15:37 what his what what the establishment is
15:39 most afraid of when it comes to richard
15:44 and he said that without hesitating he
15:47 said well they're afraid that I'm gonna
15:51 make everyone get along by seeing their
15:54 differences and laughing at them and
15:56 that was what I got from him and put it
15:59 on an episode probably 150 episodes ago
16:02 and I'd never heard him say it and so
16:04 I'd hear him saying I'm sitting there
16:06 thinking of myself geez
16:07 he was completely conscious that this
16:10 was what he was doing which is why it
16:11 became obvious to me it's fantastic
16:14 and this is the guy that wrote you know
16:18 all the racial white lines of the movie
16:22 Blazing Saddles
16:25 you know all the inward use he wrote him
16:29 but they made it absurd and they made it
16:32 funny that it was so absurd that someone
16:35 would use the harsh language that they
16:37 did and that's the power of making a
16:42 relief valve against the cultural
16:44 difference differences in the pressures
16:48 now again I was super fortunate I grew
16:52 up in a little country town
16:53 yeah probably 95 percent white the other
16:57 two cultures we had were the Mexican few
17:01 like Mexican families and a few black
17:03 families but again there was a rib joint
17:07 at the east side of town called Armas
17:11 it's Roy and Irma Williamson and I was
17:16 unfortunately I was so young that and I
17:20 had to move away because my parents
17:22 moved away at the age of 8 that my my
17:28 memory of these folks was pretty much
17:30 between I'd say probably three and eight
17:33 but it was super impactful like so those
17:36 five years were huge and we'd always
17:37 come back and visit during the summer
17:40 when we came back which is only a couple
17:41 hours away but they eventually sold
17:44 their place in like nineteen
17:45 80 so that was it it was an end of an
17:48 era
17:49 but again I'm this little tiny white kid
17:53 gold hair you know I had the you know
17:55 the little ball haircut back in the day
17:59 not quite a bowl haircut but you know
18:01 that haircut that we all had in the 70s
18:04 I'm pretty naive and I would just sit
18:09 downstairs in the billiard room with you
18:12 know I still have visions of this room
18:14 like it was yesterday in my head crazy
18:17 and there was always I don't know
18:20 probably at least a dozen black guys
18:22 down there and the oldest of the bunch
18:26 would sit because we had the whole wall
18:29 with chairs
18:30 like it was like a billiard room these
18:32 chairs that hang off the wall just have
18:34 like a pad and the oldest guy would be
18:37 on the end with me and I'd sit down
18:39 there and I mean I'm teeny tiny kid and
18:42 I'd sit and watch billiards and I didn't
18:43 have any clue how billiards was played
18:45 but it just looked cool the bumpers on
18:47 the table a bunch of orange balls just
18:50 didn't get it at all and this old guy
18:53 would thumb me a quarter over once in a
18:55 while and they had a Coke machine in the
18:57 corner those old 50's Coke machines we
18:59 got to pull the little vertical door and
19:01 yank the bottle out through them you
19:05 know the compressed metal clamps most
19:07 the time I couldn't get the bottle out
19:09 so they'd have to come over to do it for
19:10 me and you just crack the top cap off of
19:15 the bottle in the front of the machine
19:16 you sit down you know it's what you see
19:18 and fall out for all the time but I just
19:21 sat there and I watched these guys play
19:23 and it was just you know for hours when
19:28 my parents were ordering food upstairs
19:29 not to go up and eat eventually but it
19:33 was just the most incredible impression
19:36 I ever had and I always felt super at
19:41 home around the black culture my whole
19:44 life I mean it's just there's something
19:46 extra soothing about it for me in most
19:49 cases because I feel like I get it on
19:52 some level I don't understand you know
19:54 all their inside jokes and stuff I got
19:56 friends and minor comedians
19:58 that are black and they'll say a line or
20:01 two and I don't get it and they're like
20:03 what's because you didn't come from the
20:04 ghetto I'm like yeah it's not but I want
20:06 to know tell me right my father was
20:10 always and still is you know very I
20:16 don't even know what the hell you call
20:17 it he's sort of colorblind when it comes
20:19 to music he you know you know he no one
20:23 has like Chinese albums in our house or
20:25 anything like that but it's very
20:28 European but soul music metal techno you
20:33 know very diverse and so I grew up in
20:38 that and so what's interesting about it
20:43 is there's a there's a pro and there's a
20:45 con so the pro is that I grew up really
20:47 outside of any inbred racism the con is
20:51 that I don't know what it's like to be
20:53 inside a deeply rooted racist
20:57 neighborhood where I can't escape and go
21:01 to back to my oasis now I've always
21:03 talked about Massachusetts being pretty
21:05 crazy but you have two white
21:07 I guess races going after after Joe the
21:10 Irish in the Jews fighting all the time
21:12 and me in the black kid or walking off
21:15 you know going home and we got to get
21:18 back to our place where we lived and it
21:19 was a quarantine area where we didn't
21:21 have to deal with this [ __ ] except
21:23 fighting through the woods to get home
21:24 right and so you know being born when I
21:29 was born in 69 and looking out at you
21:34 know when I got finally went back and
21:35 saw the videos of what was going on in
21:37 America before desegregation and before
21:40 Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and all
21:42 them it was hardcore it was like
21:47 inconceivably bizarre how people were
21:49 you know living in their fear bubbles
21:52 and making their fear turn into racial
21:54 slurs right but today it's being
21:59 exacerbated right the Democratic
22:02 National Convention likes illegal
22:05 immigrants to come across the border
22:07 because they turn them into voters and
22:11 they are easily frightened because if
22:14 you're truly new to this country then
22:16 you know you don't know much you just
22:17 kind of know there's money on the other
22:19 side you're gonna work hard and that's
22:20 the kind of stuff because Mexico has
22:23 federales and drug lords and stuff you
22:26 kind of live a very guarded life and so
22:28 when you're here and that there's none
22:30 of that here
22:30 then if someone smiles and gives you a
22:34 voting ballot you're gonna do whatever
22:37 they say but it's just literally
22:42 stealing a vote as all it is right now
22:47 for the black folks that are here in
22:48 America they're not migrating from
22:51 anywhere right so they know the game so
22:57 what the Democrats do is that they they
22:59 played this little race card once a
23:01 while and they can only play it about
23:02 every 8 to 16 years because it's a
23:06 [ __ ] card the blacks always wake up
23:08 because they're always screwed over by
23:10 the DNC by the Democratic Party in
23:13 general and so then there's you know
23:16 there's lucidity just how Trump got in
23:19 office right now the interesting thing
23:21 about America is that we have these
23:23 these and this is really every country
23:26 in the world but we're one of the most
23:27 recent ones to go which is that we we
23:30 built a country on top of another groups
23:32 country the Native Americans who were so
23:38 squeezed out of existence it's really
23:43 phenomenally bizarre that that we've
23:46 actually squeezed them down to reservoir
23:49 reservations and we can here we can have
23:53 LBG who's LBGT groups LGBT groups we
23:59 have black lives matter we have and Tifa
24:02 all this kind of stuff but no one gives
24:03 a [ __ ] about the Native Americans the
24:06 one group that probably has the biggest
24:07 beef - beef would be the Native
24:10 Americans yeah we want our reservations
24:13 to grow back to the sizes that they were
24:15 or hell of a lot closer we want the
24:17 ability to exercise our religions what
24:20 if the Shoshone Indians said look we
24:22 used to be a migratory nomadic try
24:25 that went in a huge circle in the United
24:27 States and we want this trail to be
24:29 restored so we can live the way we used
24:30 to live now obviously they want modern
24:32 technology too but you know they could
24:36 make a case one way or the other right
24:38 in America you have a at least you know
24:45 for my black friends that I've had I've
24:47 had the privilege of really talking
24:48 about this deeply with them and about
24:50 you know the 40 acres and a mule thing
24:52 comes up every once in a while which is
24:54 you know at some point the government
24:56 granted I can't remember what year it
24:58 was granted this notion that every black
25:01 male I was gonna get 40 acres in a mule
25:05 for his family of course it never
25:08 happened and then we have so as
25:11 Americans we have the guilt of taking
25:13 away Native Americans now of course we
25:15 didn't do it personally but we are
25:17 benefiting from this land grab history
25:21 has been revised to make Native
25:22 Americans seem like savages being
25:25 accused of scalping which they didn't do
25:28 until they were scalped you know it's
25:30 just it's pathetic
25:32 the history that's going on there we
25:36 said that they died of smallpox and
25:39 influenza when we really probably
25:41 massacred most of them but these
25:46 revisionist history stories allow us to
25:48 sleep at night for the blacks it's very
25:52 interesting blacks are encouraged in
25:55 America to look at whites with disdain
25:58 now again there's plenty of racists
26:02 white people they are whether it be
26:05 milder on you know whether it's 1 or 11
26:09 they exist and I think we all have sort
26:13 of frustrations with cultural things at
26:16 some points but we have to always
26:18 remember it's usually that one
26:19 individual that's doing that and we
26:21 don't like the individual would doesn't
26:23 matter what color they are what race and
26:25 that kind of thing but you've all heard
26:26 that before but the way that the the
26:29 slaves got to America was by the French
26:32 and the Spanish
26:34 going to Africa and and we don't really
26:39 know the truth I mean the truth that has
26:41 been prepared sorry the story that's
26:43 been given to us is that you know their
26:46 stories of white conquistadors going
26:50 over there and grabbing them with Spears
26:51 and pull arms and what-have-you and
26:54 putting them on boats chuckling them
26:56 putting them on boats and then there's
26:58 the other story which is someone simply
27:01 paid off the leader over there to put
27:04 them in shackles and bring them over
27:07 what actually happened all we know is
27:10 that they got put on boats the boats
27:12 were atrocious a good third to 50% of
27:16 these slaves died in the boat because
27:19 they got sick and they weren't fed at
27:20 all so the only ones to make it were the
27:24 absolute fittest of the bunch and then
27:29 of course after they get here their pure
27:32 blood African at first and then there's
27:34 a ton of mating because why do you
27:39 figured out that there's some incredibly
27:43 beautiful African women I think probably
27:47 some of the females of the plantation
27:51 also like the black male and so it was a
27:54 lot of interbreeding and we've created
27:56 some super cool combinations I mean it
28:02 really mixes well in a lot of cases I
28:04 probably get some cake a gay guy
28:06 threatening my life for saying that
28:08 let's just move on to the well it's the
28:10 finish of the story here the problem
28:14 with you know an african-american here
28:19 in the United States looking to his left
28:22 or his right or her left from right and
28:25 looking at a white person saying you
28:26 know you're you're a slave owner you
28:29 your family line has slaves in it you
28:32 brought it used you know you own slaves
28:34 you brought us over on boats you you you
28:37 you you is that a lot of families didn't
28:41 get to America until after slavery was
28:43 abolished for the ones that came over a
28:46 lot of our families
28:48 were indentured servants just exactly
28:50 like the slaves now as per my
28:53 grandmother who's half knight K&I gh T
28:57 they have turned into the knight
28:59 shipping company if you guys see those
29:01 driving around she said that they were
29:04 endangered servants and that they had to
29:07 escape the plantation they were working
29:09 on because it wasn't gonna you know it
29:10 was like a 10-year plan to get out of
29:12 there and it wasn't working and the
29:15 plantation owners know that scam you get
29:17 paid a dollar a day you have to pay
29:19 ninety three cents back to the
29:21 plantation but you own 10 grand ahead or
29:23 some crazy number you're never gonna
29:25 reach her as like a bad credit card debt
29:27 so to turn to your fellow white man in
29:30 America and accuse them of doing this no
29:32 no go to France go to Spain and ask the
29:36 king and queen or the government over
29:38 there to give you your 40 acres in the
29:40 mule in that country because those are
29:43 the folks that brought you over your
29:45 ancestors the other thing too is that
29:48 almost no black person in America is
29:50 purebred you got some white in you too
29:54 and again I think the country's better
29:56 off with these mixes they're amazing but
30:01 doesn't matter if you're pure blood
30:02 that's fine none of my family members
30:06 that I can find and we go back to eight
30:08 sixteen thirty on slaves never happened
30:13 we weren't rich enough you know I don't
30:17 know what their mental attitude towards
30:18 it was I think very few folks in America
30:22 had slaves you know you're talking about
30:28 rich people who can feed another human
30:32 being on a daily basis provide shelter
30:35 it's good or bad as it might have been
30:37 that's a tremendous effort to have a
30:40 hundred slaves could you imagine what
30:43 kind of money you got to come up with on
30:45 a daily basis to feed and clothe
30:47 individuals even if it was tattered rags
30:50 or whatever I think it'd be pretty hard
30:54 then Tarantino comes out of the movie
30:56 Django uses the n-word almost 300
31:02 and you see these brutal battles where
31:06 they bring in two of the biggest males
31:07 to fight to the death in the lobby or
31:12 sorry the living room of the house right
31:15 and that goes into people's minds as
31:19 truth and a common practice among white
31:24 slave owners
31:27 it's a story I'm sure something like
31:30 that has happened in the history of
31:32 mankind but it's a fictional story that
31:36 because it looks real becomes you know
31:38 real in people's minds from me racism
31:43 goes one of two ways it is either driven
31:46 by pure ignorance aka a lack of
31:49 knowledge about another culture or
31:51 you're filling in the blanks of what's
31:53 gonna happen there or you have had a
31:58 definitive moment when your culture
32:01 differs from someone else's culture
32:04 what's really fascinating in my own
32:06 neighborhood and this isn't some of the
32:09 some of my neighbors I think that they
32:11 came in with a heavy culture that was
32:13 very pure to where they came from and
32:15 others are mixed families where you have
32:17 two different cultures marrying each
32:18 other and having these amazing kids and
32:21 the same thing happened for both sets of
32:24 people they come to our neighborhood and
32:27 it's well-established right not a lot of
32:29 movement in the homes around here people
32:31 been living here for some my neighbors
32:34 been living here for fifty five years
32:38 okay and it goes down the street and
32:41 again some people are new but most of
32:43 them are but they come in and some of
32:46 them have parties a lot
32:48 it's just party party party party and
32:51 then there's this weird thing where they
32:52 realize no one else does that so the
32:58 parties start to to go down in number
33:01 they start to end earlier they start to
33:04 get a little less loud and obnoxious
33:08 some cases they stop completely and that
33:12 person sort of absorbs into the
33:14 neighborhood
33:16 all right that's a natural thing but you
33:21 got to give them time this show has if
33:25 you go all the way back to season one
33:27 there's two dogs and the dog next door
33:29 ginger passed away about a year ago but
33:34 you can hear she's immortalized in the
33:36 zoo's little Pomeranian she got it
33:38 mortalized in the show here but I got a
33:39 new dog that's next door and he's also
33:44 in a lot of episodes too and what's
33:47 interesting is is that dog the one
33:49 that's still alive younger he did the
33:52 same thing that all of us human beings
33:54 do which is to come into the
33:55 neighborhood first he's scared doesn't
33:57 know where the hell he is we got a big
33:59 street out here and you know get
34:00 helicopters and motorcycles and race
34:02 cars going by other dogs barking me
34:05 talking in the backyard
34:06 and at first it just freaked him out and
34:08 he was barking like without a doubt
34:10 eight to ten hours a day people are
34:12 trying to call you know the pet agency
34:17 that comes around checks out but
34:21 eventually that little dude calm down
34:24 back there
34:25 he only comes out a couple times a day
34:27 he only barks for maybe five minutes and
34:29 goes back inside because he's got his
34:32 domain figured out now right he feels
34:34 comfortable he filled in the gaps of
34:37 fear with knowledge and now he's relaxed
34:40 and that's what everyone on the street
34:42 does to one of the oxymorons for me
34:45 about athletes taking knees which is
34:48 this new trend right is that you have I
34:53 think it's 67% of the NFL is black
34:58 African American the rest is all the
35:01 races right but the crowd is about 98%
35:04 white and so and you know again I think
35:10 it goes without saying most the owners
35:12 of teams or white coaches you know it
35:16 just depends we're getting a lot more
35:17 senior coaches who are former players of
35:21 all different races coaching so the
35:24 hundreds of millions of dollars that are
35:26 going to these athletes if they want to
35:27 claim racial
35:30 are coming to them by the white people
35:32 that love every inch on their body by
35:36 jerseys with their names on it and wear
35:38 it to restaurants and that kind of stuff
35:40 holding up the prop their pride for a
35:44 person that doesn't have the same race
35:45 or culture that they do to have that
35:50 group of people kneel for me it's just a
35:52 little mind-blowing but what they try to
35:54 do is say I'm being a martyr I'm being a
35:58 martyr for the folks that are not as
36:00 fortunate as me if that's the case buy
36:04 some [ __ ] knee pads and never get off
36:06 your goddamn knees because there is no
36:08 limit to the people in this world who
36:11 are suffering what you need to do is get
36:13 off your [ __ ] ass and go and help
36:15 those people if that's what you want to
36:17 do stop playing football that doesn't
36:20 help anybody
36:21 it's a titus flavius Coliseum of utter
36:24 propaganda distraction if you want to
36:27 say who's hurting the world it's anybody
36:30 who distracts people from reality that's
36:33 what a sports person does if you really
36:36 want to split hairs you want to hold the
36:38 technicality about racism and you're not
36:41 gonna stand there for the national
36:42 anthem well I can beat you at your game
36:46 right right now we have a giant [ __ ]
36:52 cancer in the world it's called
36:53 globalism it is the wet dream of the
36:57 elite banking cartel families that want
36:59 to run this world their goal is to
37:04 destroy all nation states however they
37:06 can to lose pride in your country when
37:14 your country you know which has plenty
37:17 of warts and bruises and weird things
37:18 that it does overall is good if you
37:24 think about America you know the the
37:25 problem with America and you know
37:27 there's a pro when there's a con the
37:29 people believe they're doing good
37:31 because they have been told propaganda
37:35 that that's what they're doing the
37:38 bummer is is that we're not doing good
37:39 in a lot of cases because we're getting
37:40 duped
37:42 by the very people that are fueling this
37:46 sentiment that makes people kneel there
37:50 will be no football if America ceases to
37:54 be America
37:54 there'll be no hundred million dollar
37:57 paychecks if America ceases to be
38:00 America and if you think that that is
38:04 sensationalistic then why don't you take
38:06 a [ __ ] field trip to North Korea and
38:09 come back and tell me how much of that
38:10 [ __ ] you see North Korea is kept around
38:14 as a social experiment if there ever was
38:17 one
38:18 how much can you totally repress people
38:21 and keep them quarantined away from the
38:23 rest of the world when the rest of the
38:25 world can use Skype to call the the rest
38:29 of the world and absolute photo real
38:32 cameras photo real displays the most
38:36 amazing crystal-clear audio you've ever
38:39 heard in your life first up might use
38:40 Skype when it first came out which I
38:42 didn't remember what year but probably
38:43 around 2005-2006 somewhere in there I'm
38:46 skyping with my development team in Peru
38:50 the only outside team I ever hired an
38:53 incandescent light bulb burned out
38:56 during the phone call and we weren't
38:59 doing video because of the internet
39:02 bandwidth was still kind of shitty and
39:03 the cameras were pretty bad but the
39:04 audio was so clear that I heard an
39:06 incandescent light bulb burn out and I
39:09 said did you just have a bulb burn out
39:11 and he's like he had turned around cuz
39:14 it freaked him out and he turns back
39:17 around he goes oh my god you can hear
39:19 that I said yeah you know Skype doesn't
39:21 seem to compress the audio it's
39:23 beautiful perfect audio right but even
39:27 with all this technology North Korea
39:30 can't get a message from the outside
39:32 world there are forces that want America
39:35 to be that bad to be utterly controlled
39:39 by some crazy bastard
39:41 who eats of pie all day while we feel
39:45 fortunate to be alive let alone have any
39:48 choice in our life right the world is
39:52 different all over the place it just is
39:54 go to Mexico
39:56 nope sorry just go to any word down in
39:58 South America and drink the water see
40:01 what happens to your [ __ ] they have a
40:05 bunch of microbes that we don't have and
40:08 I guess we have some they don't have so
40:09 they get sick when they drink our water
40:11 for a while and till we build up the
40:13 antibodies to get rid of [ __ ] are the
40:16 bacterial cultures that eat the other
40:18 bacteria when they shoot movies all over
40:22 the world they have to bring all the
40:24 food with them and all the water with
40:25 them even as far back as 1974 to 77 when
40:31 they were filming the principal footage
40:32 for Star Wars George Lucas said I bought
40:35 dehydrated chicken in my own water with
40:37 me as he went I was at Tunisia and a few
40:40 other places they gathered right we have
40:44 different bodies with different
40:47 capabilities one of the funniest things
40:52 ever watched was a video some sort of
40:54 reality show probably about five years
40:57 ago where some white guy went to
40:59 Australia I don't even know I don't
41:01 think he was from Australia maybe he was
41:02 but his thing is he was gonna cross one
41:05 of their big deserts and he read up on
41:08 everything of what he's supposed to
41:09 bring and how he's gonna get there he
41:11 got bought flies all over him - which is
41:12 just disgusting but he was being filmed
41:16 in one area and there was a Aborigine
41:20 got looked like Morgan Freeman tall
41:22 skinny guy he just I think he had kind
41:25 of like an old suit on and he had just a
41:28 couple gallons of water and here he is
41:31 with very dark skin which if you just
41:34 take light and do the properties of how
41:36 he's feeling he's absorbing the photons
41:38 right he's absorbing all the thermal
41:40 Heat he's got clothes on and this white
41:43 guy he's got shorts on you know he said
41:45 or whatever I don't know what he had but
41:46 he I think he did shorts with his kind
41:48 of REI boots and just tons of water and
41:53 tons of rations and all this fancy stuff
41:56 you know little pieces of paper covered
41:59 in crumbs so he could use the sun's
42:01 light to heat up water I mean it's just
42:02 you know it's sort of look ridiculous
42:07 but he gave up he gave up crossing
42:10 desert and the other dude walk right
42:13 across it no problem what was the
42:17 difference what was a cultural
42:20 difference it was a physiology
42:22 difference but on paper it would look
42:24 like the black guy Aborigine wouldn't
42:27 have been able to make it across the
42:28 desert because he's got too much clothes
42:30 on and he's dark his skin is dark and so
42:33 he should be boiled up by he even though
42:35 his skin is thicker he's absorbing a
42:37 tremendous amount of heat his
42:38 dehydration should have been through the
42:39 roof but it wasn't he was a gracious man
42:44 - he didn't showboat at all he just kept
42:48 to his guns and just peacefully walked
42:49 across that get a cane or something -
42:52 but he brought the cane I don't think
42:54 cuz he needed assistance walking but
42:56 because he knew it was a great way to
42:59 keep away predators cuz every animal
43:04 scared of [ __ ] out of well scared of you
43:06 until you back them in a corner and then
43:08 they'll go after you
43:09 now the low-hanging fruit to create this
43:14 disenfranchised sect of people is to
43:19 suggest that the only difference the man
43:22 has against man is related to the color
43:25 of their skin
43:25 in the culture that they geographically
43:29 evolved from you know Mexico or you know
43:34 the Spanish blended in with the Incas
43:38 and what-have-you and became Mexican or
43:40 the Aborigines in Australia live in hard
43:43 Luck's the Polynesians and in the
43:45 Polynesian islands and Hawaii you know
43:49 Eskimos Asians and Germans and Romans
43:52 and Arabs and Jews and all these things
43:55 the African of a frickin 's right but
44:00 it's a big planet as much as we've
44:01 shrunk it with communication and
44:03 pictures it's still a big planet or
44:06 pretty tiny as compared to its overall
44:08 radius right and so we all advanced at
44:12 different levels it's been asserted I
44:15 think quite accurately that one of the
44:19 reasons why your native Africans who are
44:22 still in tribes and
44:24 still using face paint and beads and you
44:27 know elongating their necks and picking
44:30 their mates by how high they can jump
44:32 there's a bit a lot of study to try and
44:37 figure out why that group of folks never
44:39 really advanced again according to
44:43 European advancements you ever think
44:47 about it how is it that one group of
44:49 folks can launch a rocket to go at low
44:51 orbit around the earth and flight jets
44:53 and you know study quantum physics and
44:57 this other group can't conceive of any
45:00 of those things how did that happen and
45:04 there's a brilliant theory they don't
45:07 know I don't know if it's new it's new
45:08 to me and it's beautiful and it's simple
45:10 which is if you live in an area of the
45:12 world and your culture becomes perfectly
45:17 balanced with that area of the world
45:20 then your need to grow your mother of
45:23 invention is non-existent you know
45:25 exactly how to get up and chase down a
45:28 lion until he's pants to death and you
45:30 hit them with a bunch of spears cut them
45:32 up and feed them you know where the
45:34 fruit is you know the water is you don't
45:37 have you know your your skin that you
45:38 put on as clothing is coming off the
45:41 animals that a big deal your huts that
45:44 you live in are perfectly acclimated to
45:45 the type of weather that you have
45:47 there's no weather condition that you
45:49 haven't completely taken into account
45:52 from a monsoon to normal rain to pure
45:55 sunlight all taken care of and so the
45:59 neural mesh in the brain doesn't need to
46:01 get complicated anymore because again
46:03 it's only gonna procreate in your brain
46:05 if you get over stimulated electrically
46:06 and you hold that stimulation by
46:08 thinking well when that some of us move
46:12 north us albinos move north we ran into
46:16 a lot of obstacles the weather was a lot
46:18 more seasonal right super cold winters
46:22 super hot summers the terrain was
46:25 different the Predators were a lot more
46:26 complex the foliage that we had to run
46:30 around and you know in the mid middle
46:32 Europe which was Germania area no stuff
46:36 can hide behind trees I've gonna hide
46:37 up in trees right not that that can't
46:39 happen in the African plains but there's
46:42 a lot more visibility in most areas
46:44 right or it's a desert and no one goes
46:46 in right so over time that began to
46:50 manifest yes you have areas of the world
46:54 that advanced well now what do you do
46:57 when you finally conquer the skies and
47:00 forms of planes that's all you really
47:02 need you don't need a Space Station to
47:04 accomplish this you now can see all
47:06 these other cultures that have no reason
47:09 to advance those tribes that are stuck
47:12 there in the Brazilian rainforest and
47:16 the Argentine rainforests all over South
47:18 America seemingly have never owned a
47:24 television seen a camera a lot of the
47:27 folks that take pictures of these folks
47:29 there are like modern objects in there
47:32 in their tribes is really funny like a
47:34 pot and pan and a knife you know that
47:37 they obviously got from some modern
47:38 place but they're still painting
47:40 themselves Orange like every day may or
47:46 may not bathe regularly who knows but
47:48 they're okay they're in full balance
47:50 with nature and if you're watching me or
47:54 hearing me right now you're part of the
47:55 other clan that went whoa hey the other
47:57 way
47:58 SuperDuper dense growth and now you know
48:03 we're at a point now where culture is
48:06 supposed to work pretty much 16 hours a
48:12 day
48:12 eight hours of sleep 16 two hours a day
48:16 because you go to work maybe 8 to 10
48:18 hours and that's supposed to be [ __ ]
48:19 normal right over 8 hours is nuts what
48:24 happens you got a laptop you got an iPad
48:26 you got a phone work never stops
48:29 in fact people get bored now and they
48:31 create themselves a project on the side
48:34 which is their entrepreneurial thing and
48:36 they got work so we have drawbacks major
48:42 major drawbacks in that we have been
48:44 able to intellectualize on paper a
48:47 society that doesn't work
48:49 for our genetics so anytime a culture
48:53 moves into town that is still hanging on
48:55 to previous more balanced formulas we
48:58 think they're crazy so there's a lot of
49:01 comments about how other cultures are
49:04 lazy I think that's interesting they're
49:09 just in balance with nature a lot better
49:10 in some cases right believe me there's
49:13 plenty of lazy white kids all over the
49:15 world but we have now though we have
49:19 this sort of white privilege is what
49:23 they're calling it the problem with the
49:27 haves and the have-nots formula is that
49:29 it's really it's sort of bait for the
49:33 ignorant because at all points there'll
49:37 always be someone that has something
49:39 that the other person doesn't have and
49:41 it's not that that thing is better than
49:43 what the other person has it's just that
49:45 they don't have it and there's always a
49:47 marketing company out there whether it
49:49 be the DNC or a true marketing company
49:52 for a product that will make you feel
49:53 inferior because you don't have this
49:54 thing you don't need but your neighbor
49:56 does and as long as you can distinguish
49:59 with your eyeballs that they are a
50:00 different race than you you can [ __ ]
50:03 yourself that they got that object
50:04 because of their racial privilege what
50:09 happens when you get it what if you're
50:12 able to go over to the other person say
50:13 can I have that thing and then go yeah
50:16 you could have it it's not that great oh
50:17 but I want it okay yeah here you go here
50:20 you go and let's see yeah a white guy
50:22 goes over a black guy goes over the
50:23 white guy and sits gonna have that thing
50:25 and he gives it to a black guy now the
50:26 Mexican guy is living next to the black
50:27 guy he's looking at the thing going [ __ ]
50:30 I want that thing what is that thing not
50:32 even know it is but I want it goes back
50:34 to that childhood fighting over toy
50:36 thing and now they got to sort it out
50:41 maybe a black guy doesn't wanna give it
50:43 to the Mexican guy now is this weird
50:46 dispute now that Mexican guy can make a
50:48 sign walk down to the corner and say I
50:50 don't have this thing I deserve this
50:53 thing but you know what'll happen right
50:57 let's say society steps in
51:00 and takes the thing away from the black
51:02 guy he gives it to the Mexican guy well
51:07 that's gonna create a permanent scar
51:08 isn't it but in the meantime while the
51:11 black guy and the Mexican guy are
51:12 fighting over this thing that came from
51:13 the white guy the white guy got a new
51:16 thing and the process starts all over
51:20 and you could mix up in my example all
51:23 the races chinese eskimo Aborigine
51:26 indian Arab Persian it's gonna be the
51:30 same game forever and to think that
51:35 there's a bunch of NFL players that
51:39 don't understand that victimizing the
51:43 the utter sacrifice that we have made a
51:46 citizen's for this country to give them
51:48 the privilege to play a [ __ ] game for
51:52 a living all right they play games for a
51:56 living they don't work they play a game
52:01 well you got your PlayBook and yeah you
52:03 gotta lift weights and yeah you gotta
52:04 haul your ass around yeah you're gonna
52:06 have so many [ __ ] concussions by 50
52:08 if you can think straight you all right
52:11 they're still coaches that are senior
52:14 enough that as soon as you join the NFL
52:17 and you say I am going to play a
52:20 linebacker I'm gonna play a tackle I'm
52:23 gonna play this I won't play that
52:24 defensive end these guys can look at you
52:27 and go okay so the that position your
52:31 average life expectancy is 63 years old
52:34 that's the life expectancy anyone who
52:37 plays this position because you get hit
52:39 in the head that's not your back gets
52:41 destroyed your joints get destroyed but
52:45 you're gonna make a lot of money you're
52:46 gonna have a pretty good life for those
52:47 63 years you're gonna need a lot of
52:49 physical assistance after 45 but hey
52:51 medicine keeps getting better there's
52:53 this really inexpensive crane you can
52:54 put next to your bed the morning that a
52:56 lot lifts you out of your bed into your
52:58 wheelchair they may be stem-cell
53:01 research advances and you can grow back
53:05 vertebrae that are gone but unless
53:07 you're in a position in the world to
53:09 socially engineer the world to make
53:12 things better perhaps be a philosopher
53:14 who could write a book that really talks
53:16 to the people and really pulls these
53:18 kind of things out and calls out the
53:21 [ __ ] that is complete [ __ ] and
53:24 legitimizes things a legitimate we're
53:28 gonna be in this vicious cycle forever
53:30 the first person to tell me that
53:33 affirmative action was [ __ ] was a
53:35 black male and it was shocking to me I
53:38 said well why do you say that he was at
53:42 an educational institution as an
53:44 employee he says well it's the number
53:47 one reason why black males and females
53:50 cannot get into college I'm like whoa
53:54 you know I know you're right cuz you're
53:56 educated and you're in this industry but
53:58 please explain it to me because I don't
53:59 get what you're saying isn't it made
54:01 specifically to help minorities go to
54:03 school he said yeah but it's no longer
54:07 us we are no longer than minority that
54:12 is targeted by affirmative action
54:15 it's immigrants and you know I've sorted
54:19 out trying to find out you know he was
54:21 being racist about his comments and the
54:24 thing is is that he worked in admissions
54:27 he saw the numbers I consequently a
54:32 couple years ago programmed a system
54:34 that tracked all this information for
54:37 two years he's right he's completely
54:41 right I've been to England three times
54:45 as I've said several times on the show
54:49 other than staying at the lancaster
54:51 hotel every single place i went i was
54:58 assisted at restaurants and other retail
55:03 stores by usually a black Jamaican woman
55:10 who consequently kept her i guess her
55:13 traditional clothing from where she came
55:16 from which in our world in america would
55:21 be tantamount to an Jemima
55:25 pancake syrup that that old sort of
55:32 1930s looking head wrap was sort of the
55:35 apron clothing and it started to get
55:39 eerie you know one time okay one time
55:44 hey everyone deserves a job and you know
55:47 obviously the most well I have to say
55:49 this the most polite people ever but
55:54 there was suffering in their in their
55:56 eyes and it was it made me feel
56:00 uncomfortable but I don't hear about
56:04 soccer players taking these over there
56:06 football players is what they call it
56:08 over there
56:09 so there's weird standards all over the
56:12 world and maybe it was just sheer
56:14 coincidence that in three trips every
56:17 time I went into public it was very rare
56:20 at least in food food surfaces is really
56:23 where I saw it the most I didn't do you
56:25 know cell phone shopping over there
56:27 anything but it was just phenomenal now
56:31 I've also been privileged to live in Los
56:33 Angeles and Los Angeles is a beautiful
56:35 melting pot where not only do folks get
56:39 to live here you know there's you know
56:41 obviously we have we have probably the
56:46 biggest immigration that goes on in Los
56:49 Angeles is definitely our brothers to
56:51 the south are Mexicans that move north
56:53 we have a fair amount of Asians that
56:56 move in brand-new off the boat and we
57:00 have you know a light sprinkle middle
57:03 eastern and sort of Pakistani Indian
57:06 groups that come over and the rest is
57:10 all either pretty native get a few
57:14 Europeans but that's that's super rare
57:16 me hearing some of the British accent
57:17 who's moved over is pretty rare we had a
57:21 few of those from EA when I used to work
57:23 there but it's like one out of G's a
57:27 thousand people would be like that now
57:30 once they get here to Los Angeles area
57:34 Southern California
57:36 couple things happen if they're totally
57:39 fresh off the boat first-generation
57:41 family members coming over they're
57:44 pretty lost for a while and they just
57:45 work hard to keep their mouths shut
57:47 it's just try to figure it out they're
57:49 trying to learn English properly they're
57:51 trying to be effective
57:52 trying to keep the eyeballs off of them
57:54 right there I'm gonna cause any reason
57:56 for police to pull them over and that
57:58 kind of stuff which is kind of funny
57:59 because one of the biggest jokes we have
58:01 here in LA is that if you're driving at
58:03 night and you find a car going you know
58:06 ten miles under the speed limit and the
58:08 flow lane
58:09 chances are it's an immigrant trying to
58:12 drive super careful on these massive
58:14 highways that we have here because they
58:15 don't have those kind of highways in
58:17 some of the rural areas where these
58:19 folks come from so they're terrified
58:20 they're hanging on the steering wheel
58:21 for dear life yeah there's a lot of
58:24 stereotypes about Asian people driving
58:26 badly you could say that that happens
58:31 but the main reason is is that these
58:32 folks are fresh off the boat and they
58:34 have never driven a car in their
58:35 lifetime they drove bicycles they walked
58:38 and so hanging on to a two-ton car
58:43 driving down a highway with five to
58:45 seven lanes per direction with a bunch
58:48 of aggressive drivers like myself and
58:51 other folks that we grew up driving cars
58:53 since 14 you know it's uh we sometimes
58:57 forget that these individuals are
58:59 sitting in their car utterly terrified
59:01 you know but in California we also have
59:06 a sort of disagreement with the Mexicans
59:11 down south and that there have been
59:14 times when the folks that live down
59:17 south believed that they and they've
59:19 been told that they completely owned in
59:21 controlled America which is really
59:24 fascinating when you look at Native
59:26 American history and what you realize
59:28 when I wrote my first screenplay it was
59:31 I did a tremendous amount of Native
59:33 American research in Stanford University
59:35 and you could poopoo that I got
59:37 propaganda but these books were actually
59:39 extremely revealing and I found other
59:41 books and I've got other an employee of
59:43 mine it was under percent Native
59:44 American he taught me another huge
59:47 collection of data
59:50 but what's really true is that the
59:52 Native Americans actually owned or
59:55 controlled I should say probably a good
59:57 third of Mexico so when the border comes
60:01 down at Texas and then starts wrapping
60:02 back up to Baja California and San Diego
60:05 the real map is that the little little
60:09 handle that goes down there to the Gulf
60:10 that rubs up against Mexico that
60:13 actually kept going down deep into
60:15 Mexico and they interestly at least four
60:18 tribes of Native Americans that were
60:20 down there and a lot of my Mexican
60:22 friends exude this beautiful Native
60:24 American design in their face which is
60:25 fantastic but the disenfranchised incue
60:30 bation by the DNC and the Raza and all
60:33 these different groups is to make them
60:34 feel like they are victims of whitey
60:39 they're made out of European Spanish and
60:42 the native cultures that were there when
60:44 they came over to try and find gold for
60:46 the Queen King of Spain right kind of a
60:50 new race it's kind of cool it's two good
60:54 bloodlines mixing together it's great
60:57 now in Southern California in Northern
60:59 California there's Spanish city names
61:01 all the way up to Oregon and then
61:04 there's a lot of Native American names
61:06 you know I come from Wichita I don't
61:08 come from Wichita come from the
61:11 southeast Kansas but I was raised in
61:14 Neosho County there's Wichita Kansas you
61:18 know I mean it's all these Native
61:19 American names of Shawnee County and you
61:22 know it doesn't stop there and I've got
61:24 Mexican friends of mine full-blooded
61:26 Mexican friends of mine who are for the
61:29 border down south and they actually
61:32 there you know their families have been
61:34 here for probably four generations and
61:36 they legally immigrated over here and
61:39 they don't believe in illegal
61:40 immigration because they love America
61:43 they're all American folks they've
61:44 sacrificed everything gone to war for
61:47 the country and they don't believe in
61:50 illegal infiltration but you know I I
61:54 don't hear this discussed a lot so I'm
61:56 gonna throw this into this episode
61:58 Europe for the first time is really
62:00 incurring immigration
62:03 because as much as they have the
62:05 privilege of being bordered with tons of
62:07 countries over there and learning a
62:08 bunch of different languages and and
62:09 sort of being in a segregated melting
62:13 pot like it's usually vacations where
62:15 they would travel you know cuz you can
62:17 Jesus you could be in London and take a
62:19 set of trains all the way down to Rome
62:21 and spend a week there and then come
62:24 back home you know you never got it you
62:25 never flew you were just on the Chunnel
62:28 and through all the network of mass
62:30 transit that's in Europe but in America
62:34 we really absorb people we absorb them
62:37 permanently and I know that Europe does
62:40 this - trust me I know that there's been
62:43 you know there's been Arab neighborhoods
62:45 over there forever and our there's
62:46 Armenian neighborhoods and that happens
62:48 here and you know Los Angeles like crazy
62:49 you have areas of Los Angeles that are
62:52 predominantly a particular race they
62:54 just enjoy their neighborhoods and they
62:57 get to celebrate their culture and it's
62:58 all good but the main concern that a lot
63:02 of folks have with immigration from
63:03 countries that are having serious human
63:06 rights problems is the question of this
63:12 you know love or hate America what
63:17 America was initially formed out of were
63:19 the folks that like I've said several
63:21 times on the show that we're tired of
63:22 the monarchy of Europe moved here and
63:26 the pretense that they were going to
63:28 expand the European empire to America to
63:31 the Americas right so we have this huge
63:33 slaughter of the Native Americans and
63:35 then all that everything settles down
63:37 and we fight the the the Mexican you
63:42 know contingency down here to the south
63:44 so it all calms down everyone kind of
63:45 takes a big deep breath very unfortunate
63:48 that that happened but the spirit of an
63:51 average European that came over here was
63:53 to defend sovereign rights to defend
63:56 what we eventually called the
63:57 Constitution which is based off Magna
63:59 Carta which has had a hell of a time
64:01 staying in power in Europe especially
64:03 with Merkel now over there right the
64:07 Europe is like undoing everything over
64:10 there it's that that's made Europe
64:11 amazing but now you have let's say
64:15 Mexico
64:16 Mexico has a huge set of problems they
64:19 have federales that are cops that can
64:22 rough you up put you in jail extort
64:24 money out of your family fake charges
64:27 just because they can and the government
64:29 doesn't step in so your DNC your
64:32 Democratic Party and a lot of the shilly
64:34 right-wing folks that are trying to help
64:37 globalism like a Senator McCain our
64:40 Pelosi they can take a paycheck and
64:43 destroy their country that's what
64:45 they're capable of doing and what
64:47 they've been doing their entire career
64:48 they do not care about anything other
64:52 than being members of CFR's Bilderberg
64:54 Group Scouts on Foreign Relations CFR
64:56 trilateral commission etc they want
64:58 these status symbols from these outside
65:01 agencies right and they need votes to
65:06 stay in office and so they smuggle these
65:07 folks in that don't know any better and
65:09 they'll get votes but now if you took a
65:12 citizen of Mexico it is willing to leave
65:15 their native land which is gorgeous by
65:18 the way
65:18 right if America ever just inherited
65:21 Mexico I think if we made them a state
65:24 of America then the richest people in
65:30 America would develop all the land in
65:32 Mexico and Mexicans wouldn't have the
65:34 money to live there because they have
65:37 beautiful coastlines incredible weather
65:38 just go to Costa Rica it's one of the
65:41 most famous places and you know the
65:43 South American belt down there right
65:45 there need to be modern amenities put in
65:48 like plumbing and electricity and a lot
65:50 of these rural areas but it would get
65:51 done but if you move a bunch of folks
65:54 that are unwilling to fight for what we
65:57 have fought for in America and perhaps
65:59 see in certain phases of Europe and
66:01 Europe then what happens is if you were
66:05 to think of like America with your
66:08 people who are proud Americans that are
66:10 going to fight for the sovereignty and
66:13 hold up the Constitution in all ways not
66:15 these [ __ ] taking knees and you
66:18 and you think of those folks like the
66:20 good folks as the skeletal support
66:24 structure the muscles the one that the
66:27 parts of the human body that do all the
66:29 work
66:30 then the folks that come up without the
66:34 capability of fighting for their native
66:35 land which shouldn't be anything more
66:38 powerful than perhaps your you know your
66:40 family themselves but when you think
66:42 about your family you should think about
66:43 your country and if you don't like the
66:46 country that you live in you got to make
66:48 changes in your country it's your land
66:51 it's where you're born your people have
66:54 fought for centuries to build that
66:57 country and if you're unwilling to fight
67:00 for that then you're sort of a fat sell
67:02 you're sort of you're not completely
67:05 useless or anything but you only need so
67:07 much fat in the human body before you're
67:09 done you should probably start leaning
67:10 out right so you're definitely not part
67:13 of the skeleton structure that holds up
67:14 freedom and sovereignty and so importing
67:18 a bunch of folks into a country then
67:20 again will again vote for the globalist
67:22 candidates and they're on both sides of
67:23 the fence right you've undone the very
67:27 fabric of a country that it was that
67:30 well that is great or was great
67:32 depending on one time you want to look
67:33 at it and the timeline of things and so
67:36 you know I can definitely say I've been
67:39 in many conversations with friends of
67:41 mine that defected across the border
67:43 from Mexico illegally it was like 20 30
67:46 years ago in some cases when Y buddies
67:48 came here in 1988 he walked up the
67:51 center of the 405 during a guard change
67:55 at the border he timed it perfectly so
67:58 he's walking where the cars go and he
68:00 walked up and I think he got picked up
68:03 by a relative or something they got him
68:05 to Los Angeles and we got here what was
68:08 very interesting is this his relative
68:09 said look this ain't a free ride this
68:13 ain't a free ride you got to go get
68:14 yourself a job you can have that
68:15 mattress in that room you have to share
68:17 with a couple of your cousins and our
68:18 some of our friends that we have here
68:20 but if you don't work and if you don't
68:22 make money you're going back home or at
68:24 least kicking you out
68:25 and he worked his ass off at the same
68:29 time his family respected America and
68:32 said we're here now and this is the last
68:36 stand we're not going anywhere else and
68:39 if anyone tries to take away the
68:40 freedoms that we have just inherited by
68:43 crossing the border illegally this is
68:46 where we fight because we have odds of
68:49 winning here in our home country the
68:52 police are corrupt so there's no chance
68:54 of winning well it's a lot harder to win
68:55 this but that way down there when I meet
68:59 those individuals I have no worries at
69:01 all and I haven't sat down at some huge
69:04 collective and you know and talk to all
69:05 the of the immigrants that came in from
69:08 Mexico my hope is that they're all like
69:11 my friends family but they respect the
69:14 country that they have now moved to and
69:16 they're going to throw down if anything
69:17 happens they certainly aren't weak
69:20 people right they're not physically weak
69:24 yeah sure maybe due to education they
69:27 may or may not know how to program a
69:29 computer but you know they can
69:31 definitely defend our country perfectly
69:36 but there is a limit to how much we can
69:38 dilute and absorb its really the
69:40 absorption rate should control the
69:42 immigration rate because if we bring in
69:45 too many folks that don't have the
69:47 ability to to warm up to where they're
69:51 coming from and feel the need to defend
69:53 the Constitution and that kind of stuff
69:54 again a lot of them if they go through
69:57 normal migration or immigration steps
69:59 they know more about this country than
70:01 half the kids that graduate college
70:03 around here they know all 50 states they
70:06 know what the Capitals are they know the
70:08 executive branches of government they
70:10 have to to pass and get legal admission
70:13 into the country right I was recently
70:16 told a statistic that out of the Native
70:20 American people and I don't mean Indian
70:22 the formerly called Indian Native
70:24 Americans but of the European privileged
70:27 white kids less than 25% of them can
70:31 name one executive branch of the
70:34 government they don't know where all 50
70:38 states are barely know a capital sorry
70:42 probably less than half a dozen capitals
70:44 out of 50 they couldn't quote a single
70:47 amendment or sir sorry a single
70:52 amendment to the Bill of Rights or a
70:54 they can't talk about the 1 through 10
70:55 they can't talk about the ones after
70:58 because our education here is starting
71:00 to get horrible something we have to fix
71:02 right if I were to conclude this episode
71:06 with some statement you know that is
71:09 like Rodney King sort of statement where
71:14 it's you know can't we all get along
71:15 most of you would roll your eyes the sad
71:19 part is that is really what needs to
71:21 happen in September of 2017 taking a
71:26 knee during the national anthem when you
71:30 are more privileged than most folks and
71:33 the world depending on regardless of
71:36 what your race is right it isn't really
71:39 helping anything
71:41 in my opinion before you're wealthy you
71:45 think you need a tremendous amount of
71:47 wealth you think that that's the the key
71:50 to happiness undoubtedly money can
71:53 create a lot of pockets of freedom but
71:57 in the end if you're a boring person you
71:59 will be bored to death and I know plenty
72:01 of SuperDuper wealthy people with
72:03 hundreds of millions some with tens of
72:06 millions who's struggled to keep
72:08 themselves entertained and when I think
72:11 about especially athletes that are
72:14 taking these and making hundreds of
72:16 millions of dollars they don't need that
72:17 much money in their lifetime a lot of
72:20 them won't have life expectancies that
72:22 are long enough to use that amount of
72:24 money for anything right but if they
72:27 felt so compelled to take a knee in my
72:29 opinion
72:29 take your money and help help the
72:34 disenfranchised and help them in a very
72:36 specific way where you think they are
72:37 disenfranchised if you think racism is
72:40 causing some injustice in the world that
72:44 you do what you can to take your fortune
72:47 of which you don't completely need and
72:50 apply it to the areas that you feel so
72:53 important because the idea is if you're
72:55 brilliant enough to take a knee you're
72:57 making a big statement of how ingenious
73:00 you are about the racial struggles
73:02 struggles of any citizen in the world
73:04 let alone in America right and if you're
73:08 that if you're that smart
73:10 then every dollar you spend to fix
73:13 racism should be worth $10 of someone
73:16 else investing the same amount of money
73:17 who doesn't know what they're doing you
73:20 know a couple of things I want to
73:22 mention you know one of the things that
73:24 keeps getting mentioned is the KKK the
73:26 Ku Klux Klan when I was a really young
73:29 kid in the 70s I could turn on
73:32 television yeah probably every quarter
73:34 and they were filming some town in the
73:36 south that was doing a KKK march a
73:40 peaceful protest walking down the street
73:42 with all their sheets on and there
73:44 whatever I don't really remember seeing
73:46 swastikas when I was a kid in their
73:49 hands right and a couple things about
73:53 this one I don't see that anymore and I
73:57 didn't before I left in the late 80s I
73:59 didn't see it either I mean it was
74:01 starting to boil away it was this thing
74:03 that that virtually every single white
74:07 person I knew cringed when they saw
74:10 these people on television it was never
74:12 like well at least somebody's standing
74:15 up for the white race I've never heard
74:16 anything like that in my life even those
74:20 that are the couple people I've met in
74:21 my hometown to to a young kid and an old
74:26 fart who was who were scared of the
74:29 blacks you know is two people my whole
74:32 life that had that attitude ignorant so
74:37 that has largely died off in America I
74:39 don't think there's any reprisal of
74:41 skinheads of KKK people I think their
74:45 numbers have always been extremely low
74:47 and probably declining overall and yes
74:53 they do hide I understand that but
74:57 there's this interesting place where
75:00 kids that are raised to be racist undo
75:05 their racism really really fast and it's
75:07 a fascinating yet sort of unfortunate
75:09 reality but the place that I have heard
75:12 the most amazing transformations and
75:14 racism is in war you come in from
75:20 wherever the hell you come into you sign
75:22 up to go to the military they deploy you
75:23 to a
75:24 or pretty much a random base that has an
75:26 operative as a vacancy to teach you you
75:29 go through boot camp you're surrounded
75:31 by pretty much every race you know and
75:34 then you go off to war you get deployed
75:37 in some holding area where you sort of
75:39 get your bearings together Kuwait and
75:41 then maybe you're dropped in Afghanistan
75:42 or Iraq to do something and the second
75:46 that a bullet flies by your head and you
75:51 realize that the only way you can
75:52 survive is to keep your numbers up as a
75:55 group it doesn't matter what race anyone
75:58 is in your group you're a group and if
76:02 you can convince yourself not to
76:05 participate in the group because one
76:07 guys black and one guys Chinese and one
76:09 guys Mexican you're dead or you've just
76:12 increased the odds that the entire group
76:14 is dead but I don't hear about that I'm
76:18 sure it happens and in certain areas I
76:21 guess but I have heard amazing stories
76:25 to the contrary people going in racist
76:28 and coming out absolutely colorblind
76:31 because when the [ __ ] hits the fan none
76:34 of this frivolous [ __ ] racist
76:36 [ __ ] matters anymore you're a human
76:41 being and you want to live now war is
76:42 obviously a super unfortunate outcome of
76:45 any circumstance but I think it's
76:49 interesting that when someone of a
76:50 different race saves your life or helps
76:53 you in some profound way the
76:56 unbelievable transformation that
76:59 individual has towards that race and
77:01 then once you can break the habit with
77:03 one race you start to break the habit
77:05 with all the races a lot of cases right
77:08 and the last thing I'll mention is
77:12 imagine that all of the amazing cultural
77:16 creations that happen to coincide with
77:20 race with the pigment of your skin
77:25 imagine that it all blended together and
77:27 it all melted away you have one form of
77:30 music one form of food one form of
77:34 clothing a couple hairstyles for guys
77:38 couple hairstyles for girls it's turning
77:40 into thx 1-1 3-8 which had a black guy
77:44 in it and we lose Mexican food and soul
77:49 food and whatever a white donut food we
77:53 make or and etc sector across the planet
77:55 we lose our culture's that thought hurts
78:00 my soul and you might think well you
78:03 know we'll just maintain these recipes
78:04 we'll just know that they came from
78:06 certain cultures maybe maybe because
78:11 certain cultures have been raised in
78:13 various parts of the world you've got
78:15 problems with certain cultures having no
78:18 tolerance for certain foods milk really
78:21 messes up a lot of folks in this world
78:24 super hot spices that are ingested in
78:27 Asia and the South America region white
78:30 people can barely eat we had a funny ass
78:35 experience and my my group at EA we used
78:38 to go to this pub which was it's like a
78:43 king Arthur pub or something like that
78:44 in San Mateo California and they have
78:47 this habanero burger and they make this
78:50 habanero paste it's like it is hard core
78:54 right habanero is only about 350,000
78:57 Scoville but when you make this paste it
79:00 feels like a million Scoville and the
79:03 idea was they put it on our hamburger
79:04 and if you can finish the hamburger I
79:07 believe you got the hamburger for free
79:09 or get a beer for free or something so
79:12 my group got this idea to go there and
79:15 do it and we had I had an art director
79:20 that is I believe Mayan and this dude
79:26 could eat fire and and ask for more fire
79:31 you know and he ate this burger without
79:33 sweating in fact he went got more sauce
79:35 so he could put it on the burger
79:37 and it was very genuine he wasn't really
79:40 trying to show off much he just he's
79:41 raised with SuperDuper hot peppers
79:43 and all these white guys were trying to
79:46 eat this thing a man they are sweating
79:48 bullets and given up and crying
79:50 literally eating this burger but the
79:53 other person who ate this burger with no
79:56 problem at all was one of my artists
79:58 from Singapore a female the most dainty
80:03 beautiful girl you ever saw and you just
80:06 didn't get that this would be something
80:09 that could happen because the visual
80:10 stereotypes right if girls you know
80:12 young girls not being able to eat these
80:13 super hot things but she ate that burger
80:15 laughed all the way through it
80:17 couldn't really figure out what
80:18 everybody's problem was eating this
80:20 thing very fascinating in my experience
80:25 being fairly colorblind I've had a great
80:28 life you know I wouldn't take back my
80:31 multicultural experiences for anything
80:34 you're gonna see bad behavior from all
80:37 human beings and I can almost assure you
80:40 if you could stand in my patio I said
80:42 give me your your greatest case for
80:46 disliking a particular race give me the
80:47 whole case study I think I could
80:51 probably come up with half a dozen
80:52 people of your race that I've met
80:55 probably white they have the same exact
80:58 problem it's just you allow that bias to
81:02 become the cause of why you didn't like
81:04 that race and a lot of folks by the way
81:06 that I've known in the Midwest south and
81:10 Texas which has a tremendous amount of
81:12 racism just overt racism you have big
81:16 fat white people who look in the mirror
81:20 every day and go I hate myself or I lost
81:24 my job because they didn't learn
81:26 anything new I thought my paycheck would
81:28 just come forever because I'm entitled
81:29 to it
81:31 and I've heard them say I lost my job
81:36 because of that guy over there who's a
81:38 particular color and he doesn't work
81:40 very hard unbelievable so there's also
81:45 this self-loathing thing that goes along
81:47 with usually trying to scapegoat
81:50 a social algorithm of racism well how do
81:56 you fix that you got to fix the entire
81:57 country crease education continually
82:04 educate yourself tell every citizen you
82:06 know if you sleep you lose you know I
82:10 know a lot of people who are very
82:11 wealthy here in Los Angeles like I
82:13 always say okay I'm not trying to
82:15 impress anybody when I'm telling what
82:17 I've got to tell you is this I know
82:18 they're all of all colors okay but the
82:22 difference between them and everyone
82:24 else who complains about racism and
82:26 being kept down by it is that these
82:27 folks work their asses off every single
82:30 day and they educate themselves every
82:34 single day and if they were to think
82:37 that they were racially profiled out of
82:40 opportunities a lot of my friends will
82:44 say I got to work extra hard to make it
82:46 happen I know white folks that say that
82:48 black folks just say that Mexican folks
82:49 that say that and all they're saying is
82:52 really what life demands out of a human
82:55 being not out of a race it helps I mean
82:59 if you think you're getting racially
83:01 profiled out of opportunities you know
83:06 you're gonna have to work harder
83:09 but I'm telling you it's it's like
83:12 Cheech & Chong's what third movie things
83:14 are tough all over I never understood
83:16 that so I got older I was like yeah it
83:18 is it's right things are tough all over
83:20 what about India we have slums right
83:24 next to the most amazingly wealthy
83:26 places in India they're all Indian yeah
83:30 there's several different tribes over
83:31 there but what are they supposed to say
83:34 about their poverty it's the white guy's
83:36 fault
83:37 it's the black guy's fault no they're
83:39 living a hundred percent in their
83:41 culture in their region of the world
83:43 whatever problems are going on in that
83:45 area it's because of their government
83:48 not taking care of them not fighting for
83:49 a better government perhaps right why do
83:54 Mexicans want to move to America
83:55 something's wrong down there there's no
83:59 white guy down there controlling their
84:02 wealth and controlling their federales
84:04 they control their world by the way they
84:07 have a giant border on the South border
84:10 of Mexico [ __ ] huge and it is well
84:14 built and the penalty for cross then the
84:17 border is to get your ass shot you know
84:19 well my buddies go down there to do
84:21 business they're constantly pulled over
84:24 and roughed up their possessions are
84:26 stolen in trade for being let go doesn't
84:30 happen here does it if you're
84:33 susceptible to the race card then I
84:35 would say no you're being duped you're
84:41 being exploited not saying it's not
84:44 happening to you here and there but I've
84:47 seen conversations on YouTube I'm sorry
84:52 Facebook excuse me
84:53 where there's a tiny innocent dispute
84:58 about was the recent one I heard about
85:01 was a spoiler was given for a reality
85:03 show so the finale of the rowdy show was
85:06 spewed up on someone's wall you know
85:09 what an [ __ ] to do that right and
85:12 when another person said why did you do
85:15 that you know I'm trying to watch the
85:17 show you shouldn't be telecasting the
85:19 ending of a show or the first season of
85:21 first show of a particular season
85:23 where all the secrets are coming out and
85:28 the person pulls a race card this is I
85:32 don't have any sympathy for you because
85:35 their life matters or whatever weird
85:39 right being duped being duped into being
85:45 rude to the rest of your fellow humans
85:48 because they're buying this
85:51 disenfranchised formula really sad
85:56 anyway I think you feel me it's a very
85:59 controversial subject
86:00 I think this version finally came out
86:02 decent we'll put this one up if you're
86:06 new to the show there's a website deep
86:08 thoughts radio calm all the feeds are up
