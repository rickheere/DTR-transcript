00:00 [Music]
00:32 we using gentlemen to deep thoughts
00:37 today is a beautiful day in July here in
00:41 Southern California
00:44 and I'm going to take my lunch break
00:47 here and make an episode as I drink
00:51 coffee and smoke this amazing hurrah
00:53 rastelli today we're going to talk about
00:56 the gender of the soul which I guess you
01:00 could say as an extension course from
01:02 the soul episode so if you if you're an
01:07 atheist you might get some interesting
01:11 sort of philosophical arguments which if
01:15 you invert what I say you could have
01:17 perhaps am some fodder to question the
01:23 existence of a soul in general but for
01:26 those of you who believe in a soul as I
01:29 do we're going to go into an exercise
01:32 that I think is extremely valuable and
01:34 one that I have struggled with
01:36 authentically for many decades is the
01:40 thing how many of you believe in a soul
01:43 always have but when you really
01:46 contemplate re-entering the universe as
01:50 simply a soul the fabric of your
01:55 imagination ceases you know for any of
02:00 you've seen like a computer graphic of a
02:02 world that generates itself in front of
02:04 your someone's view you know the ground
02:07 starts creating itself the sky creates
02:09 itself the people populate the area the
02:11 animals all that stuff
02:13 and it's you know wherever you look the
02:15 world's generating itself something in
02:16 some movie somewhere you've probably
02:18 seen something like that everyone has
02:20 played a memo in it but it's as if when
02:23 we leave our body in our mind and we're
02:26 creating this perception of what could
02:28 it possibly be for me at least and I
02:31 feel like I have a fairly decent
02:33 imagination one viewing the universe is
02:38 some sort of really dark void it's not
02:42 necessarily a pleasant experience as a
02:44 human being but then again I don't
02:47 necessarily have warm fuzzies when I
02:48 think about whales swimming in the
02:50 Pacific Ocean is seven miles deep you
02:53 know I feel like my god these creatures
02:56 swimming in almost zero information the
02:58 entire time no wonder they love coming
03:01 up to the surface of the ocean and
03:04 seeing the Sun seeing people seeing
03:07 boats seeing actually seeing anything
03:09 right thank God they have to breathe air
03:12 force them to that perception but when
03:15 you think about fish that breathe you
03:18 know metabolize oxygen through gills and
03:20 you think about them being at the bottom
03:22 of the ocean obviously their eyes are
03:23 different they can see things and that
03:25 sort of stuff but you know there are
03:28 various what is it you know moles and
03:30 stuff that don't have eyes and you just
03:33 think about them swimming in this void
03:34 and not having any problem with it
03:36 because they've never known anything
03:37 else a person has lost their eyesight
03:39 for whatever reason you'd have born that
03:41 way
03:41 in generally or some injury you know
03:47 living in a visual void seems
03:49 suffocating once you've seen but what's
03:54 funny about it is that I process the
03:56 existence of a soul in a visual way
03:57 because I have eyes as a human mortal
04:01 coil which is actually idiotic on my
04:05 part for doing so because the soul
04:09 obviously it's not carrying around a
04:11 human flesh and flesh and bone blood
04:13 filled water bag all over the universe
04:15 it is merely a collection of energy that
04:19 is and through whatever means it stays
04:23 together
04:25 you know perhaps soul energy twirls
04:28 together just like evil energies but it
04:33 stays together and that's an individual
04:36 by the way minor digression Here I am
04:39 late to the luc besson movie Lucie
04:43 my father had actually seen it said man
04:46 you got to see this movie it's really
04:47 great and then of course I've but people
04:49 around me say they thought it was no
04:51 good and I finally was just at my smoke
04:54 lounge and someone played it and her
04:58 it's uh Scarlett Johansson and playing a
05:01 essentially the sixth element is what it
05:04 is the guy directed and wrote Fifth
05:05 Element made this Lucy film and her
05:09 epiphany once she starts waking up the
05:12 premise of the story is basically very
05:14 simple again if you haven't you're going
05:17 to see this you've already seen it if
05:19 you haven't seen it here is your trailer
05:20 she is forced into smuggling a very very
05:25 exotic designer drug in her stomach
05:28 where they open up her stomach put the
05:30 bag in solar backup she gets to her
05:33 destination and this idiot roughs her up
05:35 and there punches her in the stomach or
05:38 kicks her in the stomach and ruptures
05:39 the bag and she ends up absorbing about
05:41 60% of this exotic drug which I'll let
05:44 you watch the film to figure out where
05:45 that's from
05:45 and this Jazzercise is her gene pool to
05:51 the point of the Fifth Element character
05:55 and Fifth Element so didn't serve
05:58 everything in terms of genetic
06:00 information but when she goes outside
06:03 and she looks at the tree she sees the
06:06 life energy of the tree and life energy
06:09 all over the place and I had told you my
06:11 episode about hanging out on the beach
06:13 and really trying to observe an overlay
06:15 of energy on top of everything and
06:17 trying to see the universe from its
06:19 purest sense but just as as dictated by
06:23 where life is we give credit to plants
06:26 and animals and people and all quote
06:29 unquote inanimate objects were void of
06:32 this just so we could see the trend of
06:34 you know
06:36 peddle life-forms when I saw Lucy when I
06:39 saw the tree I'm telling you that's
06:41 exactly almost exactly what I was seeing
06:44 when I didn't really see it but you know
06:46 this is what I'm trying to imagine on
06:48 top of people when I was doing all my
06:50 research in 2012 actually was 2013 sorry
06:57 yeah so here I am I'm thinking about
07:01 souls and how we exist what would the
07:04 ecosystem be and what's really really
07:08 interesting is we we sort of you know
07:12 this information isn't really that
07:14 important to being here right we don't
07:16 have to know how the afterlife works to
07:18 enjoy this life that's what my episode
07:21 in season 1 about the answer is all
07:23 about and there's another episode of
07:27 origin of man which goes hand in hand
07:29 it's the very next episode but the
07:31 exercise of thinking about where your
07:33 soul goes after this life is a very
07:36 interesting thing because even to the
07:39 degree that you have a problem
07:43 conceiving of it and let's say it's like
07:45 let's just say in terms of the mental
07:46 exercise it's always a train wreck in
07:48 your brain you can never take it that
07:50 far it only literally goes you know a
07:52 quarter of a second into a scenario into
07:55 a simulator in your mind as you try to
07:56 play God or try to figure out what the
07:58 simulation would be and then it stops
08:02 and you think I will never good at this
08:04 or you know just you know just hurts and
08:08 you walk away there's an extreme value
08:11 to that process that I'm going to I'm
08:13 going to give you a bump hopefully when
08:15 you run into that barrier such that we
08:18 can understand the value of that barrier
08:20 and then maybe change our perception
08:23 right at that moment and get a lot
08:25 further in our thought process towards
08:28 the soul and eventually we'll loop into
08:30 gender but let's uh since I'm going to
08:33 be calling the episode gender of the
08:35 soul let's not beat around the bush for
08:36 too long the philosophical thrust of
08:39 this episode is to recognize the almost
08:47 the
08:49 selfish bias that we adopt in being
08:53 human if we have souls I'm not sure you
08:59 know okay so there's an LGBT group in
09:02 the world that have you know they've
09:07 become very accustomed with going
09:11 against the biology of mankind for
09:14 whatever reason I'm not saying it's bad
09:16 the man and man woman and woman however
09:20 you want to do it and for them this
09:24 argument is almost a passe thing that
09:28 there is no gender of the soul because
09:30 their own gender identification is is
09:34 irrelevant ubiquitous again you have
09:39 every single strand of possible
09:41 orientations and that stuff again I
09:43 think da the EU is legislated almost
09:47 thirty but for those of us who are still
09:51 hanging on the old fashion how you make
09:53 babies way of heterosexuality the gender
09:56 of the soul is a very interesting
09:57 philosophical question to say is there
10:01 such a thing now
10:04 it brings on an immediate reaction to
10:06 some people because you're thinking oh
10:08 my god I'm so straight I would never you
10:11 know try to have any type of
10:13 relationship on a romantic level on a
10:16 family level you know in terms of making
10:19 children with my own sex with my own
10:23 orientation but if souls exist it begs
10:29 the question as to whether or not they
10:31 would ever take on any sort of gender
10:34 bias on the other side it seems as the
10:37 Egyptians would probably tell us it
10:40 would be extremely unfortunate to be
10:42 only right brain or only left brain
10:44 right to either be only a warrior or
10:47 only be a creative sensitive soul and
10:50 that is why we believe today that a lot
10:53 of the hieroglyphs that are mistaken for
10:56 northern Egypt in southern Egypt the two
10:58 crowns on being smooth or
11:00 the what they believe I what we believe
11:04 now to be the right brain and then the
11:07 more sharp one which we believe to be a
11:09 representation of the left brain being
11:12 more acute sharp indicative of hunting
11:15 sharp instruments of building the other
11:19 one as wool mesh and has the shape of a
11:21 woman's hips waist and chest
11:25 the women were born with a
11:29 predisposition to be enlightened with
11:30 the right brain and the men are
11:32 predisposition to be enlightened on the
11:34 left brain and over time through
11:35 marriage they teach each other the other
11:38 hemisphere and that's where they
11:40 believed you achieved some form of
11:42 enlightenment over time but then what
11:45 would be the point of any sort of gender
11:47 of identification on the other side well
11:51 why do we have genders here in the
11:53 biological world we have them because
11:57 there's an any in an Audi there's a
12:00 sperm in the egg the egg in the dart and
12:03 without the combination of these two we
12:05 do not have the chemistry by which we
12:08 control the creation of life now you
12:12 might ask yourself why on earth would
12:13 there be the separation of these gender
12:17 mechanisms to create life and I will
12:19 explicitly tell you why God did it that
12:21 way without separating the two halves of
12:24 this the procreation algorithm would
12:28 have exploded like the proverbial and a
12:31 very fictional Big Bang right there was
12:36 a great example of this in Douglas Adams
12:39 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy where a
12:42 female was being cloned because she was
12:46 beautiful brilliant and he wanted a
12:48 bunch of her so someone ordered several
12:50 hundred thousand of her and her name was
12:52 Lynn Atilla but the Machine got out of
12:55 phase and it got out of phase in a way
12:57 that the next Litella was half created
13:00 at the time that the last until it was
13:03 finished and so to turn the Machine off
13:04 they had to kill Alan Atilla or perhaps
13:08 several of them and so because the the
13:12 world had the universe our galaxy had
13:14 become very kind of hippie and designed
13:16 by committee they they met for for years
13:19 and decades and decades trying to figure
13:21 out what to do with this dilemma of
13:23 killing another life and eventually they
13:26 just turned the Machine off and probably
13:27 killed somebody and the fictional story
13:30 but what happened was is they had this
13:31 explosion of Lyn Tillis all around the
13:34 galaxy and then so they had its
13:37 overpopulation this weird liability that
13:39 they created all these Lin tillers and
13:41 so they created a male version called a
13:42 little which is until spelled backwards
13:45 that was absolutely irresistible to Alan
13:48 Atilla and so as soon as they meet they
13:51 want to get married but as soon as they
13:52 kiss they both vanish getting rid of the
13:55 population problem so they've
13:57 manufactured all these littles to run
13:58 around the universe and kiss all them
14:01 until O's all right kind of a funny
14:03 story the idea is if man could just
14:07 simply create man all by themselves a
14:09 sexually and there's a few creatures
14:11 that can do this we be overpopulated
14:15 so quickly that the world would reject
14:18 us they're going to be enough food
14:20 wildlife whatever down on an
14:23 intellectual level I think that there's
14:26 a safe there's a safe notion because we
14:30 know that love exists it really does
14:33 exist in some chemical form and some I
14:37 think honestly the fabric of the
14:39 universe form that typically in most
14:43 cases we have some sort of association
14:45 between each other that is fueled by
14:49 love that brings together us for
14:53 conception and obviously there's love at
14:55 all different levels which people just
14:56 love the feeling of it and so they don't
14:59 necessarily have to be in love with
15:00 someone to have sex and make a child but
15:04 that separation is to control our
15:06 explosion and population you get it so
15:09 what would happen if you had spent a
15:12 hundred years being a male or a female
15:16 in a human form that you have a soul and
15:20 then you pass away and your soul is now
15:25 joining the universe and whatever
15:28 formitz in what matters at that point
15:34 now I know that it's sort of almost
15:36 childish to ask the question of whether
15:38 or not a soul has a gender but I think
15:42 it's valuable to parse these moments and
15:44 our minds right now what matters here on
15:47 this planet and this planet we actually
15:50 feel something called isolation it's
15:53 very simple to feel that way and again
15:55 it doesn't matter if you're married
15:57 successfully you have 10 kids you got a
16:00 great job if you are thinking every day
16:03 a frequency of thought that no one else
16:06 around you is thinking then you can feel
16:09 isolated because you want to extend the
16:12 conversation beyond your own perceptions
16:14 because what ends up happening is any
16:16 subject we individually think about we
16:18 can tap into our resources and exhaust
16:23 the analysis that we can provide to our
16:25 own idea very quickly and you know hell
16:28 it could be a fifth of a second it could
16:31 be five days but eventually you're sort
16:34 of going and I've taken this as far as I
16:37 could take it I got to find someone else
16:38 is thinking the same thing that perhaps
16:40 is coming at it from a different angle
16:42 who can take my progress and move it
16:44 forward perhaps they've already gotten
16:46 to my level of progress perhaps I've
16:47 gotten to a place they haven't been able
16:49 to get to but once you become soul
16:53 energy out of all of the after well I
16:59 should say near-death experiences that
17:00 we've heard everyone has ever done DMT
17:03 that we've ever heard they all speak of
17:07 a communion that is immediately apparent
17:09 a safe painless place right once you
17:14 lose connection with your mortal coil
17:16 especially if you're over say 30 years
17:18 old depending on your health and fitness
17:21 you know I'd imagines anyone over like
17:24 75 for instance who is transcending into
17:28 their soul you're losing connection with
17:30 a pain box as much as it's worth living
17:33 and pushing through all that there's a
17:35 lot of aches and pains and your eyes
17:37 start stopped working you know
17:40 efficiently
17:41 you feel wonderful now again most
17:45 detailed stories where it's something a
17:48 little bit more than a bit you know a
17:49 tunnel of light and that sort of thing I
17:51 think that neurologists and people who
17:53 are sort of devout atheists they really
17:56 enjoy the tunnel of life story because
17:59 they've come up with this you know
18:01 philosophy in this hypothesis that
18:04 there's a chemical dump in the brain at
18:06 the time of death which can create this
18:08 light because they're terrified of not
18:12 being the authorities on the universe
18:14 they try to put everything in a box you
18:16 know and I'm going to tell you it's just
18:18 like every other piece of brain science
18:22 you know it's just a good guess or
18:24 should you guess whatever it is it's
18:28 just they don't want to release their
18:29 grip on your perception that they're
18:31 experts but everyone says who has a need
18:37 level of detail starting again DMT
18:38 people have a very similar story which
18:41 is all about traveling to a central
18:44 location in the universe that that feels
18:47 like what they believe to be God and
18:50 that there's a colours with no names is
18:54 one of the commenters put it recently
18:56 the universe is is infinitely beautiful
19:00 instantaneously obviously that sounds
19:04 pretty cool right but now if you're
19:07 sitting here in your mortal coil trying
19:09 to perceive okay how this whole thing's
19:13 going down it's difficult for us to
19:17 abstract away from ourselves our
19:19 addictions to everything that is in this
19:23 world you know let's say that you love
19:26 your house now forget people people are
19:29 going to be the really tough one to
19:32 parse so I'm going to try to avoid that
19:33 meaning your love for your family
19:35 members that you might immediately think
19:37 you're going to miss let's go with the
19:41 simple stuff the material objects the
19:43 patterns the habits you know there's
19:46 people that go to like myself I go to a
19:48 smoke lounge routinely and I enjoy the
19:53 communion with them I enjoy the location
19:55 smoking cigars and whatever and so if I
19:59 thought about transcending outward I
20:02 have this you know potential of feeling
20:06 like oh my gosh I'm going to miss all my
20:07 buddies I'm going to miss all this stuff
20:09 and philosophically let's just slow down
20:12 time and then visualize something that's
20:15 not usually Illustrated which is to say
20:20 if you think about your consciousness
20:24 swimming out to the universe with your
20:26 soul after you pass away on earth okay
20:28 to miss something in the mint in the
20:32 midst of that journey now no one's ever
20:33 reported given a [ __ ] about what's going
20:35 on in earth once they pass away there
20:37 seems to be this utter intellectual
20:39 release of what's behind you in terms of
20:44 relative time right but we are trying to
20:48 philosophically get somewhere with our
20:50 thought process slowing down this this
20:53 algorithm as human beings so we haven't
20:56 transcended yet so we don't have the
20:57 benefit of this automatic auto autonomic
21:00 system the strip's us of our desires and
21:03 so as we sit here trying to enlighten
21:05 ourselves about potentially how the soul
21:08 works and especially it's you know it's
21:14 bias based on living several hundred
21:17 years as a particular gender in a human
21:20 form to think about a continue thinking
21:26 about earthly things after transcending
21:28 it's almost as if you have a fishhook in
21:31 your flesh with a very strong wire back
21:34 to earth as you're trying to
21:36 philosophically engage a simulation in
21:38 your mind you're constantly drawn back
21:40 to worldly things now I only mention
21:44 that so if like me you have been down
21:49 this road and you did have earthly bonds
21:54 they seem to interrupt your thought
21:56 process I want you to clip them or don't
22:00 allow them to get inside your mind or
22:02 you know just kind of push them to the
22:04 side just well there's that thing you
22:06 know I got
22:07 remind myself to not worry about you
22:10 know the next Star Wars movies coming
22:12 out or who's going to sleep with my
22:14 girlfriend or my husband when I'm gone
22:15 you know there's something I haven't
22:19 talked about on the show in any level of
22:21 detail but it's the idea that if there
22:24 is no afterlife we have this weird
22:27 little thing that happens here on earth
22:29 were some people get really uptight
22:31 about the notion of dying and not being
22:34 anymore meaning a you know all of the
22:40 sort of Kurtz well people are correct
22:42 it's just a bag of chemicals as I always
22:44 say on the show but I was talking to
22:47 some person I just recently met and they
22:50 said well you know I don't really worry
22:52 about if there's not a soul because if I
22:54 die and there's nothing after this then
22:56 I'm not around to worry about it I said
22:59 exactly exactly you have these um fig
23:06 beetles running around most beautiful
23:08 scarab looking beetles you've ever seen
23:10 it's like they're built by Egyptians and
23:13 they fly around once a mom always trying
23:14 to see if they're going to land on me
23:15 during the show would be cool
23:17 they sound like helicopters but there's
23:21 this weird thing so let's say that let's
23:23 say that you're into this you're already
23:25 hip to this you've been doing what I've
23:26 been talking about for years and none of
23:28 this is a problem for you which would be
23:30 defined in a scenario that when we both
23:32 discuss the potential of the soul we are
23:38 immediately talking about that moment in
23:40 time when we've essentially escaped the
23:43 philosophical gravitational pull the the
23:47 human conceptual event horizon of our
23:51 previous existence and now we're outside
23:52 of all the influence of that and we are
23:54 pure pure soul made of soul energy you
23:58 know perhaps just life force whatever
24:00 that is right consciousness well then
24:03 what some of you will immediately recall
24:08 several tales of people going to the
24:11 other side and meeting either relatives
24:14 or individuals that took care of them
24:17 who if they're able to tell us about the
24:20 story someone
24:20 the said to them and this is what's
24:22 interesting is what I'm about to tell
24:25 you I'm slowing this down because what
24:27 I'm about to say has been said by
24:31 countless people I won't even try to put
24:33 a number up but countless people have
24:35 had near-death experiences meaning their
24:37 body died they left their body they went
24:39 and visited the location I'm talking
24:41 about here and then came back in their
24:43 body forever converted about the
24:45 afterlife existing they absolutely could
24:48 never be convinced that it doesn't exist
24:49 but they always say the same thing the
24:53 same thing they say that the person that
24:57 they met the being that they met said
25:01 it's not your time and sent them back
25:03 down now it sounds very man-made doesn't
25:07 it cause I'm going to slow this down too
25:10 because there's a lot of things that
25:12 people tell us that we don't really
25:14 parse in my opinion one what's
25:19 interesting is that someone actually at
25:23 this other location that there's a time
25:26 when we're supposed to go or there's an
25:30 index of years where you can go within
25:33 this decade it's okay if you die in this
25:35 decade but there are to be told that
25:40 it's not your time signifies a couple
25:44 things and these people aren't
25:47 superheroes these people haven't you
25:49 know it's not like Nikola Tesla and he's
25:53 13 years old or he was a young kid
25:54 actually he almost died of a sickness
25:56 never had any out-of-body experiences
25:59 that I'm aware of but you know I could
26:01 see someone saying you know it's not
26:02 your time you need to invent alternating
26:05 current and wireless technology and you
26:07 need to you know show us that there's
26:08 free energy because even though it won't
26:11 be realized in your lifetime in 2017
26:14 Eric Dollard will have dug you up for 10
26:16 years and taught the world that the
26:18 Einstein was a fraud a plagiarist a
26:21 wife-beater etc etc and the Tesla was
26:23 the one who actually invented something
26:26 whereas Einstein invented nothing so the
26:30 the luring thing is that people
26:33 who have but who have heard this and
26:35 been told this pretty much lived normal
26:38 lives the only thing out of the ordinary
26:41 was that they actually shared the
26:42 experience of the near-death experience
26:44 to us some of them in televised
26:46 documentaries right but you know I'm
26:50 always telling you guys especially in
26:51 the program universe episode that this
26:54 simulation runs flawlessly right
26:58 there's no glitch in the system for real
26:59 unless you want to say Mandela effect as
27:01 an error and not an organic byproduct of
27:05 frequencies and the perception of time
27:07 as human beings experience it right but
27:11 somehow we die too soon sometimes which
27:15 is interesting
27:16 now whoever coded this universe did a
27:20 perfect job so the interesting thing is
27:22 is that to be told it's not your time
27:24 the overlaying subroutine that is us
27:27 when we're born when we're supposed to
27:29 live and when we die maybe perhaps we're
27:31 supposed to accomplish while we're here
27:33 has sort of an anomaly maybe a bug right
27:37 why would anyone tell you that you're
27:39 not supposed to die that you're supposed
27:41 to go back down and be in your body well
27:44 the only thing I could possibly think
27:47 about or contemplate is that there's
27:50 something you have to do you know and it
27:53 could be just something as simple as you
27:55 know the butterfly in Peru effects the
27:57 tea price of tea in China
28:00 there's something you're going to trip
28:03 on contribute think do not do but is
28:08 important to the overall algorithm of
28:10 the universe now I've been beating up on
28:14 the show
28:15 the brilliant British writer Douglas
28:17 Adams about beating him up at using his
28:19 material in the show to make points I'm
28:22 going to repeat myself on my time
28:24 because the more I talk about it to you
28:27 the more there's a beautiful thing to it
28:29 which is you know in his book in his
28:31 four books Hitchhiker's Guide the galaxy
28:32 he buy the second book had told everyone
28:35 at the computer that is Earth Earth is a
28:39 computer and it's calculating the
28:41 question to life the universe everything
28:42 of which the answer is 42 he took it
28:46 the next level in the next third and
28:48 fourth book series where he had engines
28:52 inside of ships that were bistros where
28:55 you go and eat and everything that you
28:57 do inside this restaurant is part of the
28:59 code that runs the engine of a ship I
29:01 mean it was just [ __ ] brilliant right
29:05 the interesting thing about being told
29:07 that you have to go back when you may
29:09 perceive yourself as being an incidental
29:10 life in a big collection of things is
29:13 what if we were some sort of program
29:15 virtually identical to what Douglas
29:18 Adams had insinuated in his book they
29:22 were actually calculating something I
29:24 think that's fascinating doesn't have
29:27 any real route I can't point it anything
29:30 go see see doesn't that make sense yeah
29:33 something to keep in the back of your
29:35 head when you think about being us being
29:37 a simulation and anyone who invests time
29:41 and energy in something typically has a
29:42 purpose right now sometimes you get
29:46 bored and just go the mall to walk
29:47 around but the purpose is to get rid of
29:50 your boredom there's always a purpose to
29:52 everything we as human beings
29:54 I can imagine having very incidental
29:58 engagements but when you think about the
29:59 people pretend potentially running a
30:01 Truman Show I'm willing to bet there's a
30:04 pretty big purpose to do all this right
30:07 save us being just entertainment for
30:09 another realm doesn't seem like any of
30:12 the aliens that have been you know
30:15 philosophically or or I should say
30:19 romantically said to be encountered ever
30:21 had a the ability to laugh right you
30:24 know grazers supposedly the most
30:25 monotone are factory robots you've ever
30:27 heard of the ralien dude it's always
30:31 some peaceful kind of hippie thing so
30:33 it's never just like you know a whole
30:34 race of Robin Williams coming down
30:36 having a good time Christ would that be
30:38 awesome I think man gets funnier with
30:41 time I would hate to think that we would
30:43 complete a couple million years of
30:44 evolution get past war monetization of
30:48 our existence and then we're just a
30:50 bunch of boring bastards on the other
30:51 side with that stuff but once we get
30:54 past this thing to go back to our
30:56 episode here
30:58 our existence on the other side is where
31:01 I think we feel some intellectual pain
31:04 and give an example and I think this is
31:07 why it leads into a lack of belief in
31:10 reincarnation or the lack of willingness
31:12 to believe in reincarnation and I'm
31:16 telling you right now I feel the same
31:18 pain that I'm about to describe
31:21 intellectual pain let's say that you're
31:27 madly in love with someone and you've
31:28 had the fortune of spending a good
31:31 portion of your life with that person
31:32 towards the end of your life your
31:34 husband your wife boyfriend girlfriend
31:37 best friend and you contemplate dying
31:42 but you love this person they complete
31:46 you as they say I mean they really do
31:49 you love every fiber of their being and
31:52 you don't just love who they are
31:54 internally but you love who they are
31:57 physically you love looking into those
31:59 eyes and and then enchanting smile and
32:02 that sympathetic you know hug or moan or
32:05 whatever happens to keep life
32:08 interesting rate and then there's this
32:10 notion that you die and you lose access
32:15 to that that beautiful form your
32:19 beautiful form their beautiful form even
32:23 if you're dying you're losing access to
32:25 them and one way or another depending on
32:26 how this afterlife works so man
32:30 immediately struggles with the notion of
32:32 losing his or her identity and that
32:36 identity is obviously attached to some
32:40 sort of gender identification of some
32:41 sort we don't want to lose access to our
32:45 loved ones be they related to us they
32:49 our partners in life it saddens us to no
32:54 end
32:54 and then what we contemplate being away
32:58 from them it saddens us more and more
33:01 but let me make a suggestion here on how
33:03 we might interpret this to reduce this
33:06 level of concern now
33:09 the Mormons have an interesting belief
33:11 system and that they believe that you
33:13 retain your your body in the other realm
33:16 that's how they've solved the problem
33:17 there is no pain for a Mormon in the
33:19 afterlife because it's essentially a
33:21 human party in heaven but let's go back
33:24 before Joseph Smith stole a book in a
33:27 prison cell in Missouri man has not been
33:32 cremating forever man has buried bodies
33:36 and Intune themselves and you know and
33:38 bond themselves for thousands and
33:40 thousands of years tens of thousands of
33:42 years and again forget all of your
33:43 [ __ ] history about Egyptology all
33:47 right they go back to easily 40,000 BC
33:50 don't be fooled
33:52 but what happened back in the day when
33:55 they believed you needed your body to go
33:56 to the other realm what would happen if
33:58 I'm building the pyramid for instance a
34:01 gigantic 50 ton rock fell on a worker
34:04 and squished in to the width of a
34:08 millimeter they're gone building the
34:11 Hoover Dam when someone fell down into
34:13 the cement and they just kept pouring
34:15 the cement and they're just stuck there
34:16 in time frozen dead there's all kinds of
34:22 ways that we perish and there is no
34:24 mortal coil left of any kind I don't
34:27 know how they dealt with that idea that
34:30 you take your body with you or that you
34:32 need to take your body with you with
34:33 those scenarios I know that sounds like
34:36 a little gruesome digression but it's
34:38 fascinating because it is gruesome when
34:40 we don't talk about it but it is
34:41 something that is part of the
34:42 philosophical possibility in certain
34:44 religions
34:45 I don't know that Mormons engage in
34:48 cremation I don't think they do because
34:52 they believe you need your body but what
34:54 happens to a Mormon that experiences an
34:56 accident as such that their body simply
34:58 doesn't exist anymore a plane crash
35:00 something obviously the simple answer is
35:03 you get a new model as soon as you go to
35:04 the other side I've actually asked them
35:07 I said well what how old would I be Oh
35:09 any year any age you want to be like
35:12 okay at school again these are all
35:15 pacification philosophies so that we
35:17 don't have to experience any
35:18 intellectual pain when it comes to
35:20 perceiving what's after this life
35:22 right but what the creators of the
35:26 universe create a situation where you
35:28 would perhaps marry your highschool
35:29 sweetheart eat well your whole life
35:32 avoid all the vaccinations and horrible
35:34 toxins that are out there live a full
35:37 life both of you are the same age you
35:39 both live to be a hundred years old you
35:41 die of you know within 60 seconds of
35:43 each other's life holding hands in bed
35:45 what happens to you do you ascend to the
35:50 other side as the gender that you are in
35:54 love with this one soul and then you
35:58 spend eternity together
35:59 and assume some sort of Nirvana heaven
36:02 but there's no state change you are
36:04 simply a static being with no more need
36:08 for choice because there is no darkness
36:10 there really is no left and right
36:13 there's just there and that's where in
36:17 our illustration in our minds we've got
36:18 pain associated with the notion of
36:22 losing our loved ones on earth and then
36:26 once you ascend all the way into a
36:27 heavenly realm you have pain with this
36:30 notion of zero reincarnation of being
36:34 stuck in this world but as humans we
36:38 believe that as long as we can maintain
36:40 some sort of identity to what we are
36:43 here that there is no transformation
36:46 there is no birthing process you know
36:48 the caterpillar always stays a
36:49 caterpillar and never becomes a
36:51 butterfly for a lot of us the butterfly
36:56 is the soul
36:57 what kind of caterpillar dueling and
36:59 runs around on the ground as I said in a
37:01 previous episode but once he essentially
37:03 cocoons himself and rebirths himself
37:06 think of the vantage point the beautiful
37:08 vantage point of turning into a
37:11 butterfly and then getting out and
37:13 flying all over the place seeing you
37:16 know there's any one creature that
37:18 enlightens itself it would be a
37:19 butterfly because there they've got it's
37:21 amazing ground perception eating all the
37:24 vegetation and stuff and and seeing
37:27 everything really close up and then
37:29 flying and seeing a house
37:31 we always say that an ant can't conceive
37:34 of the home that he is invading and I
37:36 think that that's probably true but a
37:39 butterfly is an insect that gets to see
37:41 at all
37:42 of course any flying insights could be
37:44 put in that category but you know a wasp
37:47 isn't you know ground-based and then
37:51 becomes a flying thing it's all cocooned
37:54 up in its little embryo until it comes
37:55 out and it immediately flies roughly
37:57 right if you've ever struggled with the
38:00 notion of the gender of a soul it is
38:02 most likely because like all of us
38:05 you're very comfortable and familiar
38:07 with your human body and we have
38:12 potentially the impossibility of truly
38:15 conceiving of ourselves outside of what
38:18 we look at in the mirror every day the
38:20 more you grow comfortable with your body
38:22 and your outward personality get
38:24 everything straightened out to at least
38:25 a decent level the character in your
38:27 persona start to become one in the same
38:30 they're homogeneous congruent with each
38:33 other the frequencies are very identical
38:34 so you don't have to pretend to be
38:36 someone to other people you can actually
38:38 be who you really are you finally feel
38:42 like the battle has been won regardless
38:45 if there's daily skirmishes about life
38:47 you've essentially won and so it was
38:52 difficult to get there wasn't it you
38:55 worked your ass off to get there and
38:57 dying is sort of one of these things of
38:59 like damnit I just got this figured out
39:01 now I have to die or you know if you get
39:06 it figured out and you're 50 and you're
39:07 fairly healthy and then you get to 70
39:10 and start having aches and pains that
39:11 really just the way you can walk down
39:13 the hallway and like damn I only got
39:16 like 20 years of this sort of amazing
39:21 feeling of being really content with who
39:23 I am as a person the choices that I made
39:25 I was happy with then there's the whole
39:28 thing about you know sexual orientation
39:30 if you're heterosexual or even if you're
39:34 homosexual be the sex that you're not
39:38 attracted to it can be nauseating to
39:40 think about crossing those lines and so
39:43 we have this barrier
39:45 that we experienced day to day here as
39:48 human beings then when we think when we
39:51 think about dying and changing genders
39:53 and coming back the opposite gender it's
39:56 all from the perception of being a human
39:59 being so that doesn't need to be
40:03 belabored to any degree you've all had
40:05 that feeling if you've considered it now
40:08 let's talk about what can happen if we
40:10 get rid of this okay and this is not
40:12 about you know trying to solve or you
40:17 know biological orientations such that
40:19 we can continue procreating right don't
40:22 let the whole world to go in my opinion
40:23 if the whole world went homosexual then
40:25 there would be no more humans right if
40:29 we were steadfast to our alliance and we
40:31 didn't have little mishaps here and
40:32 there we would simply disappear it
40:34 wouldn't we so it's important that
40:36 there's at least a critical amount of
40:38 human beings that feel heterosexual if
40:41 we're to continue but in the other realm
40:44 in the purely celestial realm as they
40:47 often say I'm willing to bet it doesn't
40:52 matter I'm willing to bet that the
40:55 notion of gender in general and the
40:56 probably the information will connect to
41:00 the idea of being stuck inside of a body
41:03 it might be instantaneously forgotten
41:07 right
41:08 if you've ever saved someone's life in
41:13 any type of tiny way I was a lifeguard
41:16 so you know as much as you know one
41:19 would poopoo true near-death experiences
41:22 I can tell you I've jumped in several
41:24 times and pulled little kids out of you
41:27 know three and a half foot water that
41:28 they couldn't swim it in terms of their
41:31 memory of that moment a lifeguard saved
41:35 their life now you know obviously as a
41:38 kid struggled a bunch of people would
41:39 have jumped in but that was my job right
41:41 didn't happen that often but it happened
41:44 and the thing is is when you're in that
41:48 drowning phase you are you're in a panic
41:52 you're irrational and then they train us
41:54 for all this when you become a lifeguard
41:56 that you know when you try to save
41:57 people
41:58 maybe they may have even completely
42:01 accepted death and they're floating on
42:02 top of the water facedown and when you
42:04 save them when you you know do a hook
42:07 around their neck and turn them around
42:09 to face the air they go crazy sometimes
42:12 because they want the panic that they
42:15 had subdued immediately returns once
42:17 oxygen oxygen goes in their mind and it
42:19 reacts pretty much it's like their their
42:22 program was already in session was
42:24 pushed on pause and then you turning
42:28 them up to air push this play again on
42:30 the panic button but what's interesting
42:33 is once you gang come out and you get
42:35 them all taken care out taken care of
42:37 they calm down you realize there's no
42:39 imminent threat they're going to live a
42:41 nice long life as long as they can
42:42 figure out where they can swim where
42:44 they can swim there's this piece and
42:46 there's this column and then there's
42:48 this sort of weird moment in their life
42:52 where they've they've gone past this
42:56 panic one time in their lifetime and as
42:59 other moments of panic come up there's a
43:01 familiarity with the frequency of panic
43:05 you know if you took your whole life and
43:07 drew it in timeline and then you put
43:09 little notches in there for every time
43:10 you've ever been panic that you're going
43:12 to lose your life a bad car accident or
43:14 almost car accident or whatever when you
43:19 feel or when you're in it every single
43:22 previous moment in your timeline pops up
43:24 like a line crossing you know the the
43:27 overall timeline of your life and you
43:29 immediately see all of those other
43:31 moments but the second you go back to
43:32 being calm all the other moments for
43:35 whatever frequency you're experiencing
43:37 highlight back up so if you feel
43:41 wonderful all the times you've ever felt
43:43 wonderful pop back up in your timeline
43:45 and all the bad moments go down
43:46 everything that doesn't match goes down
43:48 and goes away we talked about
43:50 frequencies on the show a lot and I will
43:52 tell you that one of the big mechanisms
43:56 you have to understand is let's say your
43:59 life is neutral to positive we're having
44:01 a good time
44:04 and life is good it's not amazing but
44:07 it's really good and you let someone in
44:10 your life who is having a bad time they
44:13 bring in that other frequency and the
44:16 more you try to help them the more that
44:18 it reminds you of your frequencies that
44:20 were very similar and sometimes you can
44:22 keep your cool and counsel them and it's
44:24 all good but sometimes if you
44:26 continually suffer with them and trying
44:29 to help them it will exacerbate your
44:32 frequencies in the past that were like
44:34 there's and you will change your
44:36 frequency to theirs and you will start
44:38 living their suffering and that's why
44:41 they all saying is that people who are
44:43 depressed or negative will only bring
44:46 you down they can never bring you up and
44:48 it's the truth they must go out and find
44:51 for themselves what will solve the
44:54 problem again you can do a session with
44:57 them and tell them everything's going to
44:58 be ok which you should and perhaps
45:00 suggest something to them if you can
45:03 think of anything but there's almost
45:05 like a key now you got to go away you
45:07 got to go away for a little while it's
45:09 going to be eight hours could be a
45:10 couple days whatever it is you got to go
45:13 out and you got to find your mother of
45:15 invention to get out of this problem
45:16 because I got my own thing going and I
45:19 cannot have you disturbing me and you
45:23 might think that that's pretty selfish
45:25 but let's think about it this way what
45:28 if one of your closest friends came down
45:30 with tuberculosis tuberculosis is an
45:33 airborne disease meaning the more that
45:36 they inhale and exhale in the room with
45:38 you you have a fair chance of catching
45:41 tuberculosis yourself and so there's a
45:46 quarantine that happens for the person
45:48 Scott TB you can't go in the room with
45:51 them you're still their friend you're
45:54 still going to assure them that the
45:55 medical treatment that they're getting
45:56 is going to absolutely solve the problem
45:59 but in the meantime all you can do is
46:02 talk from a distance through a window
46:03 through a microphone through a telephone
46:06 in a net scenario your friend who is
46:09 suffering understands that there's a
46:11 physical proximity that must be adhered
46:14 to and observed and they're ok with it
46:20 there shouldn't be any problem with
46:23 taking that situation and mapping it on
46:25 to emotional problems as well sometimes
46:28 it has to be at a distance sometimes if
46:32 it's something that's going to trigger
46:34 you internally and I hate to even use
46:35 that word such a pop-culture word now so
46:39 let's go back into souls if I told you
46:42 that as soon as you transcend you lose
46:46 track of all the souls on earth that
46:49 would be a depressing statement wouldn't
46:51 if that were true at least from the
46:53 intellectual perception that we have as
46:55 human beings perceiving the problem we
46:58 may realize that once you go to the
47:00 other side you don't care anymore
47:02 there's a great Twilight Zone episode
47:04 which names escapes me but it's all
47:07 about this young girl who's reaching the
47:09 age where she is to shed her god-given
47:12 body and select a genetic replacement
47:15 for a new body and you go to the store
47:18 and you look at all these human bodies
47:19 and there's very few models but they're
47:21 all numbered and so someone will say oh
47:23 you've got the 27 oh you got the 14 and
47:26 it's played only by about four actors
47:29 because they're playing multiple roles
47:30 because people have multiple multiple
47:34 people pick the same body but the most
47:37 touching thing is in the last part where
47:39 this girl's is essentially that she
47:41 doesn't want to change there's nothing
47:42 wrong with heard that you've this the
47:45 characters in the and The Twilight Zone
47:46 have told her that she's broken because
47:48 she doesn't look gorgeous and beautiful
47:50 the actress looks like [ __ ] Spacek I
47:53 don't think it is way before her time
47:56 but in the end she gets the new body
47:59 they force it on her and in the end the
48:02 new body doesn't care about the old body
48:05 the entire argument of individuality was
48:08 subtracted from her ability to think and
48:10 so she didn't have any more concerns
48:13 about what she was it's not a fun
48:16 thought to think that the soul loses its
48:20 loyalty to its family members its
48:23 friends goes to the other side and
48:25 simply can't care enough in any way
48:28 shape or form to worry about the
48:30 previous life
48:33 maybe that's the case maybe it's not I
48:37 think that these dilemmas and these
48:39 arguments are often sheltered by you
48:45 know the Christianity for instance which
48:47 says there's no reincarnation it is a
48:48 sin to reuse God's machine more than
48:52 once or not reused it at all excuse me
48:55 right you mustn't be reincarnated now
48:59 let me um loop back on something that
49:02 happened to me because someone asked me
49:05 to explain it again I guess I'll explain
49:07 this one more time and maybe I'll
49:09 explain it once in every seasons I had
49:12 an experience and for those of you who
49:13 are longtime listeners you've heard this
49:15 maybe twice in the past now I'm not a
49:19 guy who thinks I see ghosts I don't
49:21 think I've ever seen a ghost in my
49:22 entire lifetime I believe that I have
49:25 communed with spirits at least twice and
49:30 the the lesser of the two is my
49:33 grandmother who passed away visited me
49:36 about noon in my bedroom I was sleeping
49:39 in and she was hovering over me and my
49:41 mind's eye again not an apparition in
49:42 the room that anyone could see and she
49:44 simply said my name and then she said I
49:47 just want you to I'm on the other side
49:49 and I'm okay now and two hours later my
49:52 mom called me and told me that my
49:53 grandmother had passed away her mother
49:56 so I was like yeah I know she came and
49:58 told me okay and what's really strange
50:03 is my mom is she's just not open-minded
50:06 enough to just take that at face value
50:07 it's always sort of some condescending
50:11 laugh II smirk that says oh you silly
50:14 dumb person you know it's really funny
50:16 but it happened it absolutely took place
50:18 with the most life-changing perception
50:22 for me about souls which I think will
50:25 put a huge bandaid on any of the pain
50:27 that you might have experienced and
50:29 listening to me talk in this episode has
50:31 to do with the amazing Walt Disney so in
50:36 2007 I met a one of the oldest surviving
50:39 Imagineers that Walt Disney hired
50:41 himself a man by the name of Bob ger gee
50:43 you are are you can
50:44 just look him up still alive to this day
50:47 looks extremely healthy I'm willing
50:49 about the scout live another 15 years
50:51 he's going to be about 100 years old
50:53 most likely but I met him at a buddy of
50:56 mine said Meads
50:57 at Christmas day and we had this
51:00 conversation about Walt Disney because
51:02 Bob had never been there before or since
51:03 and it was just the most touching
51:07 conversation talking to a person who
51:09 work for Walt Disney yes this 2007 right
51:13 and he got choked up and he just told me
51:17 he goes man the world has no idea the
51:20 amazing person who died that day and
51:24 believe me in the conversation there was
51:26 no sense that you know Walt was anything
51:28 he's accused of today I think that
51:30 accusing Walt of all these negative
51:32 things is just a diversion story I would
51:36 suggest you unless we have some black
51:39 and white proof which I didn't know how
51:41 the [ __ ] you have that today don't
51:42 believe any of the hype around this guy
51:44 but he was a bad guy so a few weeks
51:48 later I'm at Disneyland I had a season
51:50 passed at the time because they were 368
51:52 dollars for the entire year no blocks
51:54 and free parking another over a thousand
51:57 dollars and my girlfriend I were going
52:00 to the park and we're very hungry and
52:02 when you have the season pass you don't
52:03 go and just ride all the rides all day
52:05 long you go and you have we had maybe
52:09 four rides that we would ride inside the
52:11 Disneyland Park but we were going there
52:14 to eat we were both hangry going in so
52:17 we go in and there when you go into
52:19 Disneyland for those of you have been
52:20 there there's two entry points
52:21 underneath the railroad track we were on
52:24 the right side this is in California the
52:26 only one that Walt has ever been to and
52:28 there's a employee restroom off to the
52:31 right of the bank which has now been
52:32 moved so I'm standing in front of the
52:34 bank and I'm sort of so hangry that I'm
52:38 annoyed that she has to go the restroom
52:40 and delay so she goes down the restroom
52:43 and I'm just standing there sunglasses
52:46 on just like you see me today and I'm
52:48 just staring and I kid you not in my
52:51 mind's eye Walt Disney walks up to me I
52:54 can only assume he was like 30 to 35
52:57 somewhere in the
52:58 wearing a suit classic to that time so
53:00 late 20s early 30s no hat he had a
53:04 cigarette in his hand and he waves up a
53:08 cigarette and he says you know Bob girls
53:09 over there you should go say hi and
53:14 what's interesting about is my mind
53:16 doesn't form sentences like that I don't
53:17 know I don't say it as cool as that cat
53:19 did right so immediately I had this you
53:23 know Google / iPhone red pin in my brain
53:26 pulling me towards to Marlon now the
53:31 three major rides that her and I would
53:33 ride on anyone visit would be star to
53:36 her Space Mountain and perhaps Pirates
53:38 of the Caribbean because pirates is like
53:39 15 minutes long you get to sit down and
53:41 enjoy the world maybe the haunted house
53:43 maybe it'll be like a fourth little
53:45 floater in there but we're going to this
53:48 Mexican restaurant in Frontierland it's
53:50 just was our staple at the time you know
53:52 the food was great at the time so that's
53:55 where we're headed but you have to go
53:56 down Main Street past Adventureland and
53:58 the next bark overs frontier she comes
54:01 out of the bathroom we start walking
54:03 down Main Street now we are tracking
54:05 towards the Frontierland because we're
54:07 hungry and we're we're honoree but I say
54:11 to her because of this pin I should have
54:14 I should have told her at the point a
54:15 this happened to me but come on yeah
54:17 yeah yeah I'm going to tell my
54:18 girlfriend that Walt Disney walked up to
54:20 me and told me where Bob was I said well
54:24 let's go this way first not let's go
54:26 ride a ride let's go this way first
54:28 and chief whatever reason didn't argue
54:31 with me and said okay and she starts
54:35 following me and it's moderately full
54:37 I'd say the park was part about 50% full
54:40 still daytime we turned the corner I
54:44 passed Star Tours don't even look at it
54:46 don't make any mention of potentially
54:49 riding that ride and she's still
54:50 following me somehow she was pacified
54:53 through this process right now the only
54:56 other ride in this entire place is space
54:58 mountain which is continuing way down to
55:01 the right on a go anywhere close to that
55:03 place because the pin is dragging me
55:05 into the juvenile area errata topia is
55:09 and where the former submarine ride was
55:11 which has been shut down for at least
55:13 two years as is being restored to
55:15 Finding Nemo so I start going up the
55:19 Scylla past the moon burger place I go
55:20 up the hill she's following me and at
55:24 this point I am so off-base from where
55:26 her and I ever spend any time looking
55:28 back I'm like how on earth did she not
55:31 asked me what the hell are we doing here
55:33 I don't like Matterhorn which is right
55:36 the top of the mountain to the left
55:37 because it's too rough and right at the
55:40 top of the hill is Bob ger and his buddy
55:43 I walk right up to him I said Bob
55:47 because he had just met me so I was
55:49 familiar to him how the hell are you oh
55:53 my gosh you know I'm mark Bubba Bob just
55:56 reminded him and we start shake hands
55:57 and talk and all four of us are shaking
55:59 hands and he goes well we went Malcolm
56:02 mountain biking today and now we're here
56:04 to see the grand opening of this Nemo
56:07 ride and you know it was after me asking
56:11 him you know what are you doing here and
56:12 he goes well this is Imagineering de
56:14 pointes over his right shoulder you see
56:16 all the people in line he goes those are
56:17 all Imagineers and you'll see this
56:19 little Appel on my collar here on my
56:21 shirt he goes that this is Imagineering
56:24 but you're going to see these all over
56:25 everyone today I'm like wow he goes yeah
56:30 it was busted so I've been waiting in
56:32 line for an hour so we finished talking
56:35 about stuff you know I was telling him
56:37 you know how amazingly 75 years old
56:39 mountain biking and you know I was
56:41 probably 35 years old going or 40 years
56:44 old or whatever saying you know I I
56:46 don't even on bike man it's too
56:48 dangerous right then and there when we
56:52 finish our conversation later his last
56:53 sentence comes out that seems to be a
56:55 logical into our conversation a cast
56:57 member comes down this ramp because you
56:59 have to load really up high for this
57:00 kind of big tank it's the ride and she
57:03 says and because he designed the
57:04 propulsion system for the Sun Reid ride
57:07 that had been retrofitted so he's the
57:09 first one in line he is being celebrated
57:11 but the cast member comes down and says
57:14 mr. Gore we're ready for you see you
57:18 later goes away now let's rewind
57:22 while Disney in his sort of ether ol I
57:26 don't need this you know as the particle
57:28 reference but in his lifeforce he was in
57:31 front of me
57:32 purely identified as Walt Disney taller
57:36 than me which i think is great it was
57:40 just totally proportional as if he'd
57:41 walked it to me he's only there for two
57:42 or three seconds right Bob where's over
57:45 there you should go say hi to him you
57:46 know and he just does one of those walks
57:47 on then I find Bob exactly where Bob was
57:52 standing I didn't make any mistakes
57:54 walking somewhere else and then having
57:56 to correct I walk straight to that guy
57:58 and I walk to the most theological place
58:00 in the park
58:01 and that may be the most illogical but a
58:03 fairly illogical place for me to be and
58:08 he was right there
58:09 ten years later I asked my buddy Sid for
58:12 Bob's number I guess maybe nine years
58:16 too called him last year and I left a
58:17 message with him and they called me back
58:19 here at this house and I said Bob I just
58:21 got to tell you this story remember that
58:23 eval when Nemo was saying he completely
58:25 remembered the moment right sharpest
58:27 serve as an ale man he said you know I
58:30 told him about Walt sending me over to
58:31 him and he just lovingly said you know
58:34 what because this isn't is amazing or as
58:39 uncommon as you might think he goes this
58:40 happens all the time at the park and
58:42 he's not trying to blow smoke up - he
58:44 started giving me example after example
58:46 being in parking lots in the area and
58:49 supposed to be meeting people at the
58:51 park and you know the parking lots will
58:54 be completely empty no cars he gets out
58:56 of his car walks 10 feet turns it around
58:58 there's cars parked and the people are
59:01 walking towards him but because there's
59:03 you know I don't see any way they could
59:04 have been there beforehand just weird
59:07 things but you know there's all kinds of
59:09 stories about that from all kinds of
59:11 other Disney employee friends of mine I
59:14 tell you that story right now because it
59:17 doesn't give us any you know well I
59:20 shouldn't say any it doesn't answer a
59:23 lot of the questions we're talking about
59:24 right let's rewind and slow it down if
59:28 what I saw was real and not some bizarre
59:33 daydream based on the feeling Bob's
59:36 life force over there because I wouldn't
59:39 imagine that a 75 year old guy
59:40 regardless of his association with
59:42 Disneyland would spend a lot of time
59:44 going to the park but he's got a big fun
59:45 soul so he does but I'd had that
59:47 answered until I saw in there right the
59:49 Walt Disney walks up to me and let's
59:51 just say for the sake of argument that
59:52 this moment happened the way that I
59:54 experienced it Walt kept his identity
60:00 Walt kept his gender at least to me Walt
60:05 was not anything other than what Walt
60:07 probably would have been if he had been
60:08 alive and actually been there he was
60:11 trying to create a union between two
60:13 people who knew each other who obviously
60:15 if he can see into my soul and seeing
60:17 the Bob soul he knows that there is an
60:19 overall appreciation for what he did to
60:21 the park but Walt did to the park
60:23 there's there's two parks when you go to
60:25 Disneyland which is the Anaheim
60:27 California version again Walt never went
60:30 to any other parks because they didn't
60:31 exist before he passed away when you
60:35 walk in you either see a completely
60:38 nauseating commercialized super
60:40 corporate-sponsored amusement park or
60:44 you see the remnants of the park up to
60:49 the age up to the year of 1965 and
60:52 perhaps all of the additional creations
60:56 that were based on things on the
60:58 blueprints at in 65 like Space Mountain
61:01 for instance was definitely something
61:02 that had been theorized prior even
61:05 Disney World has been theorized on paper
61:06 before Walt died so we see in our
61:11 opinion what Walt contributed to the
61:13 park and we subtract all the rest and so
61:15 we're just enjoying this sort of
61:17 remnants of what's there it's almost as
61:20 if you go to Rome and you look at all
61:21 the the artifacts that are there you
61:24 don't see the Colosseum in a broken way
61:26 in your mind you see the Colosseum
61:28 finished with you know potentially a
61:31 thousand people and they're watching
61:32 people get pulled apart by lions right
61:34 the big question at the end of the
61:36 argument or the analysis and the process
61:39 of examining what might be after this
61:41 life is the following for me personally
61:46 do we need to know what's after this
61:49 life in the episode the answer I talk
61:54 about it you know not really if you have
61:57 the privilege of analyzing because you
62:00 have time left over in your human day
62:02 you've done everything you can do and
62:04 you need a rest and somehow there's a
62:05 there's enough energy you have enough
62:07 analytical ability to think about these
62:09 things slow down time and take every
62:12 step of what happens after life
62:14 potentially combining all the stories
62:16 that have ever been told sifting through
62:19 them again some people have afterlife
62:21 experiences and they see Jesus Christ
62:23 and the devil and hell and and what's
62:27 interesting about that is is that in my
62:30 personal experience of gathering
62:32 information you know sort of willy-nilly
62:34 just as it occurs to me is that most
62:37 people don't have those hell and
62:39 damnation experiences in fact they have
62:40 quite the opposite they have beautiful
62:43 non religious experiences save perhaps
62:46 the insinuation that the light that they
62:48 see whether be through a tunnel or
62:50 through some center of a galaxy of souls
62:53 is God now I'm closing let's just take
62:58 an assertion here and go with it for a
63:01 second let's say we do reincarnate again
63:06 you know don't get all bent out of shape
63:07 I mean you can you can say look I get
63:10 some time with Elvis before I come back
63:12 or my grandmother or whatever I just
63:14 want to chill I just want to relax and I
63:15 want to pay taxes for a while but you do
63:18 come down eventually in your recycle by
63:21 your own choice just the way the
63:23 universe works and let's say that you
63:26 know gender is sort of maybe something
63:29 you can choose but after you live for an
63:33 infinite number of years and you're
63:37 going to go to the other side in fact
63:38 you might be any one of these 2972
63:43 genders depending on what you know
63:44 source you're looking at you're some
63:46 interesting combination of all of the
63:49 possibilities and you're simply doing it
63:51 because you're like well why not you
63:55 know I've done it all you know I used to
63:57 be all bent out of shape about being a
63:58 girl
63:59 and then after you know hundred thousand
64:02 instances of being a man I just thought
64:05 well whatever I don't have all my in
64:07 maturities about being perceived as
64:09 potentially weak I could be a strong
64:11 female whatever now we say the truth
64:15 gives you a cool warm blue feeling
64:17 inside you're inside your system right
64:20 lies are a very intense scattered
64:24 chaotic cancerous feeling which is why
64:27 you should never tell them if you're
64:29 hanging on to one you should find a way
64:31 to let it go
64:33 you know as I've said on the show I
64:34 think one of the most therapeutic things
64:36 you can do is talk to strangers about
64:38 your lies such that you get a chance to
64:42 say it like confession but you don't
64:44 have any ability for that to come back
64:46 and hurt you and so you can be
64:48 completely open obviously finding
64:49 someone you can trust in this realm is
64:51 not easy but it's possible right
64:54 the almost I would say do I dare say
65:00 genetic barrier towards thinking about
65:04 crossing over your gender could be
65:08 construed as a moment where we take that
65:10 feeling of either rejection or
65:12 acceptance and we say it is the truth is
65:17 is that I am the gender that I am
65:19 because I feel such a strong biological
65:22 connection to my gender there's no way
65:25 that when I leave and become sole energy
65:26 that I'm going to release this bias and
65:30 that might be true it could be just
65:33 because you're human you have this huge
65:35 bias right now gender is obviously a
65:38 very dirty word these days there are
65:42 folks that can't figure out what gender
65:45 they are and so they get very angry and
65:48 agitated by the argument within their
65:52 own mind and what they try to do is
65:54 demonize any specific reference to
65:56 gender such that they don't have to deal
65:58 with the chaos in their own mind of
66:01 trying to figure out what they are
66:02 Society says you have to pick one and so
66:07 they don't want to pick one and so they
66:09 get angry and they say don't reference
66:11 gender don't say boy don't say girl
66:13 don't say men don't say women so we let
66:17 this tiny group of folks who are
66:19 struggling and God bless them to create
66:24 this bizarre almost different way of
66:29 seeing all of ourselves but let me throw
66:33 out perhaps an unpopular conclusion to
66:37 the idea if Souls have no gender then
66:43 perhaps one of the things that we could
66:45 think about in terms of really going
66:49 along with these individuals up here on
66:51 earth sort of and maybe reducing the
66:54 significance of putting things in gender
66:56 boxes is that what if we were more
66:59 prepared for the afterlife if we could
67:03 be more ubiquitous and agnostic and
67:09 androgynous about our souls about who we
67:13 are as individuals that we are
67:14 consciousness obviously you know most
67:18 folks that feel secure in whatever they
67:20 are they are they've made decision this
67:23 is what they are they have their reasons
67:26 be it they believe to be a genetic one a
67:30 social one or both but what do we gain
67:33 by pulling away from our souls at least
67:36 let's keep let's get rid of the debate
67:38 here on earth let's go back into the
67:40 soul realm what would we call ourselves
67:43 if we were simply Souls we have a lot of
67:49 words to choose from right let's put our
67:52 little lexicon the word consciousness
67:54 awareness identity
67:57 at a minimum I think those three terms
68:00 can be used for any one of us
68:01 referencing the other in this realm in
68:04 this celestial realm some people worry
68:08 about losing their identity in the other
68:10 realm
68:12 and I think it's not there they're wise
68:14 enough to say whatever your first and
68:18 last name is in this world and you're
68:20 probably not going to be referenced that
68:22 in the other room no matter what you
68:23 believe you're going to have some you
68:26 know print symbol that you are write an
68:29 unpronounceable symbol because in the
68:31 other realm you don't have the
68:33 instruments to pronounce anything you're
68:35 just consciousness I would imagine that
68:38 your consciousness has a shape and an
68:41 identity like a snowflake and that
68:43 perhaps if there is any sort of
68:44 familiarity in the other realm if you
68:47 and I bump into each other and we've
68:48 never met on earth we meet and you have
68:52 a symbol that you are it is that when I
68:55 look at your energy or feel your energy
68:57 you have a uniqueness to you and I have
69:00 a uniqueness to you and so perhaps our
69:03 uniqueness affects the frequencies
69:05 around us such that like penguins who
69:08 come back together to mate they always
69:10 seem to find their monogamous assigned
69:12 mate you know the whole penguin thing
69:14 where they they lay their eggs and then
69:19 they hatch and become little tiny
69:20 penguins little birds can't really do
69:23 much for themselves and the parents have
69:25 to take turns going off and feeding they
69:28 can hear supposedly the squawk of their
69:31 offspring as opposed to the squawk of
69:34 other offspring which really is
69:36 phenomenal if you think about the
69:38 distinction of frequencies so I don't
69:42 have any answers as to whether or not we
69:44 do have a gender I assume we don't
69:47 personally but you have to dig about it
69:50 yourself I think the larger debate here
69:56 or intellectual thought process or
69:58 enlightenment that we can perhaps
69:59 achieve is to be able to have enough
70:02 conversations for whatever reason
70:04 whether we're debating you know some
70:07 sort of identity on the other side our
70:09 gender on the other side if the if the
70:13 question of what happens after this life
70:14 is interesting to you and perhaps even
70:16 bird nests to your overall daily
70:18 consciousness the more conversations we
70:21 can have that are sort of
70:23 perhaps not very enlightened you know
70:26 we're having just sort of willy-nilly
70:27 lowbrow conversations about what what
70:30 could possibly be on the other realm the
70:33 more that we have these conversations is
70:35 almost as if you're building in a forest
70:38 your first village where you know you're
70:41 not sure how to build a shelter but
70:43 first thing you do is start clearing out
70:45 the brush and creating a place to sit
70:48 down you know and eventually someone
70:49 goes well you know what I did was I took
70:51 these branches and I kind of made a
70:52 little fence and so now the animals that
70:54 crawl on the ground don't get inside our
70:55 little area then we put a roof over it
70:57 right so slowly we build the you know
71:00 the house of cards auction sales of
71:02 cards we build the scaffolding that we
71:04 need to stand up higher and stand up
71:06 higher and stand up higher and we may
71:07 end up finding that does a whole branch
71:10 of thought that we just flushed but we
71:12 have to go through all these this
71:14 process all this debate to get to a
71:17 point where we ascend to those other
71:20 levels of understanding does God want us
71:22 to understand the other side if there is
71:24 one I don't know I don't know are we to
71:28 be distinctly human and not really know
71:31 about the other room it would seem that
71:32 there's a lot of indicators that that
71:35 could be the truth we are not one with
71:38 the universe in any consciousness way
71:42 but perhaps the reason why we
71:43 reincarnating is to achieve this level
71:45 of ascension and and go back to the
71:48 atomistic way of believing where you
71:50 know the spiritual realm and the human
71:52 realm are one
71:53 although distinct and have in their own
71:56 ecosystem of life that we have this
71:59 communion with the other side and I will
72:02 say that out of all the cultures that
72:04 believe in an afterlife that leave food
72:06 offerings no Japanese have some of the
72:09 more traditional homes as I understand
72:10 it you know altars to their to their
72:14 loved ones where they offer food and
72:17 incense and nice things this is a
72:19 holdover from Egypt where they did the
72:22 same thing and the reason why I
72:24 mentioned this is the following out of
72:26 all my personal research I have never
72:28 read a hieroglyph that said that they
72:30 had communication with the afterlife
72:34 they simply believed that it existed
72:37 they believed that they had embalming
72:38 process the prepared you for it and when
72:42 they left out food like I said you know
72:43 when the food gets rotted and dies they
72:46 think that's the spirit coming to eat
72:48 the essence out of the fruit but they
72:51 never said oh and he said you know how
72:54 about that Cubs game it never happened
72:56 and so throughout all history we haven't
73:00 had any indicators that anyone has ever
73:04 made any contact with the other side in
73:06 any overtly normal way I mean again
73:13 correct me I'm sure you guys have better
73:14 history than I do in those realms but I
73:16 haven't read anything about that I've
73:19 just heard the ceremonies that believe
73:23 that there are souls right this was I
73:25 could have gone down a hole haunted
73:27 house thing where people of very
73:29 specific genders haunt homes and stuff
73:31 like that it even carries some sort of
73:34 physical impression of their previous
73:35 being like Walt Disney for me but
73:40 that'll be for another episode because I
73:41 don't know much about that stuff so I
73:45 hope you feel me deep thoughts radio.com
73:47 for all the feeds again this video for
73:49 an audio audio if you're on video your
73:51 video options are YouTube then V dot M e
73:54 your audio is iTunes Google Play or just
73:59 go to default radio comm and your mobile
74:00 device and click the RSS feed link and
74:02 it will load up whatever podcast reader
74:04 you have on your phone we have a locked
74:07 Facebook group sometimes I say page I am
74:10 mistaken when I say that if you watch
74:12 the old trailers too old videos I'm
74:14 talking about the old website MK ULTRA
74:17 calm okay little radio calm and I talk
74:19 about the old Facebook page which we
74:22 eventually shut down really appreciate
74:24 your comments both in YouTube and on
74:27 Facebook a lot of you are coming from
74:28 the podcast over to the videos the the
74:31 one benefit I'll say is that for some of
74:32 the videos that are referencing a lot of
74:35 inventions or science sometimes I'll put
74:37 up images but I try to reference that in
74:39 the episode so that you know that you're
74:41 not getting the full package by just
74:42 listening to an audio so just keep that
74:47 in mind
74:48 once you take care of yourself and
74:50 someone else and I will see you in the
74:51 next few thoughts over now
