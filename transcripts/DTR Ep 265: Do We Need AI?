00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts today I'm
00:38 smoking a wonderful gift by one of our
00:41 listeners Ritchie Montgomery Ritchie's
00:45 very special because he is an incredible
00:48 artist I'm gonna put all the links to
00:49 his wares down below that way I don't
00:53 say something that expires he's all over
00:56 the place but he draws in a very special
01:00 way that I could only liken to artists
01:03 like MC Escher he doesn't have one
01:08 particular style but he does have some
01:09 popular styles that he likes to
01:11 illustrate in he is currently really
01:14 blowing up in America he's getting a lot
01:16 of requests from merchants and
01:17 businesses to illustrate a lot of their
01:20 wares because they're just looking for
01:23 something different you know and
01:24 something beautiful and something
01:25 handmade this Opus X is the Blue Label
01:29 Opus X and it is absolutely the finest
01:31 OPA sex I've ever had in my life I've
01:33 only smoked one of these before because
01:36 they are so rare to get a hold of I'll
01:38 show you some pictures of it Thank You
01:41 Richie and I'll try to make this a
01:45 really good episode
01:46 so recently did some traveling and in
01:50 doing so I always like to get caught up
01:53 on some reading both in my collection of
01:56 books and in the you know Swilly rags
02:02 that are published and sold at airports
02:04 right you can't get him more I don't
02:09 know I think vile group of
02:12 books than you can in an airport but
02:15 anyway I bought everything I could find
02:19 out artificial intelligence to still do
02:21 a little bit of an update of where we
02:23 are now before I go into this episode
02:26 there was an AI episode way back in
02:28 series 1 very early on and I think the
02:31 first thing you have to know about
02:33 anyone talking about it is what's their
02:34 background because if you don't
02:37 understand the person talking you might
02:39 just go god no not another one of these
02:42 things right artificial intelligence was
02:45 definitely around just as soon as
02:48 someone could conceive of it especially
02:49 the Turing test back in the day which is
02:52 a test to see to say if a computer can
02:55 convince a human being that another
02:56 human being is actually conversing with
02:58 them and they passed the Turing test
03:02 we're gonna get into that a little bit
03:04 too I think but in the mid 80s as a
03:08 aspiring programmer I jumped into
03:11 artificial intelligence on my end with
03:13 very little training because the amount
03:14 of published books where I particularly
03:17 was located was nil but I was a teenager
03:20 anyway without any money there was no
03:21 internet and I'm not sure how many geeky
03:25 magazines were accessible I never really
03:28 looked but I came to California as a
03:30 young man became a programmer very
03:32 quickly was involved in a start-up very
03:36 quickly that required some artificial
03:39 intelligence and it was going to teach
03:43 all the people the world of ran this
03:45 program the sort of gamey program how
03:48 the Masters discovered electricity way
03:50 back in the day by giving you a
03:52 playground where you actually recreate
03:54 the experiment what I didn't know is how
03:57 utterly brilliant that product would
03:58 have been I don't know if it's ever been
04:01 really created I've seen a couple sort
04:03 of attempts to do that but my job was to
04:06 program the product and draw it and I'm
04:12 one of the partners was an artificial
04:13 intelligence guy who was going to
04:16 college for it probably in his late 20s
04:19 early 30s and it was funny how he had
04:23 the computer science degree I didn't
04:26 he was taking a special you know
04:28 master's degree in artificial
04:30 intelligence and we sat down at the
04:31 table I'm 18 years old and this guy
04:34 knows [ __ ] all about AI unbelievable
04:39 couldn't figure out a way to have people
04:41 ask questions and free-forming text and
04:44 decipher that question into a response
04:47 by the program because they wanted you
04:49 to kind of be able to get your own help
04:51 my strategy was simply to say look we're
04:54 looking for keywords then just throw a
04:56 batch of answers at them because again
04:58 artificial intelligence as you will
05:00 learn in this episode is merely a
05:04 reenactment of a very specific request
05:09 to a programmer to satisfy that request
05:12 in some form of response what does that
05:15 mean everything you ever see that blows
05:17 you away about artificial intelligence
05:19 has been specifically coded to exist
05:21 there is no dynamic creation of thought
05:24 but there is one question that we have
05:26 not asked and it is the name of this
05:28 episode of what you already know do we
05:32 need AI do we need it in all my travels
05:37 I've just realized that I've never heard
05:40 anyone ask the question on now there's a
05:42 lot of articles written about things and
05:43 I don't read those articles because I
05:44 don't know they exists so someone's
05:46 probably asked the question before maybe
05:49 a dozen times maybe three dozen times
05:51 but it's probably written and paid for
05:54 by someone peddling something selling
05:56 something usually when someone says hey
05:59 you know why do you need that washer and
06:02 dryer and they'll say well because I've
06:04 got you know things to do and these
06:06 things automate the process for me so I
06:10 go off and get more done with life and
06:13 they're right artificial intelligence is
06:17 there to replace what real intelligence
06:21 and I think that the before I get into
06:25 everything that I read there's a bit of
06:27 a paradox to say well can man really
06:30 create man is that possible is there
06:33 some out magic algorithm of
06:38 sort of fractal reiteration where you
06:41 can say whatever comes out goes back in
06:43 and whatever comes out goes back in and
06:45 it just manifests it becomes
06:47 exponentially smarter simply because
06:49 it's digesting its own output or can you
06:51 take to artificial intelligence BOTS and
06:54 make them talk to them talk to each
06:55 other and then they learn they don't
06:59 need another human in the room and then
07:00 just like all the Hollywood [ __ ]
07:02 that's out there oh my god they're God
07:04 right there feature I will tell you
07:07 being an engineer and having douve into
07:10 artificial intelligence several times in
07:13 my career looking at the different
07:16 infrastructures and platforms that they
07:18 used to create artificial intelligence I
07:20 have not seen anything revolutionary at
07:22 all ever but when I have conversations
07:25 are overhear conversations about
07:27 artificial intelligence what I
07:28 constantly hear is a regurgitation of
07:31 what Hollywood told them or the
07:35 ambiguous statements of a Stephen W
07:38 Hawking or of an Elon Musk who oh my god
07:40 these guys said they've seen horrible
07:42 things and it's gonna be horrible
07:43 horrible horrible I want you to keep in
07:46 mind that maybe some of the some of
07:50 those doomsday statements really have to
07:53 do with regulating the industry prior to
07:56 the industry becoming profitable such
08:00 that they're gonna be the only ones that
08:01 will be able to lawfully introduce
08:03 artificial intelligence and you sitting
08:05 in your living room will be breaking the
08:07 law if you happen to create an
08:08 artificial intelligence by yourself thus
08:11 locking in the community for Elon Musk
08:13 to dominate whatever's there as a
08:16 interesting contrast and I would say
08:21 almost similar theme and archetype I
08:25 bought a magazine on UFOs and I might
08:28 drag some stuff out of that magazine to
08:29 make an episode but I haven't read
08:31 magazines in a long time it's actually
08:32 very interesting to get into it but
08:35 nearly every single article in this UFO
08:37 magazine that I've read so far probably
08:40 half at this point because I bought
08:41 about six magazines to get through every
08:44 single article was the same I was like
08:46 oh there are these aliens and people
08:48 have seen them but maybe there's a
08:49 government conspiracy
08:51 that was every single article well then
08:54 there was these aliens and then people
08:55 said they saw him but maybe there's a
08:57 government conspiracy to hold them back
09:00 it was like every single article
09:03 well the AI magazines there was three of
09:06 them some of them Scientific American I
09:08 think was popular science there was a
09:12 philosophy one that had a few articles
09:15 about it we are stuck on first day class
09:21 first day class I am not hearing
09:24 anything that I haven't heard for 35
09:26 years in this industry oh they will
09:30 preach about neural nets and they'll
09:32 talk about this one thing that starts to
09:34 make your jaw drop a little bit but then
09:36 you start to realize oh wait a minute
09:37 you programmed that AI to do that one
09:39 thing so of course it did that one thing
09:42 and as it didn't pass the Turing test or
09:45 did or didn't please the generals or the
09:47 commanders are gonna pay for all this
09:48 research or the board of directors the
09:51 investors all you did was massage the
09:53 experience such that the output looked
09:55 more organic and everyone gives you
09:59 another year's budget without being up
10:01 your butt about it right I will tell you
10:04 in a couple things here I've had some
10:07 conversations recently in the last week
10:09 as well with fairly informed individuals
10:11 about it
10:11 there's nothing revolutionary going on
10:14 in artificial intelligence as it relates
10:16 to science-fiction things like the Blade
10:19 Runner Nexus series you know replicants
10:23 nothing remotely like that happening at
10:26 all if you see any sort of you know
10:29 rubber costumed robot behaving like a
10:32 human being every single thing that you
10:35 are seeing has been hand coded we are
10:38 not at West world yet we're not even
10:40 close we're not even at one day old baby
10:43 however like I said in my first episode
10:46 in the first season what they do have is
10:49 very basic machine learning artificial
10:53 intelligence loops and that sounds so
10:55 big doesn't it do you realize that every
10:58 piece of mechanical code that has ever
11:00 been created or written whether it be a
11:02 calculator that you have to you
11:04 no run a rotary hand crank to get it to
11:08 tumble the gears to calculate something
11:10 all the way up to the latest Swift 3.00
11:13 code that's been compiled and run on
11:15 your telephone it's all artificial
11:17 intelligence anytime something is not
11:19 using direct human intelligence to
11:22 happen it's artificial what they have
11:26 done is create drones they have created
11:30 drones that are as big as planes and
11:32 jets and they've created little tiny
11:34 micro swarming drones that can fly
11:37 around with you know two to four little
11:39 propellers and they can control
11:41 themselves in 3d space these devices
11:45 depending on how big they are can hold
11:46 enough circuitry and power to identify a
11:48 friend or foe
11:49 organic non-organic and carry out
11:52 various tax tasks against those targets
11:55 we've had robots roaming streets on the
11:59 behalf of the police looking for bombs
12:01 and what have you going into hostile
12:03 areas for over 20 years what's the big
12:06 deal man we've had wrote remote-control
12:08 cars since the seventies when I was a
12:11 little kid right so you make it a lot
12:13 bigger you put guns on it and all of a
12:16 sudden you've had a revolution I don't
12:17 think so it's no more intense than the
12:21 Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am I had as
12:23 a kid
12:24 but these things are lethal Boston
12:26 Dynamics DARPA robots are designed to be
12:30 utterly lethal the last episode of
12:35 season 4 black mirror will show you why
12:37 so we don't need a hell of a lot of
12:39 intelligence and we don't need to
12:41 develop another line of code at this
12:43 point in terms of the intelligence of
12:46 these robots to have a big threat on our
12:48 hands in terms of how these things could
12:53 take over a city and the one thing that
12:57 black mayor did beautifully in their
12:58 final episode was that they created
13:01 these little teeny tiny robots these
13:03 little like about a chihuahua sized
13:05 robot and that's the best way to make
13:09 these things as deadly as hell besides
13:10 little microscopic bees that could drill
13:12 into your head and kill you or the video
13:15 that's going around for some fictional
13:17 show where it shows a draw a drone
13:20 excuse me that swings and taps you in
13:22 the forehead and puts basically a 22
13:24 round in your head it takes a little bit
13:27 of pattern recognition for it to figure
13:29 out what your faces and then engages a
13:32 maneuver to get you get itself there I
13:35 guess we will be wearing lead foil hats
13:37 at that point right there's a fantastic
13:40 Twilight Zone I forgot its name but it's
13:42 about a gentleman who gets fascinated
13:46 Aeons a factory and he gets fascinated
13:48 with artificial intelligence and he
13:49 starts replacing all of his employees
13:51 with computers and one of his employees
13:54 says you know you're an [ __ ] we have
13:57 to build things with the human soul
13:59 because that gives a man a sense of
14:00 purpose and dignity he tells the guy you
14:04 were so passe you got to get with the
14:06 times baby and the guy just quits by the
14:11 end of the episode the man who started
14:13 the whole nightmare was laid off himself
14:14 and replaced with I believe Robby the
14:17 Robot with us head swap and that's you
14:20 know somewhere in their 60s they made
14:23 that prediction right
14:24 do we need artificial intelligence it's
14:26 a real question I know it sounds like a
14:28 gimmicky little technique to create a
14:30 clickbait situation but it's not the way
14:33 I view this question is very simple
14:37 about the mid 60's in the United States
14:39 of America at least we had restored of
14:42 the apex of our educational ability to
14:46 teach a human being something the kids
14:49 coming out of college became some of the
14:50 most successful kids per capita of
14:54 children graduating college and those
14:56 who didn't go to college actually did
14:57 extremely well as well because you know
15:00 K through 12 was actually fairly
15:02 informative people were happier because
15:04 they did have a sense of purpose we
15:07 prided our own country's products you
15:10 know made in America meant something but
15:13 when one could go to bed at night having
15:14 accomplished something well regardless
15:16 of what that is it makes you feel better
15:18 but now we're in a situation where
15:20 education couldn't be crappier I would
15:23 say most likely globally and this is the
15:27 foundation that we're using to create an
15:30 artificial copy of our
15:31 selves to start replacing man at every
15:35 single conceivable level now it should
15:38 be noted that there are AI replacement
15:42 initiatives that have already been put
15:45 in place right
15:46 you know robots make cars giant portion
15:50 of assembly lines are made by cars okay
15:52 next one up is the the next rumored
15:56 stage of deployment which are you know
15:58 like for example would be fast food
16:01 locations being replaced by robots so
16:06 that's not quite here it's coming maybe
16:09 there's one prototype and deployed and
16:11 you know Omaha Nebraska whatever and
16:14 then there's the sort of basta dynamic
16:16 stuff it's like holy [ __ ] that is going
16:20 to be very questionable as to how this
16:23 is used right and again everything's
16:26 buttoned up inside of a nice ribbon
16:30 Boston Dynamics really has two things
16:33 that they have been pioneering the mule
16:35 and the the man the mule has been put
16:40 out there as oh it's just gonna carry
16:42 really heavy things for soldiers right
16:45 because there's all these soldiers in
16:46 the desert carrying gigantic bundles of
16:48 things three the Special Forces that
16:51 carry very little or they have six
16:54 wheeled vehicles for wheeled vehicles
16:56 that are driving from point A to point B
16:58 knowing how I e DS work it would be an
17:02 absolute travesty to have you know what
17:05 if you have ten robots from Boston
17:07 Dynamics you're probably talking about a
17:09 hundred million dollar tab and some guy
17:11 uses you know fifty thousand dollars
17:14 worth of mortar shells and blows up all
17:16 those targets in one fell should it's a
17:20 shooter swoop I don't remember but the
17:23 man one is interesting because they're
17:24 teaching it how to crawl over all these
17:26 different terrains and so essentially
17:28 what it is is it's a robot with a bunch
17:30 of cameras and a processors that can run
17:32 fast enough to constantly look down at
17:34 the ground find its depth find obstacles
17:36 whether or not one is close like a door
17:38 jamb or sorry door knob versus a stick
17:40 come pointing right at its face versus
17:42 nothing and opening and then it makes
17:44 decisions but again
17:45 all we see are cleansed videos out of
17:48 DARPA Boston Dynamics you know they've
17:52 had a chance to tell that robot what to
17:54 do and maybe it failed 999 times but got
17:58 it want right one time and that's the
18:00 video you see they kicked the mule in
18:04 the parking lot who's walking on ice and
18:06 99 times out of 100 it falls on its ass
18:09 and it cannot get back up again but the
18:11 one time that it you know corrects and
18:13 it gets gets to stay on his feet that's
18:16 the one we see there's a kid in Korea
18:20 that's creating mechanised robots just
18:22 like all them ones even play in a video
18:24 games for years but artificial
18:27 intelligence isn't always a military
18:29 thing right it's it's in your house
18:31 there is the push for 5g networks which
18:36 is basically going to cook all the DNA
18:37 of every one neighborhood that has them
18:38 because they want every single device in
18:41 the world to be shipped and controlled
18:44 and in full communication with some
18:46 central system and you know there'll be
18:49 these sales pitches to make it sound of
18:51 luring well if you ever lost your remote
18:52 control easy ask your computer it'll
18:55 tell you where it is have you ever lost
18:57 your socks easy it'll tell you where
19:00 they are but imagine the cognitive
19:04 skills that we have to find the remote
19:07 control to find your socks going away
19:11 simply because the computer always
19:12 answers the question for you we have
19:17 learned in the recent past the critical
19:18 thought is almost you know going into
19:21 extinction it's an endangered species of
19:24 neural operation and the only way to get
19:29 it back is to go back into the gym of
19:31 thinking which is obviously why this
19:33 show exists right I'll tell you a study
19:36 I've never seen and that is the study of
19:39 saying what are the the the food groups
19:43 the basic food groups of a cognitive
19:45 healthy human being the the types of
19:51 thoughts that an individual has to be
19:53 able to have the creativity that they
19:55 have to possess the discernment that
19:57 they have to have
19:58 to create a fully functional beautiful
20:01 human being and then compare that
20:06 against the artificial intelligence that
20:09 is being presented to the world as being
20:12 the next thing that we want to do and
20:15 saying how will this by replacing that
20:19 and pare that from being able to
20:21 function properly I'll give you an
20:23 example that you've all seen in your
20:26 lifetime if you're at least 25 years old
20:29 you have a friend whose mommy took care
20:33 of him or her every day of their life
20:36 did all their laundry had it all nice
20:38 and folded made every single meal if the
20:41 car ever broke down dad went off and got
20:43 it fixed or paid someone to fix it they
20:46 never had to do a damn thing and then
20:50 for whatever reason they get out on
20:52 their own because they believe they can
20:54 conquer the world and life goes to [ __ ]
20:57 real fast because they can't do anything
20:59 on their own they don't know how to iron
21:01 a piece of clothing they don't even know
21:03 what a vacuum cleaner is and that is
21:07 because the parental units have
21:11 prevented those circuits from ever
21:14 developing in that person I have dated
21:17 several people like this I used to hate
21:20 the fact that I was an only child and
21:21 basically a human slave in my house to
21:24 do all the chores and all that stuff but
21:26 man when I turned 17 and I got out of
21:28 the house I was so thankful that that
21:31 was my past because surviving was easy
21:36 but that's the threat that is always
21:40 going to be a threat to mankind
21:42 if artificial intelligence takes off and
21:46 it gets sort of overgrown now I'm gonna
21:51 jump off here for about five minutes and
21:53 give you an example of a very almost
21:57 humorous way that we have seen it work
21:59 really well it's a fictional setting
22:03 here the Star Trek series created by
22:06 Gene Roddenberry is a great example of
22:10 artificial intelligence playing a fairly
22:12 in role in humans lives but not being
22:16 too overbearing we have a ship's
22:20 computer they have various utilities
22:25 like replicators and in next generation
22:29 we have a Android named data in Voyager
22:38 we have the hologram the doctor who
22:42 doesn't really ever have a name for one
22:44 point he's going to call himself
22:45 Einstein or something like that but so
22:47 we've seen this integration where human
22:49 beings are still required to behave and
22:51 still required to be involved with you
22:54 know arming photon torpedoes and firing
22:57 it's all a human thing the artificial
22:59 intelligence is perhaps just sort of the
23:02 underbelly of the ship the circuitry
23:04 that makes it happen you push a button
23:06 that says fire just like in your car
23:08 when you turn on your air conditioner
23:09 circuitry completes and it happens we
23:13 have artificial intelligence programs
23:16 inside all of our big commercial jets so
23:18 if someone tries to pull a 911 in a jet
23:21 the jet won't allow a 4G turn it's
23:24 impossible it will prevent it it will
23:27 prevent that dangerous situation from
23:29 occurring the pilot can try and the IOA
23:32 I will refuse it so where do we want
23:35 artificial intelligence where do we want
23:39 it well I think that one of the things
23:44 the Star Trek actually did really really
23:46 well and probably without thinking about
23:48 it is that man in that series has to
23:52 maintain the central consciousness of
23:55 the time there's a captain that runs the
23:59 ship every individual has their own
24:01 quarters they make requests for tea Earl
24:05 Grey or whatever since the hull and the
24:11 Replicators will create a for them but
24:14 it comes from a command and response
24:16 relationship with artificial
24:17 intelligence
24:20 I was given one of these echoes for
24:25 Christmas and I understand these things
24:28 our little surveillance mechanisms and
24:30 everything that you say into an echo is
24:32 actually transmitted to the central hub
24:34 and translated then the command is sent
24:36 back about how to respond to it with
24:39 your Alexa woman inside I use her to
24:44 wake up it's actually very interesting
24:46 to use voice commands to set alarm if I
24:49 need to snooze it snoozes if I need to
24:51 move the alarm I move the alarm on
24:53 occasion I might ask a question but I
24:55 usually don't there's a bunch of fears
24:58 that these echoes actually listen
25:00 without your permission
25:01 and transmit your information from the
25:04 room to some central location I can tell
25:08 you as a programmer it would be
25:09 extremely easy to put some voltage
25:11 meters on this thing to put a router a
25:13 route tracer on the outside and you
25:16 would be able to as an agency for the
25:19 consumer protection you'd be able to see
25:22 it talking out the back door
25:24 instantaneously but it's definitely an
25:26 area where all the companies are
25:28 fighting to prove to the central
25:30 intelligence agencies and various
25:31 military agencies perhaps the NSA that
25:34 they are the one to to allow to be in
25:37 the top of the pile because they will
25:39 provide and sell and market spy
25:42 information or spy devices into your
25:45 house right
25:46 Apple's entire spy portfolio and if you
25:48 just take every single company like
25:50 Google Microsoft and Apple and you say
25:53 wait wait wait they're not really what
25:54 you think they are they are wooing the
26:00 surveillance community by how much they
26:03 can create devices that spy on you for
26:06 instance all three of those companies
26:07 create an operating system which means
26:09 everything that you type and everything
26:10 that you save on your hard drive
26:12 transmitted over the Internet is all up
26:14 for grabs
26:15 so all that input is spied on Apple
26:19 takes it one step further as well as
26:21 Android Google and that you carry your
26:25 spy device around with you your cell
26:27 phone it does GPS as to where you are
26:29 and it we've already solved a lot of
26:31 crimes as a result of this right
26:33 the next one up for Apple is the watch
26:35 and there's an Android watch it does the
26:37 same thing but the idea is they want you
26:40 to wear this thing everywhere you are
26:41 and it they've fed into it the biometric
26:44 information right they want to know how
26:46 your heart beats and there's fitbit's to
26:50 do it there is an Android watch now
26:54 they're trying to promote the fact that
26:56 you should wear your Apple watch to bed
26:57 you have this radioactive cancer machine
27:01 attached to your body it's remarkable
27:03 how that's done but the new one is the
27:06 echo the new one is this the Apple calls
27:09 at the home unit or whatever it is but
27:11 they're all fighting to put these little
27:12 listening devices into your bedrooms you
27:14 should have one in every room of course
27:18 they never price it so that's possible
27:20 so there's a big business in trying to
27:23 woo these agencies to violate the Fourth
27:25 Amendment to control us and the military
27:29 commissions Act is the exemption
27:33 document that was drafted during the
27:35 Bush administration reaffirmed during
27:37 the Obama administration no mention of
27:40 it during the Trump administration so
27:41 far perhaps it hasn't rehab to renew yet
27:45 that allows all these Fourth Amendment
27:48 violations to be essentially
27:51 tongue-in-cheek not a violation of the
27:53 Constitution of the United States if I'd
27:55 ever hit the Supreme Court we would find
27:58 out who is actually working for the role
28:00 bank and who's not
28:01 and we'll get off into this tangent but
28:02 too much but you need to understand that
28:05 that's what's really going on with all
28:06 that technology they're not interested
28:09 in keeping you satisfied except to say
28:12 love surveillance an artificial
28:16 intelligence is going to play a big role
28:18 as this progresses I've been going to
28:22 Disneyland for a very very long time
28:24 and they have this Imagineering sort of
28:29 building in Tomorrowland where you can
28:31 go in at least it was last time I was
28:33 there and they'll have the kitchen of
28:34 tomorrow this is where you got to you
28:36 get to see a tremendous amount of how AI
28:40 is being integrated into the household
28:42 they want to rfid chip every single
28:45 ingredient that you have in your house
28:47 that any day you walk in they can tell
28:48 you okay you have enough to make
28:50 spaghetti did you know you can make
28:52 fettuccine because you bought that
28:53 little pound of chicken again at face
28:56 value it sounds great and maybe in some
28:58 of these more strategic ways like a Star
29:01 Trek environment where you have a
29:02 utility that serves you on command it
29:06 might be nice maybe you'll become a
29:09 better chef under one circumstance but
29:13 why do we become fat weak why do we
29:19 become stupid after we were smart why
29:23 are we allowed to stay incapable of
29:26 taking care of ourselves because
29:28 something else or someone else is doing
29:30 it for us right but isn't it sort of
29:33 blasphemous for me to say or or even
29:35 viewed as ignorant for me to say should
29:39 we have a I should we go in that
29:40 direction isn't the knee-jerk response
29:43 simply to say what are you an idiot of
29:45 course this is an imperative this is an
29:48 obligatory thing in time it must occur
29:51 you can see how they would eat us alive
29:53 in the public if we ever created a group
29:55 it said this is a bad idea because the
30:00 public doesn't have the knowledge I
30:03 think in bulk to this day to be able to
30:06 analyze this without having it broken
30:08 down so I think the good news is the
30:13 level of AI at this point is so bad so
30:16 remedial so laughable like the echoes
30:20 and the series and the Alexa's and there
30:24 it's just stupidest thing in the world I
30:26 mean all you're doing is verbalizing a
30:30 search in Google and then based on how
30:33 they want to route the answers you get a
30:37 look up read to you over these devices
30:40 and people are [ __ ] all over
30:41 themselves it's like well it wasn't a
30:43 very amazing when you said who is Albert
30:44 Einstein in Google and it simply sent
30:47 you to the Wikipedia page and now the
30:49 only thing that's really occurred here
30:50 is that Siri reads it to you do you
30:54 really think we're just how 9,000 is the
30:56 very next thing that's about to show up
30:57 in your bedroom
31:00 some people think that that's what's
31:01 going on oh my god I talked and it
31:03 recognized my voice and then it gave me
31:05 information back whoo it's set an alarm
31:08 Oh God we're gonna be traveling the
31:10 Stars any minute now when you get into
31:13 artificial intelligence and you start to
31:15 parse the atom of what it means to be a
31:19 human being
31:20 hell even an insect or an animal you
31:23 start to come into the grips very
31:24 quickly that we have this amazing
31:26 process by which we are created we don't
31:30 really understand the embryo to fetus to
31:33 baby process when it relates to the
31:39 development of the mind and
31:40 consciousness whether you know again
31:43 there's there's those of us that believe
31:45 in Souls and and I've gone down that
31:47 road a million times let's just say that
31:50 whatever you believe we are is a given
31:53 at the inception point and then after
31:55 that point we're gaining our
31:55 consciousness and control over ourselves
31:57 and the identification of who we are but
32:00 I went off on a little tangent when I
32:02 was 16 years old I've been programming
32:03 for four years and I started just to see
32:09 things I just started to see artificial
32:11 intelligence brains and how we could
32:13 actually start building a consciousness
32:15 out of the the sensory input that we
32:20 would put into an artificial
32:21 intelligence and after about six months
32:23 of designing and programming some basic
32:26 things and again if I'd had the internet
32:27 it would have really blown up as a young
32:30 kid because I needed for one of the
32:32 elements of its brain I needed to have a
32:34 lot of textual content and digital form
32:36 which we simply didn't have or you know
32:39 I I didn't even own an Internet and
32:42 sorry a modem for quite a while but very
32:46 quickly even as a child you'll realize
32:49 that we have bodies and we have at least
32:53 five senses that we're taking it now
32:55 most of us believe we have a hell of a
32:56 lot more now but even just the five
32:59 senses every single one of the senses
33:00 becomes this ultimately complex
33:04 insurmountable amount of data that comes
33:07 in it has to be logically mapped to all
33:09 the other senses which provide the same
33:12 level of astonished
33:14 sight hearing and touch before we even
33:18 get to a super higher hyper construct
33:21 like love right and so the this one of
33:26 the magazines I bought recently I think
33:28 as a Scientific American
33:29 it talks about I want to Swilly mag this
33:32 thing's turned into oh my god
33:34 they couldn't interview a bum on the
33:36 street without the guy you know having
33:38 some you know global warming agenda or
33:41 something it's really just awful awful
33:45 writing but it was the profound cover
33:50 story okay
33:52 it's Sony among other vendors has
33:57 realized that artificial intelligence
33:58 really needs a body and so they've
34:01 created this sort of infant child sort
34:04 of like a robot and they're starting to
34:07 you know make it interact with the world
34:09 and and they're trying to figure out how
34:11 to decipher the input to try and create
34:13 these these Turing test versions of
34:20 their program to again convince you of a
34:23 very small thing going really really
34:26 right it's child's play and I'm telling
34:30 you you know my my adventure was in the
34:32 mid 80s okay by 1985 I was doing this as
34:35 a teenager okay it's 2018 it's been a
34:40 long time and it's been over 30 years
34:42 and we're still at ground 1-0 right now
34:46 I know what some of you will say you'll
34:47 go over to that hundred year theory and
34:49 you'll say yeah man but the government's
34:53 way ahead of us and that's sort of a way
34:55 to cop out and I'm gonna say not not
35:00 probably as much as you think no there
35:04 are artificial intelligence programs
35:06 that are given various charters like
35:10 predicting crime like the Minority
35:14 Report thing you hear this rumored all
35:16 over the place right well they could
35:19 take your your profile and your data and
35:21 then compare it against all the other
35:22 convicted criminals and they can find
35:24 out whether or not you're likely to
35:25 commit a crime
35:27 things you say the places you go where
35:28 you spend your credit card what kind of
35:30 food you eat cut people you hang out
35:32 with where you live in the world with a
35:34 nutshell Republican well that's your
35:36 registered gun owner sure it's just a
35:40 statistical probability that they run
35:42 and you know sure you could be likely
35:46 but you still don't have to do it how
35:48 many times do your friends and family
35:50 blow you away that you thought they were
35:52 total losers what you thought they were
35:54 gonna be Ivy League's total successful
35:57 scientists or whatever singers
35:59 performers whatever and either they
36:01 turned into something amazing when you
36:03 thought they couldn't or they turn into
36:05 complete losers when you thought they
36:06 had it in the bag and why did any one of
36:09 those things happen because one little
36:10 tiny thing happened to them that kicked
36:15 it off let's take a few examples of
36:17 where artificial intelligence if they
36:19 were to reach these these total ape X's
36:22 of programming that they're not reaching
36:23 today might be sold to you as would it
36:26 be great if there's a lot of you who
36:29 love pets and you've owned several pets
36:33 in your lifetime because you've lived
36:34 more than say 10 years and your pets on
36:38 average live between 8 and maybe 14
36:40 years and they pass away but some major
36:43 artificial intelligence company comes in
36:44 and says you know what we have created
36:47 and this has already been done to some
36:49 degree and it's been pretty awful but
36:51 let's say they can create a cat and a
36:54 dog or maybe even some totally weird
36:57 Mughlai thing that's just cute as a
36:59 button and it has a means of learning to
37:03 a certain extent it does everything that
37:05 a cat and dog does it ingests it
37:07 excretes it is your sort of your best
37:09 friend it's soft it's it walks in real
37:12 time it's not some weird robotic looking
37:15 thing and they say you know what what's
37:18 the worst thing about owning a pet and
37:20 the answer comes back well they die and
37:24 they say well wouldn't you like to pay a
37:27 certain amount of money for a pet that
37:30 can be designed to your heart's content
37:32 and it will never dine it gives you all
37:35 the interaction that you have from every
37:37 single pet species that you like if you
37:39 like the way that cats walk between your
37:41 legs when you walk down the hallway well
37:43 we can make this pet do that if you like
37:45 the way that dogs greet you when you
37:47 come home we could make it do that and a
37:50 bunch of other things that none of the
37:51 pets that you've ever had have done and
37:53 you could build an artificial bond or
37:56 even a real bond excuse me with this
37:58 artificial pet and the beautiful things
38:00 that never dies so that comes down the
38:03 line a couple things happen right away
38:06 cats and dogs start to suffer because
38:08 nobody wants them anymore why because
38:11 they die they have a short life span
38:14 no one rescues in them anymore it's over
38:19 sure you'll have your hippies that still
38:21 get those pets and your your hunters in
38:24 the south that still get their hound
38:26 dogs but for the most part those guys
38:28 and gals are just relics
38:30 everything's artificial intelligence
38:33 well what happens when a pet dies I'm
38:37 gonna do an episode about a pet that I
38:38 was involved in that is a wonderful pet
38:41 that passed away I've got a great
38:43 gallery of photos I'm gonna put in there
38:45 for you the human being grows when a pet
38:48 dies you know I used to always think it
38:51 was fairly cruel to get a pet for young
38:53 kids because pets do die and depending
38:57 on if you got the pet prior to your
38:59 child's birth because pet you know kid
39:01 number one was the reason why you got
39:02 the dog and by time he gets a kid number
39:04 three the dog has lived three or four
39:07 years and it is going to pass away well
39:10 within the infant stage of the third
39:13 child and they're gonna have to deal
39:14 with the trauma of it all I used to
39:16 think that was cruel when I was young
39:21 having experienced it now in very
39:24 three-dimensional way in my 40s because
39:28 I'm allergic to pets for the most part
39:30 so I don't get them in California it's
39:35 interesting my block has quite a few
39:37 dogs but most of my friends don't have
39:39 any pets of any kind because their life
39:41 is too busy to be able to integrate
39:43 feeding an animal and having
39:45 life but my grandfather used to always
39:47 have dogs and when they passed he went
39:52 through a traumatic situation I believe
39:55 he had three dogs within my lifetime the
39:57 soul grows when you see mortality happen
40:00 now if you live a full fledged life and
40:02 you don't lose track of your parents
40:05 whether they be biological parents or
40:07 adoptive parents doesn't really matter
40:08 your friends if you don't lose track of
40:10 them you will bury your friends and
40:13 family at some point it happens
40:15 sometimes you'll be on their deathbed
40:17 holding their hand as they pass into the
40:19 the other world as they transcend but a
40:23 dog is a way to get a shortcut to that
40:25 huge learning curve it teaches you about
40:28 your own mortality doesn't it something
40:33 that is truly alive and truly organic
40:34 organic is giving you their true love
40:38 and their true decision-making process
40:40 to be a part of your life and regardless
40:43 of how wonderful and artificial
40:45 intelligence might be in the back of
40:46 your mind if you as long as you know it
40:48 is an artificial being you will know
40:50 that all you're doing is convincing an
40:51 algorithm to give you a true or false I
40:54 love you I don't love you I'm hungry I'm
40:57 not hungry as much as it might emulate
41:00 reality it is not reality now some of
41:02 you might be thinking about those men
41:07 who are married to dolls they take sex
41:11 dolls they have polygamous and rubbery
41:14 relationship in some cases they have
41:16 lots of them they eat dinner with them
41:18 they take them to bed they dress them up
41:20 they take them to parties with each
41:22 other oh my god that must be some great
41:24 conversation we do have exceptions to
41:27 the rule where people are so undone this
41:31 is their only option in their own mind I
41:33 always say there's someone for everyone
41:35 you just can't give up on looking for it
41:39 but as artificial intelligence usurps
41:42 the responsibility of man man will no
41:45 longer have that skillset and every
41:49 decade that goes by that that particular
41:51 utility of man has been replaced man
41:54 will forget how to do it biologically
41:57 one of the most amazing things you can
41:59 do in your life is to go out and hunt
42:02 for your food now some of you might be
42:05 thinking about you know using Spears or
42:09 something or arrows and having a really
42:12 hard time at it you're gonna hunt some
42:14 venison well what about just throwing a
42:18 little worm into a lake and fishing out
42:21 a fish what about just taking eggs out
42:24 of coop and cooking them fresh no matter
42:29 how you accomplish that task if you
42:31 don't do that on a regular basis if
42:33 you're not Ted Nugent it's a rewarding
42:37 experience to go back to the primal
42:39 version of what we were because we used
42:41 to do this a hell of a lot more than we
42:42 went to those you know shopping center
42:45 and got our food the grocery store if
42:49 any of you have made a little garden in
42:50 your backyard and then you are sitting
42:53 at your table looking down at vegetables
42:55 and there's this little thing in your
42:56 brain that said oh my god you can really
42:58 grow tomatoes I mean I can really just
43:00 put a seated in soil and water it and
43:02 take care of it and harvest what comes
43:05 out of it I can really look at how we
43:10 have taken automated industries and lost
43:13 our capability of really sustaining life
43:16 for any of you who are Preppers or you
43:19 know a prepper
43:19 one of the psychological evaluations
43:23 that they've come up against is to
43:24 simply say how much of our primal
43:26 capabilities have we lost if we lost
43:28 power in this world just power it went
43:32 dead all around the world I'm going to
43:36 predict that there would be a 90%
43:39 reduction in the population of this
43:41 world within whatever the starvation
43:44 envelopes are of your local region if
43:47 you have fresh water you can live a
43:48 little bit longer the people would go
43:51 feral people will eat each other alive
43:53 probably literally and once that's done
43:56 they die the summary report I can give
44:00 any one of you listening to this episode
44:01 is of the mental artificial intelligence
44:04 that we have developed to date is [ __ ]
44:06 it is
44:10 infantile if anyone shows you a demo
44:13 that makes you convinced otherwise that
44:15 demo has been specifically programmed to
44:18 make that xpick situation appear
44:21 intelligent but you ask it to do
44:24 something 90 degrees over to the side
44:26 and it will fail right I give it a
44:30 hypothetical example they have written
44:34 an AI they can look it and I'm making
44:35 this up right they can look at a flat
44:38 photograph of a human being it
44:40 understands the overall basic genetics
44:43 of a human being and it starts to trace
44:45 limb length and starts to make
44:48 estimations using shadows and the pixels
44:50 of the photograph to figure out where
44:51 joints are so it starts to then
44:53 reconstruct underneath the flesh or
44:56 underneath them maybe underneath the
44:58 flush but underneath the clothing the
45:00 actual body of the human being and it's
45:01 fairly accurate if you got a big big gut
45:06 and it figures that out if you're all
45:08 ripped it figures that out and you're
45:09 like oh my god this artificial
45:12 intelligence can figure out people
45:15 underneath their clothing in just static
45:17 old photographs they even showed it a
45:19 picture of Winston Churchill and by God
45:22 if it didn't make something look like
45:23 Gary Oldman but then you ask that same
45:26 intelligence what is a cotton ball and
45:29 it just goes into this Robbie robot
45:32 probably the robot infinite loop of
45:33 self-destruction because there's no
45:35 goddamn clue what you're talking about a
45:37 true consciousness and artificial
45:40 intelligence is going to be a device
45:42 that can learn everything that a human
45:44 baby can learn if you were to take the
45:47 first 10 seconds of a human infant the
45:50 second it exits its mother's womb and if
45:53 you could track the trillions of
45:56 experiences that it's having on a
45:57 five-point census system in 10 seconds
46:00 and compare every single artificial
46:03 intelligence developed to date in some
46:06 DARPA basement in some 100-year theory I
46:10 would wager that we can't dissect or put
46:14 together any artificial intelligence
46:17 that can capture the first 1 second of
46:20 that experience to properly index the
46:23 IMP
46:23 and make sense out of it such that the
46:25 second incoming second a five of a
46:28 five-point it says sense system could
46:30 attach to the previous second and
46:32 continue building a logic gate a neural
46:35 net of any intelligence whatsoever in
46:37 ten seconds
46:38 the a eyes of today the most brilliant a
46:40 eyes of today trying to simulate human
46:43 thought would look like some you know
46:46 hundreds sided rubik's cube that had
46:48 been blown up by a pipe bomb it doesn't
46:51 mean just like a robot that can paint a
46:54 panel in a forward factory that could be
46:58 reprogrammed to make a Big Mac better
47:00 than the fat cow fat kid that loves cake
47:03 doesn't mean that can't be done but
47:05 that's not real intelligence that's
47:09 mimicry that's a script that tells an
47:12 arm to go here their waypoints you know
47:14 left-right up-down in three inches back
47:16 four inches grab the cheese use your
47:18 camera to figure out whether or not it's
47:19 cheesy enough use a thermostat sensor to
47:23 see if the meat is at the right
47:24 temperature before you pull it out
47:26 working with all the sensors in the
47:28 ovens to make sure that everything's
47:29 going well yeah that's intelligent up to
47:32 the point of making a Big Mac but you
47:33 can't make a souffle Isaac Asimov put
47:38 together some great directives for how
47:39 to handle sort of an android robot which
47:46 was actually beautifully recreated in
47:48 autumn ax the Antonio been des movi it's
47:53 free again on Netflix but I think
47:55 perhaps before we allow an Android to be
47:58 created we got to go back to the basics
48:00 and say what is going to represent a
48:04 human being and it's healthy mental
48:06 state it's critical thinking all that
48:08 good stuff and then what are we planning
48:11 on you know facilitating ourselves with
48:13 when it comes to automated processes
48:16 with which we call artificial
48:19 intelligence which is really sort of
48:21 automated intelligence right well it's
48:24 gonna make man stronger what's gonna
48:26 make man weaker we talked about on this
48:29 show and it's it's a pretty good keyword
48:32 out there in the internet which is that
48:34 empathy is is dying
48:36 now I'm gonna qualify that by saying I
48:38 think that with the recent awaking
48:41 empathy is being reborn it's a long
48:43 process right it takes no time to use it
48:47 but it takes a long time to create it
48:50 how do we get empathy there are some
48:55 people that have it fairly fairly
48:59 regularly and and they have it from
49:01 birth but empathy just to kind of rewind
49:04 here for a second it is your ability to
49:07 feel what someone else feels to put you
49:09 and put yourself in their shoes not just
49:11 to feel sorry for them that's sympathy
49:13 right but usually we have empathy
49:16 because we've been in their shoes we've
49:20 been there before
49:21 what if artificial intelligence got to
49:23 the point where it starts replacing
49:26 enough little tiny microscopic elements
49:28 of human existence but by the time
49:30 someone suffers in some very basic way
49:33 or some advanced way we're unable to
49:36 sense what they feel because well geez
49:40 we've always had our robots to do it for
49:41 us and these people can't afford robots
49:44 so we don't know what it's like my you
49:48 might have conversations you know 200
49:50 years from now if this stuff works out
49:51 it at any level where someone will say
49:53 you know I couldn't even imagine what it
49:55 was like to to lose a sock I mean with
49:58 this my neighbor lost a sock and he you
49:59 know he couldn't figure out where it was
50:01 and I couldn't believe that that was
50:02 even possible I mean I ruin thought
50:04 about it the torment of losing a sock or
50:07 your neighbor that has a dog that dies
50:09 but you got a you got an automated one a
50:12 replicant I know you feel what I'm
50:15 saying here I think a large part of me
50:18 is just sort of sick and tired of
50:20 hearing folks that don't know anything
50:21 about programming I mean I'm not angry
50:25 about it but it's it's this thing where
50:28 they they'll carry these headlines to
50:31 you in a conversation will cheer you on
50:34 Moe said [ __ ] that guy are you serious
50:39 swear to God you're buying a straw man
50:42 just like Zuckerberg is not a coder
50:44 you're buying [ __ ] if you believe
50:49 these folks if the
50:50 mass media tells you someone smart
50:53 unless we have really reengineering this
50:55 country most likely they are the
50:58 antithesis of anything defined as such
51:02 right all the people that are science
51:05 heads either they're they you know they
51:09 can't speak and they're quadriplegic and
51:11 someone else is programming they're
51:12 speaking spell or you know they don't
51:16 have science degrees walking around
51:19 saying there's science guys right other
51:22 got degrees that are 3040 years old
51:24 claiming to be on top of things
51:28 spewing some basic old theories that
51:31 most folks can't understand because one
51:33 they're wrong and two they require a big
51:37 foundation of knowledge to to be able to
51:40 question a mention of general relativity
51:42 or special relativity is wrong how are
51:46 you going to prove it is wrong you were
51:49 going to have to have not only that full
51:51 intimate knowledge of those two theories
51:52 which have a lot of spin-off theories
51:55 but you're going to have to have the
51:56 counter theory the counter science that
51:59 is the true replacement for that
52:01 deception that's a lot of hard work
52:05 artificial intelligence is exactly the
52:07 same and because AI is sort of put on
52:10 everything right it's at any time
52:14 there's a a calculation a process that
52:18 is put into motion not just a functional
52:21 remote control but something that says
52:23 I'm gonna dim the lights at 10 o'clock
52:25 because I don't think you need anything
52:27 to be that bright after 10:00 I'm gonna
52:29 turn down your heater at least two in
52:31 the morning if you haven't done it
52:32 yourself I'll turn it back on you know
52:35 up to 72 just about 50 minutes before I
52:38 see you get up in the morning because I
52:40 got a sensor that has motion detection
52:42 in your house and on average I just I
52:44 just created an average wakeup time and
52:47 I go fifteen minutes before that make
52:48 sure the house is heated up by time you
52:49 get up I think mankind is sort of this
52:53 is no this is not a profound statement
52:55 maybe thirty years ago of you more
52:58 profound but I think man is losing grasp
53:00 of reality
53:02 because of all the amenities of life
53:04 those of you who look at all the drugged
53:07 up people and I don't mean heroin and
53:11 cocaine those kind of things but your
53:12 people that are on all these drugs that
53:16 help them think better and do things
53:19 yeah some people have physical problems
53:21 that's a different situation but people
53:23 are trying to use sort of lifestyle
53:25 drugs to try and get an edge on
53:29 something you know we have energy drinks
53:34 you know I'm guilty of drinking a couple
53:37 that are fairly neutral in terms of its
53:40 damage to my body but still I need to
53:42 just get better sleep I need to manage
53:44 my life better and stop using artificial
53:47 ways to patch up my life so I want you
53:54 to take all those things in your mind
53:56 that we use that we probably shouldn't
53:58 use and then make every single one of
54:01 those things and artificial intelligence
54:02 in your mind and say wow just like the
54:06 you know the third act of wall-e the
54:08 movie the the obese people that floated
54:10 around in those cars they had no bone
54:12 density if I didn't have an a bone
54:14 matter in their body to connect any of
54:16 their bones together because a little
54:17 car that they drove around and did
54:19 everything for them
54:20 well it's a physical representation of
54:22 the mental representation we're talking
54:24 about in this episode it's food for
54:26 thought isn't it don't believe all the
54:30 hype do me that favor understand we are
54:33 at Ground Zero any rumors you hear to
54:37 the contrary are most likely just rumors
54:40 if you hear some cousins brothers friend
54:44 is a big three-letter acronym agent and
54:47 and they're telling you some tall tale
54:49 about a computer they saw that could do
54:51 this and that maybe I'm gonna put all my
54:56 money that whatever they saw was
54:58 specifically programmed to create that
55:00 one calculation that one response and
55:04 then again they don't know what a cotton
55:06 ball is it just as a quick footnote to
55:09 the end of the episode there there's a
55:14 lot of sci-fi talk
55:16 about downloading a consciousness into a
55:19 computer being very close to the
55:24 individual who wrote and directed Tron
55:26 back in 1982 I will tell you that this
55:30 is a subject I cover a lot with him
55:34 always looking at the next level of what
55:37 that can be turned into in terms of
55:40 sequels or rebooting that particular
55:41 franchise having worked on another film
55:45 with him that dealt with that exact
55:49 thing the exact technology we're talking
55:52 about here which is downloading a
55:53 consciousness a new computer and you
55:57 need to understand we're not sitting in
55:58 a room with just all fictional ideas we
56:02 do massive research read books that are
56:04 four inches thick to update our
56:08 knowledge on where technology might be
56:11 with that the the going theories about
56:13 how to do that and I will tell you that
56:16 that is nothing more than an HG Wells
56:19 theory there's been I could promise you
56:25 absolutely no progress of any kind in
56:28 that area for any mortal man on this
56:30 planet whether they be in deep
56:32 government bla bla bla it hasn't
56:36 happened right for those of you like
56:38 UFOs and want to say the aliens always
56:40 have this technology if they had that
56:42 technology you wouldn't see them to
56:44 visit us we wouldn't need to because
56:48 they just send some AI machine they come
56:52 take a look at us right but we've got
56:54 drones right putting a consciousness
56:57 into a computer just to kind of give you
56:59 a quick analogy would be essentially
57:01 like trying to create a weather
57:02 prediction system if you read the book
57:04 chaos you'll hear this theory pulled out
57:07 quite a bit be like trying to create a
57:09 weather system by saying well if we just
57:11 knew the trajectory and position of
57:13 every atom that contributes to the
57:16 overall weather conditions of Earth
57:18 which really includes every celestial
57:20 body in the universe we could put that
57:23 into a simulation and calculate where
57:26 every particle will be in its next state
57:29 then we'll be able to predict all the
57:31 weather that will ever exist ever and of
57:34 course it comes back as the paradoxical
57:37 reality and result of the equation you
57:40 will never ever know where all the atoms
57:42 are all the ether o particles are in the
57:44 universe and therefore this will never
57:46 occur it is artificial intelligence and
57:50 this consciousness into a computer thing
57:52 is really a bit like a character in a
57:57 book trying to write themselves out of
57:58 the book while they're in the book you
58:02 know it can't happen right you can't buy
58:04 a Stephen King novel and halfway through
58:06 the novel the character the gunslinger
58:09 just pops out in your in your bedroom
58:11 it's never gonna happen that's all I got
58:15 Richi amazing stick even those little
58:19 windy out here it burned beautifully it
58:22 tasted beautiful so appreciate it if you
58:25 haven't been a deep thoughts video comm
58:26 please go there's video and audio
58:28 depending on what your style of
58:30 listening and viewing is like there's a
58:33 locked Facebook group please come on
58:34 over you'll have to request to be in the
58:37 group and then I'll get to you usually
58:39 within a couple hours to get you in the
58:40 system there's patreon for those of you
58:44 who want to contribute on a monthly
58:45 basis for all of those of you who do
58:47 whoa got that through really appreciate
58:51 it but in the meantime take care of
58:53 yourself and someone else and I will see
58:55 you in the next deep thoughts over
58:57 [Music]
