00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts on this sort of sketchy
00:35 sunny day you're saying it's a lot
00:38 warmer than it feels out here at least
00:41 it's nice how to get you know to take
00:43 advantage of these global warming days
00:44 when you can so dinasaurs let's talk
00:50 about dinosaurs so dinosaurs is kind of
00:55 like talking about Jesus Christ when you
00:59 have had it pounded into your soul for
01:01 so long and all of your relatives and
01:04 friends and family believe it's real how
01:07 dare you ever have the thought that it
01:10 couldn't be well that it could be a big
01:13 line it's a it has an ulterior motive
01:17 but that indeed is probably what has
01:20 occurred you see dinosaurs there's a
01:24 bunch of ways to go about looking at
01:26 this ok but the easiest way that you can
01:30 look at this as before you have anyone
01:32 try to prove to you that they may not
01:35 have existed by current day you know
01:40 museums and techniques that
01:42 paleontologists are having problems with
01:44 trying to find the real bones trying to
01:45 be able to see the real bones that lock
01:47 behind these vault doors and all this
01:50 other stuff before 1842 when the Royal
01:56 Society in England had prophesized that
02:01 these things exist because they were
02:05 evolutionists and they needed some more
02:08 ironclad evidence to destroy God to
02:10 destroy you know any any theory of
02:16 creation that was outside of their
02:18 paradigm and hey I'm not a necessarily a
02:21 creationist I'm not sure what I am you
02:24 know I mean I'm I see some some logic in
02:27 potentially evolution and I see a whole
02:31 bunch of logic in creationism slash
02:34 alien engineering
02:37 again could be a poof you exist could be
02:40 a we're gonna let these guys go first
02:42 and they're gonna hybrid this stuff
02:44 together and we got kind of a Prometheus
02:45 thing so you know I'm kind of still out
02:49 on the jury but I will tell you this man
02:55 has excavated into the ground since man
02:58 could excavate into the ground we have
03:01 built pyramids on every continent on
03:04 this planet we have excavated billions
03:11 of metric tons of soil from this
03:15 planet's surface and up until these
03:20 evolutionists these Darwinist McDormand
03:23 was a [ __ ] hack to begin with and
03:25 because he stole his material from de la
03:28 Marck didn't have the IQ to completely
03:29 understand de la Marck
03:31 and so he chops it down to something we
03:33 all understood which is survival of the
03:35 fittest
03:35 I mean seriously do you consider
03:37 yourself a genius of figuring out what
03:39 every human being on the surface of the
03:41 planet understood whether they be three
03:44 years old or three hundred years old
03:47 they knew that survival of the fittest
03:48 is the way it works because someone
03:50 bigger than them took something away
03:51 once that's it
03:53 so does a big kid comes out he goes mine
03:55 and then you know I want this buck you
03:57 you know the survival the fittest the
03:59 way it works because until you get
04:01 bigger than that kid you're not gonna be
04:02 able to get that thing back so Darwin is
04:05 a genius well hummingbirds are going
04:09 nuts that clicking noise that's what
04:11 hummingbirds are but in all of this
04:14 earth moving we never found a dinosaur
04:16 bone and I mean ever found anything like
04:20 a dinosaur bone oh we found bones and we
04:25 worshipped those bones because you
04:27 remember that you know your average
04:31 tribe in anywhere even if you want to
04:36 thank your superior cuz you're white
04:37 we had bone necklaces around us and all
04:40 kinds of stuff this was standard
04:43 you know divide it well sign even divide
04:46 it's just standard conquering conquest
04:50 paraphernalia if you killed a big black
04:53 bear up in Russia well then you deserve
04:56 a little alkylating if you can pull its
04:59 teeth out pull its claws out cut its
05:01 hands off cut its head off
05:03 save the fur and put it above your
05:06 throne and your tribe Oh people are
05:09 gonna go what's that you know and the
05:10 guy he killed that thing oh my god I'm
05:13 not messing with that guy so glad he's
05:15 in charge of the tribe but in 1842 the
05:18 Royal Society theorized this maybe we
05:21 had an old you know just imagine the
05:25 imagination these [ __ ] guys no proof
05:29 at all no proof at all they came up with
05:32 this fictitious theory of a mammoth
05:36 large beast prehistoric creature I mean
05:45 that's just bizarre right that would be
05:47 like me saying yeah you know I'm just
05:50 thinking about maybe there's some great
05:51 aliens
05:51 probably where some gray aliens and then
05:54 all of a sudden I find these four-foot
05:56 tall grey aliens with big almond eye
05:58 dudes and I find them 12 years after I
06:01 write a paper that they probably exist
06:04 and the guy that finds them is a buddy
06:06 of mine or a student of mine or the same
06:09 type of scholar as I am and so we're
06:12 both evolutionists we're both Darwinists
06:16 we want to have our new theory which is
06:18 a business become popular so we can
06:22 charge money we can transform or
06:24 transform the consciousness of man now
06:27 one of the big precursors before we get
06:30 into this is that you know this is to
06:33 get rid of the belief in God yeah
06:36 probably is an evolutionist you know
06:39 it's it's one of these things where they
06:41 want to have more juice than God right
06:43 and so their whole thing is how do we
06:47 turn off God and turn on us it doesn't
06:51 really mean that God doesn't exist or
06:53 that they even believe that but they
06:55 just want to they want to have more
06:58 juice they want to turn it into a
06:59 business now what I don't understand is
07:02 that
07:03 this is gonna be a little digression
07:05 based on this because we're not gonna
07:07 cover or insinuate this any further than
07:09 this this little statement here but the
07:12 Jesuits keep getting pulled into all
07:14 this fighters stuff and the Jesuits are
07:18 always trying to get you to not believe
07:20 in God and to believe in man like as the
07:23 only thing that exists and you know on
07:28 one level what if what if you know they
07:30 understand that the story of Christ is
07:32 completely fictitious that all these you
07:35 know virgin birth gods are all copycats
07:38 of each other and that there really is
07:39 no there really has been no divine
07:43 intervention in a way that has been
07:45 blinked and like a cartoon where God's
07:47 down there and not you know there's Adam
07:50 and Eve they understand that never
07:51 happened and so maybe their whole thing
07:53 is to say we need to progress by getting
07:58 rid of these folklore stories and start
08:04 believing in ourselves because we are
08:06 truly responsible for ourselves and the
08:09 idea was you know hey you want to know
08:10 why your government sucks because you're
08:12 you're believing in this magic person in
08:14 the sky and I'm not saying God but like
08:16 Jesus and whomever Allah
08:19 you know Buddha all these other things
08:21 instead of paying attention what's going
08:23 here on earth so while you're messing
08:25 around
08:25 of course the evil forces the secular
08:29 evil forces can take over and destroy
08:30 this planet because you're not even
08:32 paying attention you're dreaming about
08:34 heaven you're dreaming about being you
08:36 know as soon as you die everything's
08:38 gonna be fine instead of worrying about
08:39 the planet so maybe that's their tactic
08:42 who knows so back to our dinosaur story
08:45 so it's 1842 this theory is put forth
08:50 that a giant race of creatures could
08:54 have existed in the past I mean again
08:56 it's like a comic book it's just out of
08:58 thin air but this thing incubates for 12
09:02 years until this dude who's part of the
09:07 same group okay the he's in a river in
09:12 upstate new obscene Missouri and he
09:15 finds a tooth
09:17 all right it's a pretty big tooth he
09:21 finds a tooth and what does he do he
09:24 craps an entire dinosaur around this
09:27 tooth I mean when you saw well so this
09:31 way for any of the very interview that
09:33 have seen the Star Trek episodes in the
09:38 90s
09:39 perhaps this happened in the the
09:42 enterprise which is 2001 or 2005 but
09:46 there have been various stages and
09:47 various stories inside Star Trek where
09:50 they'll have a tiny piece of DNA and
09:52 they take it to the to the holodeck and
09:55 they have this amazing computer that is
09:59 a billion trillion quadrillion times
10:01 more powerful than any computer we have
10:03 here on earth in 2019 and it understands
10:08 all the protein pattern folding causes
10:10 and effect to the new nucleic acids of
10:13 DNA RNA and it constructs up for the
10:17 creature from a tiny tissue sample you
10:19 can know what it looks like they only
10:21 did this really one time apparently in
10:24 the 1800s this technology was also in
10:27 existence but it just happened to be in
10:28 the head of some fraudsters the next
10:32 thing they found was a big giant femur
10:34 bone probably a woolly mammoth bone if
10:39 it even was real and these bones well
10:44 they go on display back in the old days
10:46 but today according to the
10:51 paleontologists that are trying to see
10:53 these things they are told that all of
10:56 these bones are behind big locked vaults
11:00 and they don't have permission to see
11:03 them yet but some of these guys have
11:06 been the business for like 35 years and
11:07 they're like how many years do I have to
11:09 be in this business before I become the
11:10 elite privileged to see the real bones I
11:13 mean I don't even need to touch him I
11:14 just need to see him mm-hmm but there's
11:19 this era for I've heard it in two
11:22 different years recently i reluctance
11:28 from 1870 to 1890
11:30 a 10-year period between Edward cope and
11:35 think it's like a Reginald Marsh mr.
11:38 Marsh mr. cope going after it so these
11:43 guys one of them discovers like 80
11:46 different dinosaurs the other one
11:47 discovers 56 different dinosaurs but
11:51 even modern-day paleontologists will say
11:53 well that's a real shame
11:55 those two guys got involved with
11:59 fraudulent deceptive tactics because out
12:05 of you know what is that that's a
12:07 hundred and thirty six different
12:08 dinosaurs between the two of them that
12:10 they supposedly discovered I mean these
12:12 are the inception
12:14 paleontologists that launched this this
12:17 is very much like the Catholic Church
12:19 formally being Roman senators all of a
12:23 sudden every senator becomes a pope then
12:25 as they die off they become Saints until
12:27 we only have one pope and then of course
12:29 this doesn't even start till 350 AD but
12:35 then this you know Inquisition comes
12:37 around they pounded into everyone's soul
12:38 this is true this is true right you got
12:41 any like a dagger pointing at your
12:42 throat
12:43 of course it's totally true sir don't
12:45 kill me my kid great now we have a bunch
12:48 of denominations of the Catholic Church
12:51 and of course those are real and this is
12:52 fake and just gets crazy so paleontology
12:56 turned it out you know started off being
12:58 a completely fraudulent sector of
13:01 science based on a theory that incubated
13:05 for 12 years with lots of hype and all
13:08 the newspapers and publications all the
13:12 sudden boom they start fighting
13:14 dinosaurs of course they find a tooth
13:16 they make a dinosaur whatever they find
13:18 a femur bone and make a dinosaur out of
13:19 it then what's absolutely amazing is
13:22 those little dinosaurs big dinosaurs
13:26 they're still in the history books as
13:28 having looked just like that let's
13:31 imagine you've never seen a human being
13:32 before and you find a tooth somewhere
13:35 sitting around and someone theorizes
13:37 that we existed of course we actually
13:39 did exist so this is not a very good
13:41 analogy but then they make a human being
13:44 and then they actually find a human
13:46 being several hundred years later and it
13:48 happens to be exactly like the 99.9%
13:50 complete fabrication that they made a
13:53 hundred years earlier
13:55 welcome to paleontology but out of the
13:59 hundred and thirty six that these two
14:00 guys supposedly came up with cope and
14:03 Marsh only 32 and modern-day history are
14:10 given the certification of being real
14:14 probably none of them are real but now
14:18 wait a minute
14:19 you have grown up your whole life
14:21 watching television shows movies you've
14:24 read books you've seen bones in the
14:28 museum's you've seen daily reports of
14:32 finding new dinosaurs and my god you've
14:34 seen photographs of the paleontologists
14:36 digging these things out of the ground I
14:38 mean you've seen it you've seen you know
14:41 dinosaur eggs and you've seen all this
14:43 other stuff you might be surprised to
14:47 know that up until 2019 this year we
14:53 don't have any recorded discovery of a
14:58 dinosaur by an average human being that
15:00 was minding their own business just
15:01 walking by tripped over something looked
15:04 back and it was the spine of a dinosaur
15:08 the closest thing they have to average
15:11 pedestrian finding a dinosaur is a
15:13 professional paleontologist or someone
15:17 related to the business someone who can
15:19 make a profit from it going up to a
15:21 pedestrian like a farmer typically and
15:23 saying I bet if you dig here you'll find
15:26 a dinosaur and won't you wouldn't you
15:29 know it pal they dig there and they find
15:32 a dinosaur hmm the Dead Sea scrolls were
15:37 found by what a fourteen-year-old kid
15:41 now I think those are probably bunk but
15:44 whatever they existed kid found it I
15:48 believe it was a woman riding a donkey
15:50 in Egypt who had the donkey leg fall
15:54 through this hole when they looked down
15:57 inside
15:58 the hole they found the first of many
16:00 caverns underneath the soil were
16:03 literally tens of thousands of Romans
16:07 were buried according to Egyptian ritual
16:10 inside tombs in Egypt actually saw a few
16:15 of these when I went to the London
16:16 Museum back in 2001 I know 2,000 excuse
16:20 me they just arrived I just read about
16:23 them having come out of my Egyptology
16:26 face actually I was just ending it there
16:30 they were unbelievable so mmm the idea
16:34 that someone's gonna pull a hoax with
16:36 30,000 tombs you know cat like circa
16:41 foci of some sort is highly against
16:46 right but the Romans did like the way
16:47 that the Egyptians did embalming some
16:49 makes sense well I come from Kansas
16:52 where farmers are turning the soil of
16:55 the entire state you know I mean it's
16:58 probably a good 75 80 percent of all the
17:01 topsoil in Kansas has been turned over
17:03 by a plow being pulled by an animal
17:06 initially then being turned over by a
17:09 tractor the other big hoax is that when
17:14 they do find dinosaurs there seems to be
17:17 this weird strategic location and then
17:20 they will find thousands and thousands
17:23 of bones there's like all the dinosaurs
17:27 just got together in one place and all
17:29 decided to die hmm but again
17:32 paleontologists are usually the ones
17:34 that find this and keep in mind this is
17:37 big business
17:38 you've got museums that need to have
17:41 attractions you've got magazines that
17:43 need to have articles that draw eyeballs
17:46 now there are several hundred claims of
17:51 finding individual dinosaur bodies but
17:54 it up until 2019 we haven't remotely
17:57 ever found a complete dinosaur skeleton
18:00 it's always some partial skeleton
18:03 ethically speaking technically speaking
18:06 you're supposed to have a license to dig
18:09 up a dinosaur
18:11 isn't that funny if you need a license
18:14 then that creates a tracking device so
18:16 if you want to start digging up
18:18 dinosaurs you go get your license and
18:20 now you're on a registry well if you're
18:22 not part of some paleontology Society
18:24 quite frankly you may not get the
18:25 license but if you do at least they're
18:27 gonna start asking you just like when
18:29 you use an electron microscope you have
18:31 to register everything you're looking
18:32 for an electron microscope so the
18:34 government can keep tabs on how much
18:36 you're discovering about how the world
18:37 actually works to give you an idea how
18:41 lucrative this businesses I think there
18:44 was a trend source rex parts and pieces
18:49 that someone had sculpted together of
18:51 course and of course they're trying to
18:52 say that they're selling the original
18:53 bones but you never see the original
18:55 bones so how do you know one of them
18:57 sold to a museum for twelve million
19:00 dollars that's a lot of money folks but
19:05 okay so you've been to a history museum
19:07 or Natural History Museum and you've
19:11 seen dinosaurs all over these museums so
19:14 what am I talking about they don't exist
19:16 you've seen them with your own eyes hmm
19:20 well one you don't always see fold
19:26 you know dinosaurs but most the time
19:29 they are full dinosaurs right from the
19:31 tailbone all the way up to the the legs
19:35 the rib cages up to the head
19:36 they're almost always complete there's
19:38 more complete dinosaurs and any one of
19:41 these Natural History Museum's
19:42 but we've never found a complete
19:45 skeleton hmm in fact there's been claims
19:51 they never really found a skull of
19:53 anything now since Eric Dubay dropped
19:57 his video about five years ago talking
19:59 about this maybe it wasn't quite five
20:02 years ago but this theories been out
20:04 there for a while then all of a sudden
20:05 they said they found skulls I think
20:08 that's interesting so for nearly 150
20:11 years no skulls and all sudden someone
20:13 questions paleontology and it's like all
20:16 right we need to get these skulls out
20:17 there okay so I guess about 170 years
20:19 since they said they found the first
20:21 tooth right so what are you seeing in
20:24 the museum's
20:25 well let's say that you're a privileged
20:28 kid you're rich and you've been to every
20:31 natural museum Natural History Museum in
20:35 the world you have walked through every
20:38 single museum that is shown a dinosaur
20:40 on some you know steel structure I will
20:46 tell you that even if you've been to all
20:48 of them you've never seen a real
20:49 dinosaur bone in your life because every
20:51 single thing that you've ever seen is a
20:53 plastic plaster conglomeration of all
21:00 kinds of different things to form what
21:02 they say officially is a facsimile of
21:07 the real bone so the real bone is
21:08 somewhere in a vault and they have done
21:11 a plaster technique and they've cast
21:15 these things that you see that way if
21:17 someone comes in with the baseball bat
21:19 you know any problems right you might be
21:22 shocked to find out that it you know
21:24 they've had dinosaurs around forever
21:27 like the brontosaurus and they realized
21:31 they had the they said that they had the
21:33 wrong head on the wrong dinosaur for
21:35 like a hundred some years hilarious so
21:39 you've never seen one so the whole thing
21:41 is the fabrication to begin with it's
21:44 kind of like going to Museum of Charles
21:46 Dickens and you start seeing all of his
21:47 fictional characters everywhere in wax
21:50 and thinking that you're actually there
21:53 and you've actually seen proof that
21:54 Charles Dickens stories were actually
21:55 real because there was a facsimile in
21:58 front of you to prove that it was real
22:01 hmm now just a you know recap here as
22:07 quickly as these paleontologists and
22:11 people with the dig up dinosaur license
22:13 find dinosaurs man would have found tens
22:22 of thousands of these things throughout
22:24 time and I know what someone's thinking
22:28 they're thinking well man may have
22:32 discovered these things this simply
22:34 couldn't recognize what they were
22:37 right let's sound let's do some quick
22:41 math here how many of you go out and
22:45 kill a wild animal
22:47 Lynch it up onto a tree which is where
22:51 the word was invented cut it from its
22:55 crotch all the way to its neck got out
22:58 the bag and then slowly slice off all of
23:02 the skin because we're gonna keep the
23:03 fur we're gonna keep everything and
23:05 we're gonna eat it or turn it into some
23:07 utility how many of us do that every
23:10 single day so that we can eat meat
23:12 I'm gonna guess very few of you maybe if
23:15 some of you are Ted Nugent that's I know
23:18 some of you guys hunt hats off to you
23:20 dudes and dudettes but most people on
23:24 earth have no clue what the inside of an
23:27 animal looks like and especially do not
23:30 have unless they're artists who are
23:32 studying this for the sake of
23:33 replication you don't know what a femur
23:36 bone looks like a tooth skull if you saw
23:39 a skull in the desert you may not know
23:41 whether or not it's a a bison a cow or a
23:47 boar but back in the day they absolutely
23:52 knew what everything was because they
23:55 were constantly tearing apart an animal
23:58 to eat it and use it how many of you
24:00 have heard the stories of the Native
24:01 Americans and how they absolutely used
24:04 every single piece of a buffalo bison
24:08 everything the teeth were cut out to be
24:11 ornamental the furs were definitely used
24:16 they turned the beef either into media
24:18 food or beef jerky they had contests
24:21 where they would eat the intestines
24:23 stringing them all the way out and two
24:25 dudes on one side you know ones on lion
24:28 a ones on line B and they'd eat this
24:30 intestine and run and whoever could eat
24:32 the most intestine would win the contest
24:34 you should grow up in the Midwest you'll
24:37 find out these things when you're grew
24:38 up in the big city they make you feel
24:39 like everybody's a [ __ ] [ __ ] not the
24:43 case so we should have been discovering
24:46 these things when we dig out enough Rock
24:48 to build the pyramids
24:50 you know the couple hundred that exists
24:53 in Egypt alone just because three in the
24:56 in the Giza Plateau are really popular
25:00 doesn't mean those are the only ones
25:02 that are made there are dozens and
25:04 dozens of bent pyramids dozens of
25:06 pyramids that are as big as mountains
25:08 but they've cannibalized them for other
25:10 resources the pyramids in Mexico alone
25:14 in South America are monstrously
25:17 gigantic they're mountains but they're
25:19 man-made yeah they might have like a
25:21 dirt core but they were geometric we
25:25 have pyramids in China pyramids in South
25:27 Africa pyramids in Turkey they're all
25:30 over the place we would have discovered
25:34 gigantic bones and they would have been
25:36 on display and they probably just like
25:39 World of Warcraft would have been used
25:40 to build huts right got a big giant
25:42 femur bone the size of this pole over
25:44 here well instead of putting the pole I
25:46 put the femur bone there and I bring in
25:48 the other rival chieftain and I'd say
25:51 look at this place we killed these
25:53 animals and now we're using their bones
25:56 to build our hut you're gonna mess with
25:58 me you you you don't even compare to
26:01 these femur bones imagine how big this
26:04 creature would I tell a big story about
26:05 how big it was
26:06 I'd have teeth around my neck this big
26:08 you know six-inch teeth but down
26:12 are these all fake or everything that
26:15 they're claiming to have found complete
26:19 fakes well it's pretty hard to fake a
26:22 tooth probably it's a very specific
26:25 thing it's not going to be like an
26:27 arrowhead he came off of a rock
26:28 necessarily a big giant femur bone but
26:33 we have creatures like woolly mammoths
26:35 we're pretty sure they were just big
26:36 elephants right so some of these things
26:39 could be real as long as they're close
26:41 to the evolutionary history that we see
26:43 today an evolution you know you can take
26:47 it with a grain of salt I'm not talking
26:49 about evolution back to us supposedly
26:51 climbing out of trees as monkeys or some
26:54 fish that gains legs and becomes land
26:57 bound and then turns into a giraffe
26:58 right I'm not talking about that I'm
27:01 just talking about species in general
27:03 you can look again at the mantis insect
27:06 and find out that there are you know God
27:08 was having a blast creating these little
27:10 Lamborghini insects you know but you
27:14 could find a bunch of bones in various
27:18 states and then choose to to take you
27:23 know a sigh bird saber-toothed tiger
27:25 claw or a big giant bear claw because
27:28 there are big giant bears we just don't
27:30 always find them right but if a bear has
27:31 been out there for 60 years and gets
27:33 absolutely massive and then he dies and
27:35 his bones are there you take the claw
27:37 off that one the bone off this one that
27:39 one and you could literally hodgepodge
27:41 together a monster Hollywood's been
27:44 doing it for years and if you've seen
27:47 John Carpenter's The Thing I think they
27:52 use 32 cows to create the various
27:55 incarnations of the alien then you know
27:58 I won't ruin the movie for you but
28:00 there's an animal that turns into this
28:02 being and then they just keep using cow
28:04 parts and cow parts and burning them to
28:06 give them this certain look
28:08 it's utterly brilliant but you know
28:11 that's fake now if you pay attention to
28:14 the acceleration or the the velocity of
28:20 discovery from paleontology once this
28:23 18:42 theory was hit in the paper and
28:26 the funny thing is I know the son of one
28:30 of the most famous Royal Society
28:33 paleontologists on planet earth I think
28:38 the dude was even knighted at one point
28:39 his father but it seemed like there was
28:43 an amazing haste to get this theory out
28:47 there to crush anything that was
28:51 creationism to crush the paradigm of a
28:53 Supreme Being creating things we're
28:56 having any participation whatsoever
28:58 everything had to be knocked down to a
29:01 level where it was just incidental again
29:04 this is kind of something from nothing
29:05 theory if you start back at the Big Bang
29:09 now for those of you who are religious
29:11 they do get into this notion that you
29:13 know
29:16 if dinosaurs came before man then man is
29:18 essentially an afterthought of dinosaurs
29:22 a guy went first what dinosaurs got
29:24 tired and then obviously sent a meteor
29:26 down poof which is probably not a meteor
29:29 it's probably a gigantic volcanic
29:31 explosion and then we have this
29:34 extinction of it you hear it all the
29:35 time it's it's there for you to repeat
29:38 so that you feel extremely smart just
29:41 like the ludicrous Big Bang Theory which
29:43 relies on a theory of gravity which in
29:45 wikipedia to this day is considered a
29:47 phenomenon you don't get the Big Bang or
29:50 black holes if you go with the
29:52 traditional theory of gravity which is a
29:54 particle attracts another particle by
29:57 exchanging information that exchange of
29:59 information never occurs which is why
30:01 they've never been able to prove it
30:03 which is why the theory is still a
30:04 phenomenon switch back to II throw
30:06 theories of gravity kaboom everything
30:08 makes sense therefore can't have black
30:10 holes and you most certainly can't
30:12 create a singularity now if you think
30:15 still I'm crazy and I'm being ludicrous
30:18 with this whole thing you might find it
30:19 interesting that there are two companies
30:21 on planet earth one in China one in
30:23 Canada that make dinosaur bones they
30:28 take a bunch of bones from a bunch of
30:30 random creatures and melt it down put a
30:32 bunch of adhesives into it and then you
30:34 could pour it into molds and if you do
30:37 samples of it it's a bone but if you do
30:41 genetic tests on it you're gonna find
30:42 out it's not a dinosaur it's a chicken
30:45 bone on one little particle it's a
30:46 turkey bone another one it's a it's a
30:49 cow on another particle but what is
30:53 fossilisation how does that whole thing
30:55 occur well this gets into the ability to
31:00 say it's organic and this gets into the
31:02 ability to date its existence the way
31:07 this is works in the petrified forest
31:10 when you see petrified trees because
31:12 that's true fossilization it is a very
31:15 very specific situation that occurs
31:18 where you have some still water that is
31:21 undisturbed for the most part for a very
31:24 long time how
31:26 who knows but as a particular infant
31:30 essa Mille organic molecule begins to
31:33 disintegrate in this water
31:36 our little sedimentary rocks which can
31:41 go in and there at the exact same scale
31:43 that go in and they replace that organic
31:46 component because rock over a long
31:50 period of time will definitely bind with
31:51 other rock you start to replace organic
31:54 matter with rock again the Petrified
31:57 Forest is the only place I know where we
31:59 can say this absolutely occurs I do have
32:02 fossils in my house of trilobites and
32:05 other things that seem very plausible
32:07 because we still have those beings in a
32:10 different name on earth so there's a
32:15 technique called the radiometric effect
32:17 where they are supposedly dating these
32:20 bones / rocks okay and figuring out how
32:25 old everything is and so they'll tell
32:26 you straight out oh this one's 100
32:28 million years old this is 400 million
32:30 years old blah blah blah which you might
32:33 be surprised to find out is that they're
32:35 not actually using the radiometric
32:37 effect on the actual found bones but and
32:40 typically neighboring rocks in the area
32:44 well the radiometric effect of dating
32:50 things sysm almost been completely
32:51 dismissed as a valid methodology of
32:54 figuring how old something is one of the
32:57 paleontologists said I couldn't tell the
32:59 difference between a dinosaur egg and a
33:01 rock and the real reason was because
33:04 they were submitting rocks as dinosaur
33:07 eggs and then hilarious so any type of
33:10 attempt to date these bones is pure
33:16 guesswork any attempt to try and take a
33:19 bone from one location and match it with
33:21 the bone of another location that's also
33:24 guesswork but there's another element to
33:28 this that you can just use without
33:31 knowing any of this advanced post 1842
33:35 theory / discovery and that has to do
33:39 with the physic
33:39 of these dinosaurs haven't you ever
33:42 thought it looked really strange for a
33:44 Tyrannosaurus Rex which has a pair of
33:50 pretty strong legs has no front arms
33:52 really small hands but its gut sac and
33:57 most of its its spinal cord plus its
34:00 massive skull which is going to have
34:03 tremendous amounts of fluid remember I
34:05 think the the human skull is like like
34:09 1/7 the weight of your body or something
34:11 like that I probably have that wrong but
34:12 it's a it's a significant portion of
34:14 your overall weight as a human being and
34:16 it's because it has a lot of dense bone
34:17 in it a dense matter and it also has
34:20 water lots of water ok our chest cavity
34:23 is doing pretty good but it has two big
34:25 lungs in it which have air in it so if
34:28 you're to make a trance or X do what
34:31 it's supposed to do it would have to
34:33 have a counterbalancing tail behind it
34:36 to offset its weight it doesn't work out
34:41 some of these theorized gigantic
34:44 brontosauruses and other giant creatures
34:47 technically speaking they would weigh so
34:49 much that even if you were to make the
34:52 bone out of bone material they would
34:56 crush their own legs because they would
34:58 weigh too much consequently they would
35:01 probably move extremely slow even the
35:04 Tyrannosaurus Rex would move super slow
35:06 because once you start moving that kind
35:08 of mass and crunching it and crunching
35:11 it and crunching it they'd probably
35:14 break their own bones however if you
35:16 believe in expanding earth Neal Adams
35:19 does present the theory that if we do
35:23 reverse the world's history and get rid
35:25 of all the oceans and make all the
35:26 continents connect on all sides which is
35:28 what happens you would have an earth
35:30 about 1/4 of gravity and therefore maybe
35:33 that issue I'm mentioning isn't a big
35:35 deal but you're also talking about
35:38 a earth that doesn't have a lot of lush
35:43 foliage everywhere so the idea that
35:47 these beings would have enough food to
35:48 survive is the next big problem
35:52 the amount of food that any one of the
35:55 theorized dinosaurs would have to eat
35:58 would be so massive that especially with
36:01 their small heads take a brontosaurus
36:02 right the old Monty Python skit about
36:05 the brontosaurus it's thin at one end
36:08 much bigger in the middle and then at
36:10 the other end that is my theory ok so
36:15 you have this you have this gut sack of
36:17 a brontosaurus that is unquestionably
36:21 about the size of a normal house in
36:24 America probably a thousand square feet
36:27 minimum but what do you have you have
36:30 this little tiny neck that goes way way
36:33 way out okay and has a little tiny bird
36:36 skull at the end because they used to
36:38 use bird skulls as the template when the
36:41 artists would carve a fake skull for a
36:45 hundred and fifty years if not 170 years
36:48 to give the thing a head and so they
36:51 just make it up they put horns on them
36:53 and all kinds of wild you know jesus
36:56 lizard looking things all in bone form
37:01 your Triceratops with this little tiny
37:05 mouth is gonna have to eat metric tons
37:10 of food every single day to feed that
37:12 big giant house that is the rest of the
37:14 body it would be ate an utter 24-hour
37:18 marathon for a brontosaurus to eat
37:21 enough mass to stay alive and it's a
37:23 vegetarian because it doesn't have the
37:27 jowls and the and the pointy teeth to
37:30 become anything other than a vegetarian
37:33 based on this bird skull that they use
37:35 of course it's all made up in the first
37:37 place right so that's an impossibility
37:41 you know we know on earth that if you
37:44 let loose a whole you know I don't even
37:48 know what they call it like a herd of
37:49 sheep or goats or cattle they will
37:54 literally eat everything off your land
37:58 and you got to rotate them and you
37:59 better have the right amount of acreage
38:01 that is ready to be consumed for a
38:04 particular size of
38:05 heard otherwise they're gonna eat all
38:09 the food and then starve to death
38:10 because they won't have enough to rotate
38:12 so the world supposedly so saturated
38:15 with Dinosaurs that again on one
38:17 particular site you will have someone
38:19 claiming to find two thousand to six
38:21 thousand distinct dinosaur bones from
38:24 different dinosaurs not just one it's
38:25 been blown apart right but what are the
38:30 odds that you find these perfect areas
38:32 where you find partial skeletons never a
38:37 full skeleton now they've been getting a
38:40 little bit better because I think that
38:41 they're starting to pardon the pun
38:44 collapse under the pressure of their own
38:46 [ __ ] so that you know you will see
38:48 some pretty impressive
38:49 you know skeletons where you see the
38:52 vertebrae that goes on for you know
38:53 twelve feet and these guys are digging
38:55 it out some of you will be very familiar
38:58 with the notion that they say that birds
38:59 are the descendants of dinosaurs and
39:02 then coincidentally within a few square
39:06 miles of the company in China that makes
39:08 these dinosaur bones for a living and
39:11 brags about the fact that they are in
39:13 you know 60 different countries they've
39:15 made tens of thousands of these bones to
39:19 be discovered they'll literally come to
39:21 your land and push one into a
39:23 mountainside and then cover it up
39:25 and then you can go out as
39:28 paleontologists and discover it and then
39:30 dig it out it's all artificial
39:32 that's aboveboard but it was right
39:36 around this company in China that they
39:42 found supposedly dinosaurs with feathers
39:44 and it went all over the press right it
39:48 was again magazines sold specials went
39:51 on TV and because 3d rendering software
39:53 gets so amazing the dinosaurs inside of
39:57 our fictional computers are so realistic
40:00 and convincing that if you see it on TV
40:05 people think it's actually real that's
40:09 how this whole thing has forged itself
40:11 and boy if you're willing to believe one
40:14 giant hoax can't you believe in other
40:16 hoax
40:17 and the very very interesting thing is
40:20 that we have religions that have less
40:22 evidence than dinosaurs and they're
40:25 believed to so they build up your brain
40:28 to be able to accept things that you
40:30 want to be true even though they have no
40:32 truth at all no evidence at all I mean
40:34 zero evidence for religion right but all
40:38 of a sudden they push a few bones
40:40 together they don't belong together and
40:43 you don't only believe in dinosaurs but
40:47 you believe in the scientific theory
40:48 that would have made them in the first
40:50 place which is evolution now let's say
40:53 evolution really is the way it worked
40:56 making up dinosaurs to somehow further
41:01 your agenda of this Darwinism evolution
41:03 and then later getting caught in the
41:07 21st century of having forged all these
41:10 creatures together and you never show
41:12 the bones and they're all plastic and
41:14 you've synthesized 80% of the structure
41:17 of any one of these creatures then you
41:18 push them into television and books like
41:20 Danny and the dinosaur and I was a kid
41:23 but you get caught and now you're
41:25 setting back your movement who knows 500
41:30 years a thousand years until some other
41:31 piece of true evidence comes around
41:33 where we can say oh now we figure out
41:34 how that works I mean if we could ever
41:37 get that Star Trek computer to really be
41:39 able to predict how protein patterns
41:41 tell double helixes how to create
41:43 themselves I forget every that
41:46 cause-and-effect thing then we could
41:47 actually prove it in a computer we're
41:49 not there yet unfortunately maybe
41:51 quantum computing can help us out with
41:52 that
41:53 but the feathered dinosaurs were heavily
41:57 dismissed once the evidence was really
42:00 examined so hats off to some of these
42:03 paleontologists for actually coming out
42:05 and saying you know I went into this and
42:08 I dropped out either before they
42:11 graduated because as they took all of
42:14 what they were taught and brought it
42:15 into the laboratory and tried to prove
42:17 it or they tried to get access to these
42:19 bones and were told they're behind
42:20 vaults they had the guts to not ruin
42:25 their lives in this fake career which
42:27 the park could have made a lot of money
42:28 but they have integrity and they pull
42:30 out
42:31 paleontologists again that had been the
42:33 business for over 30 years being denied
42:36 access to these bones behind these
42:38 special vaults they pull out but because
42:43 we now know how the Chinese have
42:46 brilliantly done this and I guess the
42:47 Canadians did the same thing but melting
42:50 down bones it doesn't make any sense
42:53 because fossilized bones should be
42:54 technically rock but if you did see
42:59 something on the internet that look like
43:00 a big giant bone I mean any shape you
43:03 can imagine they just build a mold pour
43:05 this junk in there close the mold you
43:08 got a fake bone they even talked about
43:12 in the Chinese company that they'll put
43:15 your artificial fractures in the bones
43:17 they'll do all kinds of stuff to make
43:21 the bone look real but it's fake 100%
43:25 fake in 1999 National Geographic this
43:30 will blow your mind National Geographic
43:31 announced the archaeal believe I'm
43:36 saying that correctly Raptor hmm what
43:40 did that get popular oh the Raptor
43:42 became popular in 1993 when Steven
43:46 Spielberg made the Raptor the central
43:49 character of his movie Jurassic Park
43:52 which is based on a Michael Crichton
43:53 novel he also pissed off paleontologists
43:58 by making a brontosaurus stand up on its
44:00 hind legs in the first shot and then do
44:04 this you know leap forward because by
44:08 1993 paleontologists have been saying
44:10 look you can't have a brontosaurus lift
44:14 its head because it doesn't have enough
44:16 blood pressure to push blood all the way
44:19 up that giant neck and keep its
44:21 consciousness so it always has to be
44:23 below the heart that's in that Center
44:25 House of the middle of his body so I
44:27 thought that was interesting at least
44:28 they're starting to look at the physics
44:30 a little bit better but that has to stop
44:33 as quickly as possible but they took
44:36 some of this archaeal and put it under a
44:39 CT scanner and figured out it was BS
44:43 and then they had to come out and say
44:46 that they had lied but they had invented
44:50 a fake dinosaur hmm how many people ever
44:55 get a chance to read the retraction in a
44:57 newspaper or a retraction in a magazine
45:00 I mean jeez Wednesday I mean if if a
45:03 television let's say the History Channel
45:06 or discovery does some special on a RKO
45:10 Raptor and they publicize this whole
45:13 thing the only thing that they will do
45:15 is not run that special again because
45:17 the creature has been proved to be a
45:19 fake but they'll never go back and run
45:20 it special to say sorry we fed your kids
45:23 a bunch of crap that now they believe
45:27 but I want you to think about the money
45:29 behind this whole thing because when you
45:32 want to think about why something exists
45:34 I would say it's it's probably safe to
45:36 estimate that the Royal Society of
45:39 England or of London I'm not sure what
45:43 the last word is but when they put this
45:46 paper forward in 1842
45:48 they're trying to advance the agenda of
45:53 evolution it's a big deal it's gonna be
45:56 a big business right and and let me give
46:01 you a little algorithm here of why that
46:02 would be the case what if you had let's
46:07 see four colleges let's just say in the
46:09 modern time we've got Caltech and MIT in
46:13 America and we have Cambridge and Oxford
46:16 in England so the two of you know for
46:20 the top colleges in the world and their
46:22 science colleges now for a while there
46:26 each one of the colleges are probably
46:27 known for being more advanced in one
46:29 particular area than the other College
46:31 and for maybe 100 200 years that's the
46:35 case but here comes the internet and the
46:40 Internet is balancing knowledge so you
46:44 have the four colleges start to have as
46:49 much quantum physics as the other
46:50 college one of them has aerospace
46:54 initially as their thing and then it
46:56 starts to balance out
46:57 and all the other colleges well you're
47:00 gonna need some competitive subject
47:03 matter where your college starts to
47:06 become more powerful than another
47:07 college at least for the next game the
47:10 next hundred years or 50 years
47:12 therefore when someone's determining
47:14 what tuition they're gonna pay for from
47:17 which college can't get paleontology
47:21 from say three out of the four because
47:23 they haven't endorsed this new theory so
47:27 right at that onset you'll have colleges
47:29 that will outperform each other because
47:32 of theories that they've advanced
47:33 remember Stephen W Hawking was a
47:36 Cambridge University guy eventually
47:37 started holding the position that Isaac
47:39 Newton held at Cambridge and his whole
47:42 thing was the big bang for a very long
47:44 time they don't want anything to dismiss
47:47 the Big Bang
47:48 I mean if you listen to my show and you
47:50 study ether all Sciences you'll find out
47:53 the Big Bang absolutely positively can't
47:55 have occurred and then all of that
47:57 assertion from Cambridge becomes
48:00 fraudulent becomes almost comical you
48:04 could go into the the admission board
48:07 with all the head scientists that
48:09 believe in the Big Bang present your
48:11 case of ether Oh Sciences destroy their
48:15 theory and say so you're a college that
48:18 teaches pseudoscience that is your huge
48:22 claim to fame and you're unwilling to
48:25 acknowledge ether all winds East well
48:30 technology which provided Tesla
48:31 everything that he used to make all of
48:34 his instruments which is what's running
48:35 the world wireless technology Tesla
48:38 alternating current Tesla he was gonna
48:42 transmit again free power to everyone's
48:43 house right now let's talk about the
48:49 phenomenon of our sort of loyalties to
48:56 belief systems and it's funny because
48:59 there are tons of examples of this in
49:05 2019 where you've been taught something
49:07 your entire life and then all of a
49:10 sudden there's a group
49:11 that's now questioning the very validity
49:14 of things that have been sort of common
49:16 knowledge for a really long time
49:18 common knowledge with a little a strict
49:21 overt and the asterik down by the bottom
49:24 says we really don't have any proof of
49:25 this it's probably complete [ __ ] but
49:26 we make a ton of money off of it thank
49:28 you for listening we believe there's a
49:31 giant portion of people on earth that
49:33 believe that our Creator at one point
49:38 was so flawed in his design of the earth
49:41 and so flawed in the design of man that
49:46 he had to send his own son his only son
49:48 he only have one son right God only has
49:50 one of these things and he sends it down
49:52 and a woman who's a virgin gets her
49:55 pregnant she gives birth
49:57 this kids a prodigy he lives about 30
50:00 years before he really activates his
50:03 mutant gene and then he runs around for
50:04 33 years
50:05 ends up getting killed on the the Mason
50:09 33 degree year of his life should give
50:14 you some clues there where that story
50:15 came from he we used to sacrifice lambs
50:19 for our sins and because the God made a
50:22 mistake right you know he's out poor
50:24 lambs gosh let me send my son down he
50:26 can die for your sins and then all
50:29 everything will be great no you'd have
50:32 to overlook the fact that he's probably
50:33 the 27th Messiah of that exact archetype
50:37 to come down his individual story
50:39 differs from the previous twenty-seven
50:43 in several ways but in a lot of cases
50:47 you know Jesus as a young man taking you
50:52 know audience of the rabbi's and of the
50:55 priests of the time and demonstrating
50:57 that he has divine knowledge of all of
50:59 their laws that was repeated in several
51:02 predecessors but most of Jesus's life is
51:06 modeled after titus flavius the caesar
51:08 that that founded rome in the modern era
51:11 right created the colosseum created the
51:13 arena's created the aqueducts this guy
51:16 was the bomb they wanted you to worship
51:19 Him at least in symbolic metaphor and
51:22 typology
51:24 so titus flavius his life is all in
51:26 stone jesus's life isn't remotely
51:30 documented till probably 350 AD
51:33 and then it evolved over time but his
51:35 story starts to mock titus flavius his
51:38 life there's 45 correlations between
51:41 titus flavius his life and jesus's life
51:43 in the end you were worshipping titus
51:45 flavius through the story of christ the
51:48 story the big bang it as I've said
51:51 several times on the show go steady
51:54 Joseph Campbell who really locked down
51:57 the mythos of modern man meaning all the
52:01 stories we told to ourselves to explain
52:04 the universe they said God woke up and
52:07 when God woke up he exploded and his
52:09 body flew all over the universe and
52:11 every life force that exists in the
52:14 universe is a particle of God that
52:15 landed on preexisting planets that's
52:19 that orbited pre-existing Suns with
52:22 pre-existing moves but then people heard
52:25 the story and said well then you know
52:27 chicken-and-egg problem here where did
52:29 those planets stars and moons come from
52:31 so they read the story of the creation
52:34 of the universe this is so funny God's
52:36 nature
52:36 I mean man's nature right they said oh
52:39 well those came out of God's bosom as
52:41 well
52:41 those are like you know gold stones and
52:45 kidney stones that just happened to have
52:47 no use okay fast-forward I don't know 10
52:53 20 30 40 thousand years maybe a hundred
52:56 thousand years and you have scientists
52:59 starting to try and make this true using
53:01 this phenomenon definition of gravity
53:05 well then we wake up and we find out
53:08 that's all crap doesn't make any sense
53:09 something from nothing really you got
53:11 nothing and then all of a sudden
53:13 everything comes out of it mmm my god
53:16 how an atheist wouldn't believe in God I
53:17 don't know because that creates a
53:19 miracle right there if you believe that
53:21 crap none of it's true
53:24 now are there explosions in space that
53:26 are gigantic sure if it exists yes sure
53:30 makes sense
53:31 Heathrow winds will compress mass up to
53:33 a certain point there you go you know at
53:37 sea
53:37 level you get bubbles in water seven
53:41 miles down you can crush an i-beam in
53:44 the ocean ethers like water so you get
53:47 more water you get more density more
53:50 ether you get more density boom you got
53:52 an issue those of you that think that
53:56 gravity is buoyancy and pressure well
53:59 you're kind of right you just got to
54:01 understand it's an invisible particle
54:03 that you can't see that moves 50 times
54:04 the speed of light which I just watched
54:07 a Star Trek episode last night that had
54:09 it's a season 6 Star Trek episode next
54:13 generation excuse me and they end up
54:17 running through some temporal anomalies
54:20 in space it's actually a super super
54:24 cool deep thinking episode were they
54:27 I'll just say this they end up there
54:31 Ennis shuttlecraft you've got data
54:34 counselor Troi Geordi and Captain Picard
54:37 in the shuttlecraft they've been on some
54:40 visitation to some conference and now
54:42 they're flying back to the coordinates
54:44 where the enterprise exists and when
54:47 they get there they find out it's frozen
54:49 in time there's a warbird there or I
54:53 guess sorry it's a Romulan ship and
54:56 there seems to be you know there seem to
54:58 be attacking each others what they seems
55:00 to be and time is frozen what they find
55:04 out is that there's these anomalies
55:05 where things move 50 times the speed of
55:08 normal time which I thought was
55:11 interesting because that's the constant
55:13 that Faraday Tesla and Eric Dollard
55:16 found ether to move 50 times the speed
55:18 of light just thought that was
55:19 interesting but were raised with this
55:22 stuff and as I said a long time ago in
55:26 my episode why do we believe what is
55:29 your genetic capability or probability
55:32 in divorcing yourself from a belief
55:36 system that you were raised with ask
55:39 anybody who's pursuing the Flat Earth
55:40 movement they if they are talking to
55:44 someone across the table who's never
55:46 heard that theory before they are
55:47 dealing with the genetic
55:50 predisposition to believe in the other
55:52 theory which is heliocentric ball earth
55:56 but how many other theories are based on
55:59 the theory of the dinosaurs well they
56:02 tell you that you know there is these
56:04 pterodactyls that could fly which you
56:08 know they don't remotely match the
56:12 genetic design of a bat let alone a bird
56:18 again because the skulls are all faked
56:22 you get these bizarre looking creatures
56:25 I mean they put a lot of effort into
56:26 making these things look distinct but if
56:29 you go to a museum and you see these
56:31 Brown looking things that look like
56:32 bones you're gonna think you're seeing
56:34 the real deal it's false advertising and
56:37 imagine that someone took your money for
56:40 a Natural History Museum and they're
56:44 showing you fraudulent material as a
56:46 result of your ticket but selling you
56:48 the notion that you actually saw
56:49 something that was real sounds like you
56:52 could get your money back as long as you
56:54 can prove it's fake or challenge them to
56:57 say I don't think any of this is real I
56:59 want my money back and the only way
57:01 you're ever gonna keep my money is to
57:03 take me to those vaults that you won't
57:05 let thirty-five year professional
57:07 paleontologist see wouldn't that be
57:10 interesting the method of of getting to
57:13 see the real bones would be a
57:16 class-action lawsuit to get it all
57:18 against all these museums but what's the
57:21 risk of seeing what they call bones well
57:25 you could find out they're not real just
57:28 like National Geographic having to eat
57:29 their tail with this archaeal take those
57:35 bones and put them under CT scans take
57:37 them and try to figure out whether or
57:39 not they're fraudulent or not again what
57:43 was it cope and marsh said they found a
57:46 hundred and thirty six individual
57:48 dinosaurs and today they're only
57:51 acknowledging thirty-two of them as real
57:53 even in their own science and you know
57:57 about two years ago when this thing was
58:00 super duper hot there was a case where
58:04 I believe there was a company in Utah
58:07 that supposedly found what they said was
58:11 were dinosaur bones and this Christian
58:16 Church called him up and the phone calls
58:20 actually on the on YouTube and the ends
58:24 was what the the claim was is that they
58:26 actually found bone marrow of a dinosaur
58:30 which is ludicrous
58:32 right hundreds of millions of years
58:34 ain't no bone marrow that's gonna
58:36 survive let alone bone and be in
58:38 particular right but they claimed they
58:40 had this bone marrow if I have the story
58:42 right because I've never listening to
58:43 the phone call and the do calls up and
58:46 he doesn't identify himself as part of
58:48 this church but the dude who answered
58:50 the call knew that this was something
58:52 that was potentially gonna happen to him
58:56 and he said you know what I represent an
59:00 organization who's the guy making the
59:02 phone call and he said I will pay for or
59:06 we will pay for all of the tests that
59:12 need to occur on your bones that you
59:14 said you found to prove that they are D
59:18 dinosaur bones that they are indeed
59:19 hundreds of millions of years old and
59:21 the guy immediately starts to abort the
59:24 phone call verbally and says oh I know
59:26 who you are and we don't want your money
59:29 because I know that you have an ulterior
59:32 motive I think I said well what are you
59:34 talking about what would that matter I'm
59:36 actually giving you the money so that
59:39 you can prove what you have already
59:41 claimed that these are dinosaur bones
59:44 but the guy refused because he knows if
59:47 it ever got that formal level of testing
59:50 they'd be done be one more hoax out
59:55 there and then that guy's organization
59:57 who has these fraudulent you know
60:00 dinosaur bones which are probably normal
60:02 bones I would guess would be out of
60:06 business and be they would lose their
60:08 reputation so of course the guy is going
60:11 to refuse any financial aid to prove his
60:14 own theory that he claims is true
60:17 and let me give you a fictional analogy
60:19 that overlays that exact situation so we
60:22 can take another step let's say that and
60:27 this is all fictional so don't quote me
60:29 as this is what he said and it was real
60:31 might give you a little sci-fi movie
60:34 plot your family is like the what is it
60:39 the Donald Trump family where his uncle
60:41 went and was the first guy that grabbed
60:44 all of Tesla's you know inventions after
60:47 he died in New York that's a true story
60:51 he's one of the head physicists at MIT
60:55 and they thought he was the most
60:56 qualified guy to picked this information
60:58 up and there's a funny little theory
61:00 online that Tesla was actually trying to
61:04 master time-travel because when he did
61:07 his experiment in Springfield Colorado
61:10 and surrounded himself in this bolt of
61:12 lightning he got out of the ground for
61:13 free and modulated up that he said his
61:18 assistant who walked towards him to cut
61:20 the circuit because this thing just
61:23 infinitely kept pulling out plasma from
61:25 the Earth's core in his estimation he
61:28 said you know time slowed down our time
61:30 sped up for me so that my assistant
61:32 looked like he was moving really slow
61:33 and I gave him the notion that through
61:36 electromagnetism you could actually
61:38 control space-time that's that's a true
61:40 story
61:41 his his claim and his impression of what
61:43 he was dealing with now whether or not
61:45 Tesla ever invented anything that
61:47 travels through time who knows right but
61:50 let's say that that did happen and
61:52 you're part of that family you're part
61:53 of the Trump family and you've got a
61:55 time travel machine and you're like look
61:58 it's perfect it totally works we've been
62:01 all over history it's great now you go
62:05 to Cambridge University and they go up
62:06 to these scholars of Cambridge
62:08 University say okay you could do this
62:10 two different ways you go up the Royal
62:11 Society of England and say we're gonna
62:14 take a video camera with its own power
62:16 supply and we're gonna send it back in
62:19 time to when you say dinosaurs were here
62:21 and we're gonna videotape the whole set
62:24 we got a drone that's hooked to it it's
62:26 gonna fly where do you think dinosaurs
62:28 were really you know you say you had
62:30 pit that had 6,000 in just you knows
62:33 distinct bones let's let's roll back and
62:36 we'll just videotape you know we'll make
62:38 the Machine go thump through time a
62:39 little bit and they don't believe you
62:43 and of course you should show a
62:44 demonstration of your time machine and
62:45 whoa my god it's real they realize
62:47 you're not lying what do you think the
62:50 odds are that they're gonna take you up
62:53 on your offer they're not gonna do it
62:56 because there won't be any dinosaurs
62:58 there they go to the Vatican and they
63:01 say okay you see Jesus Christ was real
63:04 where was he crucified again oh right
63:07 over there okay okay we're gonna take
63:10 this camera back it's got a stealth
63:11 device that no one can see it and it's
63:13 gonna drone around completely silent and
63:16 videotape all of Rome that's zero AD and
63:20 maybe 33 years back and try to find this
63:23 guy from Nazareth who claims he's the
63:25 Son of God we're gonna try to find the
63:27 disciples we're gonna try to find all
63:29 these miracles unless we find the dude
63:31 we're gonna track him and just film
63:33 everything that he's ever done we're
63:35 gonna see him walk on water cast demons
63:38 into pigs that then drown themselves in
63:40 a pond cure lepers all this stuff you
63:45 think the Vatican would take him up on
63:46 that offer
63:47 the answer's no because they will lose
63:51 all of their extortion power for man the
63:54 idea that God rigged the world such that
63:56 flawed man has to go through flawed man
63:59 to get salvation to be with God all of a
64:02 sudden doesn't look like a very logical
64:04 solution to the universe so is the
64:08 belief in dinosaurs going to diminish
64:10 over the coming decades
64:14 I would not place that bet for quite a
64:17 while if the earth undergoes a giant
64:23 reset and not the kind that the ruling
64:27 powers would want to see which is a 98 9
64:29 % reduction in population but if we ever
64:32 got truth to be really really popular
64:35 you know it's going to be a very
64:37 sobering century if we say spent you
64:41 know 30 to 50 years
64:44 revealing all of these lies because a
64:46 lot of people's religious systems will
64:48 disappear and then man might rediscover
64:52 something about himself that is sort of
64:55 what my screenwriting teacher tells me
64:56 which is man needs fiction we need to
65:02 create art that imitates life in a way
65:06 that is like Gene Roddenberry creating
65:08 the Star Trek universe I have an episode
65:11 on Star Trek I don't remember what
65:13 season it's in I think it's in either
65:15 one or two but in that episode I say
65:18 look yeah
65:20 if education ever became a priority on
65:23 this earth and if what we taught
65:24 ourselves was actually true and not
65:25 false we could eventually ascend to the
65:29 level of the human beings and the gene
65:32 Roddenberry universe and then you could
65:33 get rid of money you could create a
65:35 socialistic society and everything could
65:38 be great but that's several thousand
65:42 years from now if we started today I am
65:47 no longer convinced that dinosaurs
65:48 existed and the number one reasons goes
65:53 as plural that I don't believe in
65:57 dinosaurs at this point of my life is
66:01 the method by which the theory was
66:05 hatched the method by which the first
66:08 136 suppose that individual species of
66:12 dinosaurs were discovered and the fact
66:15 that I've studied enough about human
66:18 history especially it deals with
66:20 monolithic structures to know that man
66:24 would have discovered these things a
66:25 long time ago you know Native Americans
66:28 are very interesting and that they again
66:31 they worshiped the earth and they they
66:35 are probably one of the only cultures
66:37 that I am aware of and slash races that
66:40 I am aware of that beat all man in one
66:45 realization and that is the earth as a
66:47 living being that needed to be treated
66:50 like a living being that needed to be
66:53 manicured and priced over in
66:57 anything else because without Earth
66:58 there is no man and it's interesting to
67:02 note that when we found the Native
67:05 American here in North America even in
67:09 the was the 1490s they hadn't discovered
67:15 the wheel yet and part of that's because
67:18 they had managed to build a balanced
67:20 society they didn't need the wheel they
67:24 had sleds they just didn't need it they
67:28 didn't need monolithic structures to
67:31 intimidate each other or to prove that
67:33 they were you know worthy of being on
67:35 this planet they just lived some of them
67:39 lived in one area the whole time the
67:42 Shoshone Indians went this big giant
67:44 circle with the seasons so when it was
67:46 really hot they went north one was
67:48 really cold they went south
67:49 they ate berries in one season animals
67:52 in another season you know I mean they
67:53 they were amazingly balanced with with
67:56 nature but they did excavate caves that
68:00 they lived in remember the city that was
68:03 made of gold but they told the
68:05 conquistadors that there was a city made
68:07 of gold so the conquistadors kept
68:08 looking for it looking for it because
68:10 their goal is to take the gold and bring
68:12 it back to the queen of Spain and then
68:15 you know get rewarded for their for
68:18 their exploration an acquisition of gold
68:21 and what they ended up finding was it
68:24 was a mountainside that had been dug out
68:28 it still exists to this day I forget its
68:30 name but when the Sun shined on it at a
68:32 particular time of day it glistened like
68:35 gold it was a metaphor it's amazing
68:40 anyone translated the language up to
68:42 that point so someone could say gold
68:43 gold what is gold oh this right here oh
68:45 yeah we got a city minute go oh really I
68:47 was probably the worst thing they could
68:50 have told the conquistadors let me uh
68:53 finish off this episode with kind of a
68:55 generic statement when I realized and I
68:59 don't know when I realized this probably
69:01 in my mid-30s that when we build up a
69:04 motor inside of our brain that can
69:06 process information incorrectly
69:10 we then become sort of addicted to that
69:15 methodology there is sort of a supply
69:18 and demand in the neurology of your
69:19 brain to create these fictional
69:21 realities why do you think kids get
69:24 totally obsessed on Japan MA or Marvel
69:28 heroes or you know Dungeons & Dragons or
69:31 the millions of video games that are out
69:33 there they live these games and I mean
69:36 live them go to watch a Blizzcon
69:38 conference here in Anaheim and watch how
69:40 the kids cry when you know a fictional
69:43 hero gets killed or or the story
69:46 narrative and the lore gets mixed up and
69:48 they make a mistake they get all angry
69:49 and butthurt and scream and yell at the
69:52 microphone this because these fictional
69:56 constructs have become their artificial
69:58 reality to deal with the fact that
70:00 they're unattended reality is not what
70:03 they want so instead of going and
70:05 developing goals that would make them
70:07 truly happy with what's capable of being
70:09 created on earth they run off on these
70:13 fictional constructs but then when
70:15 reality creeps in they absolutely freak
70:17 out and so scientifically they become
70:22 sociopaths because nothing in reality
70:24 appeals to them as they become more and
70:28 more incompatible with I would say human
70:32 beings that acknowledge reality for what
70:33 it is they start to reject those
70:37 individuals and this is why we have so
70:39 many snowflakes in the world and so many
70:41 people that today are using their
70:46 political affiliation as a rationale to
70:49 join terrorist organizations that hurt
70:52 people in public if you don't like the
70:56 way that's happening in the way that
70:57 that works I think the very first thing
71:00 that you need to do is obviously check
71:02 yourself how much of that stuff do you
71:05 believe you know snitches there's
71:10 probably dozens and dozens of you there
71:14 perhaps not receptive to my stories of
71:18 how Christ came to exist I have to
71:22 maintain my own and
71:23 with you based on really not a
71:28 tremendous amount of research I would
71:30 say it's a lot of research but not a
71:31 tremendous amount of research go study
71:33 doctor at well and you'll get the whole
71:36 story of Christ down but now fiction
71:39 does have its value because let's say
71:42 you lived in a world that was very
71:44 tyrannical we lost control the agenda 21
71:47 takes off all right you got a bunch of
71:49 problems on your hands well now if you
71:52 just acknowledge reality we've all
71:54 succumbed to a world with no freedoms no
71:58 individuality we're living in these
72:00 concentration camps called communities
72:02 which are not communities like we would
72:05 define them but as the elite would
72:06 define them most the population has been
72:08 erased off the face of the planet you
72:11 don't have to get permission to do
72:12 anything all right how would you dig
72:15 yourself out well someone's gonna have
72:18 to rebirth the notion of freedom of
72:21 inalienable rights that you deserve as a
72:24 human being and then you're gonna have
72:26 to use that art because that's all it
72:29 would be at that point because it
72:30 wouldn't exist in the real world you'd
72:31 have to have that idea that imagination
72:34 of my god I do deserve certain things
72:37 because I exist and you shouldn't be
72:39 able to kill me robot cop from thx 1138
72:43 because I deserve to live you shouldn't
72:46 be able to steal my stuff because you
72:47 want it remember the movie rollerball
72:50 from 75 they would take his girlfriends
72:53 and circulate them through the
72:54 executives because the executives wanted
72:56 to sleep with the woman that had been
72:58 with the rollerball er that he would
73:00 never be able to have a wife because
73:01 they kept stealing his chicks his
73:04 original wife did leave him for
73:07 legitimate reasons which we'll find out
73:08 in the movie but I really want us to get
73:12 to a point as human beings where we can
73:14 just simply take from these metaphors
73:17 and take from these stories take from
73:19 art what is valuable to our person and
73:24 then leave the rest of our belief system
73:28 up there on the shelf as this is who I
73:31 used to be I used to believe in this as
73:33 reality now I've come to grips with the
73:36 fact that it's probably
73:37 just man trying to help man through
73:39 metaphor and you become a better person
73:42 because you start to become a real
73:44 person you can still live by I mean
73:49 let's take three ridiculous characters
73:51 out of three amigos right it's Steve
73:54 Martin Chevy Chase and Martin Short
73:56 playing three actors he'd play these
73:58 fictitious characters called the three
73:59 amigos but they were mistaken for being
74:02 real by a little village in Mexico who
74:06 sent them a telegram saying they were
74:07 gonna put on a show and get rid of LWOP
74:10 oh they think they're going down to do a
74:13 fictional show because they're they
74:17 think that this village is great big
74:18 fans of theirs but they go down and find
74:20 out that this is real and that this
74:22 village thinks that they're real and
74:24 what it one is up happening this is a
74:28 beautiful little story they have to
74:30 become the real three amigos they have
74:32 to really go up against this fictional
74:34 character LWOP oh and they have to teach
74:36 the village how to defend themselves and
74:38 so what what went from a fictional story
74:40 becomes real and then they free
74:43 themselves from the tyranny of this
74:45 character that was terrorizing them once
74:47 every week or whatever right stealing
74:49 their women stealing their food their
74:50 liquor all that stuff I don't know about
74:53 you but I would much rather be the real
74:56 three amigos than the fake three amigos
74:59 they look in the mirror and say well for
75:02 better for worse whatever I am it's real
75:06 story of Christ I mentioned him all the
75:08 time I will talk about Christ as if he's
75:10 completely real with my friends because
75:12 what I'm trying to do is pick out a
75:13 story of his life that has value at the
75:16 moment we're talking the solution in the
75:20 Bible that he might suggest is a
75:22 solution for all of us we just have to
75:25 do it does he have to be real for that
75:28 story and that advice to be powerful to
75:31 us no not at all you know I'll just
75:35 close with this one there have been
75:38 situations in history where someone
75:41 forged data and got an award for
75:46 breaking a record there's a bunch of
75:48 these
75:49 and then someone else legitimately broke
75:53 that record without cheating and it's
75:58 amazing when that happens right so they
76:00 were lured by some fake piece of
76:02 information but then they conquer it for
76:04 real I think that's awesome so dinasaurs
76:10 currently my book they are now a
76:12 fictional construct doesn't matter
76:15 not really whether or not we believe in
76:19 these things until the end of mankind or
76:21 we figure out that they weren't real I
76:22 don't I don't know about you but there's
76:26 nothing in my life on a daily basis the
76:28 changes because these things are real or
76:29 fake now what I forgot to mention
76:33 earlier was that the existence of oil as
76:36 a fossil fuel was attached to dinosaurs
76:38 and the time of dinosaurs again when I
76:41 was a kid they used to flight up tell
76:43 you that crude oil was melted down
76:45 dinosaurs when they finally figured out
76:48 there weren't enough dinosaurs on the
76:49 planet even in their fictitious theory
76:52 to account for all the oil that
76:54 continually fills up oil wells they
76:56 blamed it on the the organic life like
77:00 ferns and trees and things that also
77:02 melted down into crude oil and then when
77:04 we found out that crude oil exists as
77:06 far down as we can dig right Russians
77:08 about eight miles and found oil and all
77:12 life stops at about three miles
77:14 meaning no fossils no organic mass
77:17 beyond 16,000 feet then they have a huge
77:21 problem and they just want to get rid of
77:23 the conversation because oil is a
77:24 natural byproduct of the Earth's
77:26 interior it is not a fossil fuel and
77:28 it's not limited and again I'll warn
77:31 everybody this will be a funny prophecy
77:34 for maybe 20 years from now 30 years
77:36 from now we do find replacements for oil
77:37 when we stop drilling oil oil is going
77:42 to start floating on the surface of the
77:44 earth again not in any giant ocean or
77:47 something like that but southern Texas
77:49 is going to have oil fields where it's
77:53 just sedimentary crude oil on top of the
77:58 soil so we're going to figure out how to
78:01 deal with that
78:02 at the same time we're using this new
78:05 engine it doesn't have to use any oil
78:07 whatsoever so I think that's a funny
78:09 little reality check that's gonna what's
78:12 going to nip us in the butt bu TT this
78:16 time so anyway that's all I've got on
78:18 that one but this is what I've been
78:19 wanting to do for a very long time let
78:22 me know what you think let me know if
78:24 you because there's videos out there
78:26 that claim to debunk this but man when
78:27 you listen to them it is all just
78:29 conjecture right
78:31 it's like someone you know I don't know
78:33 using their belief system to continually
78:36 perpetuate the belief instead of using
78:38 science until there is an exhibit with
78:42 fully independently verified bones slash
78:47 fossilized rocks of organic matter by
78:51 independent non affiliated
78:54 paleontologists researchers are just
78:56 scientists that are saying look we
78:57 understand your theory of paleontology
78:59 but we're gonna we're gonna analyze all
79:02 of this stuff behind your vaults until
79:05 that is done and proven ten ways to
79:09 Sunday where the human beings of this
79:11 world like you and I can go and see it
79:14 and see the whole theory of the whole
79:16 thing from soup to nuts it's fake
79:19 it's not real hopefully that doesn't
79:22 disappoint too many people if you
79:25 haven't been to do thoughts radio.com
79:27 please go that's where all the episodes
79:29 exist there are two feeds for our video
79:32 which is YouTube and [ __ ] shoot that

79:39 two links for the audio of course again
79:41 take your device that you want to listen
79:43 to the podcast on go to the website
79:45 click the link it'll immediately link up
79:46 with your software you're good to go
79:48 we have a lock Facebook group of some of
79:50 the coolest people on earth twitter is
79:51 there but it's just the feed you know
79:53 it's just the links of the videos just
79:56 in case you want to retweet something
79:58 somewhere and for those of you do I
80:00 really appreciate it
80:03 there's a few ways to donate to the to
80:05 the page to the movement one of us
80:09 PayPal which because a [ __ ] shoot I'm
80:11 beginning a few contributions and again
80:12 I want to say I don't have any identity
80:14 of you folks going through PayPal
80:16 so you are anonymously contributing so I
80:21 really appreciate that the other one is
80:24 patreon where you can put in a monthly
80:27 buck or two or whatever you want the
80:29 cool thing about patreon is that you
80:31 guys get the feeds first so when I make
80:33 an episode either when it's encoded or
80:36 I'm still uploading it I will post it on
80:37 patreon so that you get it you know a
80:40 few hours to even four or five days
80:42 before everyone else you can get the
80:44 feed right away and for those of you who
80:47 contribute thank you very much your and
80:48 the credits if you ever do contribute
80:50 through patreon or if I can find out who
80:52 you are through PayPal you will go in
80:54 the credits permanently so let's make
80:57 the credits last like four or five
80:58 minutes the other two that I have for
81:01 contribution is the brave browser you
81:03 need to get this browser to regardless
81:05 if you get it for me if you want to just
81:06 get it and don't worry about an
81:07 affiliate link for me just go to brave
81:09 like it's brave com but it's a browser
81:12 that is cutting off the deep state they
81:14 can't figure out where you are who you
81:16 are change your search engine inside
81:19 there to DuckDuckGo instead of Google
81:20 they don't share your metrics they don't
81:23 track your metrics and so you're
81:25 completely anonymous the entire time
81:26 you're searching or whatever the hell
81:27 you want to search on so it's a
81:29 beautiful step and that browsers getting
81:31 super popular so it's super fast because
81:35 they cut off all the advertising the
81:37 videos that try to autoplay on your
81:38 browser and they cut off all the
81:40 trackers so if you go to fox or CNN or
81:44 some web site Amazon will run ads that
81:46 you just looked up the black and decker
81:48 and all the sudden what you search on
81:49 amazon's there it cuts that off so that
81:52 amazon has no idea where you're going
81:54 which is beautiful but the other one is
81:57 Backblaze it's a backup software I'm
82:00 gonna say it's a few times because again
82:02 this thing saves my bacon any time my
82:04 computer has problems rebooting I never
82:07 worry anymore because this thing allows
82:09 you to have two computers for five bucks
82:11 a month two computers infinite drives
82:13 and I've got I think I have technically
82:17 about 20 terabytes of information that's
82:21 connected to my computers either be my
82:23 laptop or my desktop system which is an
82:25 iMac
82:27 and it's all backed up all night long
82:30 takes a little while for the first one
82:32 but when you want to go get your files
82:34 you just surf your hard drives online
82:37 tell it what you want it builds this
82:38 compressed file then you download their
82:41 software to get it and it does a
82:42 beautiful job expanding it they even
82:44 recommend
82:45 it's called better better zip I think on
82:49 the Mac Windows does really well
82:51 decompressing this but they'll help you
82:53 get everything done it's great save my
82:55 bacon several times so definitely get a
82:56 copy of that if you're looking for
82:58 season one episodes on this particular
82:59 channel you're not going to find them
83:01 because I've marked them all unlisted if
83:03 they're embedded they still work go to
83:05 the website there's a link for season
83:06 one it's a different channel on YouTube
83:08 all remastered bit shoot has all the
83:11 remaster ones as well but make it easy
83:13 on yourself just go to deep thoughts
83:14 radio com click in the search field type
83:17 anything you want
83:18 remember there's category fields where
83:20 you click on them and they bring up the
83:22 page with all the Moon episodes all the
83:24 dream episodes anything you wants in
83:26 there that's all I've got for today take
83:29 care of yourself in someone else and
83:30 I'll see you in the next deep thoughts
