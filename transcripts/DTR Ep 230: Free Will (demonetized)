00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen today's got a suggestion from
00:41 listener Richie who sent me about five
00:45 or six suggestions that I think I
00:47 probably gonna make every single one of
00:48 them but two of them go together one of
00:56 the subjects would be sovereignty and
00:59 the other ones freewill I think we could
01:03 push both of these together because I
01:06 think one feels the other what's
01:10 interesting is you know when I was
01:12 growing up and waking up eventually in
01:15 my 30s and 40s I never used the word
01:19 sovereignty obviously I'd heard it my
01:22 entire life since I started studying
01:24 history as a kid you know just in school
01:27 you know when you hear a word like that
01:29 it's got this regal sound to it and
01:31 you're like what the hell does that mean
01:32 oh you know it's it's a person's right
01:34 to essentially be left alone right you
01:40 have a sovereign space you sovereignty
01:43 you know we need to acknowledge it as a
01:46 physical element it really has a mental
01:49 element as well you know the Inquisition
01:56 invaded the sovereignty of people's
01:58 minds in Europe you must believe you
02:02 must believe any any time you know I've
02:05 said this in the past but any time
02:06 history requires laws for you to believe
02:09 a particular thing in history it's most
02:12 likely a lie
02:13 some point in there it's it's a
02:15 bold-faced lie and that's why they get
02:18 nervous and they create these invasions
02:23 within the mental space to make you
02:27 believe something the Inquisition was
02:29 the same exact thing in fact english'
02:30 was that on steroids right not only is
02:34 there a law that you must believe but if
02:36 we can get you to see anything counter
02:41 to that well then there's punishment
02:42 potentially up to death what frustrates
02:45 the elite of the world is that anyone
02:48 would dare teach a human being about
02:51 sovereignty because they know they can
02:53 teach us the antithesis of sovereignty
02:57 serfdom slavery and what's interesting
03:01 is mankind seems to have the ability to
03:08 to understand free will as the
03:12 contrasting force against sovereignty
03:15 without anyone teaching us this you know
03:20 as much as we get really pissed off at
03:22 the little kid that has to hoard all the
03:25 toys away from the other kid in the mind
03:27 of that child even though it's
03:29 disproportionately growing like a virus
03:31 they see the world as their domain and
03:34 no one's to mess with it you're always
03:36 visiting their world no matter if you're
03:38 on the other side of the planet and
03:41 that's why we have to mature right
03:44 anytime you take a kid or a person and
03:48 you constrain them in any way shape or
03:51 form
03:51 they typically fight back to a point and
03:54 then they'll give up but in the back of
03:58 their brain they're only giving up
03:59 temporarily and that's interesting now
04:07 what is fascinating to me is the the
04:11 people that really believe that whoever
04:14 created us let's just come down one step
04:18 from god and go with like an alien
04:20 visitation for a me theist sort of idea
04:24 the folks that believe that the Anunnaki
04:26 came and
04:27 a slave race to mine gold out of the
04:29 ground they don't understand that we are
04:34 designed to be absolutely not slaves
04:38 because we always seem to find our free
04:41 will it's a natural sort of pendulum
04:44 inside our system that says anything
04:47 against this is not what we want and
04:52 once you gain the bud the seed of free
04:55 will right you then start to figure out
04:59 that you're going to need a domain to
05:00 operate in and this is typically where
05:04 you have to come up with another word
05:06 that is your ability to have your own
05:09 space within common law meaning no one
05:13 comes into your space and that's where
05:17 we say sovereign in my mind now with all
05:22 concepts like this you have a concept
05:25 that's psychological on an individual
05:27 level
05:28 I feel like this backyard is my
05:30 sovereign ground right and then you have
05:34 a sociological implication which is a
05:36 society and societies come in all these
05:40 kind of Russian doll sizes right little
05:42 tiny towns and then gets into bigger
05:44 towns and cities and then whatever
05:48 counties states nations continents all
05:54 that stuff now on a psychological level
05:59 it's a lot more fundamental and easy to
06:02 define even though each one of our
06:04 definitions of sovereignty which is
06:06 essentially what we have come down to
06:09 thinking that we need it's like Steve
06:12 Martin in the jerk
06:13 you just need his remote control we all
06:17 have our own definition but when it
06:20 comes to a sociological level Wow that's
06:25 where we struggle now maybe if you're
06:28 the father of a very healthy family you
06:31 and your wife get along in terms of what
06:35 you need the kids follow your lead
06:38 because they're kind of stuck in a sub
06:40 microcosm with
06:41 in the sovereignty that is the home that
06:43 you have built that you pay for and
06:46 protect your kids are just in there they
06:49 don't really have a perception of the
06:51 outside world or any need for such a
06:52 thing until they hit their teens right
06:54 but the more people you try to put into
06:57 the definition of sovereignty you're
07:00 going to need a mechanism a mental
07:01 technology like I said in the previous
07:03 episode that allows you all to get on
07:07 the same page every time I think about a
07:10 tribalistic sort of existence my mind
07:14 approaches the problem by going back in
07:16 time to some sort of cottage that is or
07:22 I should say village that are surrounded
07:23 by a barrier kind of like this stuff you
07:28 see in Game of Thrones you just it's an
07:31 old fortress right made of spiky pieces
07:34 of wood now imagine you have managed to
07:40 pull a bunch of people together say 50
07:42 to 100 people you build one of these
07:44 little fortresses you got your folks all
07:47 divided up in terms of who does what you
07:50 have the folks that take care of the
07:52 population maybe a horde of women the
07:54 boys and the men we they all get out
07:57 there in train how to use whatever
07:59 weapons you can come up with and then
08:02 sort of in the middle you've got some
08:03 leadership so folks that are older wiser
08:07 they've seen disasters and successes and
08:11 other fortresses and you just sort of
08:13 come together like I kind of pitched on
08:15 my politics episode although a lot less
08:17 complex and the thing is is once you get
08:21 together and put together all those
08:23 rules about how society is gonna
08:25 function where you are just this tiny
08:27 little microcosm right but you realize a
08:30 fortress could be an acre of land back
08:34 in the day not that much but very
08:36 important and very powerful but you got
08:39 the one hippie who thinks that whoever
08:42 walks by the outside if they say they
08:44 need help there's no such thing as a lie
08:47 and we'll bring them in and take care of
08:49 them no vetting process just look into
08:51 their sorrow for sorrowful eyes and then
08:55 in the door and then the wise legion
08:58 soldier that fought for rome and
09:00 whatever he's seen the the weight that
09:03 people lie to get in the Trojan horse
09:05 techniques he's like no way man this is
09:09 all just getting us to open the front
09:11 door and his buddies are just inside the
09:14 the woods there and we'll never get the
09:17 door shut in time and he'll be inside
09:20 etc etc well that weird little physical
09:26 analogy is sort of how we have to
09:29 perceive I believe the mental technology
09:32 that's being installed in us the
09:33 philosophies and the dogma and the
09:35 indoctrination to get us to let go of
09:38 sovereignty but here's the tease and
09:42 there's kind of a two-sided thing to
09:44 this you have a bunch of people that are
09:48 actually sweet people who want to
09:50 believe the world can be a utopia with
09:52 very little effort and for whatever
09:55 reason they don't really study history
09:57 they don't study other geographical
10:00 areas they're monolingual and so their
10:03 perception of the outside world is nil
10:05 it's like the hippie in our fortress who
10:08 just you know they're being very
10:10 empathetic they're being played by a
10:12 facial expression and maybe the person
10:15 outside is genuine and maybe the person
10:16 outside is a is a shill as a Trojan
10:20 horse a deception but imagine we take a
10:24 little step further the hippie gets
10:26 denied by the Legion commander right
10:30 looking over the edge and now comes
10:34 something very vicious a mountain lion
10:36 whatever and that person can't escape
10:39 they're begging for help they get
10:41 knocked down by the by the animal or
10:45 whatever the person and the hippies
10:47 looking and the hippies totally
10:48 horrified that they could have let them
10:51 in and we didn't let them in and look
10:53 what happened in its place once in a
10:56 million thing happened right in front of
10:58 everyone then the credibility between
11:01 this hippie and the seasoned soldier
11:03 that said no way we're letting this guy
11:05 in
11:05 you have no idea where he comes from
11:08 what he's all about they start to have a
11:11 clash about the definition of
11:13 sovereignty and the policies by which
11:16 you could invite someone into your
11:17 sovereign space and share that that
11:20 whole experience then there's the other
11:23 half the guy is the Trojan horse you let
11:26 him inside your so as you open the door
11:28 a horde comes screaming in here and
11:33 takes over the village and kills
11:35 everybody and the hippie just happens to
11:38 be the last one that's murdered so he
11:40 gets to see everything and just before
11:42 the knife goes into his throat he thinks
11:46 holy [ __ ]
11:47 I was naive we see this all the time in
11:52 different scenarios in the world and the
11:55 one thing that that really plays with
11:58 the mind of folks that are trying to say
12:00 can't we all get along and you know hey
12:03 I'll just give you every piece of bread
12:05 on my table we'll just make it a big
12:09 socialistic party the problem is is that
12:12 conceptually in your mind as infinitely
12:15 complex as the process would have to be
12:18 it's actually fairly simple to see a
12:20 utopia in your mind you know you just
12:24 watch old episodes of Buck Rogers back
12:26 in the 70s the remake you watch some
12:29 Star Trek and you start to realize that
12:35 there are mechanisms to get rid of money
12:38 there are mechanisms to preserve purpose
12:40 and individuals there are mechanisms to
12:42 control population all within a balance
12:47 that everyone can get along with but we
12:50 seem to be in pain okay pible of
12:52 actually achieving anything like it
12:55 which is really really sad right I've
12:59 said on the show several times and I'll
13:01 say it again
13:01 this that the proof that the elite of
13:04 the world are some of the most ignorant
13:07 human beings on planet Earth is it here
13:10 they are trying to get their way I mean
13:13 from the Koch brothers in the United
13:14 States who are just trying to do
13:15 regional things all the way up to the
13:17 huge banking families of Europe
13:21 their biggest problem is that they want
13:27 to make you suffer at the same exact
13:29 time they want to manipulate you into
13:31 their will and so chronologically
13:36 speaking they are they are interrupting
13:38 our ability to trust them in fact they
13:42 are not only untrusted but once you get
13:45 screwed by these individuals and you
13:47 lose an opportunity in life you forever
13:50 hate them you forever track them in your
13:53 mind whatever they touch is bad so if
13:57 they try to bring in a proxy we find
13:59 that the proxy works for George Soros
14:00 now that guy or girl is just scarlet
14:04 letters in our mind for the rest of
14:06 reality and without a massive active
14:11 repentance and and sort of a hobbling of
14:15 there power structure we'll never trust
14:17 them ever again
14:18 but if these folks were to create a very
14:26 pleasant state in world economy in world
14:31 health they could get their way because
14:35 more people would trust them that I've
14:38 ever trusted them in the past to say
14:40 well look at the economy's doing great I
14:41 never thought I'd be able to own a house
14:43 and now not only did I buy a house but
14:45 actually pay for it my kids are going
14:47 off to great colleges the roads are
14:50 paved terrorism is is a thing of the
14:53 past
14:54 sure I'll give you my guns right sure
14:59 you can take over education sure
15:01 everything can be robots that can be
15:03 robots how police can be robots yeah
15:05 sure you can fly these helicopters over
15:07 my house that are drone driven
15:11 everything is great
15:13 da da da right so they never seem to
15:18 attempt that process not that I want
15:22 them to figure it out but what's
15:24 interesting about the concept of
15:26 sovereignty at this point is that we
15:29 have a Renaissance 2.0 that I keep
15:31 talking about which is the awakening of
15:33 Mei
15:33 kind I mean it is a phenomenal rapid
15:36 burning explosion of lucidity in our
15:40 world right now and for me the cut of
15:46 the subtotal the daily subtotal thus the
15:49 millisecond subtotal to this awakening
15:51 is free will
15:52 and the very next thing you can say to
15:55 put it in another paradigm is sovereign
15:57 is sovereignty that once you figure out
16:01 your free will you then want to
16:03 establish a domain by which you can
16:04 operate your free will and that's
16:06 sovereignty that space is what we call
16:11 it but it's not just a physical space
16:13 it's a mental space as well for those of
16:17 you feel religiously prosecuted you want
16:20 religious sovereignty you know for those
16:23 of you are you know financially
16:25 repressed or racially oppressed you want
16:28 to have sovereignty in each element each
16:30 attribute of your life that you feel
16:32 like you don't have a fair share of your
16:36 ability to express your free will right
16:40 so the first thing that happened to me
16:42 personally it was just the absolute
16:44 understanding of the basic concepts of
16:47 sovereignty and the fact that our
16:49 forefathers and everyone who wrote Magna
16:51 Carta and you know everyone has ever
16:53 taken care of a decent society you know
16:56 all the Greek philosophers it wrote
16:57 about it they were trying to figure out
17:01 sort of where the limits are you know I
17:05 don't personally need to have the entire
17:06 world at my disposal I'm willing to
17:09 share the world with everyone else in
17:11 the world that I'm willing to follow
17:12 policies when I changed geographical
17:14 locations
17:15 just tell me upfront what I'm gonna be
17:17 dealing with and I'll make the decision
17:18 of whether I'm coming or not
17:20 you know if you fly to Saudi Arabia you
17:23 sign this piece of paper that says you
17:25 violate these laws you will most likely
17:27 be killed so don't [ __ ] around right
17:33 so you might look up that piece of paper
17:35 while you're still in the States and go
17:37 yeah you know I like red meat and
17:39 alcohol enough that I probably shouldn't
17:41 go over there but we wake up on an
17:44 individual level and everything is small
17:47 which is good because you need a core
17:49 and you see at the center of sort of the
17:51 brain trust of the whole thing and then
17:54 you can expand out and then you start to
17:57 think about other people's sovereignty
17:58 and that's a weird thing you know as an
18:04 American we were built on sovereignty
18:05 were built on free will we have you know
18:08 two amendments and our Constitution the
18:10 freedom of speech and the right to bear
18:12 arms which is the second protects the
18:14 first and so it's built into us if you
18:17 understand the words that are written on
18:19 paper this is sort of our duty to our
18:23 country to ourselves to our communities
18:25 that if we ever see it being taken away
18:29 in a different community within the
18:31 borders of the United States of America
18:32 every citizen is supposed to rise up and
18:35 reinstate the law of the land the
18:39 Constitution based on Magna Carta in
18:42 that area and anyone who was caught
18:44 trying to take away those rights goes to
18:47 jail gets tried and perhaps gets hung
18:51 for treason and so we grew up with this
18:55 our whole lives you know and then when
18:57 we look over the pond at different
18:59 countries and realize that the folks
19:00 have given up all of these rights but
19:02 they're not they realize it or not it's
19:07 really confusing you know us looking at
19:12 Europe giving up all of their gun rights
19:14 it's astonishing than any that a human
19:20 being would utter sort of sub college of
19:23 dissidents statement which is you know
19:25 we're gonna maintain free will and give
19:28 up our guns
19:29 you know these to balance each other out
19:32 because there's always a king there's
19:35 always a banker that doesn't like the
19:37 fact that you have the right and ability
19:40 maybe you have the ability and the right
19:42 to
19:44 defend yourselves if they want your
19:46 stuff if they want your land if they
19:50 want your people nowadays they want your
19:53 children right they want your children
19:56 on two different levels
19:58 the most common level is they want to
20:00 educate your child first they want to
20:02 rip your child away from you by creating
20:03 such a dual income household requirement
20:08 that the mother can't stay at home so
20:10 rips the child out of your hands then
20:12 they want to stick them inside some a
20:13 doctrine ation pool to basically
20:17 pre-configure your child to pass all the
20:19 laws that they want passed get rid of
20:21 things and rights right to infect free
20:24 will and then the other group just
20:29 simply comes and picks up your kid and
20:31 you'll never see them again but now
20:34 here's the here's the other rub I think
20:37 most of us who have at least reached
20:40 forty or and gotten well past forty you
20:45 you realize that managing your own life
20:47 is pretty much the maximum apex of your
20:52 capabilities it's tough if you have a
20:57 situation where you could make your life
20:59 very static meaning you know you just
21:01 have the same routines every day and
21:02 you're very pleased with those routines
21:04 you eat the same meal on Mondays the
21:07 kids are perhaps an autopilot they're
21:10 driving themselves to school now perhaps
21:11 throughout the college etc maybe you can
21:15 find some solace in that
21:17 but I think today's generations a little
21:20 more dynamic I think that life changes I
21:22 think people have dreams I think they've
21:24 now through the internet you you're able
21:26 to listen to people who've had their
21:28 dreams and realize there's no special
21:31 sauce there's no special bloodline you
21:33 can be just as amazing as anyone and
21:36 that's sort of if you want another
21:38 secret that celebrities understand or
21:40 successful people understand is that
21:42 they're on the other side going god I
21:44 worked my ass off and now I'm here now
21:46 I'm standing on the the pitcher's mound
21:48 of the Yankees or whatever I'm standing
21:52 on stage playing to 50,000 people
21:54 screaming our lyrics that I just wrote
21:57 last
21:57 week you know and they realized they
22:01 know that that they're special but only
22:03 because they made the decision inside
22:05 their mind to persist and as a minor
22:09 digression on that point when you push
22:12 really really hard and you achieve
22:14 success you know only you know that you
22:17 may have spent ten calorie calories
22:19 worth of energy to succeed and the
22:23 success brought you back may be 75
22:25 calories worth of reward but to the
22:27 outside world oh my gosh you're a
22:29 millionaire and boy can I borrow a
22:31 couple bucks and you're kind of thinking
22:34 well I worked so incredibly hard for the
22:37 75 cents you know I spent $1 worth of my
22:40 money and my time and my spirit and my
22:42 soul to get 75 cents and now you want to
22:45 take part of that money away and then
22:49 you look at society and you have these
22:51 conversations with the average Joe Joe
22:53 the Plumber great guy down the street
22:55 and you realize you know he might flip
22:58 on flip idli say well you know you know
23:01 well you're rich or you know you're you
23:05 have it easy or something like that some
23:06 insinuation that you have it easy and in
23:08 the back your head you're just saying no
23:11 I don't have it easy I don't have the
23:14 life you have Joe the Plumber is getting
23:15 the ideal life the wife the kids the
23:18 pool in the back just go to work make
23:20 the money come home and pay the bills
23:22 there's never any threat of losing your
23:24 job and even though he's not a rock star
23:26 or whatever he's actually got one of the
23:29 best life's anyone could ever have
23:31 period he wins meanwhile you know you
23:35 get to go to you know special exotic
23:38 locations you get to meet really famous
23:40 people but in the end you're by yourself
23:42 if you have someone with you because
23:45 they're off on their dynamic tangent so
23:48 you share a little bit of time that
23:49 during the day right get back to my
23:51 point we struggle at some point with
23:54 just controlling our worlds right it's
23:57 tough it's tough to create a life that's
23:59 that's fulfilling and you know not too
24:03 complex or not so complex that you can't
24:08 manage it easily right so
24:11 this wild balance and it changes as you
24:13 get older and older and older but now
24:16 the reason why I mention that is that we
24:19 don't think about running sovereign
24:22 constructs they're way bigger than us
24:24 half the time now what would be some of
24:28 those ideas well let's say you join the
24:30 City Council or a council that runs a
24:33 giant organization you could be on the
24:34 counsel of a local college college
24:37 campuses of like you know four thousand
24:39 kids if not twenty thousand kids running
24:42 around right right away you're saddled
24:45 with all of the politics he said she
24:49 said complaints and charges and all
24:52 kinds of stuff it's really phenomenal
24:56 the kind of stuff you have employees who
24:59 try to sexually assault each other I
25:02 mean it's crazy
25:02 and that's just a tiny little campus if
25:05 you go to a true City Council well you
25:08 have all kinds of policies that shape
25:10 and mold the town that you're a part of
25:12 creating then you go up to the state
25:15 level and it gets insane you know
25:16 depends on if your state of Rhode Island
25:18 or the state of California completely
25:20 different monster right then you go to a
25:23 nation a nation that has enemies abroad
25:29 there's the silent enemy that may be
25:32 trying to smuggle a bunch of their
25:34 citizens into your country to rob your
25:36 welfare systems and mail the money back
25:38 home to crazy nut bags in North Korea
25:41 who are sitting there playing with Tonka
25:44 toys pretending like they actually have
25:45 you know real construction vehicles so
25:49 how is the average man supposed to
25:51 participate in the sovereign formulas of
25:55 bigger thinking the one interesting
25:58 thing that you know strikes me as being
26:01 an American is that the forefathers here
26:04 had it all thought out before they
26:07 participated in the the Declaration of
26:09 Independence and then finally the
26:11 Constitution of course they borrow from
26:13 Magna Carta which really encouraged a
26:14 shortcut see my episode on Magna Carta
26:17 if you want to have a great tour through
26:19 that that whole storyline but the
26:22 beautiful thing that they did was they
26:23 created just some very
26:25 simple rules that extended beautifully
26:28 as if it's pure godly truth that that
26:32 protected an entire nation and made us
26:34 in terms of the bankers the most hated
26:37 nation on planet earth you know America
26:41 is special America is unbelievably hated
26:45 by the bankers and loved at the same
26:47 time how does that break down well we
26:52 are infiltrated at this point nearly a
26:56 hundred percent our military military
26:58 dust row complex answers to European
27:00 agents our banking institutions are
27:03 literally controlled by the Federal
27:05 Reserve banking system which dictates
27:07 how we're going to run our money our
27:09 money is created by European bankers out
27:12 of thin air and we think we can't do it
27:14 ourselves and then every politician
27:18 every corporation every stock every
27:21 gigantic investment banking house is all
27:23 controlled by them currently in 2017
27:26 total control so because we're
27:29 controlled the way that they love us is
27:31 that we become Thor's hammer for them
27:34 the handle goes back to their hand but
27:37 the big club' thing on the end well
27:39 that's our military and they understand
27:42 that they can create just a little bit
27:44 of propaganda with joseph gribble action
27:46 and we will go over and crush someone in
27:50 the Middle East
27:51 we'll crush anyone anywhere as long as
27:55 they can tuck the agenda inside the
27:58 Bible Belt tuck it into the normal
28:00 lexicon of American kind of sovereignty
28:03 concepts always suggesting that these
28:07 countries some of them 8,000 miles away
28:09 are somehow going to show up on our
28:11 doorstep right what's really funny is
28:15 that they have pitched us that we have
28:18 to go over and get them first over there
28:20 before they come over to get us over
28:22 here right
28:23 and yet the Democratic side of our faux
28:28 political system the DNC and Hillary
28:30 Clinton and Bernie Sanders their goal
28:33 was to bring in tens of millions of
28:34 these folks straight into our country
28:37 and automatically just
28:39 you're completely lovest now right
28:41 you're here because we destroyed your
28:44 country's over there we engaged in
28:47 Syrian Wars and blah blah blah the cover
28:49 story the [ __ ] cover story that any
28:52 of these people are from Syria you know
28:54 the highest estimate of people that
28:56 immigrate into Europe right now from
28:58 these regions is 4% or Syrian and 96%
29:01 are from everywhere over there just
29:04 trying to get on the tit right and it's
29:06 working what they hate the most is the
29:10 idea of America because that's all
29:13 America is it's just an idea right we
29:18 believe in sovereignty and we believe
29:20 that that is fueled by a personal free
29:22 will now there is something that we call
29:25 the Republic and America was founded on
29:29 a republic which is a method of law by
29:33 which you you agree that human being has
29:38 a set number of Rights just because
29:41 you're alive and it really dovetails
29:43 into it the final definition which we
29:44 always call common law in the show but
29:47 you have the right to be unimpeded by
29:49 another human being just by nature that
29:51 you are human being and no one else is
29:53 higher than you what's crazy about the
29:57 Christian movement for me is that they
29:58 they preach and believe that every man
30:00 is created equal however they don't
30:05 engage in that if there was ever going
30:08 to be a Christian crusade in the world
30:10 they should just be able to make phone
30:12 calls to every single Church on planet
30:14 earth and say wherever you see hierarchy
30:17 tear it down which means the Vatican
30:20 would go really fast right because the
30:22 Pope is the Jesus on earth because
30:25 Michelangelo faked the painting of Jesus
30:27 or painted a painting excuse me of Jesus
30:29 giving the key to the Pope and from that
30:31 point forward the Pope was anointed by
30:33 God through a painting through a
30:34 fictional cartoon that's why we have
30:37 sort of the
30:41 the final moment where that took off and
30:44 became bona fide let's talk about free
30:47 will for just a few minutes here
30:52 freewill is sort of an interesting
30:54 concept because it's something that a
30:56 child can barely understand if you sat
30:58 down an eight-year-old and and you were
31:00 the most articulate person on planet
31:02 earth it would be very tough to really
31:04 get the eight-year-old I believe unless
31:06 they're a prodigy to understand the true
31:10 nature of freewill and I think that the
31:13 reason why would be the following
31:15 although it's not exclusive to this
31:17 technique now if a child had been
31:20 grounded or what-have-you maybe it's a
31:23 little bit different but I believe that
31:25 we feel our freewill the more that it is
31:28 taken away from us and as a child you
31:31 have more free will than you'll ever
31:33 have in your entire lifetime unless you
31:34 win the lottery so as you get older and
31:37 you know let's just say just take a
31:40 child for instance what do they
31:41 experience they can experience what we
31:43 call in America the K through 12
31:45 kindergarten all the way through 12th
31:46 grade and then if they choose to get a
31:48 college degree they're still in that
31:50 system and then they have this kind of
31:51 rule system imposed on them got to get
31:54 up in this particular point in the day
31:56 eat get dressed get to school come home
31:58 to your homework and repeat the process
32:00 in college it's a little bit better
32:03 because you get to choose when you get
32:04 up in the morning when you go to school
32:06 you could skip a class they don't give a
32:08 [ __ ] you start to take the final but as
32:12 a child which would be anyone who's just
32:14 been in college your whole life I never
32:15 had a real job you get outside and
32:19 you're sort of thinking well gee I
32:20 wonder what this is going to be like how
32:23 free am I going to be
32:24 and very quickly you realize that your
32:27 academic prowess dictates what kind of
32:30 job you can get at what pay you can get
32:32 and that completely and utterly
32:34 determines your free will and so then
32:38 you might have a few regrets if you
32:40 goofed off in school maybe you get smart
32:43 and pull up YouTube and learn everything
32:45 you didn't learn in school and give
32:47 yourself a new profession but you start
32:51 to feel
32:53 you know I forget what the the whole the
32:56 old folktale was the one where the giant
32:58 is caught by all the little people and
32:59 they and they put all the you know the
33:03 wires and and stakes in the ground to
33:05 hold him down I forgot what that story's
33:07 name is I apologize but you know I'm
33:09 talking about so the idea is that's sort
33:12 of how life feels when you let it happen
33:14 to you when you're the pinball and the
33:16 pinball machine you have no control over
33:18 the bumpers kickers and flippers and
33:20 it's just sort of telling you what to do
33:22 constantly you know like that movie
33:25 office space right in fact the movie
33:28 office space is a great film to really
33:30 drive this home it was made by a Mike
33:33 judge who did beavis and butthead and
33:37 king of the hill and all those
33:39 incredible cartoons but the whole thing
33:41 is that a bunch of workers hate their
33:43 job at some software in a tech company
33:46 and they're just trying to find as much
33:50 free will as they possibly can in
33:52 between having to go to work so when
33:54 they come home they try to enjoy a
33:55 weekend they try to enjoy it but this
33:56 boss keeps coming in to them they got to
33:58 work over the weekend and it just gets
34:00 to a point where one of the guys flips
34:03 it's super funny movie a child you know
34:08 when you try to when they're it's time
34:11 to go to bed or something even if you're
34:12 just playing when you have to grab them
34:14 and move them to a new location either
34:16 to get them into bed or whatever and
34:18 then they might you know jokingly or
34:21 seriously can struggle in your arms well
34:24 they didn't realize they weren't free
34:26 until you grabbed him but there were
34:28 going to be constraints in life right
34:30 but the thing is is that this force in
34:33 man is is utterly programmed inside of
34:37 us and it begs the question of how does
34:41 this happen how do how do are we you
34:46 know especially if you go with sort of
34:47 the Atheist view an evolutionary view
34:49 which were just all dust and atoms and
34:52 you know soon as you're dead you're out
34:53 cold it's an interesting thing that that
34:58 and that abit mass would want to get
35:02 free now what's interesting is is you've
35:03 all seen hamsters and cages you know
35:06 trying to scrape on the wall of the fish
35:07 tank trying to get the hell out of there
35:09 dogs always try to climb underneath
35:11 fences over fences cats never have any
35:14 problem because they can get out of
35:15 anything but every wild animal doesn't
35:18 want to be captive so I'm gonna put
35:21 together an assertion some of you're
35:25 going to get it right away and believe
35:26 it and so we're gonna go what so I've
35:30 been getting in you know the more
35:31 cerebral spiritual side of things and
35:34 recent episodes and I think this
35:36 dovetails beautifully into that realm
35:40 but let me throw this idea at you let's
35:44 say we do have souls and they do run
35:47 around the universe in between lifes
35:49 I think that you know my own brain
35:54 what's interesting is when I think about
35:55 being a soul flying around the universe
35:57 having fun being with people are their
36:00 souls that I know that are familiar with
36:01 me or meeting new folks or whatever it
36:03 is right maybe gods created an infinite
36:05 playground that for the most part is
36:07 infinite wonderful and heaven there is
36:10 no negativity because he's created so
36:12 many flavors of ice cream you'll never
36:14 run out it's quite possible right but
36:18 have you ever thought about big fish in
36:21 the ocean like whales fish they can
36:25 really dive deep you know they can't go
36:28 all the way the bottom the ocean or
36:29 anything but man that is an amazing
36:33 oasis for them where unlike a bird that
36:36 has to flap a wing as long as they keep
36:38 oxygen inside their lung systems which
36:40 you know for whales it's different than
36:43 normal fish there are just an infinite
36:47 sea literally of space of life just as
36:51 long as you know some folks don't poach
36:55 them but now imagine that that whale was
36:59 turned into a human being and stuck on
37:01 the surface and they try to go in the
37:02 water and it's a little tougher to swim
37:04 around because you're not a fish anymore
37:05 they're used to breathing oxygen but
37:08 immediately a whale would be in a
37:10 human's body and gum and this sucks
37:12 I can't just swim around and sort of fly
37:14 within the medium that is the ocean well
37:18 what if we are soul
37:19 at the core the third eye is nothing
37:22 more than a people into the universe and
37:26 that you know chemically speaking they
37:28 can give us all kinds of metal dusts and
37:30 scrip the pineal gland and then you no
37:32 longer if you look through the people
37:33 because they've kind of put dirt over
37:34 the hole right but if we have you know
37:39 infinite centuries of being out there in
37:42 the universe floating around and
37:44 enjoying just being wherever we want to
37:47 be being whoever we want to be
37:49 spiritually it's just blissful and
37:51 wonderful and then we become a mortal
37:55 coil for whatever reason you know it
37:58 could be that this is a ride in a in
38:01 amusement park it could it could just be
38:03 over you played earth oh yeah no I've
38:05 done I've done Mars that was kind of
38:07 boring now Earth's way better man
38:09 instead of just being a microbe you're
38:10 like these crazy wild human beings
38:13 really oh my god right but you're gonna
38:18 get a finished arrive once you go in you
38:19 know you're gonna forget you're gonna
38:21 forget this world when you're going
38:23 because otherwise it gets messy yeah
38:24 that makes sense
38:25 all right so boomer born but because
38:30 we're born usually pretty intoxicated
38:34 fairly quickly after birth we can feel
38:37 it we can see it and freewill could be
38:42 nothing more than an echo to our
38:46 previous existence the freedom that we
38:49 enjoyed from a previous existence what
38:52 makes things right and wrong well
38:54 because the frequency of Rights has a
38:57 feeling and the frequency of wrong has a
39:00 much different feeling and because when
39:04 we're out there as souls floating around
39:06 the universe you don't create negativity
39:09 it's not a part of that world and so the
39:13 only thing that we're doing to
39:15 understand right from wrong is to
39:17 basically say that there's a contrast
39:19 between where we were and where we are
39:21 now where we spend most of our time and
39:24 this infinitely short life which we call
39:26 humanity right have you ever wondered
39:30 that well let me put this way have you
39:33 ever
39:33 wonder what would happen if you could
39:36 convince the world of the same exact
39:39 concept everyone could just see what
39:43 can't be unseen the love that loves you
39:46 get when you take LSD with some good
39:47 people in a good location once you
39:50 experience that you realize and it Maya
39:52 Waskom might be the same way I don't
39:54 know but you just realized that there's
39:57 a bigger picture going on a much bigger
40:02 picture it's not just a bunch of
40:04 microbes on the surface of a planet
40:06 it is a huge universe of lifeforce and
40:12 everyone normally gets along when you're
40:16 not inside this mortal coil when you're
40:19 not indoctrinated and dumbed down but
40:22 those of you who have awakened I know
40:26 that you you feel this virtually every
40:30 day at least several times a week where
40:33 you go out into public
40:35 you have great conversations with great
40:37 people who are good people and you know
40:40 you realize that there's this sort of
40:42 assembly line this trough of kind of
40:46 lowbrow conversations and then you
40:49 realize at the end of the conversation
40:51 even if it lasts a couple hours nothing
40:53 profound or remotely interesting was
40:55 ever spoken and you feel like the time
40:59 in your life was pretty much wasted and
41:03 maybe during a two-hour conversation if
41:05 you can if you can last that long
41:07 you try to you know offer some threads
41:12 in the sweater to maybe have a more
41:14 intellectual conversation a deeper
41:16 conversation one of more enlightenment
41:18 to get to some of those Ferengi ideas
41:20 just to see what they think about it but
41:22 they can't conceive of what you're
41:23 talking about
41:25 for them it's all official story and
41:28 they haven't heard of an alternate
41:31 theory they haven't rejected an
41:32 alternate theory they've just always
41:34 lived in the official story because
41:36 their family is just giddy and happy and
41:39 there's no need to question anything and
41:41 at some point you can get sort of you
41:45 know
41:46 disappointed I would say that we have
41:51 these mechanisms inside our minds that
41:55 limit what we can see most of you have
41:59 talked to a person in their 60s who also
42:01 has this sort of thing and that's
42:03 typically where you find them you know
42:04 60 and up starting it into your deep
42:06 baby boomer era and you start to realize
42:09 well of course they don't see it you
42:14 know they were the gullible children of
42:16 the depression age parents and their
42:20 parents gave them everything they
42:22 possibly could to protect them from bad
42:24 things not realizing that the worst
42:27 things that were going to happen to our
42:28 nation were after the depression but if
42:31 it isn't a parent already or hasn't been
42:34 a parent already from every episode of
42:38 made for like the last say three months
42:41 what I failed to say but I've insinuated
42:45 it and talked about it in kind of little
42:48 microcosms is to say if I say
42:50 sovereignty to an average sort of
42:53 minuteman sort of militia guy here in
42:55 America they immediately get into the
42:58 mode of you know all the secret
43:01 societies that are against America all
43:03 the bankers that are against America all
43:05 the bought off politicians bought off
43:06 generals etc corporatism they see sort
43:11 of a very violent need to react to
43:14 protect and they're willing to do it and
43:16 they're trained to do it okay but let me
43:19 give you a slightly bigger picture I
43:23 always say the word ecosystem I talk
43:25 about you know what life is and because
43:28 I you know technically speaking when you
43:31 just do some basic math on paper if
43:33 there is anything that we call a unit of
43:35 energy a quantum packet of energy you
43:39 can't get rid of it or hide it
43:42 in the universe it simply always is once
43:45 it is made it is now my transform into
43:48 different forms here and there but we
43:52 get into this this sort of basic
43:54 understanding that if you have any
43:56 organized energy right we look at our
43:59 bodies and our bodies are organized
44:01 energies these are these rolling
44:03 vortexes of ether winds that create
44:05 particles that create us and we say oh
44:08 my gosh you know I don't want to lose
44:10 this body because then I lose in my life
44:12 and that soul thing that you keep
44:14 talking about well that's just hanging
44:15 on by a dear thread it needs the body to
44:18 stay intact and it wants my body dies
44:21 this soul faint just you know diffuses
44:23 into the universe I ceased to exist
44:26 entirely obviously a lot of you don't
44:29 believe that but what I want to throw
44:33 into your mind is there is no difference
44:35 between the cohesion and intelligence of
44:38 the body and the cohesion and the
44:40 intelligence of something else that we
44:41 might call the soul that operates on
44:43 something different than perhaps ether
44:45 winds maybe again it reflects ether
44:49 winds itself or it is affected by e
44:52 throw winds but we have this soul that
44:55 goes in this perpetual loop forever and
44:58 ever and ever and the loop can go all
45:01 over the place it gets to enjoy the
45:03 definition of infinity infinity is the
45:05 utter gift to the soul because it needs
45:08 it because it won't die so if I can get
45:12 you to think about it like this the
45:15 playground we spend the most time in is
45:17 not in this body it's out there it's out
45:20 there in the universe we get to see
45:25 infinity we get to see all knowledge
45:27 when we get to see how it is fascinating
45:30 and interesting and we get to understand
45:31 why we have to forget it all so that we
45:34 don't go absolutely berserk or you know
45:36 just kind of get to this stalemate of
45:38 Nirvana which is held by any other name
45:42 but if we're going in this loop of being
45:45 spiritual and being physical and being
45:47 spiritual and being physical you know
45:49 you can insert God right there and the
45:51 you really get to see his face and hang
45:54 out with them when you get to the
45:55 spiritual side
45:56 then when you go into your body you know
45:58 for a fact because you have a third eye
45:59 because you have the sense of the rest
46:01 of the universe if you acknowledge it
46:03 you have this constant communication
46:06 with God because without his or her
46:09 participation in your life you would
46:11 cease to exist the program wouldn't run
46:12 for you the particles wouldn't be there
46:14 for you the sustainer is God if you
46:19 think of it in this giant loop then I
46:22 think a lot of these worries that we
46:24 have about being alive and being
46:27 successful and whatever changes quite a
46:31 bit my daughter and I played World of
46:34 Warcraft back when she was younger for
46:36 years he said quest together and have a
46:39 blast
46:39 and so I am I'm a character she's a
46:43 character and we go fight you know
46:46 bosses and fight whatever and there'd be
46:49 some times where she would get killed in
46:51 the game and then you turn into a ghost
46:54 and you walk back to your body and you
46:55 can resurrect it's real easy now as a
46:59 father seeing your kid get knocked down
47:02 and even a metaphor is something that
47:04 you get defensive about and you'll just
47:07 slaughter whoever did it right and
47:08 sometimes I would die and she'd do the
47:10 same but here's the big difference I
47:13 want to shove into your mind
47:14 I knew my kid didn't die once she's in
47:17 the room with me but - she is walking
47:19 back to her body I can see it in the
47:21 ghostly realm and she resurrects all
47:26 right think about the difference of
47:29 losing a child in a world where you know
47:31 that reincarnation is a part of the game
47:33 and then think about losing a child in a
47:35 world where you don't have any beliefs
47:37 maybe simply because you haven't gone
47:39 the distance and thinking or it just
47:42 hasn't been explained in any way that
47:43 you can kind of keep it in your mind
47:46 right I once had a fairly selfish
47:50 thought which was what if you get what
47:53 you asked for
47:54 if you're an atheist like curse well he
47:58 dies and he just disappears whatever
48:02 however it is his soul is reused
48:06 intentionally you basically have this
48:08 gift
48:09 from God that you get what you asked for
48:11 so all the atheists of the world are
48:13 sort of a dying species they'll just
48:15 disappear a go to nothing and there's
48:18 nothing there no I don't think that's
48:19 the way it works but it's a it's an it's
48:21 an interesting idea for those of you who
48:23 believe that there's something after
48:25 this world you get the heaven that you
48:29 can conceive of or if you say hey I
48:32 absolutely don't know what heaven is I
48:35 can't wait to find out then you get that
48:39 reality and God takes care of the game
48:42 God entertains after you're gone because
48:45 you've put in some some serious years as
48:48 a human being the urgency for an atheist
48:51 to do everything before they die would
48:53 be utterly bone-crushing ly intense I
48:56 would say the more enlightened you are
48:58 the only thing you could do being an
49:01 atheist and calming down would be to say
49:03 well I just
49:04 I'm gonna go humdrum through this life I
49:07 won't really create that much or maybe
49:09 you already got lucky and you did and so
49:11 you feel finished and then it's sort of
49:13 like and then you die that's it in your
49:17 mind there's no crescendo at the end of
49:19 life it's sort of depressing tragedy to
49:21 your story
49:22 I see the whole thing as this beautiful
49:27 loop and you know I don't think that
49:30 humanity is the only thing we can be
49:32 alive in right and I don't think that
49:35 being outside of a human body is somehow
49:37 less that being in a human body
49:40 sometimes you might need you are gonna
49:41 say well of course if you're in heaven
49:43 boy you're the ultimate version of
49:45 yourself
49:45 hey you're actually right how could you
49:49 not be right no limitations I think the
49:54 big question is of whether or not we are
49:59 one step from God or one step from
50:02 another being something we don't really
50:05 get into this is sort of this is sort of
50:10 at the subatomic mechanics of freewill
50:12 which is why I'm bringing this up but
50:15 for those who do DMT and the folks that
50:17 I've heard I've done DMT twice through
50:19 salvia and took a small hit once in a
50:22 heart you
50:23 [ __ ] the second time the huge hit boy it
50:25 put me in a world where I was I was
50:29 floating in a room was by 10 by 10 room
50:31 sort of an old sort of Midwestern kind
50:34 of room no furniture whatsoever it's
50:36 kind of beige walls white molding wood
50:38 floor and I was actually sitting on my
50:41 sofa right inside that house and I'd
50:44 taken this huge hit on this stuff and I
50:46 was scared of it to begin with because
50:48 I'd seen some horrific videos and I had
50:50 not heard of all the dmt associations I
50:52 didn't know that what I was experiencing
50:53 was DMT but I was all a sudden sort of
50:58 floating in the middle of the room lying
50:59 down with my eyes open and there were
51:02 two elliptical kind of wire meshes that
51:05 were banging into each other and I was
51:07 the I was the current that was in
51:10 between them these two things combining
51:13 be created me and I just sat there and
51:16 it was clear as day it's amazing I have
51:19 had the as I mentioned in previous
51:21 episodes I've had the sleep paralysis
51:23 situation where I wake up and I'm
51:25 paralyzed but I'm awake and I have this
51:27 very distinct feeling that a being is
51:30 looking at me I get the very distinct
51:32 feeling it would be something I would
51:33 call an alien nothing bad no reptilian
51:37 you know slithering and drooling on me
51:39 like a Sleestak but more of sort of what
51:42 they would talk about you know the more
51:44 stoic gray type aliens except it feels
51:46 much taller than a grey but shorter than
51:49 a beige like a human sized grey and I
51:56 know that sounds weird but that's just
51:57 the feeling I've had and I've always
51:59 associated with dreaming I will lay my
52:04 head down at night and when sometimes
52:05 I'll be just drifting off you know you
52:07 almost drift off but you kind of swing
52:09 back for whatever reason and at that
52:11 point I have what looks like someone
52:14 putting a pin light in my eye like a
52:16 doctor checking your their dilation
52:18 right
52:18 and it's usually off to one of the sides
52:21 of my eyes spectrum and I don't know if
52:23 it's some sort of discharge of
52:25 electricity through my visual cortex
52:26 just due to sleep but it's a really kind
52:30 of warm Sun ish light and what's very
52:32 fascinating about this this happened to
52:34 me two days ago
52:36 and this light came into my left side of
52:40 my peripheral vision over here and my
52:42 eyes are probably looking almost
52:43 diagonally that way anyway but I thought
52:46 that I just see this as a chemical
52:47 discharging in my eye and I'm doing so
52:50 much eye research right now it's crazy
52:52 and especially related to cones and rods
52:55 and resolutions and different types of
52:58 lighting and what was interesting was
53:02 this you know if I were to take a a
53:04 flash from a camera and say look at this
53:06 and you turn around I go pop and I hit
53:08 you with the flash you have that burned
53:10 into your eyes you know at night when
53:12 you see someone with their brights on it
53:14 blinds you you will in their pass to you
53:16 like god damnit they got the brights on
53:18 and I can't see the cars in front of me
53:20 this thing blew out my cones
53:23 I had the you know the impression in my
53:29 eye after it was over that these things
53:32 did you know we're exposed to light now
53:34 again it could be some sort of reaction
53:36 warp my cones and my rods did have some
53:39 form of depletion just because I laid
53:42 down maybe a little blood pressure
53:44 adjustment caused this to occur I don't
53:48 have any high blood pressure in fact if
53:50 anything I've got low blood pressure but
53:54 digression off what if the next layer up
53:56 from our reality are aliens what we
54:01 would call aliens perhaps they are us
54:02 and we take this avatar which is a human
54:05 being and whatever they are is what we
54:07 become and let's say we're an experiment
54:10 or inside of a game or inside some
54:11 almost self-preservation loop ourselves
54:15 within a physical body and then when we
54:17 wake up out of this we still believe in
54:19 God but it's some other etheral thing
54:22 over what we end up being we don't like
54:25 to think about that in my opinion we
54:26 like to think that once we're out of the
54:29 mortal coil that we're in this beautiful
54:30 world and all indications are from
54:32 people if ëthis after you know after
54:34 death their near-death experiences that
54:35 this is what they experience but now
54:38 let's go back into the gritty grind of
54:41 sovereignty versus freewill and how we
54:43 might live our lives on a daily basis if
54:47 you're a parent
54:49 the algorithm goes from well you're
54:51 trying to figure out life and maybe it's
54:53 good maybe it's bad but at least it's
54:55 just you suffering right once you have a
54:59 kid if you at least intended to have a
55:01 child or you like the fact that it
55:03 happened which is what I wish for you
55:07 you then have to protect the child and
55:12 there's it's like a Russian doll right
55:14 so you have to protect them from putting
55:15 their fingers and sockets banging their
55:17 head on coffee tables all the way up to
55:19 they want to walk outside and play in
55:21 the grass and you're trying to figure
55:22 out well is your front yard a safe place
55:24 do you even have a front yard do you
55:26 take your kid to a park where there's a
55:28 bunch of kids of all different types of
55:31 you know social classes education and
55:33 then maybe one kid wants to touch your
55:36 daughter in the wrong way or beat your
55:37 kid up in the face because they have
55:39 problem at home getting beat up other
55:41 parents or their brothers or whatever
55:42 what they think is fun you think it's
55:44 horrific
55:45 etc etc but then as they get older and
55:48 you start watching the fact and you get
55:50 older you start looking at the fact that
55:51 the country that you live in is a
55:55 constant job it's like a good marriage
55:57 it's constant here you're always being
56:01 tested one way or the other there are
56:05 super highs and maybe a couple lows here
56:08 in there hopefully no super lows for you
56:11 at that point you have this sort of
56:14 massive Epiphany of what needs to be
56:19 done and because we aren't raised in a
56:22 non empathetic functional manner to run
56:25 the world like the a lot of the elites
56:27 raise their children you struggle
56:30 immediately because you're going to have
56:33 two trains of thought to try and manage
56:36 sovereignty you're going to have the
56:39 preservation of freewill but then you're
56:43 gonna find out folks want things in
56:45 their freewill cabinet that is not what
56:48 they are really entitled to or what
56:50 society or the world can furnish them
56:52 how many people just want to live off
56:55 the dole I didn't know this but I was
56:59 just bumping through some videos the
57:01 other day and George
57:02 michael series came up about i was like
57:05 this called as a BBC documentary called
57:07 his last days or the last days or
57:10 whatever it's it's fairly decent and i
57:13 didn't know that because i didn't know
57:14 about this guy until he started hitting
57:16 the major airwaves right but i guess
57:18 when he was a kid he did this rap we in
57:21 the mid 80s and it was about the fact
57:23 that in britain it was very easy to get
57:26 on social security kind of welfare
57:29 payment systems even if you had money in
57:31 your house and your parents had money
57:32 you could just pop out of school and
57:34 immediately live off the state and his
57:37 whole thing was his disgust with the
57:39 fact that people were doing this I think
57:40 his bandmate the brunette dude from Wham
57:43 was doing this so he could become a
57:45 musician so it worked out in the end he
57:47 generated a lot of money for the state
57:48 in the end but I'm sure he's the
57:53 exception right but let's say you're
57:56 trying to manage the situation
57:58 sovereignty is an amazing sort of
58:01 infinite responsibility because no
58:04 matter where you are in the chain of
58:05 command trying to manage it for yourself
58:07 or for others there's always a higher
58:09 level free will can very easily be
58:13 indoctrinated and manipulated into
58:15 entitlement and entitlement is where
58:18 someone starts to take a hell of a lot
58:20 more than their fair share and they feel
58:23 righteous doing so super tough algorithm
58:28 to manage so you know I think this
58:32 conversation has immense value from the
58:35 charter of this show which is to rebuild
58:36 society from the bottom up again if we
58:39 are privileged enough to take back this
58:40 planet we have to have had thousands of
58:44 hours of conversation right on this
58:46 subject matter to figure out how we're
58:48 going to convince the corrupted who have
58:51 lived under the previous regime to
58:54 correct themselves and to believe in
58:56 that correction to go from entitlement
58:58 to what they are actually entitled to
59:02 because it's tough at the top you know
59:06 is this event in America
59:07 right after Thanksgiving it's called
59:10 Black Friday we usually have our
59:12 Thanksgiving I can't remember it's a
59:15 Thursday or when
59:15 today but there you have this like
59:17 really long week off but you have say a
59:23 retail place that we call Target it's
59:26 usually the epicenter of hell and
59:28 damnation but you have all these people
59:31 that come to target on a daily basis and
59:33 they're cool they just get the cart they
59:36 walk around slowly they find what they
59:37 need they walk in line they're all happy
59:39 but Black Friday is a very special day
59:42 where they don't have to engage any
59:44 level of humanity they get to be scum
59:47 bags they all pile in at the door
59:50 because there's all these specials and
59:52 of course the the folks with the the
59:56 biggest financial challenges are seeing
59:59 this is a unique opportunity to get
60:00 things they couldn't normally afford
60:02 thousand dollar TV might be 200 bucks
60:04 and so jeez you know you got to have
60:07 that for their family because they're
60:08 envisioning in their mind all this
60:09 positivity by having this object the
60:12 doors open and you have a stampede I
60:16 heard old people get trampled young
60:20 people get trampled even if that's
60:22 avoided wants to get to the the items
60:25 that are stacked up there now literally
60:28 fighting over the boxes they get in
60:31 fistfights they say things they
60:33 shouldn't say and just like when you
60:36 overtake someone on the highway and flip
60:38 them off now you're in front of them and
60:41 they're behind you which means you have
60:42 the disadvantage good job
60:44 but that cynicism if you're one of the
60:47 people who's coming in to behave like a
60:49 normal human being and you see this sort
60:51 of mob rules insanity you lose faith in
60:56 society there was a recent video of a
61:01 bunch of ghetto kids who went into a
61:03 convenience store in Florida and they
61:06 rush inside the stores probably about
61:08 eight of them and they pour themselves a
61:11 bunch of link slushies or whatever and
61:13 then they walk to the center area of the
61:15 convenience store throw it all on the
61:17 ground and then sort of body surf on the
61:20 slush unbelievably bizarre moment but
61:25 they did it because in a crowd they
61:27 couldn't be stopped as easily
61:29 and really the violation is they stole a
61:31 few drinks and they made a mess it's the
61:34 product I'm doing a jail time even if
61:36 the cop was standing right there once
61:40 you see that you lose faith in society
61:43 that these kids could be manufactured by
61:46 parents and that they could go in and
61:49 literally rob a store of its profit now
61:53 of course when you take it back up to
61:55 corporations I might own the story like
61:56 eff them whatever they deserve it but
62:00 there are people trying to earn a living
62:02 in that same establishment which might
62:04 lose their job by an [ __ ] manager
62:07 goes why didn't you stop them when
62:08 there's really no way to stop them right
62:10 if you've ever been involved with
62:12 educational systems whatsoever you'll
62:14 understand that in order to change those
62:17 kids that walked in there you can't deal
62:20 with them at the point where they're
62:21 they're being jerks I mean you could
62:24 punish them maybe one or two kids
62:26 actually get it and go man that was
62:27 stupid I was being a jerk I just got up
62:30 and got caught up on what my other six
62:32 friends were doing eccentric cetera but
62:35 the thing we have to do in this world is
62:37 to educate and discuss these sort of
62:40 subliminal subtextual subdermal subjects
62:45 such that we can have such a kids can
62:48 ask the question you can put the
62:50 question in your child so they can hear
62:52 it back
62:53 now obviously the sad fact is is that
62:56 the kids sometimes they're mentally
63:02 incapable of understanding what you're
63:03 saying because they've never been raised
63:05 properly from the bottom up you may have
63:08 woke up as a parent and your kids are in
63:10 their mid-teens and you're realizing oh
63:12 my god I myself was ignorant to these
63:14 things and now I've been enlightened I
63:17 want to pass this to my kids but I'm
63:19 already you know the old fart they don't
63:21 want to listen to where it's going to
63:23 take ten years for them to start
63:25 listening to you one of the most
63:28 interesting facts about Americans is
63:31 that if you were to go up to the average
63:33 American and say what is tyranny they
63:36 have no idea what that word means and
63:40 isn't it interesting that the word that
63:42 locks down the app
63:43 that would enslave them as the word they
63:45 don't understand exists or they know it
63:48 exists but they don't know what it means
63:51 how fast can you indoctrinate a person
63:54 when they don't know the nomenclature
63:57 used to have a conversation about being
64:00 enslaved you ever been in a public place
64:03 where someone speaks the language you
64:04 don't understand and they're just
64:05 talking loops around you to their family
64:07 to their friends you don't know if
64:08 they're saying horrible things about you
64:10 or good things about you're not talking
64:12 about you at all you don't know well if
64:15 all the words that we use like
64:17 sovereignty and tyranny and freedom and
64:20 Republic and what that means in a little
64:23 rites if they don't know what those
64:26 phrases or words mean then they are
64:28 unable to be enlightened to it and it's
64:33 super duper sad right all of our
64:36 homework is the following we have to
64:39 somehow weave into conversation perhaps
64:41 without a giant agenda over it these
64:43 words these concepts may be in a
64:46 complimentary way you're just kind of
64:48 bouncing off a conversation note you're
64:50 not gonna go negative you're just gonna
64:51 say well that's why I like the
64:52 forefathers because they really
64:53 understood the oppression of tyranny you
64:56 know what tyranny is you know that I did
64:58 it and you know that's why we have to
65:00 maintain our sovereignty and adults the
65:03 counter force to tyranny and you know
65:05 what's interesting about it we've it's
65:07 all fueled by free will boom boom boom
65:09 boom you know I was thinking maybe the
65:12 soul and the human body and you start to
65:15 describe the ecosystem to them and you
65:17 start to give them a picture in their
65:19 brain that they can easily recall when
65:21 the subject matter comes up I think you
65:24 feel me I think we're all in the same
65:26 page anyway it's just the methodology to
65:30 expose it to educate it to proliferate
65:33 it in our society well that's what we're
65:35 we're up against let's increase the
65:39 conversation complexity just a little
65:41 bit and then just a little bit more and
65:43 then just a little bit more until the
65:45 day we die the thing that I will tell
65:48 you that's a secret sauce to get anyone
65:49 to listen to you is essentially say do
65:53 you think the world is perfect
65:56 if you think the world is even remotely
65:57 acceptable the way that it's put
65:59 together today do you think fairness is
66:02 everywhere or nowhere alright I have a
66:07 question I always ask people that you
66:09 might want to use and you say in your
66:10 entire life and this is better if you
66:12 can ask someone over 50 in your entire
66:15 lifetime what laws have passed that
66:18 benefitted you the only two I ever hear
66:21 mentioned is the civil rights movement
66:23 of the 60s for America and seatbelts
66:26 that's it you might be able to throw a
66:30 minimum wage but come on can anyone
66:32 really afford to live off minimum wage
66:34 no not even if you make it 15 bucks an
66:36 hour it's a joke so when you get them to
66:40 see sort of the Paradoxal gain that
66:42 they've been sold the illogical you know
66:45 again cognitive dissonance formulas this
66:49 cut in these two concepts that are sold
66:51 to be congruent with each other which
66:54 are diabolical are you know
66:56 diametrically opposed forces then you've
67:01 got a conversation going because you've
67:03 also what you've also done is taught
67:04 then the formula of [ __ ] and that's
67:07 important once they can start seeing the
67:11 doublespeak then they start seeing all
67:13 of the contrary formulas that is reality
67:18 today right anybody wants to throw like
67:22 global warming at me aside from the
67:25 science it doesn't support it you have
67:27 the two biggest polluters in the world
67:29 that are absolved from any
67:30 responsibility so what the [ __ ] is the
67:32 point of lecturing me if in a first
67:35 world country a place that has scrubbers
67:38 on our manufacturing silos we barely put
67:42 out anything
67:43 we've got electric cars now replacing
67:45 fuel cars on a daily basis you know I'm
67:48 gonna tell you right now in Southern
67:50 California we're probably 15 to 20
67:52 percent either pure electric are pure
67:54 hybrid cars and it the numbers growing
67:58 every single day we will be damn near
68:00 emission free and twenty years I think
68:03 will be utterly emission free in 20
68:05 years so what's the point in panicking
68:06 right now just let the natural cycle
68:08 happen
68:09 so I think that's it hopefully that did
68:12 it some justice it's just again a lot of
68:14 these episodes will go on for over an
68:15 hour and some change but in the end I've
68:17 just scratched the surface and that's
68:20 usually my opinion of about 90% of the
68:21 episodes as we just sort of got the
68:23 conversation going so hopefully you guys
68:28 can take it the whole distance in the
68:30 comments conversations with your friends
