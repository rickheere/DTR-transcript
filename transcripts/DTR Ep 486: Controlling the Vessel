00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts well it's actually fairly
00:34 warm April evening it's technically the
00:39 morning of the 13th today we're going to
00:42 do an episode which I hate to say the
00:46 title just in case I want to change it
00:47 but the current title my mind is
00:51 controlling the vessel somebody hit you
00:55 with an idea that I think that people
00:59 would reject initially but perhaps if
01:07 you give it a just a little bit of
01:09 thought you will have to concede that as
01:13 much as we want to say oh I totally
01:15 controlled my life I control you know
01:17 everything I think I totally control
01:19 everything I feel I totally control what
01:22 I want to be awake I'm just a week when
01:23 I want to be tired I just get tired you
01:25 know you just totally control everything
01:26 and they're obvious answer is we don't
01:31 we don't actually control this vessel at
01:37 all we control a little bit and the way
01:42 I always look at these situations is one
01:44 I'm going to talk to a bunch of you at
01:47 different ages and so depending on how
01:50 old you are you will have more and more
01:52 control until perhaps your vessel starts
01:56 to age and maybe you know depending on
01:58 your age you guys are probably pretty
02:00 old you within lose control we all lose
02:03 control after a while right depends yeah
02:08 I'm not really talking about the
02:10 physical of those there's an element to
02:12 it but what always gets me about these
02:15 subjects is that we don't acknowledge
02:19 these kind of things we don't really
02:21 conversate about these things and I
02:24 think for a large group of us we don't
02:26 conceive of these sorts of things well
02:29 you're just human and isn't you know
02:31 life's a [ __ ] and then you die those
02:32 kind of statements and those statements
02:34 for me mean it's it's you know you don't
02:37 have total control if you did have total
02:39 control over your vessel then you would
02:41 be the smartest person in the world
02:42 you'd be the most productive person in
02:45 the world you would never be angry
02:48 probably because you would be in total
02:50 control and they would be in total
02:51 control ill-gotten gains well that would
02:55 be only a parlor trick to create a
02:58 little bit of tension and excitement and
02:59 drama on purpose because a lot
03:04 stuff you know people taking advantage
03:06 of you that's usually someone who's
03:07 greedy but they're also lazy lazy feeds
03:11 greedy why why should I work really hard
03:14 when I can steal it from somebody else
03:15 that kind of thing but now imagine it's
03:20 a a thousand years from now and these
03:24 sorts of things have been well
03:25 understood and now we raise our children
03:29 let's just say with a lot more data
03:33 about what it's like to be a human being
03:36 all the stuff I've ever talked about on
03:38 the show which I say you know look
03:40 there's no owners manual it's a life you
03:43 know there's no manual on how to do
03:44 anything all right
03:46 well I'm hoping then in several hundred
03:49 years from now the conversations are
03:51 deep thoughts will seem like almost
03:53 ridiculous thoughts like absurdly
03:58 obvious thoughts right but just in case
04:01 you know this is something that's
04:02 interesting to you because I think that
04:05 there are so many things that we do to
04:08 try and gain control of our lives in
04:12 terms of controlling our insides for any
04:17 of you've ever been angry and then after
04:19 you were angry you were like embarrassed
04:22 that you lost control that's one of
04:25 those moments anytime that you acted
04:30 impulsively could be an anger thing
04:33 could be a blissful thing but you
04:35 regretted it you know you you got crazy
04:38 pregnant you know it's another one if
04:41 you could just control yourself a lot of
04:43 those things wouldn't happen your life
04:44 could be very strategic it could be like
04:47 playing a video game I want to make my
04:49 character right here and uh I'm gonna
04:51 work out and get you know totally thin
04:53 and I'm gonna make really healthy I'm
04:54 gonna do all my step ups and eat healthy
04:56 food lack of control for those of you
05:02 who are religious it's very very
05:04 important to understand how out of
05:07 control we are with our vessel what's
05:12 the story of Adam and Eve you put in a
05:15 perfect place
05:17 called the Garden of Eden a lot of this
05:20 is just a metaphor for everything else
05:22 in life so there's a lot even if you're
05:23 not religious this has value God by any
05:27 definition being a perfect being comes
05:30 down to Adam and Eve and says welcome to
05:33 the garden you know first he creates
05:34 Adam and Adam gets bored and then you
05:37 know creates Eve that's why I was a rib
05:39 count difference right but he says
05:43 there's one rule don't eat the apple
05:46 from the apple tree apparently there was
05:48 only one apple tree which must have made
05:50 it so much more curious right I mean you
05:54 could eat everything in the whole place
05:55 figs and pears and peaches and
05:59 strawberries and whatever but you can't
06:02 eat that Apple I mean seriously if you
06:04 had never eaten an apple before and you
06:06 looked at it oh my god would that look
06:07 delicious big old shiny red thing I mean
06:10 I'm assuming the ones in the Garden of
06:12 Eden it would have been really polished
06:14 up nice right what are the the reasons
06:18 why the Garden of Eden to me always made
06:20 no sense was that man was created with
06:23 choice man was not perfect like God man
06:26 therefore would have some level of
06:29 frailty and flawed nature but the other
06:33 thing is is that we're also not
06:34 regimented soldiers in the Garden of
06:37 Eden we are allowed to do anything that
06:40 we want make your choices man well what
06:45 I like to do with the story of Garden of
06:47 Eden is to get you to look at that story
06:49 on the left and then I want to show you
06:52 a Minnesota Fats pool shot on the right
06:55 there's just one ball the cue ball and
06:59 you are to hit that cue ball and it's a
07:03 special table made by God it's in the
07:06 Garden of Eden and you're gonna hit the
07:07 ball just with the lightest touch no
07:10 matter what velocity you give the ball
07:11 it's gonna maintain that speed that
07:14 velocity the entire time forever and the
07:19 game is can you get the ball to go
07:22 infinitely around the table without
07:24 going into one of the six pockets
07:27 that's getting what a pool you probably
07:30 can't do it honestly you probably can't
07:32 do it the felts gonna change things
07:35 hitting the side of the pool table wall
07:39 is gonna create a spin it's gonna change
07:41 its trajectory and then all of a sudden
07:42 think it goes in a pocket maybe you can
07:44 get it to go fifty times a hundred times
07:46 a thousand times but it's eventually
07:47 gonna go into a pocket okay well the
07:50 pool table is the Garden of Eden and the
07:53 ball is a human being that's always
07:56 gonna change course
07:59 the human is flawed no matter how many
08:02 days out of an EVO cup and didn't eat
08:04 the Apple God would know as a creator
08:09 that eventually unless you're perfect
08:12 you would you were going to eat the
08:14 apple it's the ball's gonna go into the
08:16 to the pocket that is the quintessential
08:21 genesis of this concept we have been
08:27 blessed but not being perfect at the
08:32 same time we have been cursed but not
08:34 being perfect but having this overlay of
08:38 a religion and even just straight-up
08:42 human programming religion which is do
08:44 no harm and so you have this thing of
08:48 never do any harm to anyone and
08:51 especially don't break any of these
08:52 rules you know there's the ten
08:54 commandments but there's a ton of rules
08:56 forget human rules you know at some
09:01 point you're gonna be tired something's
09:05 gonna happen maybe your kid just gets on
09:09 your nerves and you know that they have
09:11 a lot more energy than you do and for
09:13 that particular nature you try to like
09:15 honey I need you to need you to calm
09:17 down or you know really tired and so
09:20 most the time they do leave you a little
09:21 but sometimes they just keep going to
09:23 keep going maybe they're angry too maybe
09:24 they're crying and you're crying inside
09:26 you know and then maybe you flip out you
09:29 flip out on a spouse a partner a friend
09:32 he didn't mean to
09:33 you were just flawed that particular day
09:36 more so than ever because the elements
09:39 because that there's the old saying in
09:41 was alcoholic anonymous you know you
09:44 can't fix a problem unless you
09:45 acknowledge you have it
09:47 so this topic appeals to me because I
09:51 would say that I have lived the majority
09:52 of my life not being conscious of the
09:56 fact that you just don't control
09:58 everything perfectly and I will tell you
10:00 up until the point like I would say that
10:02 as soon as I gained sort of an
10:04 intellectual mind who knows when that
10:06 happened to the point I realized that
10:10 there was a factor here and what's
10:12 interesting is I realized the Adam and
10:16 Eve thing know at least a decade ago but
10:19 still had so much hubris inside myself I
10:22 didn't apply the algorithm to myself in
10:24 any long-term analysis of human behavior
10:28 meaning I realized I am flawed therefore
10:33 I have choice you know I can pick the
10:36 wrong thing if I want to I can be a jerk
10:38 if I want to and then just say oh but I
10:43 don't type you know I'm totally always
10:44 doing the right thing yeah no matter how
10:47 clean your record is unless you're mr.
10:49 Rogers you probably got some faux paws
10:54 in your life frame and that's okay and
10:58 that's the other thing we have to
10:59 realize is we're all trying here in the
11:04 last probably decade due to the internet
11:07 we're having a lot of good wisdom travel
11:10 in posts traveling memes maybe even just
11:14 general conversation with people but I
11:18 will say that another thing that's sort
11:20 of indicative of this acknowledgement
11:23 which improves our lives is to remember
11:26 and some people are so good at this I am
11:28 not terribly good at this I'm trying to
11:31 get much better at this but it goes
11:34 something like this if you were to it
11:37 like there's a bunch of videos online of
11:38 people just losing their minds now some
11:41 of them are high on methamphetamines or
11:43 something else used to be cracked back
11:45 in the days it's usually meth today it
11:48 just makes you crazy you take all your
11:50 clothes off you're running around the
11:51 neighborhood not quite talking about
11:52 that but there will be pee
11:56 that have just had it up to here you
11:58 know and they go into public and someone
12:01 steps on their toes in some fashion
12:03 former fashion metaphorically of course
12:05 and they just pop and they're just you
12:09 know it could be a racial thing someone
12:13 feels like they've been you know
12:15 discriminated against you for years up
12:18 to the point they blow up it's like that
12:20 falling down movie with Kurt Douglas he
12:22 just had enough man went to McDonald's
12:25 and he just wired breakfast and he's
12:27 just slipped past it by a few minutes
12:29 and so he just went nuts but some people
12:34 have been saying you know hey I don't
12:36 get mad at people because I don't know
12:39 what kind of day they've had and that's
12:42 very very real isn't it don't know what
12:45 kind of day some of us that so I'm gonna
12:46 be a little more chill sometimes it
12:50 turns into like people driving fast on
12:53 the highway you know you help hell if
12:56 you know some guys got a kid in the back
12:58 who's dying of something choked on
13:00 somethings at a heart attack he's gone
13:02 to seizures you have no idea and here
13:04 they are halt and ass on the highway you
13:07 think they're a maniac but they're just
13:08 going to the hospital as quickly as
13:09 possible and they don't care about
13:11 anybody else just they're driving on the
13:13 shoulder they don't care it's their kids
13:15 life their spouses life and so we could
13:19 see that not understand the context of
13:21 what was going on and then almost chased
13:23 that person down and do road rage and
13:25 they're trying to save their family
13:26 members like Freight sadly there's a
13:30 young men and their first 10 years of
13:32 driving do it to have fun and those are
13:36 the ones we typically get less patient
13:39 with right but I think that I definitely
13:45 had conversations and again I'm as
13:47 guilty as anyone but I kind of kept it
13:49 to myself but you know there's some
13:51 folks out there that if you talk about
13:53 the frailties of mankind that we all
13:56 share you know oh I don't have that and
13:59 you don't hear this totally defense
14:01 mechanism
14:03 okay you know maybe a Jeff Bezos Steve
14:08 Jobs someone who's just made it happen
14:11 their whole life yeah maybe
14:13 put anyone else in there that you admire
14:15 you might just go down there just they
14:17 could just fall down and they'd end up
14:19 standing up you know I'd be unbelievable
14:21 but for the most of us there's this lack
14:26 of control now the other thing is if
14:29 you're gonna address it within yourself
14:31 first try to let the whole concept sink
14:34 in because we're afraid of not being in
14:38 control right we're afraid if we're to
14:42 look inside ourselves and find a flaw oh
14:44 my god it's like you know looking at
14:47 your bank account balance when you're
14:48 not sure you have any money you can
14:50 develop a massive phobia I've had this
14:52 several times in my life times when I
14:53 was young even a few times when I was
14:55 older I don't want to log into my bank
14:57 don't want to log into my bank I just
15:00 hope this card keeps working you know so
15:04 we look inside and it doesn't have to be
15:07 a full inventory in one day either this
15:10 could be something that you just make a
15:12 fun game out of it's between you and
15:14 yourself so you don't have to tell
15:15 anybody that you're doing this now it
15:20 could be because this is the way it
15:22 works I think in most of us we will have
15:25 areas of our life where we have
15:26 tremendous control and other areas where
15:30 we just suck it's just so strange you
15:32 could be like you know the amount of
15:35 guys that I have met where
15:37 professionally unbelievable
15:39 professionally they just kick butt
15:42 everywhere they go
15:43 and then comes to gaining a partner
15:47 they're attracting a woman or whatever
15:50 turns them on they choked up because in
15:53 their mind they don't have the
15:55 capability to do it or whatever the
15:56 reason is and they know that if they
15:59 could just muster the control at the
16:03 nightclub at some public gathering to
16:05 walk right over there and say and I mean
16:08 to be a creeper but I just noticed you
16:11 over there just curious
16:15 and you start the conversation as I
16:19 always tell you folks for those of you
16:21 have listened to a ton of episodes I
16:23 divide life into three categories
16:25 because this is why here we are talking
16:29 about a brand new topic never talked
16:30 about it before that I know of
16:32 now it's implied with all
16:34 self-improvement episodes that we're
16:36 trying to gain gain more control over
16:37 our lives this is specifically starting
16:41 at the Freudian heed right but you have
16:46 the self family actually self work and
16:50 family because that's usually how it
16:51 happens right you are born you live a
16:55 certain number of years you finally in
16:57 your school cycle and you go out and get
16:59 a job once you get the job either very
17:04 soon after that or within a decade or
17:06 two you will find a partner most likely
17:08 and you'll figure out how to maintain
17:11 that partnership and you move in
17:14 together and you you have a partner for
17:16 the rest of your life hopefully so when
17:20 we talk about categories of control I'm
17:22 going to tell you that there are a ton
17:26 of them obviously in the self and I
17:30 haven't talked about this in a long time
17:32 so let me just repeat I absolutely adore
17:34 the way that Freud broke down the human
17:36 mind whether or not it's real or not I
17:38 think for me it makes complete sense his
17:43 three chambers of the mind which is in
17:46 my definition for those of you are
17:47 spiritual your soul and your body work
17:50 together to create an instance of a mind
17:53 which is very a very well well-oiled
17:57 theory from you know Indian gurus but
18:01 you have the it'd the it is the inner
18:04 core of your being that is sort of a
18:06 complete mystery it is sort of like a
18:09 furnace of fire that is like a fire
18:13 plasma you know it's just like one of
18:15 those little lightning balls you know
18:16 just constantly moves around and
18:18 it's sort of that everything is in there
18:22 it is the proxy to the universe in my
18:25 opinion and imagine looking into like
18:27 imagine like a crystal ball is sitting
18:31 on your table and inside that crystal
18:33 ball is all knowledge all at once
18:37 and then your participation in this
18:41 particular instance in the universe at
18:43 this particular space-time I mean you
18:46 know time is an illusion but we're
18:48 definitely here together at this time
18:49 and in a future time we won't be
18:51 together before this show ever existed
18:53 we weren't together see how it works but
18:57 over that is your your hard shell if you
19:00 will and that's your character that is
19:04 who you truly are
19:05 before anyone makes you feel like you
19:09 need to behave a different way it is
19:10 exactly the raw person that you are this
19:13 is typically how you behave by yourself
19:15 when no one's looking now some people
19:19 don't have any connection with their
19:21 character and it's a very interesting
19:22 thing it's kind of rare but do you know
19:24 those uh what was it the the movie
19:27 office space or that woman was
19:29 constantly answering the phone corporate
19:31 accounting happen to have you know
19:32 corporate Kenny how may I direct your
19:33 ground corporate again you know it's
19:35 like those kind of people or the what is
19:37 it the principal's assistant in Ferris
19:39 Bueller's Day Off that woman who plays
19:41 that characters so brilliant plays this
19:44 massively I don't know fake persona
19:48 character which is your third layer your
19:50 third layer is the character that you
19:53 play when you're with other people and
19:55 what they don't tell you at least I it's
19:59 been a long time since I read his
20:00 original work but you have multiple
20:03 personas tons of different personas
20:05 they're just ever so slight it's sort of
20:08 like having multiple personalities but
20:11 they all go by the same name and they
20:12 all know each other and they're all the
20:13 same age so you're kind of switching in
20:16 and out of your different personalities
20:17 yeah and I'll give you some examples you
20:20 talk to your best bud you BFF or your
20:23 best bud you have one more loose most
20:27 likely character you're willing to swear
20:29 a little bit we want to talk about kind
20:31 of
20:31 things that we don't talk about in
20:33 public because that's why you'll have a
20:35 best friend so you can say all those
20:36 things like it's like it's like
20:37 psychological therapy and then you talk
20:42 to an 80 year old person at a resting
20:45 home who's depending on how old you are
20:48 they could be six generations away from
20:51 you if you're 20 years old they're 80
20:53 there's six decades between the two of
20:55 you you're on best behavior
20:57 you don't swear and usually without even
21:00 trying we're trying to live in the
21:02 timeframe that they came from and so you
21:07 ever watch old movies you'll find out we
21:09 were totally different human beings back
21:11 in the 30s back in the forties back in
21:13 the 50s sadly we have become more
21:17 dishonest more manipulative and more
21:19 greedy today than ever and then you go
21:24 talk to a child a five-year-old a
21:27 four-year-old who's fragile who needs
21:30 guidance who is either very recluse
21:34 four-year-old or they're a really bold
21:37 little four-year-old you know whatever
21:39 it is it's different ways to talk to
21:42 kids and so you have these different
21:44 percent you go to work you talk to your
21:46 boss you go to work and talk to your
21:47 employees the ones that report to you
21:49 it's a whole different game right now
21:52 there's um a classic thing they talk
21:57 about in life which is sometimes you see
22:02 yourself and other people
22:03 and this happens from Mendeley when you
22:05 have children and you know the last
22:07 thing a kid wants to actually
22:09 acknowledge is that they're just like
22:10 you for some reason there's just no
22:13 honor and being like your parents what a
22:16 sad world we've created here right and
22:19 so like my kid it's so funny she's
22:22 literally becoming me slowly and slowly
22:25 over time what are the things that she's
22:26 excited about how she forms a
22:28 conversation how she likes to spend her
22:30 personal time
22:31 she's totally mean in a female body but
22:35 if I ever said yeah just like me oh my
22:37 god she barf in her mouth it's just
22:39 hilarious right but we see ourselves and
22:42 other people let's say you're
22:45 fully recovering drug addict or
22:47 alcoholic same thing and now you bump
22:50 into someone who's fresh in the game
22:53 they're deep in the game and you can
22:55 just see it you know all the triggers
22:58 all of the signs that let you know that
23:00 the person is having an issue and what's
23:03 interesting about it is we're usually
23:05 fairly excited about helping another
23:06 person depending on what kind of person
23:09 they're out there violent and dangerous
23:11 and you're just gonna be like okay see
23:12 you later I hope you work it out but you
23:16 know sometimes people come to you for
23:17 help whether they're actively going dude
23:21 I need your help or they're just coming
23:23 going oh my god
23:24 life sucks I want to kill myself and
23:26 you're like okay well sit down here with
23:29 cigar do you want here you go boom slide
23:31 up let's talk about this by the way that
23:35 happens in lounges every once in a while
23:38 I've had it on multiple occasions where
23:41 an individual multiple individuals will
23:46 come in and they'll just I'm already
23:49 done smoking a cigar and I'm like within
23:51 minutes of leaving the lounge and they
23:53 will go buy me a cigar like a really
23:56 expensive one like $20.00 cigar
23:57 something like that or more and they'll
24:00 just hear I need you to talk others I
24:02 needed someone to talk to and you're
24:04 like okay alright and I want someone
24:07 there for me when that happens to me so
24:09 yeah you're eight boom and you call
24:11 people about me like an hour too late
24:12 you know so it's easy for us to see what
24:17 I'm talking about in other people it's
24:20 not so easy sometimes to go inside
24:22 yourself and let's just say for the sake
24:25 of argument you hear me propose this
24:27 concept and like yeah yeah you know what
24:30 you're right you know the others that
24:32 thing and how do we develop a science
24:35 around identifying the individual issues
24:39 that each of us have because they're all
24:43 different again you could have total
24:46 control on something than I am
24:47 absolutely atrocious that and vice versa
24:51 I'll give you a really a silly one to
24:54 start off with the way I keep my house
24:57 clean
24:58 is to have a a complete cycle of how I
25:03 live in my house and for anyone who
25:05 lives with me it's all ubiquitous they
25:07 don't even see it
25:08 I just put my toothbrush there and I
25:12 pick it up and use it and I put it there
25:13 and I clean it up put it there right if
25:15 I'm gonna cook it's just like at this
25:17 thing if I'm gonna sit in the front
25:18 bring my food in the front I got just
25:20 little rules you know so what but you
25:23 know say ten years ago or 20 years ago
25:26 I'd make a mess and then I'd leave it
25:29 there and then I come back and go well
25:30 you know it's my I it's my house I'm I
25:32 live by myself or whatever I'm the king
25:35 of my own frontier or whatever it is and
25:37 I will come back and I'll get it cleaned
25:39 up don't worry about it I always take
25:40 care of things right and then eventually
25:43 you find out you know there's a better
25:45 way to do it now I go to some my friends
25:47 houses and they one of my best buds go
25:52 to his place he's on different homes at
25:54 different times I first met him he had a
25:56 really big townhouse but he just cleans
26:00 constantly as we're talking worst you
26:02 know it makes us a couple Manhattan's
26:04 and yeah we're just talking chill and
26:06 catching up but he's just kind of going
26:07 in a big circle
26:08 he gets his sponge out he's wiping
26:11 something he wipes stuff down that I
26:12 don't even think is dirty and gets a
26:13 towel out and dries out the sink you
26:16 know and it's just everything is
26:17 immaculate constantly because he's just
26:19 like a little hoover constantly cleaning
26:20 up stuff but when you go inside yourself
26:24 this can be very daunting and it could
26:27 be actually a little alarming to sort of
26:30 find out how much you don't really
26:32 control because our instinct again is
26:35 never to admit such a thing you know in
26:38 some cases it would be like you know
26:41 you're completely out of control like I
26:43 just finished today we started and
26:46 finished the the tiger king thing on
26:50 Netflix cuz it just keeps going around
26:52 and we're sitting at the lounge and the
26:55 dude who owns a place just wouldn't took
26:57 a nap for a couple hours and so we've
26:59 got the first several episodes out then
27:01 he came in they didn't want to watch it
27:02 so you laughs we just just roared
27:04 through the whole thing finished it
27:05 start to finish
27:07 well that dude Joe obviously had some
27:12 massive hubris and literally had a
27:15 control problem he's in jail partially
27:19 because he couldn't control his anger
27:22 towards this woman in Florida Carol that
27:27 he just couldn't stand and you know
27:29 there's things about her I think
27:30 everybody dislikes but the thing is very
27:32 biased and a bunch of different
27:34 directions so it's a be careful about
27:35 passing judgment any in any direction at
27:38 all but you can see it in him
27:40 pick it up pick that guy apart and you
27:44 come back to yourself and you're like I
27:45 know I'm so much better and you sleep
27:47 really well at night so let's try to
27:51 dive into some of these layers of
27:54 personality and traits because it should
28:00 go without saying that if you don't have
28:01 control of your own life and I don't
28:04 mean employment things that are
28:10 circumstantial around you you don't need
28:12 to blame yourself for being unemployed
28:14 necessarily because times can get hard
28:15 or some other thing around you that's
28:18 that's affecting your life on the
28:21 outside we're talking about purely
28:22 things that if you were in a room by
28:26 yourself you're in a beautiful let's do
28:29 it this way you're in a beautiful
28:30 bungalow off the coast of Oahu Hawaii
28:34 and you just have all your bills are
28:36 paid it's all great yeah nothing just
28:38 wanted a lottery for for all intents and
28:41 purposes get some time for yourself get
28:43 the place rented for four weeks you're
28:47 just gonna sit and be with yourself I
28:49 think the number one thing I'm gonna
28:52 throw at you because this could go
28:53 anyway there's no right or wrong way of
28:54 course right I don't want to try to
28:57 introduce by inference rules that this
29:01 system has to go by cuz you know we're
29:03 all trying our best right part of it is
29:08 to find out who you are as a person
29:13 because the interesting thing that we
29:15 were gifted to by our Creator was our
29:20 own desires our own vector of what you
29:25 want to do this isn't gonna all be about
29:28 some career things don't worry but you
29:31 have desires as to who you're gonna be
29:34 in a room by yourself outside of any
29:36 money earning situation then you're
29:39 going to have depending on what you want
29:41 to experience in life a set of traits
29:47 and skills and attributes that you're
29:49 going to need to have in your character
29:50 right that you know hundred percent you
29:54 are who you are again some people have
29:56 very thin personas they don't really
29:58 believe in personas they're just who
30:00 they are constantly right but we all do
30:04 have a little bit of persona but will
30:06 stick to the character for now you have
30:09 desires of who you want to be as a human
30:11 being whether or not you know it or not
30:12 I'm gonna give you some words to
30:15 describe it some adjectives right gonna
30:19 be a good person
30:20 give me a neutral person you're gonna be
30:23 a conniving evil person you have to make
30:28 those decisions as to what kind of
30:29 person you are and what's really funny
30:31 is when you make a character and
30:33 dungeons dragons there's this alignment
30:34 table that you have to pick
30:39 there's lawful good and there's like I
30:42 forgot what it's called about unlike is
30:44 unlawful bad there's like I think nine
30:47 things you can choose in this square so
30:49 neutral neutrals right in the very
30:50 center you can swing this thing around
30:53 and that tells you as you portray this
30:55 fake character in this game this is how
30:58 you should play your character okay well
31:02 just bring it back to yourself are you a
31:04 good person is this the thing that's
31:06 important to you or are you Shane and
31:09 you're like man the worlds you know
31:11 totally out of control I'm just gonna
31:12 take care of myself and screw everybody
31:14 else hmm
31:16 so as you don't hurt anyone else that
31:17 might not be any violation of existence
31:20 so first is to desire who you would like
31:25 to be as you perceive yourself forget
31:27 people it does factor into how others
31:30 perceive you as well typically but some
31:32 of you don't care and you still have to
31:33 make the decision who do you want to be
31:37 the second tier up would be what themes
31:42 in life do you want to experience based
31:45 on your choice of who you are so if
31:48 you're good well how do you want to do
31:50 that do you want to be good because
31:52 you're an inventor you're a hermit but
31:54 you invent medicines and inventions and
31:56 you put them in the public domain or
31:58 maybe solve a reasonable price maybe
32:01 that's your game you're a product based
32:03 person some of you'll be a service based
32:05 person you want to go help people you
32:08 want to become a doctor or a nurse or a
32:10 volunteer firefighter or whatever
32:13 so the theme that you're interested in
32:16 is helping other people through direct
32:19 participation so the other one is
32:21 helping people through indirect
32:23 participation in my experience I don't
32:27 know that anyone chooses to be bad I
32:32 think choosing or I should say ending up
32:35 being a bad person is typically the
32:41 result of being abused in my earlier
32:48 years as a professional I made friends
32:51 in California and I had two very very
32:54 different friends sort of a yin and a
32:57 yang pairing they were best friends as
33:02 well so is the three of us one of them
33:09 was lawful good and one was sort of I
33:13 would say maybe neutral unlawful listen
33:18 trying to be been one of them that was
33:21 lawful good he grew up in a beautiful
33:22 household good family I mean good family
33:26 dad was super successful mom was a
33:29 stay-at-home mom his siblings were all
33:32 fantastic people but the other kid had a
33:37 mom that got strung out on drugs
33:41 and I think became a prostitute at one
33:42 point he was unable to finish high
33:45 school initially because he had to come
33:47 home to support his siblings while mom
33:50 was all jacked up and he learned the
33:54 hard way unknown of his own this is the
33:59 way life is and I've got to make
34:02 sacrifices to get what I need and
34:05 because he had to enter life way before
34:09 his time meaning before he really
34:12 graduated from high school in stone he
34:13 did graduate but I'm not sure how he did
34:16 it
34:17 he ended up being sort of a cheater
34:20 definitely cheated on women for a whole
34:23 different reason but he would always you
34:26 know he was SuperDuper lazy he's
34:30 probably a completely different human
34:32 being today in fact I think he's
34:34 successfully married down for quite so
34:36 quite a number of years now so I'm very
34:38 happy for him the one I knew him he was
34:42 the most charming guy in the world
34:44 super duper smart SuperDuper smart and
34:49 if he didn't know some he could go off
34:50 and learn it what was that kind of thing
34:51 but he was bored with life almost 24/7
34:54 and he had just learned the template of
34:57 life in a very chaotic manner and so he
35:00 was very chaotic to deal with as a
35:01 person because that's the world he grew
35:04 up in and so his lack of control was all
35:08 based on the fact that he was never in a
35:10 controlled environment to set the
35:12 template inside of him right as he's
35:14 forming the circuits in his behind to
35:16 figure out who he was as a person if it
35:20 just wasn't there my other buddy who
35:23 lived in a completely rule-based world
35:25 and you could rely on him usually a
35:29 hundred percent for any percentage he
35:32 didn't have it was just natural cause
35:34 that's right so I came in being both of
35:39 them other than I didn't have a mom
35:40 hooked on crack but I didn't I stop
35:43 living my mom I think it ten years old
35:47 but you know you got flawed parents you
35:50 got a flawed world I moved you know
35:52 seven different schools before I
35:53 graduated so I deal with all the chaos
35:55 around me but now here's the thing I
35:58 wanted to be lawful good I wanted to
36:01 help people
36:02 however I could and I was just a sponge
36:05 for knowledge so for me I was like
36:06 learning things was just is just tented
36:09 not to sex you know I like both of them
36:12 a lot right so when I get to these guys
36:16 I was like well I've been through kind
36:17 of both roads but I kind of I always
36:20 personally steered towards the best of
36:22 the best if I play a video game for
36:24 instance just to give you a profile on
36:27 me personally you know there's games
36:30 like fallout 4 and the Fallout franchise
36:32 I should say and you're always given the
36:35 chance to be a complete bastard in the
36:37 game if you want to tons of games have
36:39 this kind of you know pick pick how
36:41 you're gonna behave that the bummer is
36:43 is that the games don't seem to learn
36:45 who you are over time so I keep the door
36:48 open at all times you could just kill
36:51 somebody you know it's assume you're not
36:53 supposed to kill being a game designer I
36:56 know that once you start doing that the
36:58 games start shutting down a lot of
37:00 options that you'll never experience I
37:02 always go good cuz that keeps everything
37:03 open 24/7 but as I live my life it was
37:08 always trying to okay well that sucks
37:11 well I'm gonna fix it you know fix it
37:12 for me I can't fix it for anybody else
37:14 I'm only a kid boom boom boom you have
37:18 to figure out who you are as a person
37:20 terms of good or bad or neutral there's
37:24 really nothing wrong with neutral I just
37:27 think that there are peaks that you will
37:29 never experience if you don't pick one
37:32 of the other good or bad Bad's gonna be
37:36 a Faust relationship we're gonna sign a
37:38 contract with the devil and you're gonna
37:40 have perhaps some giant peaks like a
37:43 drug dealer or someone else cheating to
37:49 get something you know ill-gotten gains
37:51 and in most cases you lose respect for
37:53 yourself I'll just give you my own
37:54 personal experience seeing people do
37:56 this they lose respect for themselves
37:57 they lose all their friends
37:59 they lose all their money typically goes
38:01 like that and so they live very short
38:03 lives some people survive and are reborn
38:07 but that's not as common as I'd like it
38:09 to be if you strive to be good then
38:13 really the world is your oyster
38:15 you know now we see that analogy because
38:20 I don't need to waste your food next one
38:24 up is again your themes now once you
38:26 know who you are as a person who you
38:30 want to be at least your target then you
38:33 find your themes of what you want to do
38:36 then you can start moving up into the
38:39 first sector of outside of yourself
38:42 which is your work choices okay based on
38:46 who you are what kind of jobs allow you
38:48 to be who you want to be as a person and
38:51 then experience the themes that you want
38:55 experience in life because all of this
38:59 is going to lay the roadmap for our
39:01 control model of looking inside that ed
39:04 pool and going Jesus you know there's a
39:06 lot I don't really control that love to
39:09 control and then we can work towards it
39:11 right the more you get yourself situated
39:15 and you get your work aligned with
39:19 yourself you just remember you know you
39:23 can try something and it doesn't work it
39:26 doesn't satisfy those first two
39:27 directives and you just you just change
39:30 work you know especially when you're
39:32 young go through it go crazy because you
39:34 have the cheapest cost of living that
39:40 you're ever gonna have when you're young
39:42 and so you want to do everything nuts
39:44 when you're young amen if you end up
39:47 living out of your car you can do that
39:49 when you're 18 19 20 it's a lot harder
39:51 when you're 30 40 50 you can you start
39:54 looking like the guy that the cops need
39:56 to take into the through the hole to dry
39:59 out right when you finally click with
40:05 some industry whether you be
40:07 self-employed or working for someone
40:09 else whether it be a service based
40:11 lifestyle or a product
40:13 selling or making then you start to
40:16 incur your first harmonic the harmony
40:19 between the work module of your life
40:22 that work stage of your life the work
40:24 hemisphere of your life and the inner
40:25 core of who you are and life starts to
40:29 feel pretty good starts to feel pretty
40:31 cool and what that starts to do is it
40:37 starts to make you incredibly attractive
40:40 to other people not only your same sex
40:44 well I should say the opposite sex of of
40:48 that of which you are attracted to right
40:50 so the side of you not gonna marry right
40:52 it makes you attract you to that and
40:54 make sure you attract tips to the one
40:56 that's the one you want to go after
40:58 because they're gonna find a person who
41:01 is what we call centered right center
41:04 would be you're stacking up all these
41:06 rocks on a top of each other you guys
41:08 have seen that right these people stack
41:10 rocks next to rivers and you just find
41:11 he's amazing you know three or four foot
41:14 pile of like these little dinky rocks
41:16 sometimes it'll be a big boulder and a
41:17 little tiny rock and a medium size on
41:19 you like how the hell'd the gills
41:20 bounced this is crazy art people out
41:23 that's you stacking up your whole life
41:26 each one of the rocks are different each
41:28 one of the rocks are balanced
41:29 differently well that's every facet of
41:31 your beam is all stacking up just fine
41:36 because we're gonna also talk about when
41:39 things change because that's the other
41:41 non idealistic situation that we deal
41:44 with all the time look at what the 2020
41:47 he gave us right
41:48 it took the rocks and went poof and
41:51 pushed them right and then you're like
41:53 okay I stacked the first stack so I've
41:56 got the talent to stack another stack I
41:57 just don't want to but okay here we go
42:01 everybody
42:02 go someplace else like this right don't
42:04 watch me so you nail your spouse your
42:09 family you got to have a spouse but
42:11 we're gonna have family in most cases
42:12 even if you're not married you gotta
42:14 have to have someone to procreate with
42:15 now if you can master that well then
42:19 you've got his or her stack of rocks
42:22 which hopefully you're comparing your
42:25 rocks you're comparing your you
42:27 are you lawful good to because I'm not
42:28 gonna wear anybody who's you know
42:31 unlawful evil I'm not gonna do it
42:35 what drives you in life do you want to
42:37 help people in life because I can't
42:39 marry anybody doesn't want to help other
42:40 people
42:41 now some people can be completely
42:43 ridiculously unrealistically devoted to
42:50 assisting other people to the point they
42:51 don't have a life of their own when I
42:53 just coincidentally when I moved to the
42:55 Bay Area
42:56 I think she's 3 out of 4 women I talked
42:59 to when I said you know what do you want
43:01 to do with your life here I'm like this
43:02 super successful engineer and artist and
43:06 what-have-you and they go oh I'm gonna
43:08 work for a non-profit I don't look at
43:11 I'm going okay you realize the two words
43:13 you're saying is nonprofit that's what
43:15 your bank accounts gonna look like
43:16 nonprofit and every single one of them
43:20 went through however many years so they
43:23 get decades about the most my friends
43:24 went through that and they finally
43:26 realized I am broke I am 35 years old
43:29 I've got no savings no retirement and no
43:32 future that's usually how that works so
43:37 if you're able to make that work you are
43:38 a better person than myself again I had
43:42 a one of the richest people in the world
43:43 tell me would you believe me if I told
43:46 you the best way you can help another
43:49 faction of people that you think need
43:51 help is to go get a job a normal job
43:54 make as much money as possible and then
43:56 donated strategically to these people
43:59 not through foundations because they
44:00 still ninety-five cents on the dollar
44:02 but if you can get your second harmonic
44:04 which is you and in your spouse within
44:07 the family unit then boy are you ready
44:10 for kids because each child is gonna
44:13 require a separate harmonic each child
44:16 will be different so you're gonna have
44:18 to resonate to your child in a different
44:20 way learning how to communicate with
44:22 them but the funny thing is is if you
44:24 know yourself and you know your spouse
44:26 and listen closely if you know their
44:30 parents and your parents then you will
44:33 have the templates that are most likely
44:35 going to be your child's personality and
44:38 the Golden Rule
44:39 which I have
44:40 found to be so incredibly true this is a
44:43 hopscotch and personalities your child
44:46 will act like one of your parents or one
44:48 of her parents or vice versa depending
44:50 on your sex so you better know your
44:53 in-laws because your kid one of them one
44:57 of them might be just like you might be
44:58 just like your spouse and you know there
45:00 will be like one of your parents so
45:03 strange but you're gonna have to achieve
45:06 or her money and the thing is is if you
45:10 take the first two things that you had
45:12 deal with within yourself in building
45:14 your character who would you want to be
45:16 and what are your themes in life you can
45:19 start to program your child to
45:22 understand those concepts and to think
45:24 about it again the way that my family on
45:28 my surname side governed this was to
45:32 establish honor within the family name
45:36 both sides of my family had it but one
45:40 of my family my mom's side I didn't get
45:42 it from them I got it from the outside
45:44 world going oh wow you're part of that
45:45 family well they're very reputable good
45:47 people but it was never said within the
45:50 family on that side but on my dad's side
45:52 my father was really huge about the lows
45:56 do this the lows don't do that we are an
46:00 honorable you know we're paladins for
46:02 warriors for good
46:03 so we're strong but we're also gonna use
46:06 our skills and our energy to make
46:10 people's lives better and so I just grew
46:14 up with that and that helped me become
46:15 lawful good because that's what my
46:17 family is well then it was just up to me
46:19 to figure out my themes and that's all
46:22 serendipitous right you're having a
46:23 bunch of experiences well I felt really
46:24 good when I helped that old lady take
46:27 her you know groceries out to her car I
46:28 tucked her in her front seat and I said
46:30 you have a great day boy she just had a
46:32 smile from ear to ear
46:33 that feeling was priceless you know that
46:36 kind of thing right I was very fortunate
46:40 the only time well I didn't have any
46:43 opportunities to actually do that exact
46:44 thing I just told you until he became a
46:46 stockman at Walmart and like 15 years
46:49 old and it was part of the thing if you
46:51 had a older
46:53 man or woman but usually was the woman
46:56 and she bought a ton of stuff
46:58 well we'd always take it out to her car
46:59 and get it all loaded up for and they
47:02 bought a big TV you definitely have to
47:03 load it in her truck or whatever for
47:05 them and usually 99% of the time they're
47:08 so appreciative it just teaches your
47:11 teaches your soul how to behave you know
47:15 and I realized I'm about to say next is
47:17 is up for up for grabs for some of you
47:20 but the way I view God is that he's
47:25 always taking my groceries out with me
47:27 helping me out always now we have bad
47:31 things that happen and we tend to lose
47:32 faith when bad things happen but in the
47:36 end you know most of us would keep most
47:40 of the rough ride that we've had in our
47:41 past because it makes you who you are
47:43 today makes you wiser and stronger right
47:47 so let's go back into the in the let's
47:51 go between the mezzanine between the
47:52 it'd and the character right there's
47:54 almost like a conductive layer of
47:55 electricity between the two your it'd
47:59 for me is sort of your raw resources of
48:02 what you could be the whole universe is
48:06 inside your head everything you've ever
48:08 been from reincarnation to reincarnation
48:11 is inside that it'd plus the ethernet
48:15 cable to God Himself is in there which
48:18 is why you know right or wrong
48:19 whether or not you admit it or not and
48:23 it's sort of a burden isn't it one thing
48:28 I always yeah well I should say in the
48:29 last probably 20 years that I have found
48:33 sort of this paradox of frustration is
48:38 this notion of okay god I've been
48:42 definitely taught right or wrong but I
48:44 wasn't gifted with the mechanism to
48:46 completely control myself as a human
48:50 being and you know part of it has to do
48:54 with that regimen I've been kind of
48:56 harping about in recent episodes which
48:58 is that again Americans unfortunately
48:59 you're taught to just rattle off
49:01 whatever enters your brain becomes
49:04 slab immediately ready to start talking
49:06 immediately it was like there's no
49:08 buffer it's actually brain sort of thing
49:10 so that regimen has definitely gotten me
49:12 in trouble maybe they're trying to tell
49:14 a joke that isn't funny or I'm talking
49:16 to someone about a sensitive subject and
49:18 I just happened to think I've got the
49:21 most colorful metaphor and what I'm
49:23 saying is really strange I'll give you
49:28 an example
49:29 I dated a woman who was just a wonderful
49:32 person but I think I may have said this
49:35 before but she had an itty-bitty voice
49:37 but it was it was her persona the little
49:42 voice was her persona because what she
49:45 came home from work and I was always
49:47 there when she came home from work and
49:48 she had to get out of her dresses and
49:50 she liked to take a quick shower and
49:51 then get into her casual clothes she had
49:55 this beautiful like her version of a
49:58 Kathleen Turner voice just this
49:59 beautiful adult sexy voice it's great
50:03 exactly who I wanted her to be all day
50:05 long now if the phone ring and she had
50:09 to pick it up to talk to some associate
50:11 a relative a friend all of a sudden this
50:14 little tiny baby voice would come out
50:15 and she was sort of a petite person and
50:19 I never did it a really small person
50:22 either and so it was really tough an
50:27 intimate situation in intimate
50:30 situations I guess to have a smaller
50:32 person with this tiny voice because
50:36 that's sort of like yeah it's like
50:37 Epstein sort of feeling right so her and
50:42 I were going to I think breakfast to a
50:44 point this is me making just this is
50:47 like just imagine me putting a foot
50:51 right in my mouth okay and I was trying
50:55 to find a way to bring it up you know
50:56 it's one of those tough subjects it's
50:58 sort of like well that's not the end of
50:59 the world I probably shouldn't have said
51:00 anything it's the stupid part about the
51:02 whole situation but I said you know I
51:06 said you something like you know and you
51:08 knew you know you have two voices right
51:09 and she goes what do you mean I said
51:14 well get the smaller voice but then when
51:16 we're together and you're changing
51:17 you have like your normal voice it's
51:19 like Michael Jackson had two voices he
51:21 did have two voices and so I don't know
51:26 how we got around to it but we're
51:27 getting out of the car and I'm trying to
51:31 make a point of like I'm cool with that
51:34 little voice but I don't want it in the
51:37 bedroom I didn't say it that clearly I
51:40 said it metaphorically a roundabout way
51:42 and she caught that me and she what do
51:46 you mean I said well you know I'm not a
51:50 pedophile and she she looked at me like
51:54 what are you talking about you know it
51:56 was like way over her head because no
51:59 one had ever said anything before I
52:00 couldn't said anything but I just wanted
52:03 it to stop I wanted it to kind of like
52:05 this it was a turn-off massive turnoff
52:07 for me and that'll probably be between
52:10 the two of us we did it almost a year
52:13 and it eventually didn't work out and
52:17 for god knows what reason and you know
52:20 those things I didn't buffer my mind and
52:23 run the conversation through in my head
52:25 it was so gonna fly him by the seat of
52:28 my pants I lacked control and I totally
52:32 screwed myself but on a personal level
52:35 no one's here
52:37 you're all by yourself probably one of
52:42 the toughest things to do if you're
52:44 self-employed I mean this is one of the
52:46 hurdles that if you ever hear anyone say
52:48 they're self-employed and then you go
52:50 key do you have any employees and they
52:51 say no but they've got a nice car
52:53 they've got a nice house the other nice
52:55 lifestyle you're like whoa I didn't
52:58 recognize this when I was younger but I
52:59 certainly do as an older person because
53:02 that's sort of my lifestyle is that you
53:05 have to get yourself up you have to
53:08 assign yourself work you have to go find
53:10 work you have to complete the work no
53:13 one's there nipping at your toes man you
53:15 want to go in the TV you got a project
53:17 do you want to go and watch TV for four
53:19 hours straight you could do that you
53:22 want to play World of Warcraft because
53:23 then expand Shakima you could just play
53:25 a video game all day long always telling
53:28 yourself off I'll just work really late
53:30 tonight you know
53:31 one you're full of energy during the day
53:32 and you're tired at night so it's what
53:34 you gotta be careful with those promises
53:36 that you're gonna pull a rabbit out of a
53:38 hat
53:38 you better have a serious regimen and a
53:41 serious history of doing those things
53:43 like work hard play hard which in the
53:46 video game industry when I was immersed
53:49 in that world that's exactly what we did
53:51 we worked hard and we played hard we got
53:54 massive deadlines I take my whole team
53:56 downstairs a TA go out to the BBQ pit
54:00 and a massive team and we have a whole
54:03 barbecue for like three hours everyone's
54:05 drink and half the dudes are going off
54:07 and hotboxing in their car coming back
54:10 with all beady eyes and I always told
54:12 them I said look you can do whatever you
54:14 want
54:14 really one just don't fall asleep at
54:16 your desk and to just deliver your
54:19 product on time if you have a meeting be
54:21 on time look good speak well don't be
54:26 high don't have a hangover and it's
54:28 unbelievable I have 55 people five
54:30 verbal contractors the 50 of my own
54:32 folks and we never had one guy fall
54:36 asleep at his desk I told you guys that
54:38 story if I had to let him go but he went
54:40 off and Craig his own company and that's
54:42 what God won for that guy every day but
54:45 the other one is very appropriate for
54:50 this time and in our life in 2020
54:53 especially which is when chaos happens
54:57 to you
54:58 and then you must maintain sanity I will
55:02 say that I am a sort of privileged
55:06 position when dealing with this in that
55:07 I don't have you know four kids and a
55:10 wife that I have to perform around and
55:12 keep everybody taken care of at this
55:18 point in my life right I'm past that
55:19 stage someone I will get married but you
55:24 know I'm right now time to deal with
55:27 this I have to just deal with myself and
55:29 deal with my own you know
55:31 ups and downs and concerns about where
55:34 things are going you know it's one thing
55:35 and you guys know this more than anybody
55:40 when you are awake and global situations
55:46 occur you're seeing it for so much more
55:50 than the average citizen sees it as
55:53 they're like oh my gosh we just got to
55:55 stay inside and do this and hand
55:57 sanitizer and all that kind of stuff and
56:01 that's that's probably the extent of
56:05 their concerns now hope hope the country
56:07 starts back up again blah blah blah when
56:10 you worry about players in the universe
56:14 you know like a Bill Gates or a Soros or
56:17 whoever you're worried about a master
56:20 plan you're trying to see the world as a
56:23 as one homogenous group of people now
56:29 let me just give you a piece of advice
56:31 if you haven't already adopted this
56:34 regimen of existence now there's an
56:39 interesting clip of Prince going around
56:41 but I think he filmed in 1999 and he
56:45 said you know we need to turn off the
56:49 news this is 1999 man 21 years ago you
56:53 said let's we need to turn off the news
56:55 because we aren't made to deal with
57:00 everyone's problems in this world we
57:04 can't take on the entire world suffering
57:07 I know friends that try to do it and you
57:10 can't
57:10 because you have to have your own life
57:12 to I mean what I what I think I think
57:18 that you can play a game inside your
57:21 mind that goes something like this
57:22 metaphorically for those of you that
57:26 remember seven digit phone numbers
57:29 before area code became mandatory with
57:31 pagers and cell phones in order to
57:34 remember your buddy's number unless you
57:36 lived in a big city they just told you
57:39 seven digits and area code or sorry or
57:41 prefix and a number right the reason why
57:46 they picked seven was that the phone
57:48 company had done studies or at least
57:50 someone else did studies the phone
57:51 companies cannibalized which is that the
57:53 human mind has a seven very comfortable
57:57 slots in the mind to remember a number
57:59 and that's why they pick seven now
58:03 whether or not that's true I don't know
58:04 that's what I was told several times but
58:07 in your inside your mind depending on
58:10 well I shouldn't even depend we have a
58:14 finite number of slots that can hold so
58:19 much individual agendas that's a poor
58:23 boy saying that we have slides that can
58:24 hold a certain volume of agenda in each
58:27 one of the slots what would be those
58:29 agendas it would be you know the self
58:33 and maybe you've got two things that
58:37 you're trying to work on with yourself
58:39 so you fill up two slots each individual
58:42 agenda within the self takes up a
58:44 separate slot then perhaps a work has a
58:46 slot then your relationship has a slot
58:48 your kids have a slide let's let's go
58:51 with seven but you may have more than
58:53 seven or you may have less than seven
58:55 you may have one of those slots there
58:58 that requires so much attention that you
59:01 can't you can't service the other slots
59:05 the other agendas in your life
59:10 and so you're gonna have to measure how
59:12 overwhelmed you are and you're gonna
59:15 have to have what's most important
59:17 prioritize first and what is second
59:19 prioritize second etc etc now tell you
59:22 one of the fallacies that happens when
59:24 you're young is that you will say I'm
59:28 gonna put my family before myself my
59:31 spouse before myself on my kids before
59:33 myself now in some extreme cases that is
59:37 definitely what you want to do again the
59:39 old analogy of there's a car coming at
59:41 your kid and you have the ability to run
59:44 over there dive push or get out of the
59:46 way and you're getting hit by the car
59:47 that's where you might want to put
59:49 yourself first save your kid's life for
59:51 your spouse or whatever but save a life
59:55 and death situation I'm gonna tell you
59:58 it's the best thing you could do for the
60:00 people around you that you love is to
60:03 keep yourself first
60:05 because if you lose your mind if you
60:07 lose your sanity in terms of your
60:09 ability to be patient and happy you've
60:12 got nothing to offer anyone else and so
60:15 it we're taught the opposite for noble
60:18 reasons and it's understandable but you
60:21 can't do it you got to keep yourself
60:23 number one now what we're talking about
60:26 when it comes to self number-one things
60:29 is you want to keep the most important
60:33 things that are vital to your like
60:37 strategic resources those things are the
60:39 things were talking about
60:41 probably not in most cases an elective
60:45 meaning like I would never put a cigar
60:50 between myself and a woman that could be
60:54 my you know ultimate partner so she came
60:57 to me I met some woman and it's like
60:58 she's absolutely perfect for me she goes
61:00 a man I can't stand cigars
61:02 I'd be like ting maybe
61:06 strategically I could smoke them we have
61:09 you go visit your mom or you know
61:11 whatever you're gone for a day I might
61:13 go smoke with my buddies but I would
61:15 never put some low priority thing like
61:17 this between myself and a perfect
61:19 partner or the attempted
61:22 to create a perfect partner ship what
61:26 I'm talking about is you're having
61:29 anxiety for instance let's just say all
61:32 right well let's put that as number one
61:34 because you can't be affording to have
61:35 you can't afford to have anxiety
61:36 you just can't so we have to put that in
61:39 there and you give yourself time and
61:41 really find a time and a place whether
61:45 it be in your car in the shower or you
61:49 just drive to the beach and chill out
61:51 and you know maybe being with your
61:54 spouse being with your kids being with
61:56 your buddy is the way that you get
61:59 through your anxiety but it's you better
62:01 be talking about the anxiety and not
62:03 just hanging out because let's say you
62:06 have anxiety issues updated one person
62:10 with massive anxiety issues just have
62:14 panic attacks and I could always calm
62:18 her down but that wasn't solving the
62:20 problem what needed to occur was for her
62:25 to be sentient enough to dig within her
62:28 own soul to find out what is freaking
62:30 you out because there's a fire down
62:32 there somewhere it's out of control so
62:35 we got to find the fire and put it out
62:37 and that's real important so obviously
62:42 you won't always temper it so that you
62:45 create some clarity so that person can
62:46 search for so you do whatever you can to
62:49 calm them down but then it's like the
62:50 next step is to talk about it until you
62:53 get it worked out
62:54 at least a thread in the sweater you can
62:56 pull to figure out ok I see you know you
62:59 know what it is it's that thing with
63:01 your sister it's pissing you off let's
63:04 figure it out maybe we'll have her over
63:05 for dinner maybe make that phone call or
63:09 if she's not gonna talk to you then you
63:10 have to learn to accept that for now I
63:12 realize that things change over time
63:14 time heals all but what if your life's
63:18 going perfect and the world shuts down
63:22 your former business cannot open and
63:25 therefore you have no income and you've
63:29 never been in this situation before like
63:31 the entire world's never been the
63:33 situation before your bills are due
63:36 what you gonna do well one there's a
63:41 couple ways to look at this this is sort
63:44 of like crisis management within
63:46 yourself just talking about being out of
63:48 control
63:49 but I want to make sure you make
63:50 distinctions between things that you are
63:54 responsible for 100% by yourself and
63:58 things that happen to you because
63:59 there's a different way of dealing with
64:01 them we'll go back to the self self
64:02 thing in just a bit here
64:04 one if you know like this this whole
64:07 pandemic thing well you should breathe
64:11 this sort of sigh of relief that's like
64:12 well everybody's in the same game sure
64:16 everybody wants their bills paid you
64:18 know like the your landlord wants their
64:19 money the bank wants their money but in
64:21 the end if you made a phone call and
64:23 said look as soon as they start the
64:26 world back up again you know eventually
64:27 I'll start up again and you'll get all
64:29 your cash what do you want me to do in
64:30 the meantime
64:32 so that should give you a bit of a
64:35 reprieve that you did nothing wrong it's
64:37 just happening to you it's frustrating
64:38 but don't get into the frustration as
64:40 much that does you no good we're only
64:43 interested in things that make it more
64:45 digestible liveable etc right well the
64:52 second tier is maybe for that point in
64:56 time the bigger agenda that you're more
65:01 concerned about when things are going
65:02 well maybe you've got enough energy to
65:06 deal with that as well and maybe you
65:09 don't nothing wrong like Prince said
65:12 we're not built to worry about a mass
65:16 murder in Russia we're just not you know
65:20 tornado could go through the Midwest and
65:22 wipe out a whole town
65:23 maybe that's the information you really
65:25 don't need right now you seem to focus
65:29 on yourself the survival of yourself and
65:34 so part of you know things that happen
65:37 to you the way I look at life and while
65:40 I tell you the people who I've never
65:44 really had a super near-death experience
65:47 other than my own foolishness
65:49 but I've never been in like a fire I've
65:52 never been in those kind of situations
65:53 but everybody who has been in a really
65:56 tumultuous situation they just think
66:00 they're lucky stars that they wake up
66:01 every single day and there's a reason
66:04 for that
66:05 because that is truly when you get
66:07 involved with huge crises that's the
66:11 situation that you know most matters to
66:15 you once you've been to the crisis of
66:17 that magnitude we need to learn from
66:22 those people's experiences right like I
66:24 just told you I think I told you guys an
66:26 episode but I told a friend of mine
66:28 recently to say I can't remember saw
66:31 documentary kid escaped North Korea boy
66:35 lay down his life and laid on the
66:37 electric fence so he could crawl over
66:39 the kids burning body
66:40 wow what a sacrifice man he wasn't sure
66:44 if the kid died or not you never saw him
66:46 again
66:47 the kid escaped to South Korea when he
66:49 was in this documentary again he said
66:52 well what do you love South Korea deal
66:54 of all the music and all the
66:56 entertainment and stuff and he was like
66:57 well I really don't care about anything
66:59 he goes what do you care about he goes I
67:01 get to eat whenever I want
67:04 that's all I want so he's thinking his
67:07 lucky stars he's alive and he's not in a
67:09 in a concentration camp in North Korea
67:11 and Korea and - he's happy that he could
67:14 eat when's the last time that that's all
67:18 that mattered to you it's waking up
67:20 being able to eat when you want to eat
67:22 and that was just euphoric for you
67:25 that's all you needed you need nothing
67:27 else to happen well that's what happens
67:30 to you when you go through these huge
67:31 experiences so the way I've been looking
67:34 at life for twenty years is if my crisis
67:38 can't kill me then I'm good great the
67:42 IRS can well whatever they want out of
67:43 me and I know how many problems the IRS
67:45 will followed up but if that were to
67:47 happen because that's one of the classic
67:48 things there when fears yeah work it out
67:51 with those guys if I ever got upside
67:53 down yeah you know you lose your job for
67:56 six months and they try to evict you out
67:58 of your house or whatever you know what
67:59 I'm still alive got tons of friends I
68:01 could stay with that really ever
68:03 happened to me okay I've done favors for
68:05 so many people
68:07 people are waiting to return favors
68:09 sometimes you know so now it's gonna be
68:12 probably fairly impossible for me to
68:14 give you examples that belong to you if
68:17 I haven't already and so let's talk
68:20 about things anymore
68:23 mechanical methodology for you to
68:25 identify something and then you know
68:28 what I always like to call give yourself
68:30 a break as you identify something so
68:33 that you don't stress out about it and
68:35 you've got the calm soul to deal with it
68:39 one of the biggest things that we have
68:43 in life is that we know certain truths
68:46 in certain categories of life what we
68:48 don't know that that is still true in a
68:50 different category of life I gave an
68:54 example I don't know if any of you are
68:57 big bodybuilders but I'm assuming that
69:01 very few of you are so how many thousand
69:05 people who subscribe to the channel
69:07 belong to deep thoughts clan they'll say
69:09 you're a normal human being or maybe you
69:11 have a couple pounds on you okay and
69:14 let's say that you decided you wanted to
69:16 be a hard body you just wanted to see
69:19 what you look like see what your DNA
69:20 looks like all cleaned up and you make
69:23 that devotion okay in that category of
69:26 life you know that tomorrow you're not
69:28 gonna wake up SuperDuper hard body with
69:32 male or female you're not it's gonna
69:33 take a while you have to change your
69:35 eating habits you're gonna have to
69:36 exercise and you're gonna continue that
69:39 regiment until your body looks like
69:41 whatever your destination goal is you're
69:43 probably gonna learn how to lift weights
69:44 and learn how to exercise and learn how
69:46 to eat right it's a process and you cut
69:49 yourself a blank check immediately from
69:52 having to wake up being that person
69:54 because you know the body takes time to
69:57 craft itself all right now for anything
70:01 that you find inside your head or your
70:04 character that you're trying to control
70:07 that you realize is your soft spot let's
70:09 say you have a short fuse and because
70:12 I've had a short fuse in my lifetime you
70:14 know
70:16 again certain categories and it's tough
70:20 you know it's like when you people I
70:22 can't lie to you late you you're kind of
70:24 like I've had enough I'm not enough you
70:26 know this person haven't let them know
70:27 that I'm done with this manipulation
70:30 happens in relationships all the time
70:32 the kid will did tier 1 small - it's
70:34 more smart kind of tongue-in-cheek with
70:37 your kid but a grown adult should act
70:38 like a grown adult it's usually what I
70:40 think right ok but for you you've got to
70:45 control your mechanisms in order to have
70:47 that outward affect towards those other
70:49 harmonics right ok well the first thing
70:53 we want to do is say 1 there's a huge
70:56 victory going on because you just found
70:58 something I mean you're looking for
71:00 Beach glass on the side of the beach
71:01 right let's say for those of you don't
71:04 know Beach glasses like probably most of
71:06 you do it's when glass breaks in the
71:09 ocean and then they're on the beach and
71:11 then it gets ground up by saying over 10
71:13 years and it just looks like a little
71:14 jewel when it's wet it's amazing I used
71:18 to live in Ventura on the beach actually
71:20 technically Oxnard and there's just a
71:23 great beach glass joint and I start
71:26 collecting every piece of beach glass
71:27 that I found and I finally said brown
71:30 and green was just everywhere and it
71:33 just wasn't that nice looking but the
71:35 blue and the red and the white was just
71:37 like crystals and rubies and diamonds
71:39 right the analogy there is that what I
71:44 did was I got rid of the common stuff
71:47 that I was bumping into and I went after
71:48 the rare stuff when you are picking
71:53 apart an element of your character and
71:56 trying to resynthesize it you're going
71:59 to obviously increase the difficulty for
72:02 just a really short period of time for
72:05 any of you that learn how to drive a car
72:06 you know at first it seems impossible
72:09 it's like it's like if you look at a
72:11 really good drummer and you'd never play
72:14 the drums in your life and you never
72:15 even conceived of ever trying but then
72:18 you look at it you're like oh my god be
72:19 so fun to do what they do in the pedal
72:21 and a hi-hat and all the cymbals and all
72:24 the different control mechanisms the
72:25 muffle and play in a certain way
72:27 it just seems impossible at first but
72:31 then if you talk to a drummer you go
72:32 Kate drummer I'm gonna talk to you I
72:34 want you to look at me and we're gonna
72:35 have a conversation I want you to play a
72:36 beat I'm gonna be like yeah yeah what's
72:38 up man you know they're playing it it's
72:39 like no big deal it's all muscle memory
72:41 car driving is a muscle memory well
72:43 nothing was like that at first you had
72:46 to discipline yourself pick out the
72:49 regimen of what you were gonna do get
72:51 rid of the common excuses which have led
72:54 to you having maybe not identify this
72:57 thing in your life that you don't really
72:59 like it join and that's the other thing
73:01 is that you're gonna you're gonna
73:02 extinguish this thing from for all
73:06 intents and purposes eventually you know
73:08 people that are addicted to eating sugar
73:11 it's always the same right they always
73:13 tell you I just bumped into a friend of
73:16 mine they said they hadn't had us oh
73:17 yeah my buddy
73:19 at the lounge he said you know he's
73:22 losing a bunch of weight used to weigh
73:23 almost 500 pounds he's a big dude though
73:26 and he was like man I haven't had a soda
73:29 for like four months and everybody who
73:32 tells me that since it was so hard for
73:34 the first month I thought I was gonna
73:35 die and now I don't even crave it at all
73:38 if that you have to cleanse the
73:41 addiction in your mind the the receptors
73:44 in your brain your dopamine triggers in
73:46 your mind not to want that sugar reward
73:48 you never sugar and cocaine and caffeine
73:50 all have the same patterns in your mind
73:53 it's just there different levels of
73:55 frequency with thus addiction yeah
73:59 that's super addiction addictive feeling
74:01 go through those withdrawals right this
74:03 is kind of funny that you know we can
74:07 watch some documentary on an addict
74:11 incapable of getting rid of their
74:13 methamphetamine addiction or cocaine
74:14 addiction heroin addiction and we kind
74:17 of sit in the sofa we're like oh look at
74:19 that person you know they're having an
74:20 egg you know what's so hard it's just
74:22 such a horrible thing why would you have
74:23 a problem with that and then we go get a
74:28 soda then sit back down at the sofa we
74:31 get a pint of ice cream when we sit down
74:33 to sofa we have the same exact problems
74:35 they do it just doesn't make us look as
74:38 crazy in public space us look
74:40 potentially not
74:41 healthy I'm going to give you a category
74:45 of the it'd of the character that is
74:51 indicative of a lot of these areas where
74:55 we don't always know in this category
74:58 that it something is occurring and
74:59 sometimes we totally know what's
75:01 happening and the key word is denial
75:05 a lot of folks have that way I think we
75:10 all do
75:10 let me not let me not exclude myself
75:12 from this we have denial about bad
75:14 habits that we have part of it is that
75:18 we perceive succeeding sometimes as a
75:23 negative exercise is always perceived
75:26 initially Yemen in the gym either ever
75:30 or in several years and somebody says
75:32 men remember when you in high school you
75:34 look like you know he-man right we had
75:36 this dude in my high school that
75:38 literally looked like he men he looked
75:42 like him in the face and he looked like
75:44 him in the body he was a nicest guy no
75:45 he's still the nicest guy rolled but
75:48 today he doesn't look anything like that
75:51 anymore he's really big super sweet guy
75:54 and when I first saw him after you know
75:57 20 years had passed and I was like I'm
76:00 shocked it was like that's him like that
76:02 dude was like literally Arnold
76:04 Schwarzenegger son but he had I think he
76:07 had literally more definition than
76:08 Schwarzenegger and no steroids of any
76:11 kind but he was massive and he used to
76:13 wake up every day in lift weights nylons
76:15 hit her stuff and he was just famous in
76:16 school he's very handsome he's just a
76:19 super sweet guy so anyway I know that if
76:22 that dude would ever go back into the
76:24 gym oh my god it would be tumultuous and
76:28 painful and you know who knows what we
76:30 got to do at our age but this is where
76:34 we need to employ a little mechanism
76:37 that Tony Robbins learned and then
76:42 shares with us which is the thing I have
76:45 repeated several times but it's very key
76:46 and if you know this little secret I
76:49 mean it's a secret it's almost like
76:51 cheating
76:52 but you're not cheating at all you
76:55 playing a trick on your mind and a very
76:57 good trick on your mind a very healthy
76:59 trick on your mind which is he was
77:04 taught that the biggest problem with
77:07 making a change in your life of any kind
77:09 a big one or a small one is that you
77:12 have to dramatize in your mind where
77:17 were your life if you have something
77:19 that you're not supposed to be doing
77:20 okay matter how tiny it is or how big it
77:23 is acidic it is or how benign it might
77:26 be if you just play it forward five
77:29 years ten one year five years and ten
77:31 years and you say okay if I keep doing
77:34 this let's say it's eating very simple
77:37 one if you eat too much what's gonna
77:39 happen well a bunch of bad things happen
77:42 especially if you abuse sugar right
77:43 sugars and inflammatory inflamed and
77:45 inflamed organs tend to fail after a
77:49 while takes a long time but eventually
77:51 you'll be like oh god I have a heart
77:52 problem I got some other problem where
77:54 did that come from gee I don't know coke
77:56 coke coke great and so you start to see
78:01 yourself dying twenty years earlier
78:03 dying of a painful death having to carry
78:07 around a bunch of weights I mean ask
78:08 anyone whose thighs cannot be separated
78:10 if that's a fun thing weighing up close
78:14 to 250 or more and trying to wipe your
78:16 butt it's seriously a giant challenge
78:21 the old joke that guys can't see their
78:23 junk if they have a big belly that is
78:26 very very real for you ladies that don't
78:29 don't listen to men talk about this kind
78:32 of stuff is this extremely real and it
78:35 starts to get if you go over 250 you can
78:38 get embarrassing you know it's a real
78:39 big problem and I mean just to drive
78:43 home how bad it can be
78:44 I know personal friends of mine they got
78:47 really overweight and when they would go
78:49 to the restroom number two at someone
78:53 else's house it was sometimes almost
78:57 impossible for them to clean themselves
78:59 after what they did and so they're stuck
79:01 in the bathroom forever
79:03 just trying to find out a way not like
79:06 you know you know suppose the soil
79:07 people's towels and stuff they're trying
79:09 to do their best it's embarrassing so
79:11 there could be the you know the ten year
79:13 thing if you don't stop now what Tony
79:16 does is say okay now that's column one
79:18 in your ledger column two is you stop
79:21 that you totally stop it you get control
79:24 over it now what's the next year look
79:27 like who I might actually lose a little
79:29 weight hmm five years from now well if I
79:32 lose a little bit of weight and I start
79:33 seeing muscle definition um I might even
79:36 have more energy as a matter of fact
79:38 because I won't be going through sugar
79:39 highs and sugar lows I might yell high
79:42 energy back like when I was a kid
79:43 remember how we make all those [ __ ]
79:45 complaints about why now and you're a
79:47 kid you got lots of energy when you get
79:49 older you don't have an energy and the
79:50 little kids look as you're going alright
79:52 fatso
79:53 whatever finish your birthday cake you
79:55 know alright so maybe in five years you
79:58 you've gone to a gym you started walking
80:01 ten years whatever age you are you're
80:04 the youngest version of that age you've
80:06 ever seen there anyone's ever seen
80:07 looking in the mirror is fun again and
80:10 because you like looking in the mirror
80:12 you feel good about yourself
80:14 you have confidence you don't have ego
80:16 but just feeling really good when
80:19 everyone else around you is gonna be
80:20 like that girl that guy I love when they
80:23 come by because it's just just too
80:25 bright they know you have your haters
80:27 whatever they need to go through this
80:29 process it's not gonna stop you though
80:30 trust me so make sure and again I will
80:37 I'm a big pen and paper guy as you guys
80:40 know if your chronic Watchers
80:42 if you're new I'm just gonna tell you a
80:45 pen and a paper are the most powerful
80:48 analog mechanisms for your commitment to
80:50 the universe to do something even typing
80:53 it in your iPad with the keyboard on the
80:56 side it's dog [ __ ] not worth anything
80:59 pen and paper
81:00 write it down write it down in fact you
81:03 could do a little pen and paper seal it
81:05 in an envelope commitment to yourself I
81:07 suggest keeping it right in your face at
81:10 all times
81:11 someplace you are and you need to move
81:14 it as soon as it stops being visible in
81:16 your eyesight right because you could
81:17 put it on the mirror of your bathroom
81:19 and you start to dial it out it becomes
81:21 a blind spot you need to move it put it
81:22 on the dashboard of your car put it on
81:24 your computer you know you keep moving
81:25 in a room or rewrite it out if you
81:30 achieve it create a ceremony where you
81:33 take the piece of paper to a very safe
81:34 place and you burn it you know like I
81:37 did it I got rid of that crap you know
81:40 on my left side was stopped and the
81:43 right side became reality and as soon as
81:46 you burn it you just Forge it into
81:47 reality permanently just becomes a
81:49 permanent piece of you by burning it you
81:51 can't go back and I'm going to tell you
81:55 there's a little trick I think I
81:57 mentioned out of context and a previous
81:59 episode many hundred episodes ago in
82:03 2009 I woke up in this body of mine and
82:07 I had gained 25 pounds that I should
82:11 have never ever had at least 20 I think
82:16 it was damn near I was almost 1 nighty
82:17 which I should not weigh and I didn't
82:23 even realize it was gaining weight my
82:25 buddy I was doing he's a five-star chef
82:26 and I was doing a bunch of promo for him
82:28 he's just feeding me instead of paying
82:30 me just feed me and feed me I was eating
82:32 like a king let me tell you plus I was
82:34 rich and I was making a ton of money
82:36 from a game company the 2008 thing had
82:39 happened but I was still we still had
82:41 you know hundreds of thousands of
82:43 dollars in the bank but my buddy takes a
82:46 picture of me at his restaurant he built
82:48 a new bar and I was drinking like
82:51 Newcastle's
82:53 and that was making me extra fat right
82:56 never been heavy in my entire life so I
82:58 didn't even know what it was like I
82:59 didn't know how to become heavy and he
83:03 takes a picture of me and I don't even
83:05 remember him taking it and he gives it
83:09 to me he goes I take a picture of you
83:10 and your girlfriend I'm gonna put it on
83:12 the front with all the other photographs
83:13 I look at this picture and I kid you not
83:16 I looked at the picture and I was like
83:19 who's that dude but I was the only guy
83:21 with long hair in the room so I was like
83:23 oh my god that's me and I just couldn't
83:29 believe it I guess I wasn't enough of a
83:31 narcissist my phone and take pictures of
83:33 myself I was utterly shocked and I was
83:36 like I need to get out of this situation
83:38 and so over again I wrote myself a
83:42 little bit of a blank check and said
83:44 okay it's gonna take a little while to
83:46 loose this 20 pounds
83:47 now what did up happening was this and
83:49 this is the supplies I think to almost
83:51 everything that we change in our lives
83:53 for the better
83:54 let alone for the worse first 15 pounds
83:59 relatively quick to lose I just will it
84:03 off I swear to God I changed my entire
84:05 eating habits you know I was eating good
84:08 healthy food I was eating a lot of it so
84:11 I slimmed down 15 pounds and I but I
84:13 wanted that other 5 pounds off of me
84:15 and the other thing too I noticed too
84:19 was all the trigger points of weight
84:21 gain so like in the back of my jaw my
84:24 lower jaw where meets my neck just under
84:27 my ear when that goes flat and I no
84:30 longer have my jawline I've gained too
84:32 much weight and I immediately drop them
84:34 that's my new thing in the mirror it's
84:36 kind of funny you probably have a
84:37 different one just take a look
84:42 but the first 15 were easy but that last
84:45 five pounds they always tell you this
84:46 but I found an analogy that works really
84:49 really well it's almost like the most
84:54 formidable speed bump that you have to
84:57 get the car over and maybe it's like if
85:01 there's a cliff you know I don't know
85:02 what the deal is but just you have to
85:05 slowly get over this
85:06 the speed bump because isn't it strange
85:09 when you're young you can't put any
85:10 weight on and then when you get older
85:12 it's like no problem you eat like a
85:13 tic-tac and you weigh 50 pounds more
85:15 it's crazy what I found was this once I
85:20 crossed over that five pound threshold
85:22 it was then difficult to go back over it
85:26 the other way it wasn't easy putting the
85:28 weight back on
85:29 no that's this is a bit of a
85:32 qualification in there but I found out
85:35 that nearly all my problems in life are
85:38 exactly the same way when I exercise
85:42 like crazy and I get really really buff
85:44 really fast that extra little you know
85:48 you want your you want your pecs to look
85:50 good or you want to have like some
85:53 definition your abs or whatever it is
85:55 you want your you know your femoral
85:57 muscles to pump that's the other way
86:00 around and then when you get it it's
86:03 very easy to stay in that regimen so
86:05 whatever problem you're trying to deal
86:07 just realize you might have a feeling of
86:11 almost like an insurmountable can't
86:14 quite accomplish it feeling let's just
86:18 expect that to occur expect just imagine
86:22 like Merlyn comes down and tells you
86:23 this is the the truth of the universe
86:25 and that guy's a thousand years old he's
86:27 like you're gonna have at the moment
86:29 when this is gonna seem possible but
86:31 that's when you're really really close
86:32 to getting it but what's gonna happen is
86:35 day in and day out when you're in that
86:37 impossible feeling you know it's just
86:41 you don't know how many days of
86:42 impossible feeling you're gonna have but
86:44 just keep sticking to your regimen and
86:46 then what's gonna happen is just like
86:48 the roller coaster at the very very top
86:49 before the first drop it's gonna be easy
86:52 Street on the other side
86:54 and what I found was than when I started
86:56 eating better it was really easy to not
87:02 drink the soda eat the ice-cream do
87:05 anything crazy and the interesting thing
87:09 is if you like certain things like that
87:11 now so does a little bit art I'm just
87:13 gonna obsess on food for one second and
87:15 just metaphorically apply this to
87:17 anything that you run into in your life
87:20 some things are more I'm gonna use the
87:24 word ubiquitous again right it's
87:25 everywhere coke is everywhere it said
87:27 you know some restaurants is a Mexican
87:29 place I love to go to I prefer to drink
87:31 tea water I drink water all the time so
87:36 with my meal like to bring something
87:37 different usually but some of them don't
87:40 have any alternative dis soda so it's
87:42 kind of a bummer so I will do like the
87:44 one soda but as I'm taking the SIP so
87:46 the soda I'm feeling bad you know I'm
87:48 feeling like okay this is not the way I
87:49 eat and so I that those are a little bit
87:54 more difficult but like going to
87:56 Disneyland eating their ice cream this
87:57 for those of you have never been there's
87:59 this just this one franchises two
88:02 locations and it's like insane I mean
88:05 it's the best ice cream in the entire
88:07 planet and when you get that chance to
88:11 eat that special thing it is like 10x
88:14 the experience and typically what's
88:18 interesting is I get enough like I don't
88:20 order a small portion I order like a
88:22 normal portion you can get gigantic ones
88:25 if you want but I can't even eat that
88:26 much if you do it's actually not bad but
88:28 you'll you'll eat that whole thing my
88:31 time you're over you're kind of like
88:32 blue you know you get that kind of
88:34 feeling I can't eat donuts anymore I
88:37 can't do it wanna eat a doughnut it's
88:40 just I taste the grease or whatever the
88:42 hell they cook those things in it just
88:44 no matter what flavor I get it all
88:45 tastes the same and I feel like I've got
88:47 toxic oil in my body as soon as I eat a
88:50 doughnut I don't know how it happened I
88:53 just train myself away from them now
88:56 let's say you're partnered up with
88:57 somebody either you're married or you're
89:00 living together or you spend a
89:02 tremendous amount of time together and
89:04 both of you have really good
89:07 conversation
89:08 meaning maybe you watch the show
89:10 together imagine how much easier it will
89:15 be if you can work together to support
89:19 each other you don't need the other
89:22 person to tell you how to fix your
89:23 problem and you don't need to be telling
89:25 them how to fix their problem if they
89:26 ask
89:27 obviously that's open but one of the big
89:30 things would be to say okay I got my
89:33 list of things and maybe you share them
89:35 especially if it's a hot item between
89:37 the two of you and say well I'm gonna
89:39 I'm gonna try to be a better man I'm
89:41 gonna try to be a better woman and I
89:42 know I got this weird little issue here
89:44 please have patience with me I'm gonna
89:47 slip when I slip you could make it a
89:50 game I mean I've done this before where
89:52 there's a funny ass scene and under the
89:55 cherry moon with Prince about two-thirds
89:58 through the movie he's dancing with was
90:02 it Mary yeah Mary and they've been kind
90:05 of having this sort of like you know the
90:09 sexual tension between the two of them
90:11 up to this point in the movie they treat
90:13 each other like they hate each other but
90:14 they actually are totally in love with
90:16 each other and so they're ballroom
90:18 dancing on this amazing boat in this
90:20 south of France and she's like what do
90:25 you want what do you want you know and
90:27 finally she starts calling him names
90:31 like gigolo and whatever and he's I
90:33 forgot what he called her but eventually
90:35 they call each other names like two or
90:36 three times and princes cabbage head
90:41 which may not sound very funny right now
90:44 but she just looks that I'm like what
90:47 did you say and so he broke the cycle of
90:52 the argument with a random thing and a
90:58 girl I dated once she was a huge prince
91:01 fan and is to this day she's very
91:03 familiar with the movie and so we sort
91:06 of made a pact that if we ever got angry
91:08 at each other but we wouldn't say
91:10 cabbage head but we would throw a
91:12 non-sequitur in the middle of the
91:14 argument and here's the deal we had to
91:17 make and this is difficult at first -
91:20 you do it a couple times
91:21 and it really works out I mean it
91:23 becomes an easier thing to do the more
91:25 you do it if you're in an argument
91:27 you're obviously passionate about the
91:29 other person seeing your opinion what
91:31 your is different than their opinion
91:33 that's usually how an argument starts
91:34 right so every argument that goes one
91:39 while I split this way you know an
91:42 argument has gone too long between two
91:44 people when you start repeating yourself
91:47 at that point you're at an absolute
91:50 point of diminishing return the more you
91:52 argue after that point you're just
91:54 shouting okay what that really means is
91:59 you need to take a break right you need
92:01 to take a break from this whole thing in
92:03 it sometimes it could be so hot you know
92:07 you need to go your way and they go
92:09 their way I really highly recommend you
92:11 don't leave each other physically like
92:13 you don't storm out of the house or any
92:15 of that kind of stuff because that
92:16 recreates isolation for at least one of
92:19 you like if you go I'm gonna hang out
92:20 with my buddies and she's stuck at home
92:21 you just made her feel like [ __ ] he's
92:25 horrible right
92:26 so our pact was to non-sequitur to
92:31 forfeit resolution at that point and
92:34 then in some cases we just sat down and
92:38 watched TV something completely
92:40 different but we didn't leave each
92:42 other's presence there's something
92:44 called makeup sex right makeup sykes can
92:47 be man I've had it's like TMI but I've
92:51 had converse I had knock-down drag-out
92:52 you know verbal fights with an old
92:55 girlfriend of mine we're very good
92:57 friends to this to this day but our
93:00 solution was to just jump in bed so it's
93:03 like let's get rid of all this tension
93:04 and bam boy it was like what were we
93:07 arguing about it's all over at the end
93:09 of the whole you know it's just funny
93:11 but let's talk about first what second
93:14 you don't have a partner and you
93:17 recognize me what I'm saying here you
93:19 may even know a list of things that you
93:21 need to work on and you feel isolated
93:24 you do and so you're kind of like a hot
93:28 you know I'm all by myself I don't have
93:30 any support group maybe your family is
93:31 not that kind of close to you your
93:33 friends
93:34 they're good buddies good BFFs but
93:36 they're just not deep or you don't want
93:38 to share this particular thing
93:40 it's like Paul's thorn in his side and
93:43 you never acknowledge what it was okay
93:46 if you ever private moment I want you to
93:50 remain focused that finding the problem
93:55 was a complete victory even if you know
94:01 that you know about that you've known
94:03 about this problem your whole life but
94:05 you've been ignoring it and you're like
94:07 well it's not revolution I got this
94:08 problem now I got to deal with it I
94:11 don't want to deal with it obviously
94:13 dealing with it if it was easy I
94:14 wouldn't have had any problems solving
94:16 this problem a million years ago hey
94:18 here's the difference
94:20 just like psychologists tell you you
94:24 can't change somebody else only they can
94:26 change themselves all right how many
94:30 times in your life have you had a bad
94:33 habit that wasn't life or death or
94:35 anything it was really into them but you
94:38 simply said I'm not gonna do that
94:41 anymore I've just I'm done with doing
94:43 that that doesn't have it in you know
94:44 the pattern in your brain remember I've
94:46 like an episode on patterns and how we
94:48 are all pattern based creatures and if
94:51 you manage your patterns well you live a
94:52 great life right some people like to
94:55 keep the patterns the same some people
94:56 like new patterns after a certain amount
94:58 of time but your brain again if you if
95:01 you smoke marijuana and you're like one
95:04 puff makes you totally high do that
95:06 every single day about three months you
95:09 need two puffs and then you need four
95:10 puffs or five books because the brain is
95:12 getting tired of the pattern it's not
95:13 impressed by it anymore
95:14 that's why some you can't abuse acid if
95:18 you take acid every day I would imagine
95:20 by this eighth day you're not having any
95:22 more highs of any substantial amount
95:26 because your brain is like yeah whatever
95:27 he's eating that crap again so you
95:31 identifying it in the tense that you're
95:33 gonna fix it and hey you might fail a
95:37 couple times right you might be like oh
95:39 man I tried that that didn't work hey
95:41 that's one off the list that's a success
95:44 right go to the next attempt but the
95:47 other thing too is
95:48 be bashful about going online nowadays
95:50 oh my god you can type anything in
95:52 through the internet and you'll find
95:54 solutions for it they may not work for
95:56 you but there's more things off the list
95:59 but you may want to try some things that
96:01 you think won't work and you might be
96:04 surprised I told this story and a few
96:09 hundred episodes ago one I hate having
96:11 hiccups [ __ ] hate it if I drink too
96:13 much cuz I don't drink at all like if
96:15 hiccups I hate it because it just
96:18 controls you right you can't do anything
96:20 about it my father taught me when I was
96:22 young I don't know where the hell he
96:24 learned this he said all you gotta do is
96:26 stop one hiccup and that goes away and I
96:30 almost didn't believe him but then when
96:32 you try to stop your hiccups you can't
96:35 stop them and that's why they keep going
96:36 but the second you stop the one hiccup
96:37 it's over right I've had a woman scare
96:41 me once when I was a little kid totally
96:43 got where there he goes
96:45 scaring works but you have to learn the
96:48 rhythm of the human being and right when
96:49 they are about to hit it again you nail
96:51 him and then they resets the diaphragm
96:54 but I had the hiccups one night really
96:56 bad and the funny thing was that my
96:58 girlfriend at the time thinks this was
97:00 the funniest thing in the planet and so
97:03 she laughs and I'd be hiccup and I it
97:05 was like sort like I love her to death I
97:07 was like I I'm finding it kind of funny
97:09 but I'm also pissed at myself for
97:11 drinking too much anyway I look up on
97:12 the internet best cure for hiccups and
97:17 it was this one methodology of sitting
97:20 in the chair just like I'm in now should
97:21 have the straightest back and that you
97:23 can find like an uncomfortable chair and
97:26 you basically look straight up like
97:30 you're about to swallow a sword at a
97:31 circus right you open your mouth you
97:33 just let your whole throat open up but
97:36 you also want to get your diaphragm
97:37 totally stretched out that's part of the
97:40 thing and you just look up and then they
97:43 say to blow out in three three shots one
97:50 two three blow out the biggest breath
97:51 you can while holding your head straight
97:54 up and I'm like oh god I'll try anything
97:57 right and it was a story about people
97:59 that have hiccups for years I mean
98:01 decades they wake up
98:02 sir hiccupping right and they use this
98:04 technique and it was the only thing that
98:05 ever cured it i sat in a chair I did
98:08 exactly what they said and oh my god
98:10 governor Anka did again did it again did
98:14 again different times it worked every
98:16 single time I was actually at a bar once
98:19 and I noticed this dude talking to him
98:21 he headed hiccups and he was just trying
98:22 to cover it up you know and so he was
98:25 kind of drunk himself obviously in size
98:27 I just did them the fatherly thing and I
98:30 said okay here says he didn't have a
98:31 back on the chair so I just put my my
98:34 hand on his back and my other hand on
98:37 his chin and I lifted him back I said he
98:40 just just follow me and he was like you
98:42 have anything man I said open your mouth
98:44 open your mouth now once you blow out
98:45 three breaths like this one two three as
98:48 big as you can
98:49 wham wham boom he was cured he was like
98:53 oh thank you so much so I have faith in
98:58 the old Internet's it's a pretty
98:59 resourceful thing but let me also ask
99:03 you this have you ever run into a
99:05 situation in your life where you had a
99:06 problem and you were unaware that anyone
99:10 else in the world has ever had this
99:11 problem it seems like only maybe crazy
99:14 people have it defective people have it
99:16 bla bla bla and then you maybe use the
99:21 internet and you look it up and you find
99:23 out there's tens of thousands of people
99:25 with the exact affliction that you have
99:27 whatever it is a mental affliction a
99:29 physical one
99:30 a behavioral one whatever it is and now
99:35 sudden you feel a little bit better like
99:36 oh my god least and you read cases that
99:38 are like ten times worse than yours
99:40 right it's like they have the chronic
99:42 level 10 you're on like two and I'll
99:46 sign you feel better and then it just
99:48 poof goes away you're just like and you
99:51 read about how they dealt with it or
99:53 whatever and it's like you know I'm just
99:54 not gonna care about this anymore and
99:56 it's just gonna go away it goes away
99:58 it's a beautiful thing so rely on that
100:01 one - I have a buddy of mine who's in
100:05 AAA for the rest of his life you know
100:08 and he slips when he drinks there wants
100:10 him alone sometimes he tells me
100:12 sometimes he just sloshed talks me and
100:14 acts like he's
100:15 not drinking which is always strange
100:18 they'll open up to me like three weeks
100:20 later yeah I slipped it the day I was
100:21 late oh yeah I didn't notice mr. slushy
100:25 here's what's interesting man aren't
100:29 supposed to admit this kind of stuff
100:30 right totally in control of our destiny
100:33 but I actually don't know what the
100:34 female side of this is maybe one of you
100:36 ladies can let me know but he would just
100:42 tell me I got to go back to a and it
100:45 he's very serious you know I was like
100:47 okay you know I've never done a
100:49 situation but totally support you man
100:51 and actually one day said you know is it
100:55 possible for me to go with you to your a
100:57 meeting and he said nope I said okay why
101:01 and he just said to me because you're
101:03 not allowed in because every single
101:05 person in that particulate room as they
101:07 get up and say their name and say that
101:08 they're not go Holly and you're not a
101:10 drinker so you can't go in he says
101:12 there's that other thing that you can go
101:14 to which is the for the spouses that I
101:16 have to live you can go in there and
101:17 it's like well I'm really more
101:19 interested in what you guys go through
101:20 you know just being a fly on the wall he
101:23 said no because you'll be and everyone
101:25 else is mine you'll be one judging
101:27 everyone else because you're not one
101:30 okay so they go together to Klan
101:33 together so they can feel that you know
101:37 I'm not the only one in the universe I
101:39 can assure you if you look inside
101:42 yourself and you find something that you
101:44 want to control that you don't think you
101:46 have enough control over or any control
101:48 over you were by far not the first
101:51 person to deal with that and even if you
101:55 solve it you're joining another big Club
101:57 with people that have actually solved
101:59 the problem so know that there's a race
102:01 sort of metaphor going here at the
102:04 starting line got a bunch of people with
102:06 you you all have the same issue now you
102:09 know if you run on even a four mile
102:12 marathon you're all gonna run
102:14 differently you are gonna be exhausted
102:16 at different levels some people won't
102:18 finish they're going to go back and run
102:20 it again at a different time but as soon
102:23 as you get over that finish line even if
102:25 you barf pee yourself pop yourself on
102:28 the run and you get through
102:29 that finish line they're all gonna
102:33 welcome you on the other side and that's
102:36 sort of life the universe saying you
102:39 know you've made it man see you had that
102:44 what you needed the whole time Dorothy
102:46 it's for interesting you know I did a
102:49 young analogy the other data Wizard of
102:52 Oz and I was watching a another
103:00 conspiracy video with a friend of mine
103:02 and this dude I swear to god watches the
103:05 show he just won't admit it because I'll
103:09 make an episode and then within the week
103:11 he'll make the same exact episode or
103:15 he'll least use a big chunk of an
103:18 episode no we're talking about the most
103:20 esoteric rap planet earth but I did that
103:23 the other day and then aired the show
103:26 and then two days later the guys like oh
103:28 it's like The Wizard of Oz it's like now
103:30 we can see the guy with the levers
103:32 behind the curtain as though it was like
103:33 ooh either that's been handed out by the
103:36 universe's an analogy that we're all
103:38 supposed to be using or someone's
103:39 watching the show I hope you dug that
103:42 hope it's a nice break from all the
103:44 craziness going on right now I would
103:47 normally say oh you know share the
103:49 things that you've gone through but it's
103:51 probably too private to do so if you
103:54 think you have any additional advice for
103:56 folks please throw it in the comments
103:58 you know we're in this together when
104:01 you're happy we're happy you know and I
104:05 think that the more that we win as
104:07 people the whole the whole planet
104:11 changes you know just think about it
104:13 this way you know that there's a bunch
104:16 of you know uninformed individuals out
104:18 there swallowing all the pills of what's
104:20 going on right now they're still taking
104:22 the blue pill every single morning well
104:25 you also know that once the red pill
104:27 catches on which is really a super
104:30 popular medication right now eventually
104:33 someone will see you taking the red pill
104:34 and they'll want one or they'll ask you
104:38 about it and you give them a little bit
104:40 of information
104:42 and they're like oh my god I feel good
104:43 that explains things for the first time
104:46 ever hand those babies out you know it's
104:49 that's that's a metaphor for you talking
104:51 and sharing stuff you know if any of
104:54 these episodes ever help anybody that
104:57 you have a friend and let's say you
104:59 don't want to be the bad guy I've known
105:03 of this happening one time I did an
105:05 episode about a particular thing that
105:07 was gonna help somebody they didn't want
105:10 to tell their friend this is the exact
105:12 episode I want you to watch because it
105:14 just did aired and so they waited to the
105:16 next episode which was about something
105:17 totally different but their friend
105:19 totally dug it and so they handed out
105:22 the next video saying I think you really
105:24 like this or one right before knowing
105:26 that they're gonna go to the queue to
105:27 find other videos and there was a
105:29 conversation between the two of them and
105:32 it was helpful to at least kick off the
105:35 conversation between the two of them so
105:38 if that applies pass it out I will say
105:44 that the censorship algorithm has
105:46 completely revealed itself I couldn't
105:48 believe I didn't see it before
105:50 never kew always says the in front of
105:52 the truth is right in front of your face
105:54 I was looking at I'll put the graphic up
105:57 there of the the statistics of my
106:01 viewership and you can literally see the
106:04 algorithm of I post a video there's
106:09 obviously a spike in the curve of
106:10 viewership and then this bike goes down
106:12 you would expect that right looks normal
106:14 but here's the problem because it's
106:17 algorithmically censored these Peaks
106:20 have the same exact angle of attack and
106:23 the same angle of decay in most cases
106:25 but what happens is the bottom of the of
106:30 the curve starts at 500 for any one
106:33 particular video and it's only allowed
106:35 to get to 1515 1600 somewhere in there
106:38 and then they take it down so I don't
106:41 know how they do it realizes well a
106:44 video could be watched ten thousand
106:46 times but they stop the counter every
106:49 other time and so Elena's five thousand
106:51 impressions
106:52 so there's a lot of stuff going on what
106:56 I would love to have happen just as an
106:58 experiment on one particular day it
107:00 doesn't have to happen multiple times
107:01 but to have a Sun forum some group of
107:06 you know ten thousand people or
107:08 something just as a trick to see if the
107:10 algorithm would change get a bunch of
107:13 people organized on a particular day
107:15 take a video they don't have to actually
107:18 watch the thing but have thousands of
107:21 people hit a video where I never get
107:23 over 1,600 in any one particular spike
107:25 on a particular day and see if we can't
107:27 cream that baby over 1,500 to see what
107:30 happens because the like if people have
107:36 test farms there's a bunch of test
107:39 software out there that'll test your
107:41 website I don't have access to one right
107:43 now unfortunately but if I did I would
107:45 take the test software this is sort of
107:47 cheating the statistics but it's only to
107:49 conduct this test because I don't want
107:52 any fake impressions but if I were to
107:54 take that software and point it out a
107:56 video URL right and have it load and
107:59 stream because it's gonna be smart
108:00 enough to stream the video which is
108:03 usually just software controlling a
108:04 computer right but it's all virtual and
108:06 memory right but have it hit a video ten
108:09 thousand times within 24 hours we know
108:12 for a fact 10,000 individual impressions
108:15 happened on this particular page and
108:17 then to have YouTube's report 1,500 we
108:21 would know the game that they're playing
108:22 but the show is actually crest the 50
108:26 year mark on YouTube what that means is
108:29 if you total up all the minutes that
108:31 have been consumed by this show by
108:33 people watching the videos it now totals
108:37 a person having to sit down for 50 years
108:40 to see to accumulate all those minutes
108:43 so that's pretty cool so I really
108:45 appreciate you guys you know I do like I
108:49 do much a bunch of other channels of
108:50 course and 99% of the channels within
108:53 the first two seconds they'll be like
108:55 everybody like and subscribe like and
108:56 subscribe
108:57 I think that's extremely cheesy and so I
109:01 never pushed that sort of behavior with
109:03 you folks you guys are smart people if
109:06 you like it you're gonna subscribe if
109:08 you don't like it you're not if you want
109:10 to thumbs it up you're going to you guys
109:12 have been extremely generous
109:13 I still get reports all the time that
109:16 people have been unsubscribed by YouTube
109:19 I've even had my own alternate accounts
109:22 unsubscribes just nuts how they would
109:25 have the audacity that I mean it's all
109:26 linked to my one account I mean I'd be
109:29 dumb to say okay maybe he won't notice
109:31 he's you know subscribed from his own
109:32 account what so anyway if you know again
109:37 this is anything helpful please push it
109:39 around but on that note if you haven't
109:42 been to deep thoughts radio.com please
