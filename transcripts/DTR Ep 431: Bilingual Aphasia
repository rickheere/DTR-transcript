00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts on this very chilly
00:36 Saturday night one could also refer to
00:40 it as Sunday morning it's about 2:30
00:43 a.m. as I start this episode a good
00:50 friend of mine has referred me to the
00:54 television show Fringe and it's one of
00:57 these shows that I I'm sort of amazed I
01:02 missed it that no one talked about it I
01:05 was very busy very busy in 2008 when it
01:08 started I was running my game company so
01:09 I wasn't watching all the TV
01:12 but my friend is like she's one of my
01:16 beautiful brilliant friends who provides
01:19 research data for me for scripts but she
01:24 was helping with one of my sci-fi
01:26 scripts I'm working on before I started
01:29 this most recent project which has
01:31 caused everything to beautifully shift
01:35 which is like dude if you like all that
01:37 stuff then you're gonna love French
01:41 did you like x-files I said yeah and so
01:45 I'm tearing through episode season one
01:47 excuse me I guess I'm one probably
01:51 episode six and it's covering one of
01:56 these things which is called bilingual
01:58 aphasia and it has to do with people
02:02 that this is not a core part of the
02:05 episode it's just someone mentioned it
02:07 and giving examples but then it you know
02:11 started to really piqued my in straight
02:14 and piqued my interest excuse me if I
02:16 could learn how to speak English can't
02:17 even speak one language so if someone
02:21 suffers an injury goes into a coma this
02:26 has also been cited for near-death
02:28 experiences where people are actually
02:29 pronounced dead physically and then they
02:33 manage to recover and something's
02:35 different about them
02:37 a particular academic skill set and
02:42 suddenly appears just immediately
02:45 appears and all I can say is there's
02:47 different aphasias right some people
02:51 speak different languages in with the
02:54 proper dialects you know you're about
02:56 this all the time sometimes people speak
02:58 the same language but they have a
03:00 different dialect perhaps they're
03:02 British somewhere in the British Isles
03:04 they're speaking in some Australian
03:07 dialect and it's utterly perfect - son
03:11 impersonation people from those regions
03:12 ago whoa you're suddenly speaking a
03:15 different language but some of them
03:16 people have spontaneously you know gone
03:19 from not knowing another language -
03:21 speaking German Spanish French
03:23 everything and it's always sort of you
03:27 know it's one of these things that we
03:28 can barely wrap our mind around but we
03:33 hear it we hear the words and we see the
03:35 evidence the last woman I heard of I
03:38 believe was speaking in a British accent
03:41 if I haven't right she was in Texas
03:42 something happened to her she woke up
03:44 and she all sitting at a British
03:45 accident now I love personally
03:48 attempting a British accent I think it
03:51 and humour and that sort of thing but
03:53 I'm completely making it up these people
03:55 don't now every other skill is in this
04:00 game as well
04:01 painting piano playing in stripling in
04:06 general and we can only assume that
04:09 there are other skill sets that perhaps
04:15 are not being as tracked is as closely
04:17 perhaps someone learns engineering or
04:19 computer science or something just
04:21 clicks differently in their mind now
04:23 there's a completely different species
04:26 of this which I'm going to acknowledge
04:28 so that we stay on track with what I'm
04:29 talking about
04:30 but there's a hold of the situation when
04:34 people get organ donations from other
04:38 people and when they recover some skill
04:41 set from the person who deliver the
04:44 organ will suddenly appear in the
04:47 recipient
04:49 the only one I've really seen it's
04:52 fairly well-documented as a person who
04:54 received a child's organ of some sort
04:59 came over exactly which one but then the
05:03 person all the sudden was artistic and
05:05 was drawing pictures and the way that
05:09 the documentary spends it is that the
05:10 kid had drawn a very similar picture
05:13 before the child died and so it was like
05:18 hey let's draw together you got part of
05:20 my organs you know so I am NOT gonna
05:23 talk about that in this particular
05:24 episode I'm talking about the more
05:28 mysterious because there's no transfer
05:31 of materials between two people there is
05:33 no other person this is just a person
05:35 who had either a near-death experience
05:37 it'll probably near-death no matter how
05:39 you turn it because the coma is
05:42 obviously not some normal state we are
05:45 in in this world so I started thinking
05:50 about this and it's I'm gonna tell you
05:53 it's because of this show because of
05:55 doing 450 episodes that my brain has a
05:59 college in it to decipher what I think
06:03 this could be because I feel like
06:05 through us working together me making
06:08 shows you're thousands and thousands of
06:11 comments the Facebook page which by the
06:15 way guys I just got a compliment from
06:17 the Facebook page a friend of mine went
06:18 in there and said you know I'm a member
06:21 of your deep thoughts page
06:22 I guess this person didn't have any
06:25 expectations why would you and she said
06:30 this is a great page these people are so
06:32 nice and so interesting and open-minded
06:34 so kudos to you and let me just do a
06:39 little advertisement right now our
06:41 Facebook page which is locked which you
06:42 get through deep thoughts video calm
06:44 just like Facebook under social media or
06:46 whatever it is just the finest group of
06:51 people I mean I'm blessed to be you know
06:55 a part of you and your information feeds
06:59 into me will guard this if I ever have a
07:00 chance to give you an intelligent reply
07:03 I try to like things and so you know
07:05 I've seen it and if if I'm pounding
07:07 through a bunch of likes it doesn't mean
07:09 I'm not diving in it either is something
07:10 I've already seen or I've dived in so I
07:12 do the same thing with the YouTube
07:14 comments
07:15 so if I haven't liked your comment it
07:18 just means I've seen it and I haven't
07:19 had a chance to really read it because I
07:21 want to really give you my full
07:22 engagement right ok back to the episode
07:25 [Music]
07:26 so I'm thinking about this you know
07:30 there's there's a couple of avenues my
07:34 mind personally went down when I've
07:36 heard about people suddenly learning new
07:38 languages learning to dialects and that
07:40 sort of thing and I think because of
07:43 Hollywood there was a brief second in my
07:48 mind that thought of sort of a
07:50 possession algorithm and believe me I
07:54 understand if you did not have that
07:56 impression that somehow you know maybe
08:00 the person did pass and whoever's taking
08:03 over their body is from a different
08:05 region and they're just adapting to
08:07 whatever and whoever this person is
08:09 they'll be interesting
08:11 you just claimed to have amnesia until
08:12 everyone teaches you who everyone is you
08:15 get a whole new lot in life you know but
08:18 I don't think that's it when I thought
08:22 this up and connected the dots in my
08:24 brain which this particular time around
08:26 especially because I'm watching Fringe
08:28 which really forces you to open your
08:30 mind fringe is a word used by the
08:35 designers of the show to discuss fringe
08:40 science in unlike x-files which started
08:45 off really solid with one theme and then
08:48 wandered away from it right it was
08:50 trying to do sort of a alien spin
08:53 towards the beginning which I think you
08:55 know it's masterfully interesting I
08:57 think the writers probably figured out
08:59 oh my god we got to pull this thing
09:01 through for a whole season and they do
09:02 another one the one we're gonna have to
09:04 branch out fringe which is led by JJ
09:08 Abrams and some can say his other
09:10 brilliant writers have built brilliant
09:12 actors I mean really this show is just
09:15 one of those magic
09:17 that you know uh yeah I guess it went
09:20 from some around 2008 to 2011 and then
09:26 the fans were like what it's over and
09:29 now all I can say is if the momentum of
09:33 this show continues to the last season
09:35 I'm gonna get to watch through DVDs
09:36 I will also be going what you know how
09:39 could you possibly drop such an amazing
09:41 production but I'm putting together
09:43 these dots in my mind I'm thinking but
09:45 wait a minute
09:46 these people are still themselves they
09:50 just had these new capabilities now the
09:53 episode in question was about a boy it's
09:55 all fictitious who was an accident was
09:58 in a coma and woke up and could play the
10:00 piano and I have definitely seen half a
10:03 dozen instances in my lifetime were just
10:05 even the local press when I lived in the
10:08 Midwest as a kid they would you know
10:11 show kids walking up to pianos and
10:13 playing blind people they've never had
10:15 any lessons just start playing and
10:17 singing but now I'm gonna take you to
10:20 the platform by which I'm going to start
10:23 my little experiment in my college
10:26 because you know science has you know
10:31 usually two different processes that you
10:34 use in order to evaluate a hypothesis
10:37 right using scientific methods
10:40 you either have pre-existing paradigms
10:43 and thought processes that you believe
10:45 are true that are the foundation of what
10:50 you're going to jump off on or you have
10:53 a completely blank slate because you've
10:55 never seen what you're about to try to
10:57 figure out right those of you watch this
11:01 so regularly you know I talked about
11:03 reincarnation you talk about the fact
11:05 that the way that that's possible is
11:08 that we are symbiotic being we have a
11:12 soul a body and a mind the body is the
11:17 facilitator of the mind using the craft
11:23 [ __ ] the power station which is our soul
11:26 it is pushing through this apparatus
11:30 of which has limitations the human body
11:32 has limitations there's only so much we
11:35 can access and accomplish in this human
11:38 body meaning I can't
11:40 as far as I know fly around like you
11:43 know Superman I can't just go out into
11:45 space and stand on the moon I can't just
11:47 go to the bottom of the ocean without a
11:48 suit on limitations now whether or not
11:51 we truly have neural limitations and
11:53 thought process limitation that process
11:55 limitations I think that's probably
11:59 probably true but it's probably way
12:02 higher than what we currently perceive
12:04 at butte be careful with this this
12:08 ridiculous notion that we only use 3% of
12:11 our brain and sometimes you later 10%
12:13 and you know be careful the metric by
12:18 which that is being measured is the same
12:22 kind of metrics they use for to create
12:24 crazy political polls you know where
12:27 pedophile Joe Biden can somehow be ahead
12:29 of Donald Trump and the in the polls
12:31 when he's not even ahead of Warren you
12:33 know I mean it's those kind of things
12:34 where they can create a little thing
12:36 it's a good for cover of Scientific
12:38 America or whatever but it's completely
12:41 just conjecture and assumptions and so
12:48 allow me to give you my own conjecture
12:51 the reason why people fear death you
12:54 know in its ultimate sense not just say
12:57 I'm young I don't want to die that's
12:58 that's different that's just
13:01 self-preservation and something you
13:03 should definitely have but death in the
13:07 layman's mind which is all of us when we
13:10 begin is that we are just this bag of
13:14 chemicals and therefore when the bag of
13:17 chemicals dies dust the dusts you know
13:19 ashes to ashes dust to dust
13:21 we recycle and you know look around your
13:25 world everything recycles you know even
13:27 even though trees live a long time
13:28 eventually they do pass away and they
13:30 become the earth again and reconstitute
13:34 every precious metal that we make can be
13:37 recycled glass can be recycled all these
13:39 things so we see this beginning middle
13:42 and end cycle around us
13:44 constantly so it seems as if the
13:46 universe itself has that same limitation
13:52 as it is above such as it below and so
13:55 as it is below so too is it above the
14:00 only problem with that is that we are
14:03 definitely energy we know that for a
14:05 fact
14:06 but the problem is that energy is
14:09 typically defined in this universe as
14:12 electrons that's what we recognize as
14:16 energy even though photonic waves can
14:19 stimulate valances and create solar
14:22 panels that still turns into electrons
14:24 and that's what we think of as power so
14:27 if I were to tell you you have a soul
14:29 the problem is is I can't tell you what
14:32 it's made out of but you can feel it
14:36 alright you're number one piece of
14:39 evidence about the souls existence is
14:42 love but you do have to have a healthy
14:45 body to bring forth enough of your souls
14:49 recognition into this world and control
14:51 of this body to be able to feel love
14:53 empathy and be a human being but if you
14:58 damage the human body
15:00 with vaccinations and drugs and just
15:02 birth defects in general you will have a
15:06 kazoo instead of a trumpet and therefore
15:11 when you play it kind of sounds like an
15:14 instrument but it's not something you
15:16 wanna s'en to you for any length of time
15:19 so even though we can create zombies
15:21 here on earth that are killers or
15:24 whatever in there's you know every time
15:25 there's a tumor in the brain all kinds
15:27 of wild stuff happens right well when a
15:30 piece of electronic appliance breaks
15:33 like a computer or a laptop or your
15:34 phone and you know you accidentally
15:38 walked off with the cord plugged in and
15:40 it yanked the power connector on your
15:44 adapter we do it to your phone you plug
15:48 something in and out a lot in your
15:50 telephone you break the connector you
15:52 know that that's the reason why it
15:53 doesn't work but the interesting thing
15:55 is is you know also in your mind
15:57 even as a layman without knowing
15:59 anything about the bowels of a computer
16:00 that the internals of your computer a
16:02 99.9 percent correct you just broke the
16:05 connector this will get to the point of
16:09 aphasia so when I tell you have a soul
16:13 and you you could name people that you
16:17 think don't have souls
16:18 serial killers weird you know dictators
16:21 in life there may have been something
16:24 wrong with their body such that the full
16:28 dimensionality of what was offered by
16:30 the soul was incapable of fully
16:33 animating into the human condition and
16:36 so we have a killer
16:38 we have someone hurts animals and
16:40 children and that kind of thing they are
16:43 defective now I do believe that there
16:47 are situations where abuse can occur and
16:51 it will heavily dictate how the paths
16:57 and the brain form in such a way that
17:00 even though your soul was trying to push
17:02 through trying to give you the human
17:05 condition
17:06 you've now built a device that is
17:09 essentially short-circuiting for
17:11 emotional reasons or maybe even
17:13 neurological reasons I've never heard it
17:17 done but imagine we were to study at a
17:19 really microscopic level the neural net
17:21 of a child that was abused badly by a
17:24 parent and then someone who seemed to
17:26 live a wonderful life and become a
17:28 wonderful person I'm willing to bet that
17:32 the neural density and the way that the
17:34 synapses are connected are drastically
17:37 changed because we program our bodies to
17:42 become whatever we believe ourselves to
17:43 be through neuropeptide production which
17:47 means your neural thoughts construct a
17:50 peptide that descends into your body and
17:53 controls the way that you grow you've
17:56 got friends that can eat anything they
17:58 want to eat and they never get fatten
18:00 but their sister or their brother wear
18:02 the same exact genetics turns into a
18:04 blimp now maybe you can see the meeting
18:07 a lot more but a lot of times they don't
18:08 eat that much more and the skinny as
18:11 real I have a friend of mine who's as
18:13 skinny as a rail she's a model I've seen
18:17 this girl eat more than me now I haven't
18:20 tracked her to the bathroom to see she
18:22 throws up and stuff but I really doubt
18:23 it she'll go hours and hours after she
18:26 eats in public with us and there's no
18:29 excuse me I need to go and you know it
18:32 smells like barf later never seen there
18:34 you're simply because they think of
18:36 themselves in the form that they are as
18:40 I said a few times in previous shows I
18:42 went back to my reunion High School 30th
18:49 can you believe that and everyone in the
18:53 room that looked ten years older than
18:54 everyone else had a very interesting
18:56 consistency and common denominator and
18:58 that is that they walked around with a
18:59 bunch of catchphrases about how old they
19:01 are they really embraced age and so
19:06 their body puts push them out 1020 years
19:10 ahead of us and even though we're the
19:12 same age roughly within a year of each
19:15 other's lives
19:16 they look like grandparents physically
19:22 so if you believe in some sort of soul
19:24 and you're willing to accept the fact
19:26 that it's not going to be something
19:28 that's tracked by a Geiger counter or a
19:30 voltage meter even though the human body
19:34 is an electrical device of course
19:36 hopefully we can come to the general
19:39 understanding that if you injure the
19:41 human body you start to create defects
19:45 in your personality and your capability
19:48 of being human and the way I would
19:54 describe that is if your body was
19:57 entirely healthy and never got damaged
19:59 what kind of human could you be and then
20:02 who are you now
20:03 and have you damaged anything now
20:07 luckily a lot of damage that we do
20:08 especially with drugs and alcohol the
20:10 same [ __ ] thing that could be
20:13 repaired the ones you stopped as I said
20:17 to my alcoholic episode
20:20 if you've been an alcoholic for 20 years
20:23 be very very careful going cold turkey
20:26 because you can create thicker blood
20:28 that doesn't flow through your body you
20:30 can have catastrophic organ failure so
20:32 you might need to wean yourself off as
20:34 crazy as that sounds you made it
20:36 literally need to just drink less and
20:38 less and less for probably five years if
20:41 for every 20 right I'm just making that
20:43 up but there's a relative if you will
20:51 not not a blood that I was very close to
20:55 for several years and she died at 53
20:58 because she cold turkey to her 25 year
21:02 30 year addiction alcohol she was eating
21:07 great she had lost about 80 pounds it's
21:09 about five foot and she ended up dying
21:13 of catastrophic organ failure so how do
21:17 people learn languages overnight
21:19 especially due to a coma well now
21:23 imagine if you believe in a soul which
21:27 is very scientific thing it's not a it's
21:30 not a religious thing
21:32 religion is a paradigm by which we can
21:35 actually discuss souls freely without
21:36 having to listen to you know atheists
21:39 you know shut down the conversation
21:42 because they can't hear it you know it
21:44 they don't have a machine that's been
21:46 invented to track it they can't fathom
21:49 it which is such a pathetic mind isn't
21:51 it philosophers do a little bit better
21:54 cuz they sort of stand in the mezzanine
21:55 of what could be and you will have
21:59 theoretical scientists who stand
22:02 directly in the center with the
22:03 Philosopher's which I would assume is
22:05 probably our group but at some point in
22:10 the in the growth of a human being
22:13 inside of its mother this living being
22:16 gets a heartbeat very very quickly this
22:21 consciousness the soul is obviously
22:24 attaching to this cluster of cells at
22:27 some key point whether it's the moment
22:29 of conception or some further cell count
22:33 down the line we
22:35 but imagine you you are this super
22:39 infinite soul again we might all be one
22:42 being and these are just tree branches
22:45 that are growing into various in
22:48 instances of life which we perceive as
22:52 human but if you can't see the soul you
22:55 can't see the tree branch but just think
22:58 about the physics of the Fibonacci
23:00 pattern and the fractal patterns of
23:02 again the branches match the arteries in
23:06 your in your body on especially the the
23:10 arteries that feed your lungs and when
23:12 you pull them out separately and look at
23:14 them they look like tree branches in the
23:16 sky you know same thing so perhaps
23:21 through some sort of central
23:24 consciousness and a fractal branching
23:25 system we are all the same person
23:28 but it's attaching to this small cluster
23:31 of cells which doesn't have the
23:33 operating system just yet of the entire
23:36 human being fully grown it's in the
23:39 protein patterns that you get from your
23:40 parents that then start to dictate to
23:43 the DNA what's going on you start
23:45 creating yourself as a human being now
23:48 imagine that because we are a soul you
23:56 can't kill it it's like trying to kill a
23:58 ghost you can't do it you swing in your
24:00 arm goes through it it's looking at you
24:03 like what are you trying to do same
24:05 thing with the soul because unless you
24:08 have a soul bump into a soul you don't
24:11 have what it takes it god forbid science
24:16 has to acknowledge something that it
24:17 can't track I mean would that be
24:18 phenomenal pretty sure the high ups in
24:22 the world know that all this is true
24:23 whether or not they know exactly how it
24:26 works who knows but so you're growing
24:28 slowly into this vessel that's also
24:30 growing well if it's having a previous
24:35 life in England Germany France Spain
24:39 Middle East China whatever it was
24:44 something else and it fully grew into
24:46 that thing in the previous
24:48 life and it did learn the other language
24:51 but now because the vessel is tiny we're
24:55 now growing into a new branch a new life
24:59 being and of course what's gonna take
25:02 place
25:03 you know maybe babies cry because they
25:06 still see their old self and they're
25:08 letting go you know who knows but
25:10 they're growing into this being that's
25:12 inside the mother for nine months on
25:13 average right the baby doesn't have this
25:18 capability of holding on to all of the
25:21 neural programming and connections that
25:24 were in the previous experience because
25:25 one it's all disconnected it's got to
25:29 find its way and it's only going to turn
25:31 on the part of the soul that is
25:33 necessary to live in this world
25:35 why would turn on anything else as a
25:37 child do you need to play the piano to
25:39 feed off the mother no you need to be
25:42 able to suckle and so it's going to be
25:44 this cerebellum muscle memory growth to
25:48 be able to be a baby and then you're
25:50 gonna crawl and you're gonna walk you
25:52 can walk badly
25:53 you're gonna walk better so on and so
25:55 forth in terms of language it's probably
26:00 one of the most phenomenal things that
26:01 we as beings can do especially human
26:03 beings there's language obviously
26:06 between all creatures within their own
26:10 species right and stock to ants you know
26:13 beaver talks to a beaver
26:15 but the articulated phonetical language
26:19 construction and understanding ciphering
26:22 and deciphering of english language or
26:25 any other language on earth is utterly
26:27 phenomenal utterly phenomenal that makes
26:31 us superior to what's on this planet but
26:34 we learn the language of our land to
26:36 survive I had to learn English to live
26:40 in America even though I grew up in
26:41 Germany I do have a weird disposition
26:45 for German I can understand it and about
26:48 a week of being around German people I
26:50 can understand eighty-five ninety
26:51 percent of what they're saying it's a
26:55 weird thing but let's say you grow all
26:58 the way up let's just give ourselves a
27:01 hypothetical case it's a 25 year old
27:06 female she is for all intents and
27:10 purposes perfectly healthy speaks
27:12 English and she gets injured in such a
27:16 way that she goes into a coma it could
27:18 be a fever it could be a car crash
27:20 whatever she loses her normal
27:24 consciousness and ends up in a sort of
27:28 perilous situation of is she going to
27:32 make it that sort of thing but they put
27:33 her in a coma to help her heal and when
27:37 she wakes up from this coma
27:40 whether it be 24 hours or 24 months
27:45 she's speaking either different language
27:49 or she's speaking her language in a
27:51 different dialect which is very distant
27:55 from where she grew up indigenously
27:57 right what could be happening there well
28:02 let's say that in that state of injury
28:07 the soul is losing compatibility with
28:13 the body for a brief time in such a way
28:18 that even though it stays connected in a
28:21 symbiotic way with the being potentially
28:24 through the brainstem through the pineal
28:26 gland it does free itself a little bit
28:30 from its predisposition of how it is
28:33 hanging on to the body meaning it is
28:35 organically organically grown into the
28:39 brain cavity of this gray matter right
28:41 all this cholesterol that's making up my
28:43 gray matter in my mind but then it I
28:47 start to recover I start to recover and
28:53 perhaps the reason why it lets go
28:55 certain cells could be one of two things
28:58 the cells themselves are dying due to
29:01 whatever fever or injury is taking place
29:04 so it has to find a new home or maybe
29:07 there's a state of the brain of the
29:11 cellular structure electrical state
29:12 maybe it has less electricity who knows
29:15 that it ends up being less compatible
29:17 with the touch points of its previous
29:19 organic 25 years of mapping on to this
29:22 human host for the symbiotic identity
29:26 that is the true person who has
29:30 potentially lived as many lives as the
29:33 universe has years of existence and
29:36 quite frankly there's no limitation to
29:39 have been beings and other dimensions of
29:41 reality as well but we'll stick with our
29:44 universe for now imagine that imagine
29:49 that your soul is much more educated and
29:53 infinite than you presently are as a
29:56 human being you know there's all kinds
29:59 of theories about when you pass as to
30:00 whether or not to all that knowledge
30:02 comes swimming back to you and you
30:04 suddenly gain you know a few million
30:07 points on your IQ score no but don't you
30:11 maintain your identity are you still
30:13 Walt Disney living in the park as Walt
30:15 Disney do you have super Walt Disney you
30:19 know where he's bald isn't he by choice
30:21 he's living there by choice but he also
30:25 knows you know the dinosaurs didn't
30:27 exist but now it's gonna reattach and
30:32 now it has a super dense brain to work
30:37 with as opposed to the embryonic stage
30:39 of attachment whenever that occurs and
30:42 so now what can happen is they can
30:47 organically say well I need to be able
30:50 to speak when I wake up so the parts of
30:52 the soul that have knowledge about how
30:55 to speak well they can just reattach
31:00 wherever it's compatible now imagine if
31:07 you've ever played was it musical chairs
31:09 there's a very interesting analogy here
31:11 my grandmother on my father's side loved
31:14 musical chairs one because she knew that
31:18 any man that was playing the game will
31:22 always yield to a woman because she grew
31:24 up in a time when men were men
31:26 and women and chivalry was the name of
31:30 the game so she knew that she could
31:31 stand next to a guy and he's always
31:34 gonna give up his chair to my
31:35 grandmother because she was very
31:36 beautiful and sweet and so they just do
31:38 it
31:38 so she played that game too hilarious
31:41 she's such a feminist but imagine that
31:46 this reattachment process is a bit like
31:48 musical chairs it for those of you have
31:49 never heard of musical chairs you've
31:51 only heard it you have no idea how it's
31:52 played
31:52 they put a circle of chairs in a room a
31:57 bunch of people standing around the
31:59 chairs they play music and while they're
32:01 playing the music you walk around the
32:02 chairs but when the music stops you have
32:04 to sit your butt down in a chair and
32:06 there's always one left chair than the
32:08 amount of people walking around the
32:09 circle so one person's out then they
32:13 stand back up again remove one chair
32:15 meaning one person's gonna be out when
32:17 the music stops and you have to fight
32:19 for a chair and it goes all the way down
32:20 to I guess one chair right I have a
32:25 memory of watching my grandmother play
32:27 that and I think my father even said oh
32:29 yeah oh gosh he loves that game you know
32:31 it was one of those things because he
32:32 had seen it his whole life and I was
32:33 like really
32:34 let's see grandma kick some asses some
32:36 chairs I imagine that the remapping
32:39 process of the soul sometimes not all
32:43 the time most the time it doesn't do
32:44 this right but maybe the neural pathways
32:51 that handle language and the souls
32:53 proximity to those areas because
32:56 something has been damaged due to the
32:59 injury the old British circuits let's
33:04 just say this person wakes up speaking a
33:06 British accent its closest and so it
33:11 maps down to the brain it maps down to
33:14 the identity of this person and so they
33:17 wake up and they speak another language
33:21 or their language in a different dialect
33:24 right it's because in a previous life
33:27 they spoke a different language now it's
33:31 easy just to say well yeah of course you
33:33 were French once and so yeah if you get
33:36 injured in you wake back up again the
33:40 boom you're gonna you know have a chance
33:41 of speaking your previous language
33:42 that's what I'm saying but I'm giving
33:45 you a physical model that is fairly
33:48 interesting
33:50 now what about skill sets like playing
33:53 the piano was a couple versions of this
33:57 that I have seen one is exactly like I
34:00 said an injury happens and someone wakes
34:03 up with the skill said they didn't used
34:05 to have that sounds like horrible
34:07 English but I guess that's correct but
34:10 then the other one I've seen probably
34:12 more often and I've seen it several
34:15 times is there will be a mentally
34:17 disabled child in a household and they
34:21 may actually have other ailments but you
34:24 know sometimes I've seen it with
34:26 blindness as another unfortunate
34:29 disadvantage for the child and for a
34:34 large part of their childhood there's
34:37 nothing there's care there's hospice
34:40 right taking care of the child every
34:42 turn of the way right and then at some
34:45 point I've seen it in the teens late
34:48 teens and I've seen it in the 20s where
34:51 the child simply goes up to the piano
34:55 and obviously it's a household with the
34:58 piano so there's obviously probably
35:00 genetic capability being passed to ended
35:03 the child so the you know the neural net
35:05 of a family that is a bunch of musicians
35:06 will pass down a predisposition to
35:09 understand keys and octaves and tempo
35:13 and music construction right but the
35:17 child will simply play anything that
35:20 they can hear they'll write their own
35:23 songs it's just a light switch that
35:26 turns on inside their mind well anyone
35:29 that's familiar with these situations of
35:32 brain damage due to accidents you know
35:37 the mind is an amazing thing right I
35:41 mean technically speaking I should say
35:43 the brain what I'm talking about the
35:44 mind actually you know I'm not purely
35:47 talking about your your thought process
35:51 I'm talking about the physical
35:53 synapses in your brain we know that when
35:55 it gets injured over time it can
35:57 reconstruct and move things around the
36:01 mind there's you know a couple
36:01 conditions where they actually
36:02 physically deliberately take out half of
36:05 your brain and you lose that opposite
36:08 side of your body's movement for a
36:10 little while and then BOOM
36:11 all of a sudden one side of the brain
36:13 takes over for both sides of the body
36:15 and they're back in action it's an
36:18 amazing thing thank the Creator okay but
36:23 now imagine that the soul plays a bit of
36:26 a role in this you do have a past of
36:31 playing an instrument I want to I want
36:34 to suggest that unless souls are and
36:39 there's definitely evidence for this
36:40 unless souls come in really young with
36:43 very little experience which again we
36:45 see that and we also have souls that
36:48 come in that are very old you like my
36:51 kid I swear to god she's way older than
36:54 me you know she was born you know she's
36:56 looking around the room I was a baby I
36:59 mean just minutes old just looking at
37:02 all of us like hey what's going on I'm
37:05 gonna be on mom for a little while but
37:09 everyone has that saying you know that
37:10 person that the kid has an old soul
37:12 imagine that this child that was born
37:15 with several limitations at birth is
37:20 obviously interacting with the world and
37:22 of course the more though the world is a
37:24 loving world they have the encouragement
37:26 to become whatever they could become and
37:29 so they have a very healthy arc of
37:33 physical growth the brain keeps growing
37:37 and renewing cells to the day you die
37:40 you will hear scientists tell you that
37:44 your brain stops growing new neural
37:46 cells at the age of 10 to 12 it's a
37:49 complete lie probably was initially told
37:53 out of some false conclusion I think
37:56 today because they poison us so much in
37:59 our lifes they want you to think that
38:00 your brain doesn't create any new cells
38:02 but because of cancer research and a few
38:05 volunteers that were
38:06 terminal condition who allowed
38:08 themselves to be dyed this black dye
38:10 they'll inject into the mind it stains
38:14 all of the cells that exist with the
38:16 black dye so if you ever create a new
38:19 cell it's clean they have the oldest
38:23 case I've heard which is the oldest
38:25 volunteer I've ever heard is 79 year old
38:28 male was died and then lived a little
38:32 while and they did the autopsy on his
38:35 brain and found all kinds of brand-new
38:38 cells in this guy's head 79 years old I
38:41 think he got the shot like 78 every case
38:44 this has ever been done throughout time
38:46 to all ages there's brand new cells in a
38:49 mind and I starting to bring so that
38:53 occurs you know I read a paper about how
38:57 they they don't know why as Sinop
39:00 procreates
39:02 I've told you exactly why Sinha
39:05 procreates now the rest of your cells in
39:09 your body are very different they're
39:10 like suitcases in your synapse are these
39:12 sticky little clusters of nucleus nuclei
39:15 that then have these sticky branches out
39:18 to all the others and they're
39:20 transmitting electrical current back and
39:22 forth which is your thought process
39:23 right that much we can all agree on I'm
39:28 gonna tell you right now never read the
39:30 Senate paper but the reason why you're
39:32 synapse procreate is because of use
39:35 there's a threshold of use that triggers
39:39 procreation synapse gets used a lot it's
39:45 like I'm being overstimulated
39:46 but there needs to be more of us and in
39:48 this cavity because this person is
39:50 thinking a lot so what I'm gonna do is
39:53 I'm gonna eject part of my new key of my
39:56 nuclei out into the space of the human
40:00 brain and then we're all going to work
40:02 together to donate the cellular tissue
40:08 to create a protective coating around it
40:11 and then attach to it and everyone's
40:14 attaching and attaching and attaching so
40:16 the more you use your brain the more you
40:18 get brain cells and
40:20 just how it works when you take a race
40:22 in the world and you oppress them for
40:24 400 plus years you're going to interrupt
40:27 their natural ability to create cells
40:30 unless in the midst of oppression
40:32 they're trying to think their way out of
40:34 it and that can create an abundance of
40:38 super dense brains which can do all
40:39 kinds of wild things right once released
40:42 from oppression you get amazing music
40:46 and art and culture and all kinds of
40:48 great stuff right one of my greatest
40:50 fears is that the faction of the world
40:53 that always seems to pick the biggest
40:54 you know douchebags to run the world is
40:59 that they have this philosophy well if
41:00 we made the world great we have no more
41:01 art turn-turn resinar said as much about
41:07 his first two albums right so these kids
41:11 that are having issues mentally are
41:17 still trying every single day they're
41:20 trying every single day to be normal
41:22 they don't want any limitations you know
41:25 it's like the people that are born
41:27 without a particular limb on their body
41:29 you know there's these I forgot what the
41:32 disease is called but there's the
41:33 disease where you are a condition I
41:36 don't know exactly what the medical
41:38 category of it it is but they were born
41:40 without arms and you'll see how they the
41:44 women can put makeup on and they never
41:46 had arms so they don't miss them you
41:48 know we feel sorry for them but they're
41:50 like whatever watch my feet go and then
41:53 there's that incredibly intense
41:56 condition where you're born without arms
41:59 or legs
42:00 but these people figure out a way to get
42:03 around it they won't be stopped but
42:09 their brain is obviously working at a
42:12 higher level than most of us because
42:14 they're having to figure out how to do
42:16 you know the most complex things with
42:18 the most subtle nuances of their body
42:20 because they don't have as much of a
42:24 body is the rest of us right so for a
42:28 kid that's got all of his limbs he's got
42:30 everything
42:31 he or she
42:33 I've only seen boys do this in the in
42:36 the coverage Beatriz stood to see a girl
42:39 has done this to usually when it has the
42:41 specials with the people without the
42:43 arms it's usually a girl that I see now
42:47 there's a gentleman without any limbs
42:49 and that was a guide he runs around
42:51 talking to kids which is awesome but
42:54 here's my theory with this and it's
42:56 probably not even remotely profound to
42:58 any one of you but as the brain
43:00 continues to repair if the soul has any
43:05 element to the spontaneous talents that
43:08 these people have right it's as if one
43:12 chamber of the mind of the brain scuse
43:14 me the brain tissue that has been
43:18 incompatible with soul attachment for
43:22 whatever reason it's not fully developed
43:24 there's not enough of it meaning
43:26 everything that could possibly be
43:27 attached to has been attached to but
43:30 there's not enough of it so that the kid
43:32 has a bit of a mental disability but as
43:35 they grow more of their mind and more of
43:37 their brain I keep seeing mine sorry
43:39 more of their brain tissue there goes
43:41 the soul ting ting ting ting ting ting
43:44 ting and attaches a bunch of stuff but
43:46 because the kids bigger and has a much
43:49 larger brain than the systemic brain
43:52 that you get when you're an embryo
43:54 they're able to onboard whole additional
43:59 programs of how to do something very
44:01 complex like play the piano it's all
44:05 there
44:05 BAM this is what you used to play but if
44:08 nothing else here's what you used to
44:11 know how to do which is to play by ear
44:13 which is what I do you know in these
44:18 kids that are blind I mean think about
44:19 Stevie Wonder who I guess was able to
44:21 see up until about the age of five and
44:24 then he had a degenerative problem in
44:26 his eyes but I don't know how much he
44:29 could play at five but the guy learned
44:31 how to play everything he touched you
44:34 know still doing it to this day I think
44:36 Ray Charles was actually blind from
44:39 birth but so that you can do it
44:43 so there's organic growth learning which
44:47 is perhaps Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles
44:49 who are feeling it and listening to it
44:52 and learning it you know you just let it
44:54 roll into your brain again if you ever
44:56 want to learn an instrument my advice is
44:58 to obviously buy the instrument but to
45:01 have it close to you at all times have
45:03 it in your hands at all times play it as
45:06 often as you possibly can hopefully
45:08 you're younger without a spouse and you
45:10 will start to just understand the neck
45:13 of a guitar the octaves of a piano you
45:16 know once you understand that an octave
45:18 is your fixed note range and then you're
45:20 just simply going up and down the
45:21 octaves and then you can start seeing
45:24 key patterns and you're an A or an B
45:28 flat you mean you're playing in a
45:30 particular organization you just omit
45:33 certain keys and you pay attention to
45:35 other keys and no matter if you're high
45:37 or low those are the only keys that
45:38 you're allowing yourself to play because
45:40 when you play one outside the key it
45:42 sounds horrible so like a minor key it
45:44 doesn't work right I've talked about the
45:47 sole several times on the show and I
45:51 think I even mentioned I know I
45:53 mentioned in one of the episodes way way
45:55 back that one of the things we're
45:57 lacking is our deep thoughts College a
46:00 physical place to go with a bunch of
46:02 open mind minded people with not only
46:06 the more tangible areas of science where
46:10 scientists could use machines and
46:12 confirm things that we all have as
46:14 capital F science the religion of
46:17 science but also the other side which is
46:21 the more ethereal theoretical science
46:25 that we are trying to pioneer and with
46:30 the soul we have a difficulty in
46:33 tangibility so when you start to come on
46:37 board but I'm just gonna call now like
46:40 the Soul Train okay when you come on to
46:43 the Soul Train and you believe in one
46:46 then okay so you start to analyze your
46:49 life you start to analyze indicators
46:51 that make you believe that because most
46:53 of us come to that conclusion at some
46:55 point in time because of
46:57 various experiences those of you who are
46:59 extremely empathetic and loving you have
47:02 no problem believing in assault whether
47:04 or not you can articulate a single
47:06 sentence about what it might be
47:08 besides the religious gift from God you
47:12 feel it but then there's a lot of other
47:17 folks that would love to start
47:21 triangulating through deduction and
47:24 experience and perhaps in this
47:26 particular case of bilingual aphasia
47:29 science empirical evidence that goes
47:33 whoa hey you know kung-fu all of a
47:37 sudden how the hell do you know kung-fu
47:38 I don't know boop bop you know but
47:42 people gain skills really fast now there
47:46 is the probably gonna get the number
47:50 wrong because it's been about a year
47:51 since I researched this but there's
47:53 something about the isn't it like 37
47:57 grams something like that a doctor
48:01 claimed and I read about this later and
48:04 you know you never know when you read
48:07 scientific follow-up papers about you
48:09 know interesting theories and claims
48:12 whether or not the debunkers are merely
48:17 your classic scientists that are like no
48:20 way can that be true right but there was
48:23 a scientist that thought that after a
48:26 human body dies he wanted to weigh it
48:29 while it was dying and see if it changed
48:32 its weight as a result of death and he
48:35 came up with I think it's 37 grams
48:39 sounds like a lot but it's some number
48:43 of grams were you you lose your bodily
48:47 weight he said he recorded that at one
48:48 point now obviously if that was a bona
48:52 fide experiment then we could recreate
48:54 that over and over and over again
48:56 hospices could have beds that way you at
48:59 all times which they probably should
49:02 since they need to know how much you
49:04 weigh you just get the bedding
49:06 differential off they're like you know
49:08 the comforter or whatever which is
49:09 probably infant estimable
49:10 and then they could test such a thing
49:14 now that when I heard this it was sort
49:17 of uh was a buddy of mine they said what
49:19 do you think about that and I'm like
49:20 what are you talking about he explained
49:21 it to me I was like oh that's weird but
49:23 for me the sole having a tangible weight
49:27 in this world is sort of funny you know
49:31 it would mean that you would I mean
49:37 maybe it is maybe it's not maybe I'm
49:38 being silly dismissing it but I recently
49:41 heard on this subject I recently heard
49:43 someone say I can't remember the hell I
49:46 heard this recently but someone was
49:47 trying to say that when we shake our
49:49 head and we get dizzy they obviously
49:53 blame the little tentacles in our inner
49:58 ear and the chemical that's down below
50:00 right and if it splashes around and gets
50:04 on the little tentacles then you start
50:06 to feel dizzy and vertigo and that sort
50:08 of thing I personally don't do too well
50:12 when I'm spun around a lot I don't do
50:14 the teacups as it were right now maybe
50:16 it's something I would get over if I
50:18 went through it a few times but when I
50:19 was a kid I was on this swing in my
50:22 hometown and this guy it had his kid
50:28 there and he spun us around spun us
50:30 around I must have had chili or
50:31 something because boy I got sick really
50:34 fast and hurled on the ground and
50:36 suddenly I realized oh boy I can't go in
50:38 circles and so but I can't go in the
50:41 barrel ride you know you get pushed up
50:43 against the edge because my orientations
50:45 okay but this individual recently said
50:49 that that's a bunch of crap that that
50:51 inner ear splashing is something they
50:53 tell you to explain it but it doesn't
50:55 really have anything to do with it and I
50:57 forgot what he was saying he was saying
51:00 it was a deep neural experience I think
51:02 it was a VR guy or something if you guys
51:04 remember or seen that let me know but it
51:08 would be utterly fascinating if our
51:12 dizziness is merely the soul going oh ho
51:15 I've got mass you know on one level you
51:17 can't sense it unless your way your
51:19 whole body but you know Here I am trying
51:21 to hang onto your head
51:23 but if there was a pretty fascinating
51:26 thing that kind of dawned on me a few
51:29 years back about the idea of the soul
51:31 being tangible before I heard this
51:33 graham experiment you know we have drag
51:37 race car drivers Top Fuel Drag Race
51:39 drivers and we have fighter pilots and
51:42 there are all these experiments but drag
51:44 racing is great you know you have a guy
51:46 that is sitting and a girl sitting
51:48 inside their car and it's stationary
51:52 it's absolutely holding still to the
51:54 degree in a human being hold still in
51:56 this world and then they punch that
51:58 thing when the carousel drops and kaboom
52:01 this car is reaching 320 miles an hour
52:05 in a second or two
52:07 it's just Top Fuel drag racing for me
52:09 it's just one of the most phenomenal
52:11 achievements of man it's unlike in to my
52:16 understanding of a lot of the salt-flat
52:18 things you know where people go really
52:20 fast that seems like a more gradual
52:22 buildup but the soul if it exists has a
52:27 definite way of attaching to the human
52:30 body in such a way that even though we
52:32 come to sharp stops we have fast
52:35 takeoffs you don't lose your soul you
52:39 don't leave it behind you know you're
52:40 not like who am i oh gosh I mean you
52:42 know it's not like that it's it's pretty
52:44 well attached if it exists right you
52:48 know I told you once that I had a dream
52:49 that where I woke up and I was a tree
52:53 and I was a treatment I had no limbs and
52:58 the whole thing was I was dreaming that
53:01 I had hands and arms and you know legs
53:03 and stuff and then I woke up when I was
53:04 a tree and I didn't I couldn't move and
53:09 it was again it was like I was on this
53:12 Ridge that's probably like a ten foot
53:15 drop down to the other trees and we were
53:18 all pretty unified in our distribution
53:22 not quite like someone planting an apple
53:26 orchard or something but it was pretty
53:27 unified and it was like a green mist
53:30 kind of going around and I woke up and I
53:32 as this tree within my dream and I said
53:35 oh my god
53:36 I'm a tree and like the trees next to me
53:40 were like if somebody said next to me
53:42 yeah we're all trees and we dream about
53:46 being humans because we're trees meaning
53:51 we really wish we could move around you
53:54 really wish we could you know have more
53:58 adventure than the sitting in this one
53:59 place and so of course we dream of being
54:02 humans I thought that was beautiful but
54:07 what if it's a metaphor what if it's a
54:09 metaphor for the fact that we're all
54:10 tree branches from a central
54:13 consciousness in the universe and those
54:15 branches reach out to us and when they
54:21 bind with the human flesh we get our
54:23 consciousness now before you think
54:26 that's crazy
54:29 think about an ant colony ant colonies
54:34 are by any definition as well as bee
54:37 colonies and other insect colonies hive
54:40 minded they work together but a bit but
54:45 an ant colony is interesting when you
54:46 see that that sort of nature video where
54:49 they have ants bitter in the rain forest
54:52 and the rain forest floods and so these
54:55 ants who were living on the surface
54:57 climb up to a high place whole brood of
55:00 them right and they form a boat out of
55:05 their bodies and the ones down below use
55:09 water tension to create a bubble around
55:11 themselves so their butts are sticking
55:14 up and there's a bunch pushing down so
55:15 all the ones down below they don't drown
55:17 they've got water tension and bubbles
55:20 around them and the queen is loaded up
55:23 on the raft bunch of them climb on top
55:25 of her and you have this crazy hive mind
55:28 boat that just instantly forms as if
55:32 it's an amoeba going or a sight which
55:34 like a squid or octopus you know just
55:37 trying to climb out of a dangerous spot
55:38 and move on when you draw a line around
55:42 the entity that is a an ant brood and
55:46 then flood it and then continue tracing
55:50 and tracing the line you start to get
55:52 what looks like a multi-celled being it
55:55 lives on its own and if we think about
55:58 the fractal of the branch analogy
56:01 against the soul
56:02 penetrating some sort of life well it's
56:07 always fascinated me is we like to say
56:10 that the size of a brain dictates the
56:12 overall potential of the life that
56:15 possesses the brain now I you know I've
56:18 said it a thousand times
56:19 octopuses if they're 50 feet long I have
56:22 a brain about the size of my pinky and
56:24 it's Hollow
56:25 well how small do you think the brain is
56:27 of an ant right but ants can build
56:33 underground palaces with rooms that are
56:37 dedicated to breeding rooms that are
56:39 dedicated to saving food rooms that are
56:41 dedicated to the Queen herself you know
56:44 when people pour aluminum inside termite
56:46 mounds they get this amazing gigantic
56:49 network of rooms same thing slightly
56:52 bigger insect but ants do the same thing
56:56 and you know depending on where you live
56:58 in the world you will either have
57:00 gigantic bullet ants or you'll have the
57:02 most tiny microscopic ants and when I
57:05 grew up in Kansas we had a particular
57:09 black ant that had soldier ants that
57:14 were utterly microscopic like if you
57:18 were to say well I would say if this
57:22 cigar which is about for those of you
57:24 coming on iPad the podcast is about two
57:28 and a half inches long okay I guess it's
57:31 about four four five centimeters the
57:35 soldier ants had these gigantic bodies
57:39 and gigantic heads with the little
57:40 pincers those things compared to the
57:44 soldier ants were I don't know it would
57:47 be like taking a Tonka truck a toy dump
57:50 truck you might get from a department
57:52 store and parking it next to your family
57:55 car they're huge differences in what
57:58 they were made out of but their brain
58:01 cavities
58:02 all seem to work together when the rain
58:05 comes they all just get on the same page
58:08 really really quick which begs the
58:12 notion could there be a multi life being
58:15 on earth especially before man may have
58:19 arrived on this planet and the way that
58:22 it's just worked the way that it had to
58:24 work otherwise it wouldn't have survived
58:27 is a neural net which in the other
58:32 dimension is nothing more than a sort of
58:35 an octopus looking extension of a single
58:39 soul haven't you ever met anyone that
58:42 you're just totally compatible with you
58:46 know lovers like to throw around the
58:48 word soulmate whatever you do you're
58:52 just compatible it's crazy and it's like
58:56 finished each other sentence thing it
58:57 could be best friends it could be lovers
58:59 but when you finally meet someone that's
59:01 just god I feel like I've known you my
59:03 whole life what if that's nothing more
59:06 than the branch off your soul and what
59:10 if that region of soul branch has been
59:16 dictating souls around you and around
59:19 them your entire existence and so even
59:22 though you may wake up in Albuquerque
59:25 New Mexico all of your family and
59:28 friends are part of the same tree it's a
59:31 little absurd because you know families
59:33 break up and move all over the world now
59:37 the one experience I haven't had is you
59:40 know moving to another country or having
59:43 someone from another country move to me
59:44 and having that unbelievable connection
59:48 I have met very few of the 7.5 billion
59:51 people in the world so I there's nothing
59:52 conclusive about that and quite frankly
59:56 sometimes the opposites attract which is
59:59 where you get the yin yang theory of
60:00 existence right you can complete
60:03 yourself in different ways by not
60:04 providing the same exact faculties right
60:09 it's a hell of a thing to suspect that
60:13 you're a symbiotic being made up of soul
60:15 body
60:16 which then generates the mind not
60:20 understand it but have this definitive
60:25 feeling that that is exactly what you
60:26 are in that bizarre I can't understand
60:30 what I am you know there's a part
60:33 there's a level of which you can
60:35 conceive of it but you can't really
60:40 understand it completely because there's
60:42 no device that will allow you to see
60:44 exactly exactly the components that you
60:47 are it would be oh it's almost as if you
60:50 know and there's probably people
60:51 probably millions of people like this
60:52 but imagine never looking under the car
60:55 of a hood of a car you never look
60:58 underneath the car
61:00 you never know your entire life let's
61:03 say you live 80 90 years old you never
61:06 know what a car is made out of or up of
61:09 whatever how you want to phrase that yet
61:12 you use through the ignorance is bliss
61:15 formula a car I mean that's not a bad
61:20 thing it's a great thing actually if you
61:21 can just let go I will tell you this if
61:24 you're born with the engineering gene
61:25 this is an extremely difficult thing to
61:28 accept because an engineering mind has
61:31 one controlling idea which is I must
61:35 know how this works no matter what it
61:38 takes
61:38 I've gotta I understand it and it has to
61:40 be understood in a physical model you
61:45 might be able to survive with
61:46 theoretical models until you achieve
61:47 your physical model but you're always
61:50 searching for it and it's that thorn in
61:51 your side that you can never turn off
61:53 that curiosity it's like come on come on
61:55 what is this oh yeah you know if you and
61:59 any point in your life suspect that we
62:01 are created by a divine being that
62:05 wishes us well then the curiosity gene
62:11 which is also you know it's a blessing
62:14 and a curse would be necessary for us to
62:19 remain in a growth pattern to negate the
62:27 notion of sitting in some sort of
62:30 static stagnant state because what would
62:35 be the point of creating us if we were
62:36 just to sit there and go I exist I exist
62:39 I exist this is great this is great you
62:42 know we need more than that
62:45 yes human beings to be satisfied right
62:51 and you know you might cite ideas or
62:54 cite examples where you're like well I
62:56 know someone who's never left their
62:57 hometown I mean physically never left
63:01 their hometown it's a small hometown
63:02 they're in a loop all day long and so
63:07 they don't really have that diversity in
63:09 their life but they seem to be happy as
63:11 a clam I would say that what that having
63:15 grown up in a town exactly like that I
63:17 mean I would spend months and months and
63:21 months I remember remembering when I was
63:24 a kid that there were years that I never
63:27 left my hometown which is a six mile
63:28 square okay you begin to appreciate the
63:33 nuances of life the subtleties of life a
63:36 conversation with someone is just as
63:39 unique as a snowflake even if you do end
63:43 up discussing the same thing every
63:45 single time you get together it's still
63:47 the tone of their voice the attitude of
63:50 their body that gives you that rich
63:54 feeling of well well I see that they're
63:56 still happy and that's what I really
63:59 want from them and that makes me happy
64:00 and so today I'm having a happy day
64:02 because everyone around me seems to be
64:04 positive Oh someone lost a relative due
64:08 to old age or whatever so now they're in
64:10 that other state of mourning and so I'm
64:14 gonna lend my perspective and my love to
64:18 supplant their pain subtleties that's
64:23 what's so utterly brilliant about the
64:25 design of this reality that we're in is
64:27 that it is a fractal in itself
64:30 emotions are a fractal they're macro and
64:33 micro they're quick and they're slow
64:35 sometimes we find ourselves locked into
64:40 a state of mind for a perpetually long
64:42 time
64:43 and we wish we could change it you know
64:46 I want to hear what you guys think about
64:49 this and I'm gonna encourage you to give
64:53 us some thoughts I mean if you're having
64:55 a super deep thought comment away but if
64:58 you're just feeling something and you're
65:01 mulling it around give yourself some
65:04 hours some days perhaps and come back
65:08 and give us some of your insight into
65:10 this and I know a lot of you are
65:11 well-read and well researched in this
65:14 particular category of thought process
65:17 you know you guys refer me so many great
65:21 links so do that if you have those
65:23 available as well and also any personal
65:28 experiences that you've had that tend to
65:31 give you the thought that you do have a
65:33 soul I mean be meticulous be surgical
65:38 physically surgical theoretically
65:40 surgical obtuse acute just lay it on me
65:45 man and again I want to encourage you
65:48 guys before I go off on the bumper here
65:51 if let's say you watched one of my
65:54 videos three years ago and it was one of
65:58 your favorite videos you may find it
66:02 very enriching to go to the comments
66:05 section which at the time you saw it
66:07 because perhaps you're one of the first
66:08 50 people to see it the comments were
66:11 almost nothing and go back and see if
66:14 someone has contributed something really
66:16 intelligent because a lot of you are
66:19 going back to my older videos and you're
66:20 putting in these great comments with
66:22 references to other videos to
66:25 individuals we need to look up on
66:27 Wikipedia or other resources websites
66:29 that kind of thing and there is just
66:33 it's it is literally the virtual
66:36 colleagues that I keep talking about
66:37 except we don't have any money and
66:40 machines to develop things to do these
66:43 sorts of experiments but I think that
66:46 you know like I said the human mind and
66:49 the human body is a machine and we are
66:55 the sensing device
66:57 to have the authority on concepts like a
67:00 soul so instead of relying on a machine
67:02 to track electrons to say wow this
67:05 thing's got an energy signal a radiation
67:11 half-life that we're sensing through a
67:12 Geiger counter by counting electrons
67:14 that are flying into this sensor well
67:17 you're a machine - you're way more
67:19 complex than any machine man has ever
67:21 made including the Hadron Collider so I
67:27 have faith in yourself to be able to
67:29 find pretty much any evidence that you
67:32 want to find do realize - that the
67:35 universe is out there is your ultimate
67:38 Wikipedia it is it has all the answers
67:41 to anything that you can conceive
67:44 which is why enlightening yourself and
67:48 opening your mind so that you can see
67:49 more and digest more concepts and again
67:52 this friend show is just like training
67:54 wheels for that sort of mind expansion
67:57 there's a lot of things they'll expand
67:58 your mind hopefully this show has helped
68:01 some of you achieve that because you've
68:03 certainly helped me but the trick of
68:06 getting an answer out of the universe is
68:08 preparing the database query properly
68:10 you have to ask the question otherwise
68:15 you'll never get the answer and there
68:17 was a great episode of Fringe somewhere
68:19 in an episode I can't remember this
68:22 woman who's the main character she was
68:26 talking to one of the other characters
68:27 and she was trying to say you know I
68:31 need you to give me a bunch of
68:33 information and she says well answer all
68:35 your questions but I don't think you
68:37 have the questions I think you can
68:40 conceive of the questions as what she
68:42 was trying to say that's brilliant
68:45 that's exactly the problem if you can't
68:47 ask the question you can't get the
68:50 answer and even if you've got the answer
68:51 before you could ask the question you
68:53 may not understand what you're what
68:55 you're getting back but the other thing
68:58 I would encourage you to realize
69:00 potentially this is my experience is
69:03 that you may get questions answered in
69:06 very literal images maybe even some
69:11 words in your mind but I need you to
69:13 understand that metaphor and some symbol
69:17 symbology is also a method of how the
69:19 universe communicates it is an iconology
69:23 of communication so you may get back an
69:26 answer in a very symbolic form and you
69:30 need to understand that that's the way
69:32 that universe is communicating with you
69:34 so that you can decipher it and get the
69:37 actual English or German or French or
69:41 whatever you speak translate it in your
69:44 brain and there are humans out there and
69:47 I know at least one that watches this
69:49 show and they are extremely symbolic
69:53 when they communicate with other human
69:55 beings which they find extremely
69:56 frustrating and I'm not sure this
70:01 particular person understands how
70:03 symbolic they are when they communicate
70:05 and so they get immediately frustrated
70:08 and they'll want to shut the
70:10 conversation down instead of going you
70:13 know hey wait you just started speaking
70:16 your language you understand there's no
70:19 way I can know your language until you
70:21 explain it to me so don't give up on the
70:23 conversation don't run away from the
70:25 profound truth you're trying to share
70:27 with another human being stop take a
70:30 deep breath realize you got to put some
70:33 work in this but the second that you can
70:35 help us understand the symbology that
70:37 you're speaking then we can start having
70:41 that conversation for the very first
70:42 time that you never have another human
70:44 being I think that's all I got for this
70:46 episode
70:48 this one just crawled up my sleeve while
70:50 I was watching Fringe and I just had to
70:52 get it out there now
70:55 if you've never been to the show before
70:56 understand a few things it's a variety
70:58 show all kinds of different subjects
71:00 you're gonna be interested in some not
71:03 interested in others don't sweat it just
71:04 skip the episode I'll have another one
71:06 out within usually seven days that may
71:09 grab you if you think you're subscribed
71:12 to the channel you may want to verify
71:14 that on youtube if you like
71:15 notifications when the episodes drop
71:17 which a lot of you do click the bell I
71:19 will publish an episode and I think
71:23 nowadays with
71:24 then we think within about eight hours
71:29 the episode if it's a good one
71:30 we'll get it 400 to 500 views within the
71:34 first eight hours which for me is very
71:37 very quick for only forty two hundred
71:38 subscribers also - if you're enjoying
71:42 the content but you go out to the real
71:45 world and you're like oh my god
71:47 nobody talks like this I really would
71:49 love to have more conversations like
71:51 this well the best thing you can do is
71:52 pass the show to them and maybe don't do
71:56 a hard hard sell just say look I want
71:58 you to listen to this particular episode
72:00 and then let's have a conversation let's
72:01 go to dinner tonight after you've heard
72:03 it because I want to pick your brain
72:05 that's another way of getting them
72:07 involved and then you can start having
72:09 your own deep thoughts over dinner over
72:13 lunch or whatever but deep thoughts
72:15 radio.com is the place to go for all the
72:17 fees there's a couple video again if
72:20 you're not on bit shoot please get
72:21 yourself on [ __ ] you create an account
72:23 even if you prefer to watch things on
72:25 YouTube show them support by subscribing
72:29 and just understand that when they want
72:30 to raise money they have to show their
72:34 user account that's how they have equity
72:36 in what they're doing so if they need
72:38 money to expand without giving them any
72:41 money just giving them a subscription
72:43 really helps the business model just
72:45 keep that in mind but there's two
72:49 podcasts so you know go to the device
72:52 you want to listen to it on visit the
72:53 site hit the podcast link boom it'll
72:55 hook you up there are two primary social
73:00 media with mines com not sure minds.com
73:02 is gonna survive doesn't have much
73:04 traffic it's kind of a weird site and
73:05 they only allow 15 minute videos which
73:08 is really going to it's going to
73:11 challenge their competition with
73:13 Facebook but it is a beautiful site but
73:15 the other two are Twitter which I just
73:17 post the feed on don't do much else and
73:19 then there's Facebook which is booming
73:22 but it's a lock Facebook group which
73:23 gives you a little bit of you know
73:25 privacy from employers trying to see
73:26 what you're doing they can't see in the
73:28 page there are two direct ways to donate
73:32 to the page which is PayPal and again
73:35 thank you for the some of those who have
73:36 donated recently through paper
73:38 again your fully anonymous I have no
73:40 idea who you are so I'd put you in the
73:42 credits if if I could figure that out
73:44 but patreon is a monthly thing you can
73:49 put like a dollar and you put 99 cents
73:50 in a month I think is the smallest one
73:52 what they get to you is early access to
73:54 at least 90% of the episodes again
73:57 sometimes you're gonna have days of
73:59 episodes I put one up there that is
74:01 strictly for patreon people the other
74:06 two are affiliate programs I have but
74:08 there are two products I really believe
74:09 in one is the brave but brave a little
74:12 Aloha one of them is the brave browser
74:16 which cuts off all their surveillance
74:18 from your searches the two steps you
74:20 need to do is download the brave browser
74:21 just go to brave com I got a link up
74:24 there that supposedly if you go through
74:26 that I get some sort of credit I've
74:27 never gotten a single penny out that
74:29 thing but what it does is it shuts down
74:31 all the add trackers and you can switch
74:34 your search engine over to DuckDuckGo
74:36 very easily inside the Preferences that
74:38 cuts Google off completely so the deep
74:40 state gets their head cut off when it
74:42 comes to your social profile online very
74:45 very important by the way I do not
74:48 promote VPN software of any kind because
74:51 I think it's all a hoax VPN software
74:54 just just to put this in your back
74:56 pocket because I can't create a whole
74:57 episode on it it's very important for
74:59 you to understand VPN servers obviously
75:02 you bounce through a bunch of servers
75:04 and your traffic continually gets forded
75:06 off by a bunch of servers that are
75:07 supposed to have their logs turned off I
75:09 mean they have no idea who you are your
75:11 IP address flows through gets reassigned
75:13 until your IP at the other end doesn't
75:15 show up now that will work for the
75:19 recipient usually meaning they won't
75:21 know who you are that is true but your
75:24 deep state is setting up these VPS VPN
75:26 companies and they are just watching you
75:28 walk around the internet you are not
75:30 anonymous by any stretch even if they
75:32 have the logs turned off there's other
75:34 ways they can log your data into other
75:36 super servers and so you're not
75:37 protected so that's why don't believe
75:39 any of that crap you can use it if you
75:41 want but just use the brave browser and
75:43 it'll cut off most of what's going on so
75:45 if you want to do that
75:46 you know just know it's marginal
75:47 protection but the other service that I
75:51 use personally is called
75:52 Blaz calm its a backup software five
75:55 bucks will get your 30 days of your
75:57 drives fully backed up it's infinite
76:00 number of drives two computers so I have
76:03 a laptop and a desktop they're both
76:04 backed up 24/7 but if you pay two extra
76:06 bucks you get the other 11 months out of
76:09 the year this is something they recently
76:10 changed I forgot to mention so I pay
76:14 seven bucks a month and I have probably
76:18 18 terabytes backed up on a daily basis
76:21 while I'm asleep
76:22 definitely it yourself a good internet
76:24 connection at your house - it's the
76:25 upload that matters in that particular
76:27 thing for any of you looking for episode
76:30 1 episodes or season 1 episodes excuse
76:33 me they're not on this channel anymore
76:35 in terms of search ability they're still
76:38 on but they're unlisted because they all
76:39 have all kinds of musical problems and
76:41 copyright strikes and also the crap so
76:44 I've remastered them all and I put them
76:47 on a separate channel as not to mess
76:50 with all the numbering of this
76:51 particular channel so--but shoot has it
76:53 all and a beautiful line from one to
76:55 whatever we're on or at 4:29 today if
77:00 you want to see those go to the website
77:01 click season 1 takes you to the other
77:03 channel just go ahead and subscribe
77:04 unless you've seen all 100 and they just
77:06 have it in your subscriptions when you
77:08 want to run off and look at an old
77:09 episode they're not as we find is this
77:12 format but the content is really really
77:14 fundamental there's a lot of
77:16 self-improvement
77:17 in the season one from things you know
77:20 regarding you know alcoholism suicide -
77:23 how to get a job how to be creative how
77:26 to do design all those kind of things
77:29 there's a lot of stuff in there it's
77:30 really healthy for you guys because you
77:32 never know you never know if you might
77:33 have interest until someone talks you
77:35 through it but for all those of you
77:37 who've stuck on forever I appreciate you
77:40 very very much
77:41 until the next episode take care of
77:44 yourself and someone else and I will see
77:46 you in the next deep thoughts over now
