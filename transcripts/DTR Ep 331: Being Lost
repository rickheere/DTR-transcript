00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts today we're gonna take a
00:38 stab at something that happens a lot in
00:41 this world I think it happens for people
00:44 of all ages I would say less for
00:48 teeny-tiny people like babies and kids
00:51 but the second one is supposed to take
00:54 control over their life this feeling can
00:58 be the result of that responsibility
01:01 fairly quickly I've seen a ton of it in
01:05 my days and I think I will continue to
01:08 see a ton of it doesn't really after you
01:12 hit about 15 or so years old you could
01:16 be in it for a long time you could have
01:18 it happen to you over and over and over
01:20 it's frustrating when you're not
01:23 experiencing it or you haven't
01:25 experienced it either ever or for a
01:28 really long time and it's this feeling
01:31 of feeling lost you know there are times
01:36 when we as individuals burden ourselves
01:40 with feeling like we should know where
01:42 we're going and then there's definite
01:44 moments in time or at least in the
01:46 western United States you're supposed to
01:50 know where you're going right and it's
01:54 more intense than just oh you know I
01:57 should take this a degree or I should do
02:01 this in that what I've come to realize
02:03 is that it actually is multi-dimensional
02:05 I used to think it was just a single
02:09 person's individual inability to find
02:11 out where they're going right and then
02:15 through other analyses and meeting
02:18 people and having pretty good
02:20 discussions where we're not really
02:21 talking about being lost because nobody
02:23 wants to admit that but you're clearly
02:25 sitting across the table from someone
02:27 it's just completely lost right it
02:29 happens right so you do your best to try
02:31 and orient them and make them feel
02:32 comfortable but the the added extra
02:37 thing and they're most likely you know
02:40 kind of an infinite combination of
02:41 things we'd get into this realm but one
02:44 of the big ones is you feel like you
02:47 need to please someone
02:49 and so you're trying to pick something
02:52 that will make someone else happy and
02:57 that's the kiss of death because it has
02:59 nothing to do with you and you have to
03:03 live with your choice every single day
03:06 hmm
03:08 isn't it interesting that just in about
03:10 I know three minutes we've covered
03:12 enough of the subject to prove to
03:15 ourselves that we never get this kind of
03:16 education in schools right where's the
03:20 class about finding your major in
03:22 college where's the class about what are
03:25 you interested in doing for a living how
03:29 do you want to spend your life do you
03:30 want to be married with kids do you want
03:31 to have a job do you want to be sitting
03:34 at home living off somebody else and no
03:35 kids you know whatever if someone wants
03:38 to support you okay up to you guys
03:41 you know and then there's the different
03:43 personalities of people that when they
03:45 are lost they're either gonna seek help
03:49 which is the most intelligent of the
03:52 entire bunch right they're able to come
03:54 to you and say man I have no idea but
03:56 I'm supposed to be picking a major in
03:58 college I'm supposed to be figuring this
04:00 out and this out you know maybe they
04:02 graduate and they're still trying to
04:03 figure out what's going on maybe they
04:05 got divorced they don't know what to do
04:06 maybe they've been doing this job
04:08 forever and the job disappears in the
04:10 thirty-five forty-five years old they're
04:12 like oh my god I got a wife and kids and
04:14 kids going into college and I got no
04:16 money what do I do it just makes you
04:21 feel lost sometimes people get in over
04:24 their head with drugs and alcohol and
04:26 what-have-you and that makes them loss
04:28 they got a good job they got people who
04:30 love them but for whatever reason the
04:34 the addictions are consuming all their
04:36 money and all the time and all their
04:38 loyalty their way past I got a Harvard
04:41 ph.d never had a problem in school never
04:45 had a problem getting a job you're just
04:47 hooked on something you could get dumped
04:49 by somebody you thought everything was
04:52 going great and then out of the [ __ ]
04:55 nowhere someone dumps you right you know
04:58 I think we've all experienced that I'm
05:00 gonna definitely share some of my
05:01 my gyms to help you understand but now I
05:06 had a situation where when I was young I
05:09 tried a ton of different stuff instead
05:13 of finding out what I didn't like and
05:15 what I did like I found out that I
05:16 pretty much loved everything and that's
05:19 a bummer
05:20 yeah I loved being academic I loved
05:24 being creative and when I say love I
05:27 mean it's just as it's like feeling like
05:31 a hand fitting into a nice glove and the
05:34 glove is the universe and then you pull
05:37 your hand down you put in another glove
05:38 no oh my god this was so good you know
05:40 you know I would read a book and feel my
05:43 purpose not necessarily with the content
05:45 of the book but with the experience of
05:47 reading a book I paint a painting you
05:49 know that's my whole purpose write a
05:50 song it was like what program moved
05:52 application whatever all right I didn't
05:56 have the college major problem because
05:58 by the time I was 18 I was smart enough
06:00 to do what I wanted to do professionally
06:03 you know just well those things that
06:05 happens problems a lot of you too right
06:07 as I got older and met younger and
06:11 younger people especially when I really
06:14 started teaching
06:14 I'd say my early 30s I would find people
06:20 that like I said in a previous episode
06:22 recently you know who felt like they
06:24 were lost they just need a little bit of
06:27 encouragement and what's interesting is
06:31 is you know I you know I think that you
06:36 can be lost where you can't ask for help
06:38 because you're smart enough to
06:40 understand it is your burden you have to
06:43 figure things out for yourself now you
06:45 can use your friends and your family and
06:47 life to satiate yourself during the
06:50 perhaps frustrating phase or terrifying
06:53 phase or scary phase of not knowing
06:55 exactly where things are gonna go next
06:57 right but the other one you have to
07:01 remember I'll jump ahead too quickly but
07:06 the idea is to manifest the destiny that
07:08 you're really looking for
07:11 - obviously dabble in several things so
07:15 that you
07:15 have some choices in life right like
07:20 Walt Disney said it's hard to choose
07:22 from one so when you bring you know
07:25 someone bring him a sketch of like oh I
07:27 think this cartoon character could look
07:29 like this they'd only bring him one he
07:32 says that's pretty cool
07:33 but it's hard to choose from one need to
07:35 go draw me like three or four more maybe
07:37 your next ones better but now what leads
07:40 to a life where you don't get lost as
07:43 much and for those of you who've ever
07:46 experienced it or you're in it now this
07:51 is kind of a precursor to what you might
07:53 do adjusting your future because I will
07:57 say this before I get started you know
07:59 terribly deep in this understand that
08:01 you're okay we're gonna find out what it
08:04 is you need to do and you're gonna be
08:08 okay you will because no matter what
08:12 happens if you lose a job there's
08:14 another job out there if you lose a
08:15 loved one or you know you get dumped I
08:18 should say there will be someone else
08:20 and if you've never done something
08:23 before in your life you're 18 years old
08:26 you're coming up on 18 you're like oh my
08:28 god this College thinks I should know
08:30 what I'm should be doing yep you should
08:34 have maybe played in enough things that
08:38 you have some ideas of what turns you on
08:40 now there's a few areas right so this is
08:43 enter like introspective lost feeling
08:48 which is you may not know who you are
08:50 anymore
08:51 right I tell the story all the time
08:53 where I worked from the age of 17 pretty
08:57 hardcore up til oh I'd say about my
09:04 early 40s and I had to shut down my
09:08 company because of the whole subprime
09:12 loan scandal had nailed most of my
09:14 clients of the ones that were healthy we
09:16 were done we were done doing the work
09:18 for them so we were finished and again
09:20 we what it was is a I created a company
09:24 with one of my former employees where we
09:28 made casual
09:29 on gaming platforms and the games that
09:31 run on them and so but we did all kinds
09:34 of weird [ __ ] - I mean music studios and
09:37 conference calling robots and just we
09:39 got our reputation we can do anything so
09:42 we did really well but then it blew
09:44 apart for a bunch of different reasons
09:46 but the main one being the economy
09:48 slumping and so I had to shut it down I
09:54 mean I tried I tried to find gigs I
09:58 found a gig that was potentially keep my
10:01 doors open in six more months but the
10:03 gig looked really I should say what we
10:09 say it it looked very suspicious like it
10:12 wasn't gonna work out there had the
10:14 wrong people on this team it was an
10:15 external team trying to use our
10:17 resources and I told to see I said you
10:20 know I think this is gonna be the end of
10:22 your company because I work with your
10:23 company for four years before you came
10:25 on board and she said yeah I think
10:27 you're right and sure enough the project
10:29 was cancelled and never happened these
10:31 these fossils that were trying to act
10:34 hitman we're just taking the company
10:36 down a really bad stint of trying to
10:39 drain their their last round of venture
10:42 capital which is so sad
10:45 anyway as some of you heard I popped out
10:47 of this face and I ended up sitting at
10:51 home and I was just thinking to myself
10:53 you know I don't know who I am you know
10:56 I mean I I know some of the stuff I've
10:59 done in the past I like a lot of that
11:01 stuff life has been really good to me so
11:03 I wasn't feeling like you know depressed
11:06 or anything but it was just like Jesus I
11:08 just need to go and do nothing just let
11:11 it all settle down right it's like when
11:13 someone kicks up all the dirt in the
11:14 pond and then you want to see the fish
11:16 again you get a hold still right so I
11:19 went to the beach a little black book
11:20 nothing in it and a pin and no shirt and
11:26 I just set that just eating across the
11:28 street
11:29 I came over I'd sit down on the steps
11:30 and Huntington Beach here just look look
11:34 at the ocean look at the people
11:35 something would occur to me I'd write it
11:37 down I probably always been pushed into
11:42 episodes so
11:43 there's no mystery as to what was in the
11:44 book for you guys and it took like three
11:50 to four months I just sat there all
11:51 summer I think it was 2013 the summer of
11:54 2013 and yeah that's exactly what it was
12:00 and by the end of the year when I popped
12:02 out of this coma
12:03 I felt way better and just I didn't
12:07 really have this feeling for a love of a
12:09 job necessarily at the end of the game
12:11 because I did I don't think I really
12:13 lost the will to work in any way shape
12:16 or form I just was like what kind of
12:18 work should I do by the end of the year
12:22 I got a gig and did it for two years
12:25 little like a weird side coding gig I
12:28 had encoded like exclusively like that
12:31 for a really long time right when I was
12:33 a kid and my teens I again I did
12:38 everything I did everything I could do I
12:39 you know I read enough books that being
12:42 a scientist seemed really cool going to
12:43 you know get a degree in something then
12:47 I got into it was definitely an artist
12:50 from birth I didn't really get into
12:53 music as much in my teens later happened
12:57 in my 20s but I got into programming I
13:00 got the digital art so the whole
13:03 ecosystem to make a video game that was
13:06 me just figuring out every trick in the
13:08 book
13:08 talking to every one of my you know
13:10 mentors and my hometown and it was very
13:15 rewarding I told my job when I was 14
13:18 that I wanted to be a computer
13:19 programmer and he said you don't know
13:21 [ __ ] now he was right but he didn't have
13:24 any idea that I was actually fully
13:26 serious about it right wasn't trying to
13:28 be an [ __ ] and so I came out and what
13:31 I did immediately now the interesting
13:35 thing was when I came out I was not lost
13:38 in my career I was kind of lost in
13:41 California but I was like it's
13:43 California who cares I didn't grow up
13:45 with palm trees palm trees are great the
13:48 weather is awesome I can go to the ocean
13:51 anytime I want to something that you
13:53 know I'd only seen maybe two or three
13:54 times of my life before then
13:56 you know and always on vacations right
13:58 so I didn't care that I was lost I was
14:01 like being lost in Disneyland or being
14:03 lost in the back lot at Universal and
14:05 the universal in the 1950s you know New
14:08 York it's okay to be lost in some places
14:12 sometimes enjoy it right it's really
14:16 funny I had a good lunch recently was
14:21 something with someone and they they had
14:24 the the guts to say I got trust issues
14:29 which could be you know trust Trust
14:33 trust abandonment all that kind of stuff
14:34 and I just said I said so do I and so
14:40 does the whole world everyone's got it
14:42 so don't feel weird if you got trust
14:45 issues or you gained what the further
14:49 classification which would be
14:50 abandonment issues right and I think
14:54 that that has a lot to do with the
14:57 feeling of being lost now there's some
15:00 things where you're being lost because
15:01 of an individual rejecting you and then
15:04 there's which could be someone cheating
15:07 on you or whatever right they're
15:08 rejecting you in some metaphorical what
15:09 they've chosen someone else right and
15:11 then there's that feeling of being lost
15:13 that is more related to the universe and
15:16 not an individual right you lost your
15:20 job you your economy's crashing around
15:23 you or something like this now in 2018
15:26 as a human being in the United States of
15:28 America hit which means in being into my
15:32 late 40s you dial it all the way back to
15:34 your 20s and your teens and because of
15:37 the ride that America has had I can't
15:40 speak for any other country you'd almost
15:42 guaranteed to have had all of these
15:44 things happen to you in your lifetime
15:46 and it you know it makes you stronger
15:48 every single time you hurt your skin
15:50 right you get cut and the scar tissue is
15:53 really thick right and so you get you
15:57 know you when you're Bonesmen from being
15:59 broken you get a big old knot on your
16:00 bones where they came together and it
16:02 kind of was confused and it grows this
16:03 little knot well that's actually
16:05 stronger than the rest of the bone
16:07 interesting one a metaphor for how
16:09 things heal your heart heals and you
16:11 become stronger first time you get
16:13 dumped oh my god it's the worst feeling
16:16 in the world you feel like you're gonna
16:17 die you feel nauseous and sick and you
16:20 can't imagine the person that you know
16:22 he were with ever being with somebody
16:24 else ever just feeling love for someone
16:27 else when you're really really young
16:28 right and then you start to hopefully
16:34 examine yourself now sometimes you get
16:38 dumped because in the stage that you're
16:41 in and when you were with them you were
16:43 an [ __ ] and you need to change and
16:45 boy honestly speaking if you can figure
16:48 that out about yourself and make the
16:50 little change or make several changes
16:51 maybe a couple big ones you realize you
16:56 know when you get older that those
16:58 changes were something that was free you
17:00 just identified it and you said I'm not
17:03 doing this anymore
17:04 boom and guess what
17:07 from that point on you are fixed
17:10 permanently right how many people were
17:13 strung out on alcohol paid massive
17:16 prices lost marriages lost their kids
17:20 lost their jobs lost everything they
17:22 ever built up maybe money homes whatever
17:24 or just happiness and then one day they
17:30 just say enough is enough
17:32 I'm not doing this anymore boom I guess
17:36 what it was free for them to do that now
17:38 they paid the price before they made the
17:40 big ultimate decision but in the end the
17:42 solution was free and just like the
17:45 shoes on Dorothy and Wizard of Oz you
17:47 could have clicked your heels the whole
17:49 time sooner the better
17:52 right now with people you know I had a
17:56 relationship last time I had one of
18:00 those surprise breakups it was
18:03 fascinating it was dated this person you
18:08 know I guess he could say just about ten
18:11 months about ten months you know it was
18:13 like not quite the full relationship in
18:15 the first few months but by the time I
18:17 was over it was heavy-duty and I was
18:19 invited to this person's life in a very
18:21 ten sways slept over all the time hung
18:23 out all the time and it was really going
18:27 somewhere it really felt like wow you
18:29 know I've I'm not a little kid anymore
18:31 I'm in my forties and I think this could
18:34 last this person kept inviting me
18:37 further and further into the family
18:39 further and further into things related
18:41 to her her child everything was going
18:46 great and then one day I go over and
18:50 she's acting really strange and then
18:53 with no remorse okay there's just a
18:57 breakup she just said something to me
18:59 that meant you know we're not gonna be
19:00 together anymore and I was just like it
19:04 was so unbelievably bizarre that I was
19:08 like not really that angry you know
19:11 obviously really oh okay
19:15 it almost feels like this can't last
19:17 because this is so weird right and then
19:20 um you know then I go through this
19:23 really strange you know kubler-ross
19:26 thing you know for like a couple months
19:28 I started to sink in I'm but I'm just
19:30 ultra confused as to what was going on I
19:33 moved on with life but then about six
19:37 months later almost to the month right
19:40 the person came back and said I don't
19:43 know why we broke up why did we break up
19:45 like I don't know you're the one that
19:46 did it and we tried to hang out again
19:48 and it was it was an interesting reason
19:54 why we decided not to talk again but it
20:00 kind of ended nicely we kind of ended up
20:02 being fairly you know decent friends
20:04 with each other and we texted every once
20:06 in a while back in the days several
20:07 years ago and so you know I felt I found
20:13 myself in a relationship
20:16 bubble lost as to what happened like you
20:20 always ask yourself what did you do
20:22 right we let this helicopter do its
20:24 thing when I was in high school though
20:26 and my first high school sweetheart we
20:29 broke up and it was like you know the
20:34 Hollywood think the total ton of bricks
20:36 it was like Ben Stiller and Something
20:39 About Mary at the very end and he's just
20:41 crying rocking industry that was me but
20:44 I had been a total jerk-off I said the
20:46 store a couple times I realized that I
20:48 was super duper jealous I was protecting
20:50 this girl you know I was like 15 16 in
20:52 their first girlfriend really that was
20:56 super super duper serious and so what I
20:59 figured out was that it was me I made
21:02 the decision to change and I went from
21:05 being lost to being found again and even
21:07 though I knew I was never gonna get back
21:09 with that girl ever again I still felt
21:12 much more confident when I bumped into
21:14 the next girl because I'm like who you
21:17 know it's important you go out with your
21:19 friends go out with your friends and you
21:20 hang out talk to that guys little big
21:22 deal right if you're gonna switch to
21:23 that do it I'd rather know now than
21:25 later right so you good you get in there
21:27 you do that right the one time I found
21:29 myself unemployed and I've said this
21:32 story a couple times and where I
21:36 manifested okay I think it certainly
21:40 felt like this but when I was working
21:42 for the TurboTax folks and again it was
21:45 in there for about two years they laid
21:47 us off and they just ad they just had
21:51 tried to expand too quickly there's been
21:53 too much money at the time and you know
21:55 I'm here in California from the Midwest
21:58 and I don't have like any money like
22:01 yeah you know I have what was in the
22:02 bank my severance pay check which
22:04 apartment might have been two weeks
22:05 worth to pay and I'm sitting there I
22:08 think at the time yeah I was renting a I
22:13 was running the garage from a really
22:15 good family at my church so I wasn't
22:17 like totally worried about not eating or
22:20 you know whatever but you know these
22:22 jobs were very coveted very I mean I
22:25 walked in as the 18th employee of the
22:26 company that you know was creating this
22:29 thing eventually became TurboTax so very
22:33 very coveted thing and I moved up to the
22:34 company it was great and then Pugh
22:36 right out the door the ton of other
22:38 people so I remember three of us who
22:42 were friends went to one of our friends
22:45 homes we went in the back and it was by
22:48 April 16th Kant Merton 1989 I think it
22:52 was and we're just sitting outside by a
22:55 pool and we're looking at each other
22:57 like well Jesus what do we do now
22:59 I mean seriously one of my buddies lived
23:01 with his parents the girl that we were
23:04 hanging out with I forgot her situation
23:06 but she a lot of local family she was
23:08 gonna be alright well the next day when
23:12 we came in to get our stuff that's when
23:14 the do gave me the little tiny it looked
23:16 like a fortune cookie and a fortune
23:18 cookie piece of paper right that's how
23:20 big the ad was and it said video game
23:22 artists call this phone number I was in
23:24 Oxnard California and I'm sitting here
23:26 in Camarillo living in are living in
23:28 Camarillo he's living in Camarillo
23:30 working Camarillo and so I went and did
23:34 the interview and then to calm the
23:36 computer and did my my test and came
23:38 back and got the job so within one week
23:43 I went from having a job losing a job
23:45 feeling absolutely like geographically
23:49 and financially lost like oh my god what
23:52 am I gonna do now over panicking of
23:54 course because I'm young and then
23:57 getting the next job okay so let's talk
24:04 about pleasing other people it's not bad
24:09 to please other people all right it's
24:11 not bad it's not even bad to make a
24:13 sacrifice to please other people that
24:16 could be a very noble thing I think it
24:19 was the actor Steve Carell if I'm right
24:23 that was a situation where his wife who
24:27 was very beautiful is very beautiful I
24:29 think she was also an actress and they
24:33 wanted to have a family and if I got the
24:35 story right she deliberately stopped
24:39 auditioning so she could raise their
24:41 kids and then he went off and made it
24:44 and so then of course he he's thanked
24:47 his wife a couple times at ceremonies
24:49 which i think is super cool
24:50 but she made the ultimate sacrifice for
24:52 the both of them
24:53 and I'm hoping she's very happy with
24:55 that choice but sometimes we want to
24:59 please people that we shouldn't try to
25:02 please you know saying like they will
25:05 not matter they're not Allah they're not
25:07 a lifelong participant in your life or
25:10 they shouldn't be burdening you
25:11 burdening you with the need to please
25:13 them at all
25:15 Kenny one of the most common I think
25:18 mistakes the kids make is worrying about
25:21 what the parents think I yeah you want
25:27 your parent you want to be a good kid
25:29 you only be a good person and so your
25:30 parents can say that's a great kid you
25:32 know I've raised a great human being and
25:34 hey if you're a good human being there's
25:36 very little that it will take to get
25:39 that reward in life right that
25:41 classification so your parents feel
25:43 great on their deathbed or whatever
25:45 that's what you want there's the classic
25:50 one from the Midwest and it happens in
25:52 every sector of the world but a family
25:55 has had a business for a really long
25:56 time they've worked really hard it could
25:59 be a business that's 200 years old or 50
26:01 years old doesn't matter
26:02 they worked extremely hard to get
26:04 customers a storefront all their vendors
26:07 you know so they can you know keep a
26:08 profit going on and they expect you to
26:13 keep the business going but maybe you
26:17 have some aspirations I've known folks
26:22 that have taken over the family business
26:25 and absolutely loved it and to this day
26:27 you know they are the the template of
26:30 happiness in this world right and I know
26:32 folks that took it over hated it and
26:37 either quit or continued but they really
26:40 they point a lot of anger at their
26:44 parents for forcing it on them on them I
26:46 know folks that have run off and done
26:49 much bigger and better things and made
26:51 themselves extremely happy and the
26:53 family eventually said you know what we
26:55 had no idea you were that good at that
26:57 so the fact that you totally totally
27:00 knocked it out of the park we're really
27:03 glad you did
27:04 and then there's the fourth one which is
27:07 the kid had everything ditch the family
27:11 business went off and never really tried
27:15 anything but never risked anything just
27:18 said I don't want to do that
27:20 I'll go over here and they end up
27:22 completely failing and they end up
27:24 coming back to the parents and they
27:26 don't want to take over the business or
27:28 they try to and it's already gone
27:31 because they missed the loop right the
27:33 generation it was supposed to take over
27:34 gone family sold the business to people
27:36 they drove it into the ground they turn
27:38 it from a hardware store to a barbecue
27:41 shop to a [ __ ] parking lot so seen
27:46 all these different scenarios in my
27:48 lifetime the saddest one is the kid it
27:52 didn't really have a dream and one often
27:55 just pissed away everything right I know
27:58 when it was like that really sad so
28:02 every time I meet a family I just met
28:03 one at the at this restaurant nhb the
28:08 parents had built an RV company and I
28:12 was sitting next to the mom and the son
28:13 and great people and I so she's handing
28:19 the business to the son it sounds like
28:21 this slowly cool guy I looked at him and
28:23 I said you know you're very lucky to
28:25 have a family business that you can take
28:26 over I hope you like it and I hope you
28:29 take it over and I hope you blow it up
28:30 or do whatever you can do just have fun
28:32 with it right and he was the ideal son
28:35 he was just like oh I know this is great
28:38 I love this job I think he had a brother
28:41 that was already in it too
28:43 so it's just like it was gonna be two
28:44 bros working on it but anyway they're
28:47 taking care of the family business and I
28:48 gonna get definitely gonna go one more
28:50 generation and this kids like early 20s
28:53 or whatever so it's gonna go potentially
28:55 another 50 60 years it's awesome you
29:00 know and if if you can I mean I'm just
29:02 going to digress on this a little bit
29:04 more but if you can hang on to it for 50
29:06 60 years
29:07 your child doesn't have to take it over
29:09 their child can take it over you know
29:12 saying but it's always been the
29:17 mantra of my family that you're sort of
29:20 just allowed to be whoever you want to
29:23 be the only thing that everyone hopes
29:26 that you'll end up doing is be happy
29:28 right you know my analogy since I was a
29:32 kid was you know I'm gonna take my kids
29:35 and I'm gonna push them up with the
29:37 palms of my hand and hopefully get them
29:40 to the next step up there that I can't
29:42 access from where I am I'll never see
29:44 the step that they're at a step of
29:46 intelligence a step of insights
29:49 intellectual feelings all that kind of
29:52 stuff right you want them to be smarter
29:55 and more clever and all that good stuff
29:58 and if I die in the ditch but they're up
30:01 there it's perfect right we'll have done
30:05 my deed but now let's go for the big one
30:09 since we talked about some easy ones
30:11 let's go after a giant one and we've
30:14 done this before I think I got an
30:18 episode called getting back up here's my
30:21 advice okay and this is going to be
30:24 going after your past if you're
30:27 currently lost it's gonna be going after
30:28 your past first and there's a reason for
30:30 this but for those of you who aren't
30:32 lost right now even if you've never been
30:36 lost in your life I think the secret in
30:39 the formula to making sure that you
30:41 never ever ever feel like you're lost
30:45 and again this is a deep-rooted inner
30:48 psyche psychological issue meaning you
30:52 and your opinion of yourself you can be
30:55 lost it could be once you've lost this
30:58 inside and you don't even know it that
31:01 other people look at you and they they
31:02 don't know who you are either you're
31:03 just weird and they tend to kind of
31:05 gravitate away they don't want to be
31:08 with you as much because they don't
31:09 understand you they don't know how to
31:10 communicate with you if you're on a
31:13 mission and you know that you're going
31:15 to divorce yourself from reality for a
31:18 little while as you go off on this write
31:19 in a book maybe your Heath Ledger
31:21 studying to be the Joker and you just
31:23 gotta kind of shut your family out
31:24 because you're gonna become this weird
31:25 guy in a hotel
31:28 and then you're jealous rivals gonna
31:31 have you murdered but I think you have
31:33 to constantly be searching for what
31:36 could be unless you're in those wild
31:41 scenarios where like again you've got
31:43 total and utter control you're selling
31:46 air and everyone's buying right and
31:49 there's no competition you got the whole
31:50 lockdown on the patents but if you don't
31:53 have something that sure-fire keep
31:58 looking especially when you're
32:01 comfortable you know look at other
32:03 industries that you might do a lot of
32:05 times one of the best questions I've
32:07 heard asked of celebrities because they
32:10 always get stupid questions right what's
32:12 your inspiration one of the best
32:16 questions I've ever heard is what would
32:17 you do if you didn't do this super
32:20 famous actor super famous scientist
32:22 whatever you're even your neighbor if
32:25 you weren't doing this it's something
32:27 it's usually more interesting I think
32:28 with celebrities because they have so
32:31 od'd on a particular career
32:33 that to ask that questions like well
32:35 this is my whole life and it's like yes
32:37 Prince what would you do if you weren't
32:39 a musician and you just you sit there
32:42 and you just get on the edge of your
32:42 seat going oh yeah what the hell would
32:45 you do man I mean that's a whole
32:47 dimension of of who that person is you
32:52 know Prince was really good at playing
32:53 basketball like really good but he's
32:56 five three but he was really good I
32:59 heard he played in heels you know make
33:02 it what people's ass out there on the
33:03 court it's amazing so ask yourself the
33:06 question why life is healthy what would
33:09 you do if you did do what you do now to
33:12 be completely fulfilled now obviously
33:15 sometimes that's a fantasy question with
33:16 the fantasy answer and the fantasy
33:18 answer is well this doesn't make any
33:20 money but this is what I would do if it
33:23 did make money hmm all right so that's
33:25 good because it gives you the theme of
33:27 your life it gives you what you live for
33:30 you live for helping people you live for
33:33 whatever whatever it is right but you
33:37 want to find one that is a fallback
33:40 career could be a fallback fantasy
33:42 career now when you look at something
33:48 that is amazing in this world you may
33:53 not realize that if someone hadn't had a
33:55 really big idea the thing that you're
33:58 looking at wouldn't have occurred
34:01 examples the Eiffel Tower if you ever
34:06 see the thing in real life its massive
34:09 it's a it's a country block the four
34:11 legs are really far apart from each
34:13 other okay
34:13 it's a massive amazing structure
34:16 Disneyland
34:17 well of course Disneyland exists okay
34:21 1950 it none of them existed by 1955 it
34:26 was open because Walt Disney had an idea
34:29 he got tired of taking his girls to a
34:32 park where only they got to play on the
34:34 on the equipment and he's just sitting
34:37 there feeding the pigeons it's like I
34:39 want something where a mom and dad and
34:41 everyone could could be involved and I
34:43 wanted it to be more than just a
34:45 carnival there was plenty carnivals back
34:46 in the day he wanted story and rides to
34:49 come together and the rides were
34:51 actually designed to augment the story
34:53 and so the Peter Pan ride you're
34:55 actually taking off with Peter Pan on
34:57 one of those boats ingenious but without
35:02 the idea and the balls and the courage
35:04 and all that good stuff you never try it
35:09 so when you're sitting at home and
35:11 everything is comfortable and cool and
35:13 again there's no crime and keeping the
35:15 same career to the day you die you're
35:17 lucky if you can do that teachers have
35:19 that that privilege which is really cool
35:23 you know it's like I don't really hear
35:25 of a recession and teachers you know
35:27 it's interesting hopefully that never
35:28 happens that kind of thing but for those
35:30 of us in the you know the corporate
35:34 world or the entrepreneurial world we
35:36 have to continue asking these questions
35:38 I think right and before we dive into
35:43 the other side and get you prepped in
35:47 another way one of the most I think
35:52 heartbreaking moments that you could
35:55 have if you feel lost for even a split
35:57 second it could be almost like you live
35:59 a whole life in a split second in your
36:01 mind is your single living by yourself
36:06 and everything goes tits up at that
36:11 point you know you get to I don't know
36:15 depending on your Constitution depending
36:16 on the confidence you have in yourself
36:18 depending on your experience before you
36:20 actually have this ever happened to you
36:21 you may just go whatever I got to find a
36:23 job Jesus let's just file for
36:25 unemployment you know if that's not
36:27 enough well then I'll get a roommate or
36:29 I'll beg and borrow a few bucks from
36:31 friends but I'm gonna go out and be
36:33 really aggressive I'm gonna knock on
36:34 every single door and I'll be back on my
36:36 feet don't even worry about it
36:37 right and that's kind of attitude you
36:39 need it's constructive it's not
36:41 unrealistic but you have some freedoms
36:44 when you're completely by yourself
36:45 whether you're not know it or not right
36:47 especially the younger that you are you
36:49 know you may need to move to a different
36:53 place in the world you may find out that
36:58 just moving from where you are to
37:01 another area like let's just say I'm
37:02 gonna give you an easy kind of
37:05 low-hanging for an example which is the
37:08 following you're in Seattle hey I've
37:11 never been a lot of family lives up
37:13 there somehow and so it's kind of dark
37:17 and rainy even you know the good times
37:19 it gets cold just like every other place
37:21 in wintertime and maybe that just kind
37:24 of sours your your viewpoint on the
37:27 world maybe some people love it that's
37:29 why they live there right because when
37:30 it's green it's green it's beautiful
37:32 right I've definitely been to Portland
37:34 Oregon but maybe you need to go to the
37:36 desert of Arizona New Mexico maybe you
37:40 need a more tropical setting so you go
37:42 to La Jolla in San Diego you go to
37:45 Hawaii you find a job in those areas you
37:49 never know until you look right maybe
37:52 you want a big giant city like New York
37:54 City maybe you want the party life of
37:57 Miami maybe you want the rural rural
38:00 area of like some Amish place in Wyoming
38:04 or somewhere Utah
38:06 maybe the whole change of venue is what
38:10 you need maybe your skill sets are
38:12 better employed in different areas so
38:14 there's only one job in your area that's
38:16 available per year for what you do and
38:19 you just need to get to a different area
38:20 so that those opportunities open up
38:22 maybe there's a skill set and those
38:25 other areas that you've never seen but
38:27 when you see it it's gonna be like
38:29 getting bit by some mutant virus it's
38:32 gonna make you so happy man
38:34 I you know this is gonna sound stupid
38:37 but I've debated making an episode
38:41 called being cool I think I may have
38:44 said that back in season 1 and because
38:49 there's a science to it there's a super
38:51 science to it I tried to study those
38:56 around me who were super cool and I've
38:58 got a couple stories in season 1 being
39:02 lost but being cool can go together
39:06 really really well what am I talking
39:10 about well when you have something
39:18 happened to you that it's very
39:19 differential from where you were meaning
39:21 today was completely different than all
39:24 the days that were seen to be pretty
39:26 much the same right you get fired you
39:28 have a car accident you get some weird
39:30 news you just wake up and feel funny
39:33 again something different is occurring
39:35 today you're probably becoming more
39:39 enlightened by either force by something
39:41 happening to you or your own realization
39:44 that you're like oh my god you know but
39:48 what is being cool everyone's supposed
39:51 to be it I guess right the idea is you
39:56 have perspective on what you care about
39:57 do you you see people that are mean
40:01 there's some people that are just numb
40:02 and they get mistaken for cool they just
40:04 don't have any emotions at all but there
40:07 are folks that know exactly what's going
40:09 on they're very cognitive their world
40:11 they know they expect the unexpected is
40:14 sort of a good mantra to life and
40:16 instead of living in a state of 10
40:19 tension and Pat and panic because
40:21 something could happen that they
40:22 wouldn't expect they've run all the
40:26 scenarios out in their brain for the
40:28 category of this unexpected thing that
40:30 could occur and so they relax one of the
40:35 things I'm notorious for personally is
40:37 driving my car Los Angeles or any packed
40:40 area and I have like this again
40:44 pictorial memory this photographic
40:45 memory this it's again I turn it on when
40:48 I need it and I you know I don't use it
40:51 when I don't need it so it's when these
40:52 things but I take full inventory of all
40:53 the cars around me their velocities
40:55 who's in the car whether or not they're
40:57 a punk you know boy who's gonna be
41:00 trying to prove something to someone it
41:01 doesn't exist or you know some old
41:04 person is just really just hanging on
41:06 for dear life whether I think there's
41:08 someone who's a foreigner who's fresh
41:10 off the boat who's struggling with the
41:12 whole notion of steering a big giant
41:14 piece of steel or some really good
41:17 responsible drivers big rigs versus SUVs
41:20 versus some carved a shitty tire it's
41:23 all bent you know when you get done
41:25 taking inventory then you could relax
41:29 check your beers someone come on up on
41:32 you fast cuz it can happen the
41:33 unexpected the oncoming traffic how
41:36 protected are you from that [ __ ] you
41:38 know because you're never gonna be able
41:39 to inventory that stuff it's coming at
41:40 you constantly right but I've had cars
41:43 change lanes in front of me a million
41:46 times
41:47 big rigs all their stuff and the
41:49 passengers in my car now I'm just
41:50 driving a straight line I'm not acting
41:52 crazy but the passengers jump they jump
41:56 hardcore it's happened dozens and dozens
41:58 of time well I'm just sitting there
42:00 being really relaxed and I'm like okay
42:04 yeah if I hadn't gotten out of the way
42:06 this big rig would have probably bumped
42:08 into the car and who the hell knows what
42:10 it would have happened right well that
42:12 analogy can apply to almost every
42:13 category of your life expect the
42:16 unexpected
42:17 you know if the manifest it that's the
42:20 that's the key
42:21 you don't sit around just panicking
42:23 panicking oh she's gonna leave me he's
42:25 gonna leave me what else I'm gonna get
42:28 fire I'm gonna get fired my kids gonna
42:29 eat me or whatever those cliche things
42:31 that happened in
42:32 life to potentially other people night
42:35 you who are the people they interview on
42:37 the news that panic a lot during natural
42:40 disasters they only talk to the people
42:43 who have the ability to say passionately
42:45 you know you never thought it would
42:47 happen to you well how much more calm
42:50 and productive are you if you do think
42:52 it could happen to you we had a lot of
42:55 homes burned down recently in California
42:57 absolutely horrific tragic and very
43:00 suspicious a bunch of people said they
43:04 couldn't believe it would happen to them
43:06 now for some folks they're living in
43:08 Malibu there's not a lot of vegetation
43:10 around them in general it's kind of uh
43:12 kind of a more desert e mountaintop with
43:16 tiny little bushes and stuff they still
43:19 burn very quickly but then you have
43:21 people way up in Paradise who are living
43:23 in dense forests right but now forest
43:27 fires are pretty rare right and the kind
43:30 of forest fires that happened up there
43:32 are proven to be extremely rare right
43:36 but now some folks but and I can't say I
43:40 would have been one of these folks but
43:43 they thought it through they thought
43:45 about fire you know and I'm sure there's
43:47 plenty of people thought about fire that
43:49 they weren't able to stop the disaster
43:51 from hitting them so god bless and let's
43:53 hope they recover it's up they rebuild
43:56 so there's not a big railway going
43:59 through their backyard where their house
44:00 used to be but they they get everything
44:04 away from their house that's flammable
44:05 they spray their house down they do
44:08 whatever they can do they end up saving
44:10 other people's homes because they save
44:12 their own if the firefighters can go on
44:15 to the next house because theirs is okay
44:17 or you know they stopped the flames from
44:20 moving down the street
44:21 a buddy of mine who we're gonna do an
44:25 episode together by his house my former
44:28 host from MK ULTRA radio his house
44:31 survived because the neighbor's house
44:33 got saved and that prevented the fire
44:35 from hitting him in his area thirty-six
44:38 homes burned down just a handful didn't
44:42 his house was fortunate enough to be in
44:43 that stack
44:45 let's say you're on the other side of
44:46 this game you are sitting in what you
44:49 feel to be the most empty room that
44:52 you've ever been in and that could be a
44:54 literal statement or that could be a
44:56 metaphor of as to how you feel inside
44:58 your chest your soul what I always tell
45:03 people is you know time always makes
45:07 things better it's crazy
45:10 that's not exactly what you want to hear
45:12 but the other thing that you don't want
45:16 to hear is that this is gonna last
45:17 forever it's kind of like when you're
45:20 drunk when you're drunk you're like oh
45:23 my god I accidentally drank too damn
45:26 much and you want it away from you and
45:30 off of you as quickly as possible but
45:33 you can't do it can you right you get
45:35 your soda water in your lime and you're
45:37 pounding has maybe some coffee but no
45:39 matter how quickly you try to get this
45:41 thing off of you it's just gonna take
45:43 time
45:43 now what's cool about that I mean it's
45:46 not cool to be drunk but whatever I'm
45:48 not judging you but for me personally I
45:51 hate it usually even in the drunkest a
45:54 that you can possibly be in you know
45:57 what's gonna it's gonna be gone tomorrow
45:59 you know you might have a big-ass
46:00 hangover but it's gonna go away
46:02 Oh being lost being lost feeling lost
46:08 has the same assurance you will find
46:12 yourself you absolutely will the biggest
46:17 fear is resetting usually when you're in
46:20 that state maybe like hey I've been
46:22 doing this job for 20 years 30 years
46:24 it's coming to an end whatever you were
46:27 doing is being replaced by robots or
46:29 there's some other easy way to do it you
46:31 know and so you know you're gonna have
46:34 this period between your money coming in
46:38 now and whatever is gonna be next you
46:42 will find that people are are available
46:47 to help you sometimes friends let's say
46:50 you don't have any friends though say
46:52 you're new to this area in general
46:53 wherever the hell you are your family
46:56 and they don't have money to help you
46:58 right
46:59 the fear is losing maybe some stuff you
47:02 have but I tell you what something
47:07 called the mother of invention and it is
47:09 awesome and the crazy thing about mother
47:13 prevention which probably none of us
47:15 want to admit is that it's probably good
47:19 to feel it every once in a while even if
47:22 you don't have to feel it the extreme
47:27 example that would be you change careers
47:30 on purpose you quit your job on purpose
47:34 no one does this and I'm not
47:36 recommending you do but some sometimes
47:40 it's that risk of going out there and
47:42 going you know what I used to be this
47:45 but now I'm this right how many actors
47:50 and singers and whatever people that you
47:52 know we both mutually know which is why
47:54 I gravitate to that that pyramid of
47:57 people up there but you hear that oh
47:59 they were landscaper before they were a
48:02 doctor they became an actor comedic
48:05 actor what you don't want to do when you
48:09 feel lost is to do nothing now what am I
48:15 talking about didn't I just say I went
48:16 to the beach I did nothing
48:18 well I it's kind of an exaggeration my
48:21 body didn't move that much on the beach
48:23 I was sitting on those concrete steps
48:25 you know looking at the beach my mind
48:30 was going though my mind was moving and
48:32 it became sort of one of these
48:34 unscripted improv plays well I know I
48:39 need to do something I need to do
48:41 something for a living I need to find
48:42 out what do I care about anymore in this
48:45 world do I care about the same things I
48:46 used to care about if the answer came
48:49 back yeah absolutely you like doing
48:52 these things right I came home and
48:55 started building a product which I'm
48:56 still building to this day I'm taking a
48:59 big five-year hiatus on it but I'm gonna
49:01 be getting back into it but that here's
49:04 what happened the product I started
49:06 building I build some technology that
49:10 goes underneath it
49:11 platform and then when I got this job
49:14 basically an ol employee of mine called
49:17 me and said hey can you don't know any
49:20 guys to do this and I said well I do
49:22 that so why don't you exhaust me first
49:24 and then we'll see if we need the other
49:25 people I wouldn't do this interview I
49:28 was like oh yeah that's a one-man job if
49:29 there ever was one
49:30 and so I was able take the technology I
49:32 just recently wrote and brought it to
49:35 this company and did a job it turned it
49:40 into three jobs it was really cool
49:42 they're very satisfied it's very neat
49:45 I'm in a project right now well I'm
49:47 still working in that using my old
49:49 technology but now how did that all come
49:53 about
49:53 I lost my video game company to the
49:57 economy my poor client like for our last
50:00 client lost his company due the economy
50:04 just couldn't get any more investors
50:06 kind of sucked right probably the the
50:11 best thing you could do is tell yourself
50:12 everything's gonna be okay
50:14 you need to hear yourself say it
50:16 genuinely go in the bathroom by yourself
50:20 maybe you look yourself in the mirror if
50:24 you have so much people around you and
50:25 you feel uncomfortable with that get
50:27 your car go somewhere tell yourself talk
50:30 to yourself talk to yourself as the sort
50:35 of positive mentor that you wish you had
50:38 at that point but be logical use the
50:40 stuff that you've learned in your life
50:42 and pretend as if there's a passenger in
50:44 the passenger seat who's actually going
50:46 through this and not you and you look at
50:48 them and you're like well jeez you're
50:49 really smart right you love life you're
50:52 cool obviously every time we hear one of
50:57 our friends losing their jobs getting
50:59 laid off none of us have any fears that
51:01 it's gonna be difficult to get a new job
51:04 we always think that someone's gonna get
51:06 a new job and guess what 99 times and I
51:09 nine times out of a hundred carry the
51:12 nine they always do all right well now
51:17 it's your turn it's your turn to go
51:19 through that weird phase I've heard
51:22 friends of mine buying brand new cars
51:24 very expensive vehicles a kind of
51:27 upside-down in the car and there's an
51:29 accident and it's their fault just one
51:32 of those things that happens well you
51:34 know they got a car it's totaled they
51:36 told the other car thankfully everyone's
51:38 ok insurance rates are gonna go up maybe
51:42 with that insurance hike and all this
51:44 payoff and all the deductibles you're
51:46 not gonna be able to afford that you
51:47 know really fancy car anymore but every
51:50 time you hear it about someone else it's
51:52 okay you believe they're going to
51:54 recover you just feel the empathy for
51:56 their situation someone gets divorced
51:59 you feel the empathy oh man I'm really
52:02 sorry I'm really sorry about that and
52:04 then you know in your mind there's
52:07 plenty of fish in the sea but you don't
52:09 know exactly how they feel about that
52:11 other person maybe they're glad they're
52:13 being too maybe they're the ones using
52:14 to be divorced but still they're gonna
52:16 go through all these different angsty
52:18 moments a lot of times people get
52:21 divorced and they feel like they have to
52:23 they don't want to but they feel like
52:25 they have to and they're they're angry
52:28 that they feel like they have to they
52:30 want to be with that other person it
52:32 used to be different between the two of
52:34 them then now it's changed and they're
52:37 like god dammit why can't you just be
52:39 like you were when I first met you or
52:41 maybe you've changed and you have been
52:43 enlightened so much that you no longer
52:45 have that big compatibility with the
52:47 other person I've had to talk people
52:49 through a lot of different things in my
52:51 lifetime tragedies of all kinds small
52:54 big medium whatever and usually when I
52:59 get to a point where we've kind of
53:01 addressed the immediate panic and
53:04 they're willing to listen to me be a
53:05 little I don't know metaphysical I'll
53:09 say that line
53:10 well just imagine the roles are reversed
53:13 I'm calling you said you calling me and
53:16 I've told you I'm telling you everything
53:18 that just happened to me would you
53:21 believe that I would be okay in the end
53:24 and every time it's a rhetorical
53:26 question everybody goes yeah of course
53:29 okay that's youdo you need to advise
53:33 yourself that you're gonna be okay let
53:36 me ask you this
53:39 HBU live you're born you're born a great
53:45 area great parents great neighbors you
53:49 marry the boy or girl just down the
53:51 street with a great everything as well
53:53 and you have all the kids you ever
53:56 wanted all the possessions you ever
53:57 wanted as new things are invented you
54:00 got it
54:01 do you have one job your entire life and
54:04 you love it and you live all the way to
54:07 the very end however whatever age you
54:11 want to be when you pass away that is
54:12 exactly when your body's gonna give up
54:14 naturally sounds pretty awesome doesn't
54:18 it sounds pretty awesome why does that
54:22 sound awesome
54:24 because it's not your life
54:28 that's the grass is green you're
54:30 Hollywood you know Truman Show life
54:33 that's not the real world that we live
54:35 in it's the Wellsville life right we
54:38 live in the real world where things are
54:40 dynamic things change culture changes
54:44 culture programs people don't want
54:45 things that they shouldn't want and
54:48 you're the victim
54:49 sometimes people changing their minds
54:51 and chasing commercials on TV
54:53 chasing fads right I think in the end
54:58 okay and there's a funny let me give you
55:02 a funny analogy for any of you who have
55:03 seen the movie tombstone with Kurt
55:06 Russell and Val Kilmer among other bill
55:10 paxton a bunch of other amazing actors
55:13 that gentlemen it was a the ultimate
55:16 cowboy and the big the bass get the bar
55:18 how do I say this for those of you
55:20 haven't seen it let me just say this
55:24 much one of them passes away at the end
55:26 of but this way not of a gun wound and
55:34 he's had a really scrappy ass life and
55:38 at the end he dies technically alone in
55:43 the room
55:46 it's one of situations where you can
55:48 only visit so much and then maybe when
55:50 no one's visiting you're you're by
55:53 yourself when you pass right but you
55:55 look at those lifes and you think Jesus
55:57 at the end of this character's life they
56:00 lived they lived four or five different
56:04 lifetimes than the average person who
56:07 had that truman show life there's
56:10 nothing wrong with the truman show life
56:11 you can pull that off then if Shirley
56:15 MacLaine's little new-age world thinking
56:17 that we just talked about was true then
56:19 you pick level one and difficulty and
56:23 there's no problem with that that's what
56:24 you picked or that's what you drew out
56:26 of the deck of cards of life so if
56:29 you're struggling then you might be more
56:33 like that character in tombstone yeah
56:37 you know you've got battle wounds and
56:40 scars scars on your soul scars on your
56:42 heart scars on your skin maybe you're
56:45 missing an eye and you have an eye patch
56:47 you have a peg leg who knows right
56:50 pirates don't wear patches on their eyes
56:52 because they lost their eyes can you
56:55 live an absolutely extraordinary life
56:58 without going through obstacles I don't
57:01 know I have never met anyone that hasn't
57:04 gone through some serious ups and downs
57:06 I got friends in Los Angeles who are
57:11 legendary people absolutely beloved in
57:14 some circles their household names and I
57:20 know them very personally and I know
57:22 that they have had hardships that some
57:27 of my friends could never endure or at
57:30 least they would shock me if they could
57:32 write at least they couldn't deal with
57:36 him as late in life as it is now having
57:38 lived a wonderful life up to that point
57:39 because it's just such a such a tragic
57:41 difference in in direction though
57:45 because my friends have had so many
57:47 little ones when they have a big one I
57:49 deal with it and they're okay how many
57:52 times have you seen a a sporting event
57:56 like maybe rugby especially
57:58 or hockey puck you might even be more
58:02 intense but I'm not quite sure I haven't
58:04 seen a lot of aftermath of rugby but
58:06 watching them play
58:08 I'm assuming it's pretty brutal but yeah
58:10 a lot of hockey players have their teeth
58:12 knocked out it's just what happens and
58:14 they all kind of know and the chicks
58:17 that date these guys well they know that
58:19 they're gonna be wearing dentures or or
58:21 when they take them out at night they're
58:22 just gonna be whistling when they talk
58:24 but it's the it's the game that they
58:26 decided to play it's the it's all these
58:30 bumps and scrapes and burrow blown out
58:32 knees and all these things they're what
58:34 these guys chose for their life well are
58:39 they dumb could they did they not know
58:41 they could have chosen some other more
58:44 you know desk job career and saved all
58:47 their faculties their bodily functions
58:50 sure they know that but they love hockey
58:53 they love rugby they love the game
58:56 whatever it is football American
58:59 football right maybe you're on a higher
59:02 level that difficulty which means your
59:07 rewards are way beyond the lower level
59:10 maybe maybe I'm just being subjective
59:12 and stupid I don't think so
59:16 like I've always said on the show you
59:17 know I'll go back to my hometown and
59:19 there's folks that stay there the whole
59:20 time and they lives very wonderful
59:23 rewarding Truman sure lives
59:25 do they have their bumps and scrapes
59:26 absolutely of course as people get
59:28 divorce on people marry each other's
59:30 spouses and you know it gets all kinds
59:32 of crazy but overall it's a little more
59:35 relaxed than it is out here the West
59:37 Coast right the wild wild west as they
59:39 say it's cool Modi said if you ever
59:44 gotten pulled over and gotten a ticket
59:45 for speeding and you think to yourself
59:47 well I was due it's not really that you
59:51 do it just happened but you know like I
59:53 personally I haven't had a speeding
59:54 ticket in 20 years I've had a fix-it
59:58 ticket for forgetting to put the sticker
59:59 on my plate that's about it when you
60:03 find yourself lost and you've never been
60:06 there before or you haven't been in this
60:09 particular level so you're a little in
60:11 shock
60:12 right it's like it's new it's like Jesus
60:14 what did i do what did I do to deserve
60:17 this
60:18 why does this always happen to me
60:19 there's so some of those phrases you do
60:21 not want to be saying to yourself
60:23 everybody says it including yours truly
60:27 from time to time understand you just
60:30 need to be cool
60:31 realize all right it's my turn to go
60:34 through this right you're going through
60:36 it and maybe the universe is sparing
60:38 someone else because you're gonna take
60:39 the ticket this time I want you to smile
60:42 take a deep breath and go alright then
60:46 crack your fingers that's what you do
60:47 and say I know I'm a badass I'll figure
60:51 this out I will and hey maybe a week
60:55 from now I'm still as lost as I am today
60:57 but the difference is is that I know
60:59 that I'm in this state and I'm gonna be
61:01 searching quickly rapidly I'm gonna
61:05 spend 12 hours a day finding this new
61:07 thing maybe changing my geographical
61:10 location maybe got a change of
61:12 geographical location simply because the
61:14 person that might have dumped you and
61:17 put you in this state of being lost
61:18 there in that location and you just got
61:21 to get away you got to go into public
61:23 maybe should eat a particular restaurant
61:25 every single day for a couple months
61:28 meet everybody there so they totally
61:30 trust you and you walk in they said norm
61:32 you know and they have the beer ready
61:34 for you when you get to the bar or
61:37 whatever metaphorical product you're
61:39 buying there have faith in yourself when
61:44 I say manifest your destiny I really
61:47 mean it would it give you an example of
61:50 where I manifested my my fears
61:52 manifested a situation and it's happened
61:54 to me tons of times just happened to a
61:56 friend of mine I 23 I wrote a program
62:04 that I sold to Fortune 1000 companies
62:07 that do database programming and it was
62:10 a product that unified their interfaces
62:13 so you have like 200 coders it made it
62:15 all perfectly aligned and made it
62:18 graphically look perfect okay all right
62:21 so I started selling this product and
62:22 when it took off I got a big
62:25 buncha orders in well I wrote the manual
62:28 I wrote the software it's back in the
62:29 days when we would ship you a floppy
62:31 disk I mean a three and a quarter three
62:36 in a corner three and a half whatever
62:37 was those little hard ones from the
62:38 Macintosh and I came home with this
62:44 order and I needed to get it to FedEx
62:46 before they closed so what I needed to
62:50 do is print out a manual which I think
62:51 was about eighty eight pages
62:52 I needed to dupe the disk sorry had the
62:56 disk duped but what did I fear I feared
63:00 that my printer would have a problem
63:01 it's a laserwriter printer black and
63:04 white I start the print job you can't
63:06 find my printer it's a Mac I've never
63:09 had any problems at all ever
63:11 printing ever okay and it won't print it
63:14 won't find the printer it's not printing
63:17 and messing up it just won't find it
63:18 what the hell so I was unable to get the
63:24 the FedEx out the door I shipped the
63:28 disk and said you know I want to get you
63:29 the manual very soon after this right by
63:34 the time I got home and the fear of
63:36 scurrying up was gone
63:38 our printer worked well what do you what
63:43 do you think happened I manifested
63:46 whatever the hell was wrong with that
63:47 printer because nothing changed
63:49 I didn't reboot my computer I didn't
63:52 reboot the printer any more than I did
63:53 when it wouldn't work I've had clients
63:56 of mine that tell me that they have a
63:58 horrible relationship with machines just
64:00 like the gentleman in the twilight zone
64:02 and it won't work until I show up and
64:05 then my confidence makes them feel
64:08 better because I'll sit there and go
64:10 well you know we shouldn't have any
64:11 problem with this let me try it
64:13 poof it works and they're just like
64:15 Jesus I just need you here to make it
64:17 work because I was making the machine
64:19 work right there's a bunch of you know
64:21 go read the book a holographic universe
64:24 there's the whole first third of the
64:26 book is all about the science around
64:27 human beings changing things with their
64:29 minds I knew that sounds crazy another
64:33 friend of mine same situation she needed
64:36 to print something for one of her
64:37 clients called me up oh my god
64:39 won't work and I just talked her through
64:40 it boom it worked one of them was a
64:44 friend of mine called me in her keyboard
64:46 USB port was screwed up we knew it was
64:49 screwed up she rebooted a computer
64:51 because it hung and she couldn't get her
64:53 keyboard to work she's calling me going
64:55 how did we get this thing to work the
64:56 other day and I said remember I said you
64:58 fixed it the other day I did yeah what
65:01 did I do
65:01 I said you did this this and this I
65:03 explained the movement that she made
65:04 because I've done that I've done that a
65:06 ton of times before I called you I'm not
65:09 stupid
65:09 so well please just do it again with me
65:12 on the phone oh my god it's working I
65:15 recreated the scenario where it worked
65:17 in her mind and so she manifested the
65:20 success and it worked the more that you
65:24 recover from these bad moments the more
65:27 you have proof that you can recover you
65:29 get your heart broken the first time
65:31 feels devastating and you're never gonna
65:32 recover and you're never gonna be loved
65:34 by anyone else anymore and then you get
65:36 the second girlfriend or boyfriend or
65:38 whatever it happens again but you're
65:41 okay you're a little bit more okay and
65:44 hopefully don't have a bunch of those
65:46 but over and over and over it gets
65:48 easier and easier and easier and you
65:50 pick yourself up and you start to figure
65:52 out why things are going bad and you
65:54 change your behavior or you change the
65:55 people that you hang out with you don't
65:58 fear that your printer's not gonna print
65:59 or your keyboard is not gonna work
66:01 it just does I hope you feel me I'm
66:05 losing my light here so I should
66:06 probably blow out I got my sunglasses on
66:09 so I have to kind of girl how bad is it
66:12 the the preview monitor and my camera is
66:15 way better than the camera itself in
66:17 terms of picking up light so as long as
66:19 it's recording what I'm looking at we're
66:21 gonna be fine but anyway I wanted to
66:24 just do another episode like this cuz
66:26 every once in a while stuff happens I
66:28 just want you guys to have some someone
66:30 else talking in your ear letting you
66:32 know it's gonna be okay
66:33 cuz it will be okay it always is okay
66:35 the only thing that makes it stop being
66:37 okay is if you're no longer on this
66:38 planet and then you can't affect any
66:41 change right if you're totally by
66:45 yourself and you're feeling just
66:46 absolutely wasted by whatever just took
66:48 place mmm again think about some big
66:53 because we seldom make any big changes
66:55 our lives are made out of millions of
66:57 little tiny microscopic changes those
66:59 are the most important ones that you
67:01 make not the big ones you barely make
67:03 any big ones how many times you get
67:04 married a few times maybe maybe once how
67:07 many times you choose to do gigantic
67:09 moves across the world probably only a
67:11 couple times right if you do ever anyway
67:15 hopefully this was helpful do a short
67:19 bumper today if you haven't been to deep
67:20 thoughts radio.com
67:21 please go there's audio video case you
67:24 want to switch formats I locked Facebook
67:26 group a patreon page and that's it
67:28 there's a shop too but whatever take
67:31 care of yourself in someone else and
67:33 I'll see you in the next deep thoughts
67:34 over now
