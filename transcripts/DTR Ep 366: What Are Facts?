00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:33 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:35 deep thoughts
00:36 looks like about 40% of this season's
00:39 gonna be in the dark I'm gonna try to
00:43 make it as sexy as possible so tonight
00:49 I'm gonna talk about what our facts
00:53 anyway so two of the most important
00:58 females in my life they ingest the show
01:04 sparingly thank God but both of them
01:10 don't know it but they have they have
01:16 come to me and said you know can you
01:19 please do something about how you get
01:22 your facts and and validate yourself a
01:25 little bit and so their objective is the
01:28 same the objective is to say you make
01:32 videos for hours and hours and hours you
01:34 talk about very important subjects and
01:36 so how do you get your facts and that's
01:39 a it's a at least a double-edged sword
01:44 on one level you know that if you're a
01:49 chronic listener much of what I talk
01:52 about is my interpretation of things and
01:54 so the need for facts is not as as
01:59 intense as someone reporting the news
02:01 and claiming to be the news and claiming
02:04 to be anything other than entertainment
02:07 however we do talk about factual things
02:10 I got an episode on cancer I got an
02:12 episode on well tons of episodes on the
02:15 moon I mentioned things over and over
02:19 and over again to reinforce it to make
02:21 sure that you start repeating it on your
02:24 end as a topic of discussion not that I
02:27 am correct about anything but so that
02:29 you say it's Joe Biden really that weird
02:31 let's look it up on YouTube he says it's
02:33 on YouTube dope yep and he grabs little
02:35 girl's boobies right in front of their
02:37 parents writing on camera c-span thank
02:39 God exists what's funny for me is that
02:43 the chronology of me either deducing
02:46 something
02:47 learning something putting in an episode
02:49 and then two years later it becomes the
02:50 talking point of the world is hilarious
02:53 it happens a lot and still my episode on
02:58 how they spy on you I watched a whole
03:02 freakin hour-long special about how you
03:05 protect yourself from security today and
03:07 all this other stuff and it is so
03:11 juvenile and so naive about how they do
03:17 data gathering on in this world I mean
03:19 people are talking about consumer level
03:21 products and consumer level strategies
03:23 and not looking at how they actually do
03:28 it and if you need to see it one jump
03:30 over to the deep thought season one
03:32 channel subscribe for me and catch that
03:35 episode on how they spy on you it's a
03:38 lot better than watching the one on this
03:40 channel way back in season one with all
03:42 the just the bad microphone levels and
03:46 all that other stuff but anyway I need
03:52 to do an episode that really discusses
03:56 how we figure this stuff out so on one
03:58 side I have the burden of you know
04:04 qualifying anything I'm saying so I
04:07 think it's this way I think I remember
04:08 it that way I was told it was that way
04:11 so that you know that there's a buffer
04:13 between me and de facto reality believe
04:19 me I try to get a bunch of stuff correct
04:22 when I get things incorrect it's a very
04:24 interesting thing that occurs if you're
04:28 just talking to your buddy at a bar at a
04:30 restaurant at work whatever car ride and
04:33 you get something wrong maybe your buddy
04:36 has about a 30% chance of remembering
04:39 that if the conversation is super
04:41 interesting to your friend then they
04:43 might have about a 95 percent chance of
04:45 remembering what you said and if they
04:47 find out that you're wrong not that you
04:50 try to manipulate your friend or
04:51 anything but you just got a number off
04:52 or something like that they may come
04:55 back to you and say hey you know I think
04:57 you said I looked that up and it's
04:59 actually
05:00 this not that oh really okay yeah yeah
05:03 I'm sorry that's how it goes in a normal
05:05 organic life when you do what I do on
05:09 this show and every episodes watched
05:12 anywhere from 500 to 1500 times before
05:17 shadow banning really takes effect I get
05:21 a lot of comments about what I get wrong
05:23 I love it because it's a process where I
05:27 refine my factoids people provide links
05:34 they provide mostly video links cuz
05:36 we're on YouTube a lot of you folks will
05:38 send me off to some website or some web
05:40 page or you'll at least tell me in words
05:41 how you need to look up this person
05:43 check it out
05:45 some of you know how to really use the
05:47 indexes in like the time index is in
05:51 your comments you helped me out so much
05:52 like hey at fifteen minutes and twenty
05:54 seconds you said this what the heck did
05:55 you mean or I think you're off base and
05:58 then there's the other part of the
06:00 debate which is obviously one of the
06:02 most incredible gifts we have as human
06:05 beings is that we get to debate what we
06:07 believe about something do you think
06:10 Michael Jackson did it or not we get to
06:12 debate we get to weigh facts and and
06:14 read body language and all that good
06:16 stuff very powerful but that's the easy
06:21 side of the sword the tough side of the
06:25 sword is perceived facts I have
06:32 mentioned this off and on I didn't
06:34 episode about this information I haven't
06:36 watched it probably since I published it
06:38 might be a little bit of overlap I know
06:42 I've said some of this stuff but we're
06:44 gonna have such a pure unadulterated
06:47 analysis of this that hopefully it will
06:50 change your life a little bit and I
06:52 think a lot of you know this and I think
06:53 a lot of you even if I'm mentioning
06:57 something new you felt it down inside
07:00 your soul and so hopefully me putting
07:03 this into words will get you to go oh my
07:05 god you're right or that's how I feel
07:08 that's how I felt about this though you
07:09 know forever for a very long time
07:13 and it was through working with these
07:14 close friends of mine that I was able to
07:18 hear them go through a circular logic
07:23 situation I don't mean circle logic as
07:25 in it was a bad logic loop they went
07:29 through their loop their eco system of
07:31 like having me tell them something and
07:33 then they reach out and and I can see it
07:36 in their head they're reaching out for
07:37 their methodology of evaluating what
07:39 they believe to be true or false and
07:41 then bringing it back to me and going
07:43 question mark and the reason why these
07:46 two females are bringing this to me is
07:48 that they have super high integrity
07:50 levels very smart women love it keeping
07:57 me on my toes
07:59 information Marshall McLuhan you've
08:03 heard me say this several times he
08:05 invented the term media and he is the
08:09 one medium is the message
08:13 what he was talking about was and his in
08:19 one of his in philosophies guy almost
08:21 lived a hundred years ahead so in the
08:24 late sixties he was in his late sixties
08:26 and he was just a brilliant human being
08:29 actually I don't know if that's exactly
08:30 correct but he was pretty pretty
08:32 weathered by the late 60s when he did
08:34 his I believe it's a 1968 Playboy
08:36 interview that was printed and you can
08:39 go read it anytime you want
08:40 it is meaty let me tell you it is Jean
08:46 Baudrillard Lovell stuff you know but
08:49 his thing was to tell you that the way
08:51 that you get your information is more
08:53 important to you than the information
08:56 that you actually get out of the medium
08:58 itself now first time I heard that I was
09:01 like okay we gotta parse some words here
09:04 what are you actually saying you know
09:05 it's like that old phrase it's better to
09:07 take a shorter amount of time to do the
09:09 job right then a longer amount of time
09:11 to do the job wrong you're like yeah of
09:14 course what that means is there's no
09:16 shortcuts do it right the first time
09:18 shortcuts only lead to more delays and
09:21 more foul-ups and bad testing and
09:23 whatever you're doing but now
09:26 we have to create an image in your I
09:28 have to create an image in your head so
09:30 I wanted you to take everyone that you
09:32 think's alive in the world from zero to
09:34 perhaps maybe a hundred and ten or
09:36 something like that of course after
09:37 someone it's about a hundred their
09:40 participation in reality is a little bit
09:41 different they don't really probably get
09:43 into the newspaper that much their eyes
09:45 even work enough but I don't want to
09:48 sell it ninety five year olds short
09:49 because I've met some that were strong
09:51 as oxes and look like there were 40
09:53 years younger than they were but they
09:56 you divide everyone up in the world into
09:59 decades decades of age zero through ten
10:03 11 through 20 21 through 30 all the way
10:07 up to a hundred years old
10:10 we know that every decade grows up
10:12 especially in America grows up in a
10:16 different era of perception in the last
10:20 one hundred and nineteen years we have
10:22 gone from printed press newspapers that
10:25 are handed out every single day with
10:28 extra editions here and there into
10:31 broadcast radio it went on and on and on
10:35 still exists right and it's kind of all
10:37 junk now then we have television still
10:42 going strong now I could sit I could say
10:46 movies because they did do some
10:48 propaganda films here and there that
10:50 came and went pretty quickly so I don't
10:53 really think that that's where we
10:56 necessarily get facts we watch
10:57 documentaries on TV if we're gonna see
10:59 something in a film fashion but
11:01 sometimes we go to the movie theaters
11:02 and see things like inconvenient lie but
11:07 now we have HTTP protocol and the
11:13 Internet now we have hybrids like
11:16 podcasting and that sort of thing but
11:18 you feel me right before the printed
11:21 press as in newspapers we had books
11:25 books still exists don't they
11:28 sadly we don't buy enough of them
11:33 another hybrid would be magazine it's
11:38 important that I throw all these images
11:40 into your brain because what we're gonna
11:41 do is we're gonna divide these things up
11:43 into those decades if I asked you a
11:47 hundred-year-old person today would have
11:50 been born in 20 there sorry at nineteen
11:52 nineteen now one side of my grandparents
11:57 were young kids around that time and one
12:02 of my grandparents set of grandparents
12:04 hadn't been born yet so that's how near
12:07 that hundred years is from right now I'm
12:09 just telling you you know I I've lost
12:11 son all my grandparents are gone now but
12:14 books and newspapers would have been the
12:18 top authority in the world at that time
12:22 aside from going to a lecture or
12:24 something right then there was the radio
12:27 and there's a whole different group of
12:30 folks inside the radio because it's not
12:32 when you're born that you think that
12:34 that's a particular medium it's when you
12:36 become intellectual and wake up so you
12:39 know I don't know my grandparents age
12:41 how much they started reading newspapers
12:43 how much they cared about the news it it
12:46 was partially global mostly local maybe
12:48 national at best what am i set of
12:52 grandparents was born in 1910 in 1912
12:54 so yeah you have to give him about 20
12:57 years before you start you know thinking
13:00 about them ingesting news in the 30s in
13:03 the 1930s let's just go with them for
13:08 them the newspaper and books and radio
13:13 was a way to get information and then
13:16 there's this integrity substrate to each
13:20 one of those mediums well who's talking
13:22 on the radio who's writing the book
13:23 who's writing the newspaper it depends
13:26 you become loyal if and I'm not sure if
13:30 this took place but you know how we are
13:32 with the internet you know again as soon
13:35 as the celebrity dies some people rush
13:37 to their Facebook out to tell everybody
13:40 that someone died
13:41 it's like spreading the bad news or
13:44 spreading this it's almost like you feel
13:47 I don't know like it used to be back in
13:50 the day you would go to record stores
13:52 and you'd search around for crazy LPS
13:54 that no one knew and you'd stick it you
13:56 know you record it down some way you get
13:58 it into your car on cassette tape or
13:59 whatever it was and then you play it and
14:02 you drive down the street and people are
14:03 like what are you listening to that's
14:05 the craziest coolest music and it made
14:08 you look cool because you had the eager
14:10 to find it you had the patience you were
14:12 to go first time I played my buddy Zappa
14:15 Roger stuff in the 90s I had my Frank oh
14:18 where did you where do you find this
14:19 kind of music and I loved it but I've
14:21 I've only heard it every once in a while
14:23 kind of in the distance I never had
14:25 someone find it so there is some sort of
14:29 mental bond and identity when you bond
14:33 to a particular medium and that's what
14:36 Marshall McLuhan had seen in his own
14:37 lifetime he literally watched the
14:41 transformation from radio to television
14:44 out of newspapers so just to sum it up
14:49 because I know you can see this coming a
14:51 mile away these mediums are de-facto
14:55 sources within various age groups in
14:58 various decades sometimes it might go
15:02 for two decades you sometimes might go
15:04 for three decades before another
15:05 information type shows up I think it'll
15:09 be quite a while before we have another
15:10 information type show up I mean we're
15:12 gonna have a are but all that's gonna do
15:14 is feed web to your brain you know but
15:17 this is where people start to form their
15:21 loyalties and thus their authority with
15:25 the rest of the world and so when
15:28 someone comes in and says you're wrong
15:31 hey they could be right they could they
15:33 could have been there they could just
15:35 have done multiple sources they take all
15:37 those sources and cut through it because
15:40 of the internet now we have really good
15:41 citizens on the ground
15:43 analyzing stuff I mean we've never had
15:46 news analyzed at the level it's being
15:48 analyzed now especially since the 17
15:51 movement ever in history it's amazing
15:56 how much they dig and dig and dig and
15:58 yeah some people dig and find things
15:59 that don't
16:00 really exist we're gonna have fun with
16:03 that this year but a lot of times they
16:07 can figure out what's going on so for me
16:11 when I answer this question I obviously
16:14 am a very talkative person with my with
16:18 everyone that I'm close to and I only
16:21 surround myself with people that are
16:23 like me in most cases but I do have
16:25 family members that you love forever and
16:29 they don't have to be like you
16:31 you're gonna keep them in your circle
16:33 for life because you're related to them
16:34 some of them made you and so it's
16:38 interesting you just sit and you listen
16:39 and you hear propaganda and you hear a
16:43 total lack of research in a lot of cases
16:45 but you know where they got that
16:47 information they got that information
16:50 from bookstores newspapers posh
16:54 magazines that make them feel like
16:56 they're really informed and all it has
16:58 to do is imitate the algorithm of
17:01 integrity and I you know at times I
17:06 check myself you know I know people that
17:08 keep magazines in their homes to look
17:11 intelligent to look affluent and I went
17:16 back as when I first moved really like
17:17 I've said a hundred times I I was
17:19 subscribing to a bunch of scientific
17:21 magazines and a bunch of scientific book
17:24 clubs the psychology book clubs I mean
17:26 have books coming in my house about the
17:28 crates and I was I thought back and I
17:31 thought well did I do that to look smart
17:33 or something and I'm just trying to
17:36 analyze all the conversations I've had
17:37 because I would use those rags you know
17:39 my source of information which was very
17:42 you know I think mainstream to have
17:49 conversations with people but there was
17:52 no time and I didn't really have guests
17:54 over my places wherever I lived and so
17:57 there's really no time to behave like
17:59 that and I was always ingesting the book
18:02 so fast that there was just no time to
18:04 look up and create a a veneer of
18:07 gloating or some weird you know self
18:13 taury thing about it but I find it those
18:19 that do and this would be more of my
18:22 family members than anything else they
18:25 do have this interesting quaff of the
18:29 way they communicate it's usually led in
18:32 by sort of a sarcastic giggle that
18:35 you're wrong and this sort of super
18:39 superior attitude of let me tell you let
18:44 me tell you how this really works and
18:45 they won't necessarily say you're wrong
18:46 they're just going to talk to you like
18:48 you're a little kid and all they've done
18:52 is picked up a mainstream rag and
18:55 ingested it
18:56 they went to Barnes & Noble and picked
18:59 it up and it's subjective history it's
19:01 subjective opinions about things in some
19:03 cases in other cases it's full-blown
19:06 efficient and concealment of the facts
19:10 so no one can figure out what's going on
19:13 but it's written to make you feel like
19:16 that's occurring it's crazy how it works
19:24 now the people that are asking me to do
19:27 this episode or at least to answer this
19:28 question one person has asked me to do
19:31 an episode the other person is just
19:32 pushing me on this issue so this is
19:34 great I get to make an episode for both
19:36 of them at the same time they just want
19:39 to make sure that I'm not misleading
19:41 people that I'm not getting caught up in
19:43 my own hubris one of them says I riff
19:48 and riffing is dangerous fair comment
19:54 but again having an opinion between two
19:57 friends is one thing and that's what 99
20:00 99 percent of the world does because
20:02 they don't have YouTube shows but the
20:04 second you put your money where your
20:05 mouth is and you push it on the net and
20:08 there's a lot of discernment and there's
20:09 a lot of critiquing you know if this
20:12 channel ever got popular which it won't
20:16 the pressure would be even heavier on me
20:19 and it would there be a lot of comments
20:21 there you're wrong there you're wrong
20:22 here you're wrong and
20:23 then when someone tells you that you're
20:24 wrong you have to look at what they're
20:26 saying and figure out where they got
20:28 their information from to see how they
20:30 feel i watch this video today I'm gonna
20:36 loop back on this because it was a very
20:38 interesting thing it was a video by two
20:43 really cool people who are trying to
20:45 make the world a better place and so one
20:48 of the conversations started in on how
20:50 we can again protect ourselves from
20:52 being snooped on by these surveillance
20:57 agencies and just to be specific for a
21:02 second the question was a big it was a
21:04 conversation a fairly detailed
21:05 conversation about VPNs and how they
21:09 protect an individual's location the
21:12 integrity of the data such that you know
21:15 you can't can't steal packets off that
21:17 line and look into them and it what I
21:26 have to tell you is is that at times I
21:30 have been trained by the top humans on
21:34 this planet for those sorts of things
21:37 and then because I have such a
21:41 fundamental knowledge of the Internet I
21:43 mean you have to understand I was in the
21:44 Internet in 1996 writing web servers
21:48 from scratch and web clients from
21:50 scratch and studying all the packet data
21:52 going back and forth and studying the
21:54 hardware that had to to transmit over
21:56 and then I was trained by a security
21:59 expert who had just secured NORAD
22:04 private session medium days and so when
22:11 I look at these conversations I I'm the
22:15 guy is smirking I'm the guy who you know
22:17 you think you're secure and again I I
22:21 learned about things I've shared with
22:23 you I mean game go look at the episode
22:24 on how they spy on you it is quite
22:28 frankly the most profound reveal of how
22:32 they do it I've never seen anyone even
22:34 remotely talk about this
22:36 not in one conversation anywhere in the
22:39 world has anyone told you what I told
22:42 you in that episode but if you watch it
22:44 it'll change everything for you because
22:46 you'll know nothing's secure there's
22:49 nothing you can do there is nothing you
22:52 can do besides write it down on a piece
22:55 of paper and hand it to the other person
22:57 and go don't [ __ ] say a word don't
23:00 say a word
23:00 because if you speak this out loud
23:02 they're gonna know what's on that letter
23:03 and then you both burn it together
23:05 that's the only way you can transmit
23:07 information from one person to another
23:10 it's probably better than sign language
23:14 if a packet of information travels over
23:18 the Internet it is grabbed period it is
23:23 decoded period and if one packet came
23:26 across that and Internet that was not
23:28 capable of being parsed within a split
23:31 second they would send people on planet
23:35 Earth
23:35 to where you are and believe me you
23:37 cannot hide with proxy servers and daisy
23:39 chains and all this other crap you
23:41 cannot hide where you are you can't you
23:44 think you can you could turn your
23:46 logging off on your server your server
23:48 has nothing to do with the problem your
23:50 mobile device has nothing to do with the
23:52 problem your desktop has nothing to do
23:54 with the problem but someone might watch
23:57 that video this person wasn't selling
24:00 anything necessarily bunch of conspiracy
24:03 channels pump all this VPN crap all this
24:07 privacy stuff now what it will do is
24:09 keep the little guys out of your devices
24:12 some little firm in China a little firm
24:14 in Russia or India that's been paid to
24:17 steal information off your phone and
24:19 then send you an email and telling you
24:21 they've locked your phone or whatever or
24:23 maybe even that actually really
24:25 occurring which I've never heard
24:26 actually occurring just the threat of it
24:28 having occurred where it's like I've
24:29 locked your computer out and if you
24:31 don't get me you know $400 in iTunes
24:34 cards then da-da-da-da-da if you feel
24:38 like the information that you have is
24:40 true you're gonna double down on that
24:42 information and it's it's it's only
24:46 partially important in this conversation
24:48 when we're
24:50 talking about sharing it with another
24:51 human being was more vital and more
24:54 paramount is that you believe
24:56 information at all from anywhere so the
25:00 problem I get into when someone says
25:02 okay speak to me with 100% facts okay
25:10 JFK's dead Hitler's dead there's some
25:14 facts for you anything in the modern
25:17 spectrum of time I don't know what I'll
25:19 be talking about because I I see this
25:22 immediately as the person on the other
25:24 side has a paradigm
25:27 it makes they've picked sources that
25:30 make them feel comfortable some people
25:33 will say this person has a degree in
25:36 something and so they immediately become
25:38 truth seers and I'm a horse's ass hmm
25:46 that degree could be 40 years old could
25:49 be a PhD help and they could bit top in
25:51 their class maybe it's only 20 years old
25:54 but they didn't practice that degree at
25:56 all they didn't go back for a refresher
25:58 course and so that information is
26:00 atrophied whereas what we do on this
26:03 show is obsess and dig and get into it
26:07 make episodes and then we hear each
26:09 other talk and you guys correct me and
26:11 you guys extend my mind and enlighten me
26:16 you know what's interesting about doing
26:18 this show and you may not have thought
26:20 about this but I'll tell you a lot of
26:23 you like me up until 2014 I would say
26:26 really 2015 when this show existed you
26:30 you may have had let's just say it one
26:33 of the luckiest people in the world and
26:35 you had half a dozen mentors across your
26:39 entire lifespan do you know how many
26:43 mentors I've had since 2015
26:47 every single person who posted an
26:50 intelligent comment on either the
26:51 YouTube channel or the LOC Facebook
26:53 group you guys mentor me like crazy you
26:58 inspire me you inform me
27:01 you triangulate data for me
27:03 and so I feel like I am the utter
27:06 benefactor I'm in the center of a
27:08 triangle I don't know what the other
27:11 side is or the other point on the
27:12 triangle is but I'm benefiting greatly
27:17 and it is extended my vision of the
27:20 world and it's humbled me greatly the
27:24 Battle of facts is the Battle of
27:26 perception and as much as some things
27:30 are thought to be scientific there's a
27:34 couple little gotchas there I'm going in
27:38 I'm going to dive off in science things
27:39 because that's where we think things are
27:41 fairly ironclad like I said chemistry is
27:44 chemistry's chemistry now why things in
27:47 chemistry at a subatomic level might be
27:49 occurring well we we could parse the
27:52 atom seriously get down into it I'm
27:55 gonna think it's ether winds and
27:56 currents someone else might think it's
27:58 just stops at quarks that's it it
28:01 doesn't really matter chemists can learn
28:03 how things work and when they mix this
28:04 together with that and it happens right
28:07 mathematics is pure and perfect but the
28:13 insinuation on top of mathematics the
28:16 the variables in a formula could be
28:19 completely bunk all these dimensions as
28:23 scientists find well that's just a
28:24 methodology of discussing different
28:26 categories of entities of thoughts a
28:31 equals mc-squared
28:33 I think is wrong at least as it pertains
28:38 to the speed of light and mass and
28:40 movement and inertia someone might say
28:45 well we know how fast light travels I
28:48 thought that was a constant that
28:50 everyone agreed on around the world and
28:52 then I saw this beautiful video that was
28:56 recapping every single scientific
28:58 community in different countries
29:00 throughout decades and decades and
29:01 decades when they figured out how to
29:03 measure the speed of light they're
29:05 coming up with all kinds of different
29:07 speeds now generally it's super fast
29:10 it's not going to come in at 2 miles an
29:11 hour but it's different
29:15 but isn't it supposed to be a certainty
29:18 think about the moon landings okay well
29:24 how do you figure out they're a hoax and
29:25 how do you figure out they're real you
29:27 can't just go to some institution to
29:32 read a book to figure it out I mean you
29:34 can't just read it and have it sink into
29:37 your brain this is true this is false
29:38 because most of all of the documentation
29:42 that's in book stores says it's true
29:46 colleges say it's true scientists say
29:50 it's true
29:51 average citizens that know nothing say
29:53 it's true well then it must be true
29:56 right mm-hmm
29:58 you start using logic on this show alone
30:03 I have gone from sort of the low-hanging
30:06 fruit
30:06 episode 26 episode 165 you know 165 I
30:11 started digging out my own stuff I
30:13 started feeling really good to me and
30:15 then lately we have focused on batteries
30:18 we have focused on the amount of voltage
30:22 to cool an astronaut side of a suit
30:25 that's cut again 500 degree swings
30:28 between the front and the back if
30:32 they're facing perpendicular to the Sun
30:35 we've had two air-conditioner experts
30:38 come in and say the exact same thing
30:40 that is thinking that is intelligence
30:46 and it supersedes this crappy thing that
30:50 we call facts these days I almost feel
30:54 like facts the word fact needs to be
31:00 something that is indivisible I said but
31:05 let me change the person so it's a
31:07 little more bright Walt Disney I could
31:13 say is dead and everybody goes yeah he's
31:17 dead okay I met the guy at the park and
31:21 he took me to Bob ger I went to the
31:25 kiddie part of the park which I never go
31:26 to for any reason at all I would
31:29 from the bank which was in the front
31:30 right of the park right when you go to
31:32 the bridge with the rebel track over
31:34 your head I walk straight from that
31:35 straight to that dude no detours no
31:38 where am i I walk straight to the guy
31:40 over by the submarine right which is now
31:42 Finding Nemo so what was the fact again
31:46 oh yeah Walt Disney's dead hmm okay well
31:54 then I'm I'm a magician
31:56 I am a superhuman I am an alien with
32:00 powers you all should fear or maybe
32:04 maybe Walt isn't dead yet so fact has
32:10 got to have something that's indivisible
32:13 what do we know about Walt his human
32:16 flesh body no longer operates like a
32:21 living human body
32:23 who knows where his head and brain are
32:25 you know maybe it's some jar or
32:27 something but that's what I think is
32:30 true but now how do I prove that without
32:33 exuding his body and doing a DNA test
32:36 again facts cannot have any variable
32:40 that could parse it in a subjective way
32:44 to reinterpret the fact the fact needs
32:47 to be a hundred percent one plus one
32:49 equals two that's a pretty good fact
32:52 but then that fact would only be a
32:54 number set to people working together
32:58 one plus one is way more powerful than
33:01 two people it's an exponential curve if
33:05 they're in sync if they have the same
33:06 vision in the same dream two people can
33:09 be the power of ten individuals they
33:11 just work together the nice thing about
33:15 the request to clarify this is that
33:18 these individuals want the world to be
33:21 based on truth they don't want any more
33:25 inadvertent disinformation coming out of
33:28 people like me miss guiding people and
33:33 so they're trying to make sure that my
33:35 game stays tight because they know me
33:38 and and you know the case of
33:41 one of the people who live really close
33:43 to me if they don't want to be caught up
33:46 in a situation where I create a
33:47 controversy because I'm saying something
33:49 it's my bias and I'm portray it as fact
33:53 and it's some very controversial thing
33:56 such that we might get in trouble I have
34:01 shared with these individuals some of
34:02 the deepest conspiracies that are out
34:05 there that you know some of it I can
34:08 barely cover on this show because it
34:10 would create a big giant target on my
34:13 back but I just don't need so I wiggle
34:16 it into the episodes so if you know what
34:19 I'm talking about sometimes you know
34:23 false hoods have been repeated so much
34:28 that they can't hear anything different
34:30 no matter what you do it's just embedded
34:34 in their character and hey I'm not here
34:37 to change anybody's deep-rooted beliefs
34:39 you know I don't really believe that if
34:42 I tell you my entire history of research
34:46 in Jesus Christ which has been
34:49 tumultuous at times having written
34:52 screenplays for this stuff using you
34:55 know for that information
34:56 books little mini novels I wrote when I
34:58 was a crappy writer back in the day I
35:00 was diving into this stuff because I
35:02 wanted to find it I wanted to reference
35:04 it I wanted to use it in my material and
35:06 when I came up completely dry the only
35:11 thing I realized that it was that the
35:13 people that told me he existed had just
35:15 been told by someone else they existed
35:17 anybody who thought they had physical
35:19 proof they just were told that by
35:22 somebody else and it doesn't exist and
35:24 then they were thinking well there's
35:26 history books there's there's papaya
35:28 they're stone saying that he existed not
35:34 for 350 years when the Inquisition's and
35:38 the yeah the Inquisition's when the
35:41 Inquisition started when they needed to
35:45 pound it into the people because it was
35:47 gonna be the way it was gonna be Rome's
35:49 way or nobody's way the Senators were
35:52 made Pope's until they each died off
35:54 decayed
35:55 became Saints and then they created a
35:58 nice pyramid structure the Pope at the
36:00 top yeah that's the way God works yeah I
36:05 don't think me sharing my path is gonna
36:08 change anyone's opinion it might but I
36:11 don't I don't think it's going to occur
36:15 and why is that because I think that if
36:18 you're vested in a religion it's because
36:22 it benefits you in some way it works for
36:24 you again I've never said you know I'm
36:26 mentioning this a lot in episodes
36:28 recently as I'm editing things so I
36:30 realize there'll be you know episodes in
36:33 a row where I'm seeming like just
36:35 poaching off myself they're not recorded
36:38 in a row
36:39 they're recorder all over the place it
36:41 just so happens a stream of
36:42 consciousness keeps coming back to me to
36:44 make a point what I found in doing this
36:47 show though was a very interesting thing
36:50 that that I had and I assume other
36:52 people have it which is that you will
36:56 covet what you think is a fact and then
37:01 through talking to yourself like I do on
37:03 this show or talking to you guys through
37:05 the comments I find out that there
37:08 perhaps is really no evidence for me to
37:10 believe even a possibility that things
37:14 are different in a particular area that
37:15 I've been taught and so sometimes it
37:18 happens very rarely but sometimes I have
37:21 to let go and let the other one come
37:24 back yeah you know I thought it was like
37:26 that but I really dug into it really
37:29 talked to people on the ground got as
37:31 many real life stories as I could out of
37:34 people that are related to people people
37:36 who we still are alive and I believe
37:40 them and it changes my beliefs so what
37:44 do you do what do you do with this new
37:48 realization that perhaps the battle for
37:51 facts is merely the Battle of paradigm
37:53 adoption aka media adoption as Marshall
37:58 McLuhan set forth hmm when I go to my
38:04 smoke lounge which interesting is is
38:05 that what we choose to
38:10 to get our facts and develop our
38:13 opinions or it's primarily YouTube
38:16 videos which I know has a a bit of a
38:20 stain on it and for some people because
38:22 there is a bunch of crazy crap on
38:23 YouTube and then webpages that support
38:26 things and then the 17:00 movement which
38:28 sent us out to everything on planet
38:30 Earth it's on the internet every
38:33 Instagram account Twitter account
38:35 personal business websites we are
38:39 looking into people's lives by looking
38:41 at the information that they submitted
38:43 to the public at one point in time using
38:45 the wayback machine dot org to look at
38:48 people's websites before they change
38:49 them I mean it is is so absurdly
38:53 meticulous and I don't say absurd in a
38:55 bad way it's just that's the level of
38:56 which it's it's happening nowadays what
39:00 we do is build a gigantic cloud of
39:02 information and then we sift through it
39:06 logically by thinking and using our
39:09 intelligence and then we start to
39:12 develop a picture and then we toss it
39:15 around and we toss it around and we toss
39:17 it around for weeks and months before we
39:19 ever really say ok I think that's what
39:20 that is
39:21 you know 17 guy he could say that's
39:23 exactly the truth on the first day and
39:26 you know we'll hold that we toss it
39:28 around and we talk about it I mean you
39:30 guys that love this show if you ever
39:31 came to my lounge you'd move here just
39:34 to go to that couch telling you know you
39:37 know but making this this sort of dream
39:41 and example of having a university for
39:44 all of us and I'll say my lounge is it
39:48 is that University in a very informal
39:50 way ladies if you don't like cigar smoke
39:53 it would kill you but we'll put put
39:57 together hookah for you which is
39:59 probably not good for you at all so what
40:02 do you do when that's the process that I
40:04 use to make information I'm involved
40:06 with a group of people that do this and
40:07 then all of a sudden I take a phone call
40:09 with the friend or sit down for dinner
40:11 and I will simply say something as fact
40:16 and the person across the table or over
40:20 the phone has no other option
40:21 to think that I flip idli came up with
40:23 that opinion because there's no physical
40:26 way for me to to go back and put them
40:31 through the months and months and months
40:33 and years of discernment over the thing
40:36 that I'm talking about you know it would
40:38 be as if let's just say equals
40:40 mc-squared is completely right about
40:42 everything
40:42 well it didn't form overnight it's a
40:46 it's an algorithm that's been around for
40:48 a long before Einstein ever tried to
40:50 pawn it off as his own work I know I owe
40:53 you guys an Einstein video I got a UH I
40:58 got to go back and write everything down
41:00 so I have like a script a fax right
41:05 there we go so the interesting process
41:09 that I go through is starting that
41:12 conversation realizing I'm in this
41:14 quagmire of damn there's no way for me
41:18 to easily put you through the torture
41:21 that my friends and I put ourselves
41:22 through to get to this point where I can
41:24 just say well this is what it's really
41:26 about you know how long it took me to
41:29 find out that climate change was about
41:31 population control through taxation to
41:36 make energy cost too much and then if
41:37 you slip over then you just get
41:39 penalized because you slipped over you
41:41 know you have the second child you start
41:43 paying to the state a penalty for having
41:46 the second child it took ten years to
41:52 decipher all the information and check
41:56 it and check it and check in look into
41:58 Al Gore's world and the CCX and all this
42:01 other stuff you know reading Kyoto
42:03 protocols and the the climate Accord and
42:07 then watching countries respond to it
42:10 over and over getting insider
42:12 information from friends of mine sitting
42:14 with fricken Rothschilds and listening
42:16 to them pontificate about how the
42:19 world's overpopulated its thousands and
42:24 thousands of little pieces of
42:26 information I'm not even gonna call them
42:28 facts but you know some of these things
42:32 just happen when my friend oh I trust to
42:34 the end of the world
42:35 tells me I was in a room I was supposed
42:37 to giving a presentation I got I got
42:39 basically interrupted and usurped for
42:43 this other conversation he says I
42:45 couldn't even understand why they were
42:46 so worried about this stuff I mean they
42:48 were worried about it on a level that
42:49 was crazy and they said someone just
42:53 will the lost child kids so I don't even
42:54 know why we're listening to this guy
42:56 like he's in the room and they're
42:58 talking third-person we need to be
43:00 talking about depopulation so I don't
43:04 want to take people through that so how
43:08 do we move forward
43:12 everybody wants a simple solution right
43:14 they want fast food fast food fast food
43:16 when I start attempting to take one of
43:19 my friends down one of these paths and
43:21 I'm trying to abbreviate I'm trying to
43:26 put excerpts forth instead of taking
43:33 them through everything and it's even
43:34 hard for me to recall all the
43:37 conversations of course it's impossible
43:38 I can feel them Wayne if they look at me
43:42 in the face I can see them kind of going
43:44 okay TMI I don't need to know and what's
43:48 interesting for me is that there's this
43:50 frustration that comes about to say okay
43:53 I know that they're either listening to
43:56 or talking to someone who which is me
44:00 who has devoted his life to trying to
44:04 find the truth at the expense of my own
44:08 indigenous beliefs before I started
44:10 doing this it doesn't mean because it's
44:14 a struggle for me that you know my
44:16 conclusions are correct by any means but
44:20 I feel like what I'm a lot of times I'm
44:25 having conversation with someone that
44:26 also was very busy with their life and
44:28 so they only have the time to just take
44:32 it off of a website or take it off a
44:35 page or have a conversation one time
44:37 with someone and the other person might
44:39 have a lot more time to to investigate
44:41 things but because maybe they're new to
44:43 the truth movement the sources aren't
44:48 aren't apparent and you know the 17
44:53 movement is a great place to find
44:55 information because it kicks you off
44:56 into all these other beautiful rabbit
44:59 holes which will consume your life and
45:02 some folks start to short-circuit
45:04 because they're like I don't want to
45:06 believe this I don't believe this the
45:07 rule can't be this horrible the world
45:09 can't be this complex in my smoke lounge
45:12 we don't say that ever we don't go down
45:17 a rabbit hole and as it starts to hurt
45:19 our feelings we don't ever say to each
45:21 other oh my god I can't really talk
45:23 about this because the world just seems
45:24 so hideous and so bad we don't say that
45:29 we just go in you know most of us are
45:33 guys and so again you know there's a big
45:37 part of me that feels like I've said
45:39 this several times on the show I because
45:42 I'm giving an example of two incredible
45:45 females in my life I don't really want
45:47 them to have to know any of this it's
45:51 just it's sort of like the built-in
45:52 chivalry that let us take care of this
45:56 let the guys take care of this and it's
45:57 not that you can't take care of it
45:59 but I can tell right now by just giving
46:01 out morsels of the research that I had
46:06 to do with my buddies there's there's
46:09 like a lack of interest or a lack of
46:10 like I don't want to really fill my life
46:13 with this negativity and I don't want
46:15 certain people to have that negativity
46:18 in their life if it's gonna especially
46:20 make them lose sleep or just have sort
46:23 of a frequency of discomfort I don't
46:27 want any of my friends to have that
46:28 unless they're hungry for it and which
46:31 is why I don't walk into public and say
46:36 anything I ate dinner tonight
46:38 and I had to hear a story
46:43 he dinner some friends and I had to hear
46:45 a story about some very close friends of
46:48 mine these are like godparents kind of
46:52 people in my life they're not my
46:55 godparents but it's it's like that it
46:57 could have been
46:59 and one of the guys wife is dying of
47:01 cancer and it's very apparent in the
47:04 conversation she does not want to die of
47:06 cancer she's just in her mid 70s her
47:10 kids are starting to have grandkids and
47:12 so she wants to be around for it and I
47:16 am sitting this is funny one of the
47:18 females I'm talking about in this
47:19 conversation is right across the table
47:20 and the other females are mom and of
47:25 course there's everyone's a family we
47:27 know everybody because from a small town
47:29 and I'm sitting there going in my mind
47:33 I'm thinking well I'm on to literally
47:39 the third patient who came out of stage
47:41 four cancer in full recovery right now
47:45 using some of the methods it's in my
47:48 cancer episode number 17 gank over to
47:52 season 1 look up deep thoughts radio
47:54 season one channel and watch it there so
48:00 I'm sitting here knowing that there's a
48:03 big chance that no matter how advanced
48:05 this stages of cancer because the very
48:08 first person I ever helped was in stage
48:10 four was six months to live I think in
48:14 her early 50s she is perfectly fine
48:18 today within four months she was
48:20 cancer-free she never did chemotherapy
48:22 and she used a free solution called
48:24 vitamin C and vitamin b17 she cut out
48:28 meats and sugars drink carrot juice a
48:30 lot all cruciferous vegetables was clean
48:33 as a whistle and four months confirmed
48:36 by her oncologist who thought she went
48:39 and got her chemotherapy I've done it
48:41 two more times and every time I help
48:43 someone someone else in their life gives
48:45 them the same exact recipe so I'm not
48:47 even the only person giving them the
48:50 same exact advice and so the
48:53 conversation gets interesting because
48:55 I'm looking at the girl in front of me
48:56 and I'm going you know what I'm thinking
48:58 she knows I could ask the girl in front
49:01 of me recite the recipe and she knows it
49:03 top of her head but the person we're
49:07 talking about over here
49:08 is in her 70s
49:11 she's not going to listen to a free
49:14 simple solution because the oncologists
49:18 of the world the criminal [ __ ]
49:20 that they are have convinced her and
49:23 everyone else in the baby boomer
49:25 generation that you gotta make it
49:27 complicated you have to drink a
49:28 radioactive isotope or get radiation
49:32 treatment to cure cancer less than a
49:35 month ago and another girl tell me about
49:40 a little kid in I believe in Huntington
49:44 Beach here who's suffering from a tumor
49:46 on their spine it's inoperable and you
49:51 know suppose all these doctors on the
49:52 kid trying to figure out what's going on
49:54 they're trying to figure out what causes
49:55 it which is great do that research
49:58 meanwhile they're just getting ready to
50:01 get their kickbacks from chemotherapy
50:04 treatment they're gonna kill this kid
50:06 ninety three percent chance this kid's
50:08 gonna die by using these draconian
50:12 goddamn methods and so I told her I said
50:16 look do you care about this kid yeah do
50:21 you have contact with this kid and their
50:22 parents yeah
50:23 where's what you got to do let them do
50:26 all their crazy crap but you give them
50:28 this recipe because it's gonna boost the
50:31 immune system and the immune system is
50:33 the only thing that can kill an operable
50:34 cancer besides radioactive isotopes that
50:39 will kill the entire body and so she
50:44 goes back and starts talking to our
50:48 mutual contact her mutual contact with
50:50 the skin who is another good friend of
50:51 mine and the only thing they could
50:53 fixate on was that the facts were coming
50:57 out of the oncologists about the fact
50:59 there's nothing that could be done for
51:01 this kid kid's gonna die
51:03 most likely the empirical facts in my
51:08 world is that people take this little
51:09 treatment survive people with less of an
51:14 immune system than a young kid they
51:17 survive doesn't matter how many times I
51:20 tell them they know better and it's the
51:22 facts
51:23 the [ __ ] facts that aren't facts in
51:26 these people's brains they're gonna kill
51:29 this kid he's gonna die because all the
51:32 parents around them that are supposed to
51:34 protect them are wrong now there could
51:39 be some systemic thing that's still in
51:40 the body that even if you take this he
51:42 grows back you know those are there's
51:44 important extra research we have to do
51:46 at least you can keep the kid alive
51:48 until you figure it out and hopefully do
51:50 whatever you got to do to stop it but I
51:52 guarantee that the whole thing is living
51:54 next to a high-tension tower cell phones
51:57 uh uh eating crappy food I mean kids
52:02 getting cancer is proof this is a
52:06 man-made problem proof but no one wants
52:14 to be I don't know embarrassed wrong
52:19 look I told you guys I'm digressing a
52:22 little bit but it's important because it
52:23 stresses the repercussions
52:25 I've indoctrinated paradigms of truth
52:30 aka facts if I ever thought in my entire
52:35 life
52:35 I would assist someone assist because
52:39 I'm only one of again one of two people
52:42 that gives this recipe out to people
52:44 that recover if I ever thought I would
52:48 contribute to someone losing their
52:51 cancer I would have thought well geez
52:54 what happened did I get touched by an
52:56 alien or something we have a guy in the
52:57 comments section of the original 17
52:59 episode in season 1 on this channel
53:02 giving his case study he's like I did
53:05 this and it went away I can't even
53:07 believe this is like a miracle
53:08 thank you again it's not my idea it
53:12 comes from people that have cure kids
53:13 and there's a million cures for cancer
53:14 urine treatments there's there's what
53:18 was at the Nipsey Hussle guy was talking
53:20 about doing a documentary on a guy
53:22 that's curing cancer I need to research
53:24 that particular one because it's
53:26 something to do with the theory of
53:29 carbon-based life forms and carbon-based
53:31 intake and that kind of thing and when
53:32 you deviate from that you start creating
53:35 cancer in the body
53:37 complete sense just at the face value
53:39 but nipsey was just murdered right you
53:42 know I get the sad thing about nipsey's
53:44 he's you know he bought into the the
53:46 Banger world of rappin so he could have
53:48 just been murdered by some passerby but
53:52 what are facts for well there's two
53:57 paradigms at least of what facts are
54:00 supposed to do for us the first and
54:03 foremost thing which is probably the
54:05 least prioritized area / meaning of
54:10 facts is to actually get something right
54:13 in life to to be able to perform
54:16 something and the way that the facts
54:17 tell you they that it should be
54:19 performed and have a result come out at
54:21 the end of the equation you know you're
54:24 supposed to go to college and get a
54:26 degree and then you get a job and then
54:27 you work in that job for 3540 years you
54:30 retire with a bunch of money in the bank
54:32 and you go travel the world that's
54:33 that's the American dream that's
54:34 supposed to exist but they have
54:37 infiltrated that and destroyed it but
54:41 that's what we want to have happen
54:42 that's not the most important thing I
54:45 don't think I think the most important
54:49 thing is to give people a sense of
54:50 confidence and security in their life
54:52 and the more chaotic a person's life is
54:55 the more they want to if they're awake
54:57 to get regimented facts in their life to
55:00 kill the chaos and you have to respect
55:03 that how do you validate a fact besides
55:06 being in a laboratory or some control
55:09 condition where you can actually do
55:12 Occam's razor and say this that worked
55:14 oh my god now I have this little analogy
55:19 for gravity that will further complicate
55:24 things a little bit for anybody who
55:27 thinks that just simply doing an
55:29 experiment in a room gives you proof
55:33 that there you've actually seen a fact
55:35 occur now we know that if we drop things
55:39 they fall we call that effect gravity so
55:43 it exists by that sheer definition how
55:47 they say it happens well that could be
55:49 complete crap
55:50 again I say it's a push other people say
55:52 it's a pull I know I use this analogy a
55:54 lot but bear with me we're gonna go in a
55:55 different direction here I believe I
55:59 mentioned this in the gravity episode
56:01 and here's the thing you could have
56:05 person a here and person B here person a
56:08 is from 2019 person B is from 1519
56:14 person a is an atheist person B is a
56:17 Christian this isn't anything to do with
56:20 picking on Christianity don't worry
56:21 about it
56:22 person a believes in a phenomenon of
56:26 official history we have official
56:29 science right you go to Wikipedia look
56:31 up gravity it says it's a natural
56:32 phenomenon hilarious that means we have
56:34 no clue what it is because we've gotten
56:36 rid of ether out of the model all right
56:40 1519 person B says well I know exactly
56:44 what it is what is it
56:47 it's angel power what yeah angels they
56:51 push everything down
56:52 oh so the formula that these two write
56:57 these two write a formula to figure out
56:59 terminal velocity and all this other
57:00 stuff right okay they have the equation
57:04 correct their equation always predicts
57:07 how fast something will fall and when it
57:09 hits terminal velocity and they can plug
57:11 it into other algorithms to find out how
57:13 much the glass will shatter blah blah
57:14 blah their formulas are correct but
57:17 there are letters of what the force
57:20 actually is might be different letters
57:24 young guy uses a pH for phenomenon
57:27 because he has no idea what the hell
57:28 he's talking about the other one is
57:30 using an A for angel power when they do
57:35 their calculations they get the same
57:36 result both believe they have the fact
57:40 of what gravity is technically they
57:45 understand what gravity is because
57:47 things fall but technically and
57:50 factually they're completely wrong about
57:55 what's actually causing it you see how
57:59 we can split this and split this
58:02 an indivisible piece of information is
58:06 probably the only thing that we can call
58:07 fact which means it's rough now let's
58:12 pull back several light years away from
58:15 this problem and look at it let's think
58:18 about your soul going through a journey
58:20 of life well I've put forth dozens and
58:26 dozens of potential objectives of being
58:28 alive I strongly believe at this point
58:32 in my life that the pain and suffering
58:37 that we might feel in this world is
58:38 something that we have chosen for
58:40 ourselves because without it life
58:41 becomes there Nirvana of Hell a Q
58:47 continuum character as I've said several
58:49 times but that's something you can see
58:54 when you're on the outside looking at
58:55 your soul potentially going back into a
58:57 human form or some other form some other
58:59 place in the universe and you realize
59:02 well we have positives and negatives
59:03 because it creates choice and choice has
59:05 its own a little euphoric aphrodisiac to
59:09 the soul but as soon as you metabolize
59:12 yourself birth yourself metamorphosize
59:17 into a human form we have a little
59:20 agreement don't we you don't get to
59:22 remember all that stuff that you knew
59:25 when you were outside now some people
59:29 believe they can look back and see
59:30 previous life's I should probably do an
59:33 episode on that because I have my own
59:34 little experiences with that but save
59:38 that particular digression we'll let
59:41 that go for another episode you know if
59:44 you're not having those visions
59:46 especially you're in this body you're in
59:47 this life and you don't know how long
59:49 you're gonna live you know you're gonna
59:50 die and so the game is to suffer as
59:54 little as possible to have as much
59:56 success as possible in every category
59:58 the success can be measured or
60:00 attributed to life and so facts even if
60:05 they have a divisible nature to them as
60:08 long as like gravity you don't know
60:11 what's causing it or what it really is
60:13 but you need to understand
60:16 you're gonna you know roof houses you
60:18 don't want to fall off the roof and I
60:20 break your legs or whatever you're gonna
60:22 have to adopt some of this paradigm of
60:24 existence such that you can feel
60:27 comfortable hopefully more comfortable
60:30 as time goes on that you at least have
60:32 some of this world figured out and so we
60:35 can't blame people for doing the best
60:38 they can you only have the mind that you
60:41 have the more you work your mind the
60:44 more neurons you get and the more you
60:47 can look at things from a more artistic
60:49 level you know when I first heard you
60:53 know autism described by my friend you
60:55 had you know clinically proven three
60:59 levels of consciousness running at the
61:01 same exact time I said well what's it
61:03 like you know and this guy utter genius
61:05 fully functional guy but he was the Rain
61:08 Man autism not the vaccinated
61:10 brain-damaged autism and he said to me
61:15 well he goes you know I've got two
61:17 processors I don't need to use for
61:19 anything so I'm having a conversation
61:21 with you and I'm counting every pore on
61:25 your face
61:26 I'm counting all the objects in the room
61:28 all at the same time and I'm maintaining
61:31 a conversation with you and nothing
61:34 misses a beat anywhere it's almost as if
61:38 the Rain Man autism is sort of the next
61:41 evolution in mankind if you think about
61:43 it us having all these consciousnesses
61:46 and being able to deal with them without
61:47 feeling awkward but then again how do we
61:52 how do we acknowledge all these
61:55 frailties in the process of coming up
61:57 with facts especially if you think about
62:00 it we pay and this is like a 10 year old
62:02 factoid we pay the Army Corps of psyops
62:08 at least a billion and a half a year in
62:11 payroll to develop tools information
62:15 tools to then infect our world with
62:19 disinformation we are paying for the
62:21 psychosis that is a lack of identity in
62:24 the world a lack of true orientation as
62:27 to where we are what's ago
62:29 what's good for us what's bad for us so
62:33 we're not fully developed as human
62:35 beings we're still being incredibly
62:38 naive and unfortunately it would seem
62:41 that one of the highest forms of
62:45 intelligence is deception and evil I
62:50 mean think about that day in September
62:52 of 2001 regardless of what you think
62:56 about that day was that day orchestrated
63:00 by average intelligent human beings
63:03 mm-hmm that day was orchestrated by
63:07 probably some of the most brilliant
63:09 people in the world at so many levels of
63:14 you know deceptive press darlings to
63:21 just everything you could possibly
63:22 imagine
63:23 aviation and information and demolition
63:26 and potentially directed-energy weapon
63:30 people and just on and on and on what
63:36 positive thing if we done in the world
63:39 has not has been equally intelligent as
63:42 equally intelligent that's been for the
63:45 good of man hmm my hope is that you know
63:51 in the things that I discuss on this
63:52 show that it benefits your life more
63:55 than it hurts your life I don't know
64:02 that I've had an episode where anyone
64:03 reported back you know I followed your
64:05 advice or I did this and that and I now
64:08 I'm estranged from my kids I'm divorced
64:11 and I died of cancer you know I've never
64:14 had anyone say anything like that do I
64:17 question all of reality nowadays more
64:20 than ever
64:20 sure but do I lose sleep over it not a
64:24 wink not a wake man I go to work I do my
64:28 stuff I keep my you know my exploration
64:33 mind for rabbit holes and conspiracies
64:37 in one camp and I keep reality in
64:39 another camp and what's funny is
64:42 you know if I date someone it's funny I
64:46 often get this thing of or even just a
64:48 normal human being that's just a friend
64:50 of mine but I will have people say you
64:53 know in almost let's fragile scared
64:58 voice that you know I don't know what
65:02 it's like to be you you live in a
65:03 complete conspiracy world and conspiracy
65:05 and in their perception of me in just a
65:08 few sentences a few conversations if I
65:10 happen to mention my god just
65:12 low-hanging fruit stuff like JFK's
65:14 assassination or I don't know something
65:18 something really basic their perception
65:21 is immediately a fear one that I'm right
65:28 about something they don't want me to be
65:30 right about any of that stuff and no one
65:32 wants to be right in the truth movement
65:34 about all these conspiracies except if
65:36 they're true to stop them that's
65:39 something you need to repeat to anyone
65:41 that has to listen to you for the very
65:43 first time dump out your theories that
65:45 are different your facts that are well
65:49 explored and wear it well analyzed and
65:52 checked with your friends who come from
65:54 all different ages and lifes and and
65:56 disciplines and so I think that some of
66:00 the facts seeking conversations quote
66:03 unquote air quotes I should say it's to
66:06 sort of temper the throttle of
66:10 information transfer as to limit it in a
66:14 way that the mind can can sort of bring
66:17 it down to a level where it's not going
66:19 to be as terrifying disorienting and I
66:24 think that we do have natural defense
66:27 mechanisms that just activate you're
66:31 listening to someone tell you something
66:33 that you absolutely positively don't
66:36 want to believe and if I may use the
66:38 term can't believe and so that
66:42 kubler-ross thing goes straight to
66:45 negotiation it's kind of vacillating
66:47 between denial and negotiation then the
66:49 denial is sort of the thing that people
66:51 sometimes say I just can't believe that
66:54 no I
66:55 no this and that and this and this and
66:56 how could this remain true or how could
67:00 this be false if for decades and decades
67:03 is said to be true that kind of talk and
67:06 then if they get past that that one of
67:09 the defense mechanisms I believe is to
67:12 try and throw the property probably the
67:15 less I should say the least used method
67:19 is for someone to say why just have to
67:21 have facts I can't listen to this stuff
67:23 you're saying and then can we go back
67:25 into the debate of this entire episode
67:26 that's not used that much in my life
67:29 and I don't think that my friends were
67:31 asking me to address this issue or
67:33 necessarily in that camp they're
67:37 concerned about me personally I think
67:41 sometimes it's someone else's reputation
67:44 you know someone's like I can't repeat
67:45 what you say or I can't be with you in
67:48 public engaging these conversations
67:50 unless I play a very defensive position
67:52 because I haven't had the chance to do
67:54 the research and that isn't that is a
67:56 fully respectable attack to take and
67:59 that's something that should be spoken
68:00 if there's a public forum going on to
68:02 say hey I don't have the same background
68:04 as this person this person is very
68:05 certain about things that I am NOT
68:07 certain about so as we have this
68:08 conversation please keep me in your in a
68:11 different camp until I get to this level
68:13 if I ever do that's cool I've told you
68:17 several times and I think there's at
68:19 least a couple dozen of you that have
68:21 run into this the age-old tactic of
68:24 someone saying well you don't have a
68:28 formal degree in something that you're
68:30 talking about so you could be full of
68:32 crap all right
68:35 that's why don't try to talk about you
68:37 know chemical reactions because I don't
68:39 have a chemistry degree it's one area of
68:42 science that I've only delve into as I
68:45 need to know you know when aluminum
68:47 melts and and when steel melts and
68:51 fire-rated steel melts and how kara
68:53 scenes with kerosene stop burning
68:55 temperature is and blah blah blah so
68:57 it's just you dive in to get the
68:58 factoids that you need and then you hop
69:00 out you apply to the overall
69:02 conversations in a different area I just
69:07 made the episode about formal education
69:09 it is predictably not getting too many
69:12 views cuz I also pushed out the
69:14 Neverland thing run on top of that
69:16 because I knew that you know formal
69:18 education is just on a sexy subject but
69:21 it is my belief that for those who see
69:24 that episode who have that anxiety that
69:26 my friend has that I put in the episode
69:29 but I talk about in the episode it'll do
69:31 you a whole world of good to listen to
69:34 it but again my favorite comment now
69:37 that I developed on this show live when
69:39 you saw me say for the very first time
69:41 that's when I had the first thought of
69:42 it which is how many degrees did the
69:44 people who built the pyramids have how
69:48 many degrees that every blacksmith have
69:50 in this world all the apprenticeship
69:53 careers before universities were the
69:55 method by which we judged knowledge in a
69:58 human being I have what was interesting
70:03 we had we had a person come in and
70:08 comment about Michael Jackson and he
70:11 said that he knew Michael and he spent
70:13 quite a few years in Michael circles and
70:15 so he had probably one of the best
70:17 comments about the whole subject and
70:20 just saying look the guy was definitely
70:22 strange but he was anything but a child
70:25 when you knew him he goes that whole
70:28 Kitty personality thing that he put on
70:30 for the press was merely a persona that
70:32 he invented and there's a whole slew of
70:35 videos of Michael speaking in a normal
70:37 man leave voice - very interesting
70:40 but the commenter said he was extremely
70:44 intelligent for not having a formal
70:46 education I barely ever went to school
70:48 at all I have other friends with the
70:51 exact same aptitude the most articulate
70:54 brilliant discerning minds with no
70:58 formal education and all and barely any
71:01 other education because they were either
71:02 a celebrity or they were involved in
71:06 celebrity families where kids weren't
71:10 allowed to go to school
71:12 they weren't nellis REO which didn't say
71:14 not allowed but they just were part of
71:17 the set they were part of making movies
71:18 and life was taken care of and the ended
71:21 up
71:22 human beings far more articulate than me
71:27 far more with brilliant minds I saw a
71:32 YouTube video today at my lounge which
71:35 talked about the ecosystem of
71:37 disinformation especially applied to the
71:40 Democratic Party of course where they
71:43 own the press right they own all the
71:45 press and Fox is sort of 50/50 they know
71:49 where their bread is buttered and so
71:51 what they do is they put out a false
71:53 story in blog form then they pick it up
71:57 and put it in national news maybe even
71:59 international news everything's an
72:01 international nowadays right and then
72:03 the politicians run into town hall
72:06 meetings or these little gatherings with
72:08 like their fifty people that are there
72:09 and they quote from these artificial
72:13 articles that are simply pulled out of
72:15 someone's ass somewhere right the big
72:17 nothing burger of the Russian collusion
72:21 hilarious if you believe in Russian
72:23 collusion from the Trump administration
72:25 to Russia you know stay in school man
72:31 you know when you're an adult like
72:34 myself your kids are already through
72:36 school everything's good
72:39 and you're sort of your own man your own
72:42 woman
72:42 there's an interesting sweet spot that
72:45 occurs because then you can just craft
72:47 yourself your sculpture your minds the
72:50 sculpture that was LL Cool J says my
72:55 tongue is the sculpture yeah he says my
72:58 tongue is the sculpture and this
73:00 composition is over my favorite lines
73:01 from his song I'm bad but now let's say
73:05 you have a child
73:06 maybe it's your grandkid or it's your
73:09 kid now you have a responsibility to
73:13 fill up this gas tank that is a child's
73:16 mind and if if there's one thing I can
73:21 say at the end of this episode and
73:23 hopefully this episode has absolutely
73:25 shaken you to your core for what you
73:27 think is right and what is wrong but
73:30 also giving you hope that you can trust
73:32 your instincts and your intelligence you
73:34 for watching this show you're hardly an
73:36 average
73:36 it was gonna be about an hour and 20
73:39 minutes into this episode by now the
73:42 thing that I have stressed over and over
73:44 is that as adults to to accept reality
73:48 is to constrain it facts are the chisels
73:53 that carve away stone that will never be
73:56 back on that stone it was a Michelangelo
73:59 sculpture David I mean I looked at that
74:05 sculpture as a kid it made me feel
74:07 strange as a kid I'm one of those guys
74:08 that has a weird thing with sculptures
74:10 at least when I was a kid I don't know
74:11 why it's so strange but when I grew up
74:15 and found out that he was using
74:17 foreshortening techniques such that when
74:19 you stand at the base of David he has
74:21 distorted all the proportions as such
74:23 that when you stand there and look up at
74:25 it it's proportional so he's he's
74:29 shortened the perspective of him just a
74:31 microscopic amount so that looks perfect
74:34 to the eye but now that sculpture is one
74:40 of the eighth wonders of the world that
74:44 a human being could take a big giant
74:47 stone I mean that was that must have
74:49 been a horrendously large stone when he
74:51 started and he just kept tapping away at
74:54 it until he created an absolute
74:56 masterpiece of human creation it may
75:00 Eclipse everything the Egyptians did I
75:03 mean it is an amazing thing but just
75:06 imagine a sculptor of stone can't make a
75:11 mistake I mean today they probably could
75:14 write a little superglue and they'd fix
75:15 it up but back in his day you had to be
75:17 perfect or you're out of the business
75:19 and he did a human form we all know what
75:24 humans look like don't we it's
75:26 instinctual so if he made any mistakes
75:29 that gross mistakes and has its style to
75:32 it of course we would reject it and that
75:36 arm doesn't look like the fingers too
75:38 big you know his private parts that they
75:40 were a little small but you know
75:45 that's our life it's a big stone or
75:49 Bourne except that we can actually get
75:53 bigger than the stone after we're born
75:55 can't we because we can just live in
75:58 pure enlightenment and simply have facts
76:01 presented to us with this methodology to
76:04 say if it's divisible then there's
76:06 interpretation there's subjectivity to
76:08 whatever you're discussing why is it
76:12 again I think I said this on my first
76:13 episodes why is it the wisest men on
76:16 earth back in the past when men with a
76:18 predominant sex that was allowed to go
76:22 to university the greatest thinkers that
76:26 we've ever itemized in human history
76:27 always came out of their universities
76:30 after 10 20 30 years of philosophizing
76:32 about what where we were and what we
76:34 were doing they simply said I realized I
76:37 knew nothing why is that
76:40 did they have less facts did they go in
76:43 to get lobotomized hardly I would I
76:47 would assert that without the
76:49 constraints of the horrible
76:51 disinformation that we financed with our
76:53 taxes nowadays they were probably some
76:55 of the most enlightened human beings to
76:57 ever live that we know of in recorded
77:00 history and yet they came out and
77:03 disowned their egos at the very end they
77:09 humbled themselves to the entire
77:10 universe and simply said you know what
77:13 maybe I think therefore I am
77:15 maybe that's as far as it goes am i
77:19 skating around the responsibility of
77:21 presenting facts not at all I think
77:24 about it more now than ever we're in
77:28 this Great Awakening sort of the
77:29 renaissance 2.0 that's what I would call
77:32 it and we're all excited and I think
77:36 we're excited because for the very first
77:38 time were we're saying no to the formal
77:42 sources of information we now have a
77:45 beautiful catch phrase now if you call
77:48 it a catch phrase but a beautiful label
77:50 called fake news it's very important now
77:53 I think this episode gets to the next
77:58 level
77:59 of the conversation so you say that
78:02 things may not be true the history has
78:04 been reformed revised erased the victors
78:07 wrote the history books right I'll put
78:09 that episode out before I put this one
78:10 out I did it last night the next step up
78:16 is to say okay we have to get more
78:17 existential with our discernment of
78:20 information try to litmus test you know
78:26 me saying in fact being indivisible
78:29 something I just thought up on this
78:30 particular show but it's starting to
78:32 ring really well with my mind that's a
78:35 tall order isn't it creates more burden
78:37 on those that really want to know the
78:39 truth could it be that we unite as a
78:44 society we kick out these deep sea
78:45 people we get rid of all these news
78:49 outlets that are feeding us a bunch of
78:51 crap we annihilate science with the
78:54 capital S the religion of science we
78:58 clean up the world we clean up
78:59 everything and then is it possible for
79:02 us to write some constitutional protocol
79:05 for information information gathering
79:09 information validation and information
79:12 distribution you know we talk about all
79:14 the security all the time about our
79:16 internet stuff as if we have anything
79:18 that anyone really cares about anyway
79:20 but we talk about protecting the packets
79:22 of information the travel from our
79:24 computer to someone else's computers
79:26 such that no one can look inside the
79:27 information and steal our information
79:29 and you to drop on us and so the data
79:33 integrity is at its maximum you know
79:36 where it came from and it's only going
79:39 to who you wanted to distribute it to is
79:42 their methodology for looking at the
79:44 world and information and protecting it
79:46 moving forward well I just thought of
79:51 another extension to this episode I
79:52 apologize for going deep and going
79:55 longer so for those of you like longer
79:57 episodes you're gonna love this one
79:58 I have failed to mention one thing at
80:03 just a pure term
80:08 the Nemesis of a good fact is a lie
80:16 and because lies are the methodology by
80:20 which you get your way when you can't
80:23 get it legitimately this is what the
80:26 deep state does 24 hours a day 365 days
80:31 a year forever these people who take
80:36 money to lie are extraordinary human
80:40 beings if you think about it you're not
80:43 raised to lie I mean certain families
80:49 are but very few you know people take
80:53 money to get all the low-hanging fruit
80:56 maybe they're sociopaths or they hate
80:59 society because society didn't accept
81:02 them at a particular formative moment in
81:05 their life as a youth and so it's screw
81:09 you I want to watch the world burn
81:11 because I hate all of you anyone doesn't
81:14 show up at the high school reunion it's
81:16 a candidate for that it's interesting
81:18 and probably not for big cities but for
81:20 little cities little towns like mine
81:22 it's interesting I think people bring me
81:29 lies that have been labeled as fact and
81:33 I think that there are certain
81:37 indicators that things are completely
81:38 lies when there's laws that say you have
81:40 to believe something there's a lie in
81:42 there somewhere
81:43 I don't know if it's big I know if it's
81:44 small could be huge that for me is a de
81:49 facto moment where truth and reality are
81:52 being distorted to advance a narrative
81:55 and a belief system that is a lie what
81:59 was the Inquisition seriously what was
82:02 it a bunch of mercenaries from the
82:05 Catholic Church running around killing
82:08 people and torturing people because they
82:10 didn't believe the doctrine of the
82:11 Catholic Church Wow was that an act of
82:16 God was that was that man for
82:20 seeing the belief of God into someone
82:22 through the Savior Jesus Christ
82:24 I would submit not you know I mean you
82:29 think about the beautiful story of
82:31 Christ again when I watched the mr.
82:34 Rogers thing there's that a beautiful
82:38 moment in the documentary when there was
82:40 a real incident in the outside world
82:41 where some a black couple was in a
82:44 Jacuzzi at a motel and the owner said
82:46 gal Jacuzzi are making the water dirty
82:49 or whatever his stupid rationale was and
82:51 they wouldn't leave and so he started
82:53 pouring you know bleach into the jacuzzi
82:56 forcing the mountain and mr. Rogers had
83:01 a black gentleman who was a postman I
83:04 believe he was the postman and he
83:07 invited him to put his feet in a little
83:09 baby bath and he said let's just chill
83:12 out here and that was Fred Rogers
83:15 flipping the finger to racism on his
83:17 show and not only that but when the guy
83:20 had to pull his feet out and dry them
83:21 off Fred did it just like Jesus did it
83:26 as the story goes so we have this story
83:30 of this guy who visits prostitutes and
83:33 poor people and people with leprosy and
83:35 he's doing everything you possibly can
83:36 to show infinite mercy and acceptance
83:40 and love but the organization that's
83:44 promoting this is doing anything but
83:47 that sort of godly behavior and that's
83:50 how this thing took off lies there's a
83:56 preponderance of belief that says if I
84:01 can't think of it it can't happen if I
84:03 can't think of it that no one else can
84:04 think of it I can't imagine that anyone
84:08 would lie about the new mission so no
84:09 one can lie about the moon missions I
84:11 can't think about anyone doing an inside
84:13 job blowing up three buildings and
84:17 another like a fourth that had some
84:19 secondary explosions going off I can't
84:21 think of that so no one else could could
84:24 and therefore the official story is the
84:26 true story as the 17 guys always says
84:30 we're fighting a war and I think that
84:33 the information
84:34 or is the war and it has to do
84:37 explicitly with facts to distort them to
84:41 disinformation attack them such that for
84:45 anything that you hear you hear the
84:47 opposite cures to cancer that are
84:51 outside of the oncology draconian crap
84:55 of radiation treatment are all bunk you
85:02 know someone posted on our think it was
85:04 David I think one of our moderators or
85:08 someone on the page posted a an old
85:11 advertisement of a doctor with the
85:14 cigarette in his hand saying how
85:17 cigarettes were good for you
85:18 and they even had an advertisements back
85:21 in the day telling pregnant women to
85:23 smoke because they didn't wanna have big
85:24 babies because it made for small
85:27 children and no one thought that was bad
85:29 no one thought it through well geez how
85:31 could some how could a doctor tell me to
85:34 smoke cigarettes if they weren't good
85:36 for me okay does anyone doubt that that
85:40 was a bunch of crap back in the day so
85:43 why do you hang on to so many [ __ ]
85:45 stories today how do you do it we should
85:49 be questioning everything constantly and
85:53 look at observable reality I've got
85:58 three people in my life have taken this
86:00 treatment for cancer it's practically
86:03 free when you compare it to all the
86:04 other crap you can order it on you know
86:07 Amazon for God's sakes I don't know to
86:10 be Zoe's go to somebody else but we have
86:14 this place called mother's market down
86:15 the street they got everything it's they
86:18 don't have the high dosage b-seventeen
86:20 but they have a hundred milligrams you
86:22 really don't wanna take 500 at least
86:25 twice a day depending how big you are
86:29 can't hurt you they can't hurt you if
86:32 you take too much to this crap I doubt
86:33 or pee it out there you go you're good
86:35 your body takes what it needs that's it
86:37 just keep it full that's my observable
86:41 reality it's people getting cured by
86:43 this stuff well if I were to stand in
86:47 front of John
86:48 up khun's or some other big oncology
86:49 joint that's worth trillions of dollars
86:51 and there's all these phd's inside these
86:54 crazy people and they have cured some
86:55 people with district Oni and crap they
86:58 could have someone standing next to me
86:59 going
87:00 you're gonna battle that no no I'm not
87:02 gonna battle that I'm just gonna tell
87:04 you what the solution is or want one of
87:06 the solutions you could potentially
87:07 engage you can do you can do every
87:10 single treatment in the cancer episode
87:13 every single one of them you won't lose
87:15 your hair you won't puke you won't lose
87:18 your appetite you may want some sugar
87:20 and meat eventually but you can't do
87:24 you're cured you gotta figure out how
87:25 you got it in the first place and then
87:27 get that crap if you live next to a
87:28 high-tension tower and you're catching
87:29 cancer you move the hell away I'm really
87:31 sorry
87:32 rent the place out sell it short sell it
87:35 whatever you got to do how important is
87:36 it for you not to die that stuff it's
87:40 not a hundred percent the reason why or
87:43 conclusively the reason why people live
87:45 next to them and they don't get that
87:46 stuff but they haven't died yet either I
87:48 think that the thing that people don't
87:51 want to wake up to and this is what I'll
87:52 close with kind of pull it all together
87:56 no one wants to believe the deep state
87:58 exists they don't and even if they were
88:02 willing to accept that it exists they
88:04 still want to put limiters on with the
88:06 deep states capable of doing and what
88:07 they're currently doing to you they just
88:11 don't want to believe that all the
88:12 food's bad for them they don't want to
88:13 believe that medication is bad for them
88:16 they don't want to believe their
88:18 politicians are bought off that their
88:21 judges and and it's just a few corrupt
88:23 people in in places and pretty much
88:25 every place on earth right there's
88:27 always a corrupt judge that's willing to
88:28 take a paycheck to throw a case one way
88:31 or the other they don't want to believe
88:33 that and so they go into the denial
88:35 phase if they're willing to step in past
88:38 the denial phase they go into the
88:39 negotiation phase and it's all
88:42 marginalizing the truth marginalizing
88:45 the evil so they can go to bed at night
88:47 I say you should go to bed at night with
88:50 a big giant grin on your face because
88:52 for the first time in in human history
88:54 we are communicating as a planet about
88:58 one thing it's called truth
89:00 we don't know all the facts of the truth
89:04 but some of us have you know groups of
89:08 friends methodologies that are very
89:10 scientific that constantly reanalyzed
89:15 the first thing that we were told the
89:17 second thing we were told the third
89:18 thing we were told and we just do Dell
89:20 logic problems all day long trying to
89:22 figure this stuff out I mean at one
89:24 point if you're trying to solve a
89:26 particular issue you put this all in
89:29 your head and you constantly turn it I
89:32 know people that create excuses
89:35 constantly all day long for everything
89:37 they don't want to believe and they're
89:40 very smart people and they come up with
89:42 some pretty interesting funny ass sort
89:46 of blank checks for the deep state
89:48 constantly well I just can't believe
89:50 this would be the case because there's
89:51 there's got to be enough honest people
89:53 in that organization to blow the whistle
89:56 and to report it on the news indebted uh
89:58 and after you've lived through this for
90:00 a couple decades you're starting to
90:02 laugh you're just like really you really
90:05 think that there's just this one
90:06 reporter it's CNN it's gonna be like a
90:09 dog gun and I'm going online I'm going
90:11 on the air live and I'm gonna just start
90:13 spouting the truth you know it doesn't
90:18 work like that
90:18 I'm sorry it doesn't work like that but
90:22 what's nice is God gave you a brain and
90:26 he gave you a Pinal gland and he gave
90:28 you a third eye and it gave you a soul
90:31 and if you turn all that on at the same
90:33 time and you one bone connects to the
90:36 next bone and you talk to the universe
90:39 instead of to fake news or some article
90:42 that makes you feel good about some evil
90:44 thing because it's starting to
90:45 marginalize it so you can sleep at night
90:47 if you just go with your instincts
90:50 listen to the frequencies of truth or
90:52 lies and continually analyze the data in
90:58 your head continually think developing
91:00 more brain cells right you stimulate
91:02 your neurons they procreate based on
91:04 stimulation I think you feel me
91:07 it's important episode glad I did it for
91:11 those of you who have not gone too deep
91:13 it's radio calm it's where you get all
91:16 the information all the links the links
91:18 are actually the most important part
91:20 thanks to video links to audio links to
91:23 Facebook it is a LOC Facebook group
91:25 remember to say something human in your
91:27 application for being in the group I
91:30 will if I get an account where someone
91:33 wants to be a part of the group and they
91:34 haven't said something human I if you
91:37 look if you look legit I'll go over to
91:39 your profile take a look at you and see
91:41 if your poster recent even have you been
91:43 talking in English you're posting you
