00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:32 gentlemen justice Mike here a little bit
00:36 so I let's see about a week ago bright
00:43 not quite a week ago I made it an
00:47 episode called Flat Earth rage and you
00:52 know it was was okay it was sort of
00:55 based on the I put a big part of it was
00:58 based on that polish astronaut that said
01:00 the earth was flattened and then I got
01:04 to reading and reading and reading about
01:05 that video and I can't find the original
01:10 interview but several folks on the
01:13 comment sections were like well if you
01:15 watch the entire interview he explains
01:17 his entire mission explains the earth as
01:20 a ball and then according to the Polish
01:24 citizens they said which you're not able
01:26 to hear through translation is his
01:29 sarcasm and the final answer to the
01:33 interview now whether or not I can chime
01:37 in on whether or not that sarcastic or
01:39 not it's definitely not the way that
01:41 Americans are sarcastic you can chime in
01:43 for your language if it's not polish
01:46 because for me it seemed pretty pretty
01:50 legit he seemed pretty weird after he
01:52 said it and but I mean if it's if it's
01:55 sarcasm and it's a joke that dude is
01:57 actually pretty damn funny I mean that's
01:59 a pretty dry [ __ ] man I'm impressed but
02:02 now I did an episode called how we don't
02:06 think and I actually did it quite a
02:09 quite a while ago and just recently
02:11 released it and I'm getting you know
02:14 like a obviously get blowback when I
02:18 really hit the flat earth thing on the
02:22 nose whether I support it or don't
02:24 support it I have people who dislike my
02:28 opinion either way and this is what this
02:31 episode is gonna be about it's gonna be
02:32 a redo of the other episode because I
02:34 kind of you know you think through
02:35 things and you're talking live like I'm
02:37 doing
02:38 and then it I had my grand Epiphany at
02:41 the end unfortunately and so I'm gonna
02:44 put it at the beginning I'm gonna do an
02:47 episode on the Russian KGB guy that
02:51 defected by 1985 and came to United
02:55 States he had defected before 1985 but
02:57 he took this interview I've mentioned
02:59 him once before this season and he ran
03:02 down the line of how the Soviet Union
03:04 was taking over the United States of
03:08 America through cognitive dissidence
03:10 techniques and if he had told anyone
03:15 that stuff say even well even an 85 but
03:18 definitely 20 years before they had
03:19 started the program no one would have
03:21 believed that what he said in 85 could
03:25 be true let alone was true because he
03:27 said this is what we've already
03:28 accomplished the rest of its gonna go
03:30 really easy but the thing that is stuck
03:33 in my head since I saw this interview
03:35 and I've seen it three or four times now
03:37 again just look up KGB defector 1985 and
03:41 you'll see this dude with glasses
03:43 sitting on a chair in like a 1985 camera
03:46 it's nice and snowy resolution and you
03:49 owe it to yourself to watch that thing
03:51 all the way through if I can remember
03:53 I'll put it in the comment section down
03:55 below in the description right but this
03:57 dude was a thousand percent correct the
04:00 world that we have today is incapable of
04:04 believing the truth even when they're
04:05 told it now I will just say it like that
04:08 so that you can apply your version of
04:10 the truth and you can't necessarily
04:13 easily get angry at me about it
04:15 great no but I know you can but here's
04:19 the Epiphany that really and this is no
04:21 Epiphany to average philosophy of
04:24 freedom and and the sovereignty of
04:28 humanity but you know that there are a
04:34 few people in this world who run the
04:36 joint they control the money and as soon
04:39 as they control the money they
04:41 controlled everyone because it just it
04:43 takes two minutes to find a sellout you
04:46 know a Nadler a pelosi a shift
04:50 Maxine Waters I mean one shill after
04:55 another someone who will sell out their
04:57 entire race specifically so for thinking
05:01 you know get a beach house or whatever
05:03 it is status because their poor little
05:06 souls need you know to be told they're
05:09 amazing every single day even if it's a
05:11 fraudulent claim like I didn't really do
05:14 that but it feels good to do he said you
05:16 know be told that I did it right so as a
05:19 few that run the world and then you have
05:22 the rest of us the 99.9% of the world
05:27 there's not 1% that runs the world
05:30 that's way too much there's 1% that
05:33 perhaps are the really rich people that
05:36 we all want to hate and steal their
05:37 money even legitimate business owners
05:39 who have worked really hard they who's
05:44 miss possum it's think that that whole
05:47 thing of like let's tax billionaires a
05:49 hundred percent or someone whose work
05:51 really hard doesn't deserve to have
05:52 their money now I will tell you from
05:54 experience and watching these people
05:56 with tremendous amounts of money one
06:00 I've rarely seen anyone like that happy
06:02 to you do you really don't need that
06:05 much money anything you can conceive of
06:08 you can build it yourself have it
06:12 yourself maybe you know a thing is if
06:15 you're gonna build like the next Titanic
06:16 or you're gonna build some spaceship or
06:19 something you can get people to help you
06:21 finance it that's what capitalism is all
06:23 about you can't afford to pay for your
06:25 dream or you don't want to give up your
06:27 entire life savings for risk so you
06:28 bring other people in they help finance
06:30 it this what capitalism is that's all it
06:32 is but together you know we can conquer
06:35 these folks divided they can pick us off
06:38 one by one and we are in the center of
06:43 this movement to divide us all now we
06:50 can debate all day
06:51 NASA being a fraudulent organization we
06:55 know that at least a giant portion of
06:57 their history their claims to fame have
06:59 all been faked
07:02 okay Touche I'm right there man I'm the
07:06 moon guy on YouTube man I think the guy
07:09 that's definitely outdone me for moon
07:11 videos by count is bart sibrel but I
07:15 might even eclipse Bart four total
07:17 minutes dedicated to this subject matter
07:19 of we did not go to the moon but now we
07:23 have a bunch of new ones right we've got
07:25 the acidic ones that the fake news will
07:27 talk about you know and Tifa
07:31 black lives matters all the lgbtq XYZ
07:34 PDQ stuff kids you know seven years old
07:39 trying to get a sexual reassignment
07:41 surgery I mean oh my god you know it's
07:46 just it's just it's it's [ __ ] insane
07:49 that's all it is
07:50 and I've got let's see I've got LGB
07:53 friends that don't agree with that at
07:56 all I mean and they don't agree that
07:58 kids should be messed up with they don't
08:00 believe that kids should be taught in
08:01 school anything about their sexuality
08:03 just leave them alone
08:04 let them figure it out if anything get
08:07 them super educated you know hopefully
08:09 their parents are employed and happy and
08:11 not having to work two or three jobs so
08:13 that they don't have any parental
08:14 guidance on their you know in their
08:16 behalf but the flatter thing in the
08:19 round globe thing is sort of this weird
08:24 thing you know rrt calm the russian
08:27 television thing that's not what it
08:28 stands for I don't think but I could see
08:31 the words that they type I Justin with
08:32 hella mean but anyway they published an
08:35 article about how good the Flat Earth
08:38 movement was for science
08:39 now they immediately attached to a
08:41 climate changed a bunch of other crap so
08:43 it was a very globalist sort of deep
08:46 state article arty is just as deep state
08:48 is Fox News is seeing in all these
08:51 organizations are no don't you guys know
08:54 what I've said I've done whole episodes
08:57 on the fact that I think the Flat Earth
08:58 is great for the scientific community
09:00 even if you don't believe it's true and
09:02 the number one reasons are is that okay
09:06 you're so sure it's a globe you've never
09:08 been in space you've never seen Earth's
09:10 in space every single picture of Earth's
09:12 in space has been proven an absolute
09:14 forgery and as a matter of
09:15 there's a nasa.gov video of the last kid
09:19 that did the blue marble shot explaining
09:22 how he did it with composite shots of
09:24 Earth and he said the famous phrase it's
09:26 a composite it has to be alright you're
09:30 so sure it's a globe again my whole
09:34 thing is I believe in expanding earth
09:36 plasma ball core to earth and it's all
09:39 fueled by ether winds it's one unified
09:42 theory it explains gravity that explains
09:47 the core of the earth having a magnet
09:49 magnetic Center unlike nickel iron that
09:52 loses its its magnetism a few thousand
09:57 degrees Celsius it's done
09:59 okay here's what surprises me and I've
10:05 explained this over the course of five
10:06 years I've got two friends of mine that
10:09 when I talked about the flatterer thing
10:12 one of them got just really upset that
10:16 that anyone would ever insinuate that he
10:18 just could not let the conversation
10:19 complete his sentence my other buddy was
10:24 just come on come on come on don't be
10:25 that guy and so I don't understand it I
10:30 don't know about you but there's there's
10:32 only a limited amount of interesting
10:34 things going on in the world at any one
10:36 point in time that's not entirely acidic
10:38 right yeah they're doing this [ __ ]
10:42 impeachment thing on Trump lover hate
10:44 the guy here's the thing if you were
10:47 ever in a court with Adam Schiff running
10:50 your legal justice system you would be
10:53 guilty because he decided you were
10:56 guilty he's judge and jury he erases the
10:59 Constitution he erases due process is
11:02 that the world you want to live in
11:03 really I don't give a [ __ ] if you're a
11:05 Democrat Republican or libertarian or
11:07 whatever every molecule in your body
11:12 should be against things like that or
11:15 they're in pursuit of a crime let's just
11:17 have a bunch of hearings until we have a
11:18 you know we find something we don't like
11:20 then we'll drum it up
11:22 that's the acidic world I'm going to
11:26 talk about that because I just
11:29 comment today where someone said I was
11:31 talking about the being psychic video
11:32 when the comments say come on man this
11:35 stuff is legit by the way why don't you
11:36 talk about what's wrong going wrong with
11:38 the world like man is this your first
11:40 day on deep thoughts
11:42 we got agenda21 we have the California
11:44 fires we have the growing divide I mean
11:48 I've got dozens and dozens of videos on
11:51 those topics that's that's unfortunately
11:55 you know got some doom and gloom in and
11:58 if we don't change our ways so to that
12:01 listener hang in there look around there
12:03 there I just gave you a few but I just
12:07 for the life of me if I had a gun
12:09 against my head and someone said explain
12:11 to me why people get so vehemently angry
12:14 and either Glover's or flat earthers you
12:20 know I'd make something up to stay alive
12:22 but I really wouldn't intimately
12:23 understand it at all it's almost like
12:26 pedophilia I don't get it well how do
12:28 people cross that line we have a fun
12:30 thing going on here man you know get
12:33 into it if you're a globe or man I think
12:35 one of the greatest buddy buddy movies
12:37 that could be written right now in
12:38 Hollywood would be two kids I don't care
12:42 how old they are
12:43 one's a globe or one's a flat earther
12:45 they still love each other because
12:47 they're best friends and they end up
12:49 helping each other try and prove each
12:51 other's theory now I do want to correct
12:54 something that I've been citing in
12:56 episodes because my buddy who's a flat
12:58 earther pulled up this app on his iPad
13:03 that's called the Flat Earth clock it's
13:05 a beautiful application definitely
13:08 wanted to run on a tablet iPad looks
13:11 amazing but it's everyday it just you
13:16 bring it up and it shows exactly where
13:17 the moon is exactly where the earth is
13:19 and what time of day it is because I
13:21 flew from Los Angeles to Sydney and it
13:23 was like 12 14 hours somewhere and I
13:27 can't remember but wasn't like an
13:29 all-day trip and so I cited that Dima
13:32 said well you know I went to Sydney but
13:33 but but a guy in the room with me lives
13:35 in Australia had lived Australia for
13:37 several years my buddy looked at me like
13:39 I was a [ __ ] he goes oh that's no big
13:42 deal
13:43 he brings up this Flat Earth clock thing
13:45 on his iPad you look because it's damn
13:48 near straight-line what's the problem
13:51 because what you can't do is fly from
13:54 the tip of South America over to
13:57 Australia and a straight line that's too
14:00 far on the Flat Earth disk and he showed
14:03 it to me and I was like oh yeah okay I'm
14:06 definitely not made that trip don't know
14:08 if anyone has but now technically it's
14:12 not a tremendous difference between Los
14:15 Angeles I mean yes the tip of South
14:18 America I believe is in eastern time but
14:23 it should be possible but not on a flat
14:25 earth meant that that would be such a
14:27 massive trip around the outer edge of
14:29 this disc so perhaps even my little you
14:32 know I'm so sure it's a globe thing
14:35 isn't isn't proving anything right but
14:40 now as I always cite and I will go into
14:42 it but I'm an expanding earth guy go
14:45 look it up Neil Adams expanding earth
14:47 let me know what you think it's pretty
14:49 freakin conclusive to me I've showed it
14:51 to so many of my friends who never who
14:53 are still glow bursts they never even
14:55 heard about Flat Earth when I showed it
14:56 to him I hadn't heard about Flat Earth
14:57 when I showed it to him one of my most
14:59 brilliant friends he's a famous actor
15:02 comedian from the UK he looked at it and
15:06 he was like well that is pretty
15:08 conclusive or pretty convincing or
15:11 something like that and I was like yeah
15:13 right you know I'm not trying to
15:14 persuade you either way it's just that's
15:16 what it is right but now imagine I
15:19 always talk about this fictitious deep
15:23 thoughts university that I would love to
15:26 create right and it has official science
15:29 with a capital S being scrutinized in
15:31 one side of the campus very quickly we
15:35 would announce that the Big Bang didn't
15:37 happen that Dark Matter doesn't exist
15:38 and black holes probably don't exist
15:40 either
15:41 and we'd reintroduce ether and get
15:44 everyone back on the right track right
15:47 but over on the other side of the campus
15:49 we are going to definitely be looking at
15:51 the more existential things
15:55 we look at the law of attraction we look
15:57 at whether or not there's a soul and
15:59 we'd probably have on that other side
16:02 Flat Earth research we'd funnel billions
16:06 of dollars into this university and we
16:08 would pay for expeditions to prove
16:11 things one way or the other now imagine
16:14 I mean we're talking paranormal psychic
16:16 psyche capabilities telekinesis would be
16:18 researched trying to see ghosts would be
16:20 researched and it would be researched
16:22 not only with folks with massive
16:24 education in this but also just normal
16:26 people with great experiences all coming
16:30 together to take it seriously and the
16:33 admission board would not necessarily be
16:37 looking at your grades to see if you can
16:39 get into this thing they'd have you give
16:40 a some sort of dissertation about what
16:44 you're interested in doing just speak to
16:46 us if you're better writing it down
16:48 write it down on a piece of paper give
16:50 us a book report and then we would
16:53 decide whether or not you know you wrote
16:55 it yourself or he took stole someone
16:57 else's materials but once you have the
16:59 just the open-mindedness to get into
17:03 school you could get in the school but
17:05 one of the other things would be to have
17:09 once you're on the campus and you know
17:13 I've been very flippant about how stupid
17:15 certain theories are that you know for
17:17 me the Big Bang is just dumb as hell and
17:19 da da da da but on the campus we'd have
17:22 to draw out our emotions our
17:25 subjectiveness and keep an open mind for
17:29 pretty much anything but we would be
17:31 trying to come to a sort of a conclusion
17:35 of what rings true with the research
17:39 that we have you know what physical but
17:41 theories can survive a physical model
17:44 theory we'd pay for software to be
17:46 written to have maybe some off-the-shelf
17:48 stuff like Mathematica we do engineering
17:51 software and completely simulate NASA's
17:53 claim of going to the moon we'd find out
17:56 there's so many unknown variables going
17:57 to the moon we probably couldn't
17:58 actually complete the mission but we try
18:02 but now here's the one thing that would
18:04 keep you out of the college you go in
18:07 there and you're like I want to be a
18:09 a Flat Earth researcher and they said
18:12 great we have a whole division X number
18:14 of people X number of millions of
18:16 dollars if not tens of millions of hours
18:17 plus we have an expedition that will be
18:20 leaving in 8 months and get on that
18:22 project depending on your background
18:24 let's say you're an air conditioning
18:26 heating guy but you're a flat earther
18:28 well we need those resources to complete
18:29 our mission in the South Pole
18:31 awesome yeah if you come in and you say
18:37 those [ __ ] globe errs [ __ ] those
18:40 [ __ ] and blah blah blah blah
18:42 and everyone over there stupid being
18:46 explicit for a reason you wouldn't get
18:49 let in the campus because you got anger
18:51 management issues against an opposing
18:54 theory even if you're right you don't
18:57 want the right frame of mind to be in a
18:59 research project you don't have the
19:01 right frame of mind to touch the globe
19:03 wall or the dome wall excuse me wouldn't
19:08 that suck and if you came in and you're
19:12 a globe and you're like look well you
19:14 know here's the thing I understand that
19:16 people have looked at all these
19:19 different experiments and there's some
19:21 really clever ones out there and they're
19:23 probably not trying to deceive anything
19:25 they're just trying to get to the bottom
19:26 of the shape of the earth we're going to
19:30 pay for a launch of a rocket it's only
19:37 gonna have our equipment on it not even
19:39 a human being and we're gonna push it 80
19:44 200 miles in the sky and we're gonna see
19:47 if this thing's a disc with upturned
19:49 edges or if this thing is a ball
19:52 floating in space and if we can do it if
19:54 it's possible we're gonna send it into
19:58 high orbit and we're going to test the
20:00 Van Allen belts if it's possible we'll
20:03 try to send the rocket completely out of
20:04 orbit and take a picture looking back
20:06 and if it's possible we'll go to the
20:10 moon and land a rover you see how that
20:12 goes it's nice it's exciting I mean if
20:18 you listen to science with a capital S
20:19 you should be bored to death well we've
20:22 been to the moon
20:23 we've been to Mars we've been to Jupiter
20:24 we've been to the movie flown by Saturn
20:28 we've even flown by Pluto which has
20:29 Pluto's face on it we've landed on Titan
20:34 unbelievable what we've done boy we've
20:36 landed on Venus I mean it's like Jesus I
20:41 think you know you know as far as things
20:44 that NASA hasn't done is I think found
20:46 Superman's lair up in the North Pole and
20:49 santa claus living around the corner
20:52 I think the tooth fairy's on their staff
20:54 right it's unbelievable so I want us to
21:02 get along a hell of a lot better just
21:03 like Rodney King said you know I don't
21:05 understand the rage man now here's some
21:10 things that I think that kind of enter
21:11 the rage realm but it's not us yelling
21:15 at each other and I can't say I've ever
21:18 seen this particular secondary topic
21:20 turn into any rage between us at all
21:23 however in the comments maybe it's
21:25 happened but I've never seen it and that
21:29 is the politicians that have infiltrated
21:30 the United States of America on behalf
21:32 of Europe on behalf of agenda 21 to
21:37 destroy America to destroy the
21:40 Constitution we now have Hillary Clinton
21:44 on camera you know calling the
21:47 Constitution some washed-up old rag that
21:50 was written in the 1800s or sorry the
21:53 18th century 1700 train Wow and this
21:58 person has the audacity to run for
22:00 president hey it looks like you're a
22:03 member of a different country and you
22:05 need to find that South American country
22:07 with all the dictators right isn't it
22:09 funny
22:10 yeah I think it was hilarious they keep
22:12 calling Trump the dictator dad I guess a
22:14 lot of dictator friends it's like no he
22:15 knows he's got to talk to everybody in
22:17 the world if he's gonna know what the
22:18 hell's going on if you want some of this
22:20 chaos to stop he has to have a
22:22 relationship with Kim Jong hoon
22:24 he does but the people that are saying
22:27 that he's like a big dictator lover are
22:29 the closest things we have to dictators
22:33 but they're dictation is a little bit
22:35 different
22:36 instead of having Lord Rothschild do it
22:39 or the Queen of England do it or some
22:42 other banker somewhere but they're
22:45 trying to do is install a totalitarian
22:49 globalism on top of humanity that will
22:53 run the entire world which will
22:55 eventually most likely turn into an
22:56 artificial intelligence that will run
22:59 the whole world mankind will not make
23:01 any more decisions for mankind you'll
23:03 have to ask for permission to walk down
23:06 the street you'll have to ask for
23:08 permission to have a child and most
23:09 likely have to ask permission to get a
23:10 partner and have sex and there's
23:12 probably death penalties around every
23:15 single corner if you happen to violate
23:17 those rules and in terms of 99.9 percent
23:21 of the world's population it's all going
23:23 to be erased as soon as they get control
23:25 you'd think that's crazy then you know
23:27 fuck-all about a gym 221 and you need to
23:30 get updated SuperDuper fast I live in a
23:34 state where the agenda21 Democrats are
23:37 trying to destroy everything that was
23:40 wonderful about California it has taken
23:44 nearly 20 years for everyone to figure
23:47 out how California is being attacked
23:50 because I got here when it was a red
23:52 state and it was the dreamy California
23:56 man I mean it was everything that
23:58 everyone had ever rumored California to
24:02 be and sure you know there's always that
24:03 little devil worshipping sex somewhere
24:05 the porn thing in Simi Valley at the
24:07 time where people are hooked on drugs
24:09 and being extorted for sex for drugs
24:11 yeah there's always some shitty little
24:13 part of everything but for the most part
24:16 I came here and the the single income
24:21 household still existed where I lived
24:23 was awesome but everything that could
24:27 happen was happening women were getting
24:29 jobs a lot earlier men were successful I
24:33 didn't see any of this ass grab and
24:35 stuff that's you know the me to thing
24:37 I'm sure it happened but I was very
24:39 fortunate to work for a company with the
24:41 female CEO my first two companies I
24:45 worked for had female CEOs just
24:47 back-to-back only when I got in the
24:49 video game business
24:50 or my first year and a half was there a
24:54 all guy company but then again back in
24:57 the day women didn't do need that stuff
24:59 where now they they do great work you
25:01 know it's like the amount of female
25:03 artists and game designers and
25:04 programmers there they're amassing it's
25:07 really cool but they're trying to drive
25:09 up taxes as fast as they possibly can
25:12 they're running down all of our cities
25:13 Los Angeles in San Francisco they're
25:16 trying to destroy that they make opening
25:19 an LLC Secor Perez Corp in California
25:22 extremely expensive the penalties for
25:26 everything are super high your property
25:28 tax is super your sales tax is
25:30 relatively high they're trying to
25:33 destroy this state and now people are
25:35 starting to be able to have the
25:37 conversation don't you remember what it
25:39 was like 20 years ago
25:40 you have [ __ ] weird right 30 years
25:42 ago I guess it's taken 30 years I'm
25:44 sorry yeah this would be pretty much the
25:46 the nineties when they lost out get some
25:50 blue in here
25:51 good old Jerry Brown the guy's been on
25:54 you know was the governor off and on
25:55 forever but the state voted blue for a
25:59 price red for a president you know if
26:02 they divide us they get to pick us off
26:04 just imagine you know the old pie chart
26:07 thing right you got a sweet you're so
26:09 you're a circle and that's the majority
26:11 of all of us a little tiny dot
26:14 infinitesimal dot is the folks that are
26:16 in control because we allow them to be
26:18 in control which we need to change that
26:20 in a really big way term limits for
26:24 House and Senate representatives give
26:26 you the equivalent of eight years so you
26:30 can get you know as a senator you get
26:32 four instead of six house the House
26:35 Representative you get two and you can
26:36 have four re-elections then c'est la vie
26:38 we'll see you later men and you can't be
26:42 a lobbyist by law one of the first
26:46 things Trump put in place it's a
26:48 beautiful thing but so you know I'm
26:52 thinking about how did this get so
26:54 acidic you know and there's a listener
26:58 of the show Jed from Scotland Glasgow
27:03 and he is a very eccentric Channel he he
27:07 and I met through my old show in Kilcher
27:09 radio and I think Jed was on it really
27:13 fast I'm not sure I'm gonna connect dots
27:16 I think that he connected for me whether
27:18 or not he connected them he probably
27:19 connected them way harder than I did but
27:21 he started watching you know the Flat
27:24 Earth thing and I'm pretty sure he's
27:26 globe earth but he started watching how
27:30 the organizations that represented Flat
27:32 Earth went completely bonkers and it
27:38 hurt him because it was like it it just
27:41 showed that they had basically
27:43 infiltrated that movement I mean you he
27:48 did videos on a couple guys that well
27:50 you did one on a group where they would
27:52 do like these live chats for like I
27:54 don't know four or five hours if not
27:56 more and they talked about how they were
27:58 drinking their urine and in case you
28:01 like doing that you just do that I'm not
28:02 criticizing but you know what the [ __ ]
28:04 does have to do with flutter nothing
28:06 right one guy would who's got like
28:09 tattoos all over his body with all this
28:11 Illuminati symbolism and I mean wow you
28:15 know it's like you can do Saint mystic
28:18 stuff all over your body you could do
28:19 Illuminati stuff all over your body same
28:21 [ __ ] okay and this guy was trying to
28:26 talk like he wasn't a part of all this
28:28 like he it's almost like me tattooing
28:30 myself with Saint mystic crap and then
28:32 being against the Church of Satan on a
28:35 video like what I mean black all that
28:38 crap out redo all your tattoos get them
28:40 all removed whatever you got to do or at
28:42 least every single show come out and say
28:43 okay guys here's the thing I used to be
28:46 in saying this and now I have all
28:47 tattoos on my body it was a dumb thing I
28:49 did but blah blah blah blah right do
28:53 full disclosure disclaimer but that guy
28:55 didn't do that and so all these internet
28:58 fights started occurring I have I don't
29:01 think I've ever been implicated in
29:03 anyone's videos in a negative way I
29:06 suspect that that would happen or has
29:09 happened I just haven't seen the video
29:11 but I would never get involved in some
29:13 pissing match with somebody online I
29:15 don't give
29:16 they hate everything I ever do I don't
29:18 care if I make a video and they make a
29:20 counter video I don't care
29:22 knock yourself out man you have the
29:25 right to your opinion and you know what
29:27 I'm open-minded enough that maybe maybe
29:30 you're right I'm not gonna waste any of
29:31 my life looking at those videos but you
29:34 know if somebody said oh this one
29:36 sentence that 10 minutes in
29:38 seems legit seems like you were wrong
29:39 yeah Mike I might click over and Link in
29:42 and look at it and give it my objective
29:44 analysis and and then agree or disagree
29:49 I don't know but we know for a fact okay
29:53 that the the groups that initially came
29:56 out in 2014 were really pure at the
30:01 beginning you're Eric do Bayes and then
30:05 it got weird and so a lot of people see
30:09 that as okay there's a bunch of shilly
30:10 organizations out there trying to attach
30:15 crazy to flutter so it never goes
30:17 anywhere when what's so strange is and
30:20 it's like you know the again like my
30:27 sympathy and empathy for the flat earth
30:32 movement as a whole is a couple fold the
30:37 first one is I see a bunch of people
30:40 with an open mind especially the ones
30:41 that don't criticize I have more and kin
30:45 in in common with them and just going
30:47 that's cool man you keep going because I
30:50 want you to go to the South Pole with
30:53 some jets some g6 jet and get permission
30:59 just to fly over it maybe you go down
31:01 and you join some volunteer project
31:04 again I got a friend of mine and she
31:05 spent several weeks down there and she's
31:07 like dude it's a continent man but when
31:10 I said did you ever fly over it no no I
31:12 didn't fly over but you know they bring
31:14 in supplies from all different sides of
31:17 the continent and they can drive him
31:18 around and get them to each other and if
31:20 it was this big outer you know ice
31:22 barrier then that would be technically
31:24 impossible these vehicles are run on a
31:26 fuel the planes couldn't get from one
31:28 Airport
31:29 to the other with huh you know flying
31:31 along the edge and you'd have to have a
31:33 lot of refueling going on so she's
31:35 pretty convinced cuz she went down there
31:37 I was referred to a guy that said that
31:40 he and his wife went down there he was a
31:42 scientist and she's a scientist two of
31:45 my other friend but he said he went down
31:49 there and most definitely he actually I
31:50 don't even know if he knew think about
31:52 the flutters but the first question I
31:53 asked him was did you ever fly over the
31:55 continent no you're not allowed to do
31:58 that or whatever now I don't know if
32:00 planes have issues flying over that I
32:03 don't know seems like the air is super
32:06 cold straight up above me right way up
32:09 there it's cold but I don't know so the
32:14 other big bummer about this for me is
32:18 that okay so you have two camps fly
32:21 earth over here and globe of over here
32:24 okay
32:25 nothing changes the fact of the Flat
32:27 Earth clock application has reconciled
32:30 the placement of the Sun the placement
32:31 of the moon and overall hasn't had any
32:36 problems predicting what flights are
32:37 impossible and flights are possible in
32:39 the past that they might take it when
32:41 taken from the flat model and stretched
32:43 out over the globe it's the exact same
32:45 pass because they're straight lines on
32:47 the disk and they're round arches on the
32:50 surface of a globe alright alright but
32:53 over here on the globe side you're proof
32:57 of being in a ball is all conjecture and
33:03 lies from space organizations okay and
33:07 that's bona fide man that's certified
33:09 you have been utterly lied to you're so
33:13 sure what's on the inside of the earth
33:15 well you can't it's not nickel-iron it
33:17 can't be it doesn't survive chemistry
33:20 okay
33:21 a big [ __ ] lie there you think that
33:24 went to the moon let's just say doesn't
33:26 mean you have to believe wins a moon
33:29 well we can't we haven't that's why all
33:33 the Rovers are over on Mars and not on
33:35 the moon looking at our old kickstands
33:37 from the Apollo yeah you know lunar
33:39 landers they they're not there that's
33:42 why they can't be there
33:43 and they could even if they could try to
33:44 fake it in CG but how you gonna account
33:47 for the fact that they reuse two sets in
33:50 two different missions how you gonna
33:51 count for the fact that the blue marble
33:52 shot brought back from Apollo 17 has
33:55 they completely screwed up red see and
33:58 then it was fixed randomly on time and
34:01 reissued and I got the picture before
34:03 and after which I'll show on this video
34:05 so one group has a bunch of lies that
34:09 have been handed to them by the space
34:12 organizations and the other group is
34:13 just constructing things and they're
34:15 getting some things right and getting
34:16 some things wrong so they're trying but
34:21 in terms of the foundation of either one
34:24 of these organizations hey I think it's
34:27 a ball
34:27 I think it's expanding earth I think
34:29 it's you throw winds and blah blah blah
34:30 plasma core and all that stuff okay
34:32 great I don't need any of NASA's crap to
34:36 have my belief system because you know
34:40 the ball thing for me is that all the
34:41 continents connect on all sides and
34:43 people have said you know well don't you
34:44 think that could happen on the Flat
34:46 Earth and I'm like I'm waiting I'm
34:48 waiting do it explain it to me why how
34:51 could that possibly work on a disc the
34:54 disc is so utterly massive that it makes
34:58 no sense unless the disc is growing in
35:00 size but does it really all come
35:03 together on all sides if you just crush
35:05 the disc down I don't think so because
35:06 the outer edge that they have the
35:08 continents that would touch the outer
35:10 edge of the ice or the disk well and the
35:14 expanding earth model connects on all
35:16 sides what are the odds what are the
35:18 odds come on but okay and here's the
35:21 other one
35:22 Glover's do you believe that aliens
35:27 exist and do you believe aliens have
35:30 ever come to earth and do you think
35:35 Roswell ever happened do you think that
35:37 all this recent footage that's being
35:39 disclosed from all the different
35:40 military organizations are real alright
35:44 let's say you answered yes and I'm with
35:47 you on some of that stuff well think
35:50 about how much actual proof you have
35:52 that any of this stuff is real now if
35:55 you do your research on the Roswell can
35:56 sessions of all these people that knew
35:58 everyone in Roswell that were murdered
36:00 as well as the old man that recovered or
36:07 at least met the alien and then his
36:09 interview way way after the fact like 40
36:11 years after the fact you know you just
36:13 got listen to all these folks they'll
36:15 tell you that these people change their
36:17 stories and if you watch every single
36:18 interview can get your hands on you'll
36:20 realize they never change your stories
36:22 they were completely right so you've
36:23 been lied to by those people okay but we
36:28 believe in things without having proof
36:31 sometimes so why is it that a globe
36:33 person can believe in something without
36:35 a bunch of evidence that's in your hate
36:37 angel' hands right but your flat
36:40 earthers are not allowed to believe in
36:41 anything and there they are shooting
36:43 lasers across you know frozen lakes in
36:45 Russia that are like four hundred miles
36:47 long you're able to see things you know
36:49 there is refraction in the atmosphere of
36:51 course which might account for being
36:53 able to see certain things
36:54 check out the Statue of Liberty that's
36:56 viewable 460 miles away you know things
36:59 there should be 2,000 feet over the edge
37:01 of the earth you can still see it maybe
37:03 there's a little bit of refraction but
37:04 we know the refraction of the atmosphere
37:08 it's measurable that's a given fact the
37:12 kid that does the really cool experiment
37:13 where he shows the Sun setting on a
37:15 tabletop just through a lens it's a
37:19 tabletop he has the Sun on a little
37:21 l-shaped piece of paper and he's got the
37:22 lens with the exact same refraction of
37:24 the atmosphere and he pulls it back and
37:26 the Sun gets smaller and smaller and
37:27 then actually starting that in the
37:29 refraction which is a water refraction
37:31 off the ocean it actually expands and
37:33 sets just like it does on the ocean all
37:36 right now maybe that's a coincidence to
37:39 reality maybe not but it's right there
37:42 in front of your face can't you have an
37:44 open mind to allow these people to have
37:46 that thought can you explain to me how
37:50 the moon of which Plato supposedly wrote
37:54 or at least read texts the you know the
37:57 time before the moon like it didn't
37:58 exist and all of a sudden existed well
38:01 how does the moon perfectly eclipse the
38:04 Sun tell me that this random thing out
38:07 there in space which doesn't have any
38:09 geographical center
38:10 lady with earth right supposedly it's
38:13 this rock that hit the earth and he blew
38:15 up the earth and the earth spit off some
38:16 [ __ ] I mean they just made a [ __ ]
38:18 theory drew a funny picture they've done
38:20 several animations of it now people are
38:23 swallowing this I saw their simulation
38:26 he showed me and they got took a took a
38:28 picture when it happened you know it's
38:29 like dude it ain't real they just sold
38:32 you a picture right but this thing is
38:36 like white as a ghost up there
38:38 there's scientists that say look if that
38:41 thing had the refraction that it's
38:42 supposed to it would light up the earth
38:46 just like daytime if it was up there
38:49 basically saying if you never see the
38:51 moon at night the earth would be lit on
38:53 that side some people say it's a plasma
38:56 ball and you can't land on it
38:58 interesting some people say it's an old
39:00 Sun well we know all the craters can't
39:03 be all craters because they're all
39:04 perfectly round and ething just randomly
39:06 hitting the surface of a ball flying in
39:09 space would have a bunch of elliptical
39:11 shapes you'd have some round ones too
39:13 but most of them would probably be less
39:15 than round like way less than round but
39:18 this ball perfectly eclipses during a
39:21 solar eclipse if you're staying in that
39:23 one place and which i think is once
39:25 every 27 years you can look up and see
39:27 one wherever you are on the earth this
39:29 is 93 million mile away gigantic furnace
39:32 and space is somehow perfectly close by
39:35 this random ball that's in elliptical
39:37 orbit it's in an elliptical orbit they
39:39 tell us okay it's elliptical well then
39:43 sometimes it should completely blot out
39:46 the Sun to the point there's no Ring of
39:47 Fire
39:48 and it should totally undercut the Sun
39:52 and there would be a ring the entire
39:53 time it wouldn't completely eclipse the
39:56 Sun because it's too far away but it
40:00 does the same thing every single time
40:04 the other thing is that do we always see
40:07 the same side of the Moon it's in this
40:10 locked orbit around us we're told that
40:12 crap when we're kids were like yeah yeah
40:13 yeah that's awesome but okay so man has
40:16 been here for quite a while you realize
40:19 if the moon had an infinitesimal
40:22 rotational
40:24 difference and its speed to lock to
40:25 earth we would start seeing in our
40:29 lifetime over a couple thousand years a
40:32 different region of the moon would start
40:35 showing itself every time at full moon
40:37 did be just a pixel or so on the side to
40:39 be unique hmm there's mystery mysteries
40:44 everywhere but if we're gonna have you
40:48 know [ __ ] fits and you know basically
40:51 it's like walking in a room and going
40:53 you can think that well I can't I think
40:55 that well because that makes me angry
40:57 well why does it make you angry because
40:59 I believe something different oh wow so
41:02 that's the president's precedents we
41:04 want to set in the world okay so you
41:06 believe that Allah is God you believe
41:10 Jesus is God this said the dude believes
41:11 that Buddha is God you know and it's
41:13 just like some of the do things that
41:15 their God what do we fight it out until
41:19 you know whoever was a bigger guy gets
41:23 to decide what everyone else believes
41:24 and then whoever's left who's like
41:27 cowering down because like man will kill
41:28 me man
41:29 they have to believe what you believe is
41:32 that the world you want to live in sure
41:35 as [ __ ] isn't the one I want to live in
41:37 it's like I'll put you this way
41:42 definitely thinking about it if you've
41:45 ever wanted to be like a cool human
41:48 right sorta I don't know any definition
41:51 you might have that you want to be cool
41:54 relaxed right alright doesn't mean
41:57 there's not something that could piss
41:58 you off someone's betraying you so much
42:01 betrayed a friend someone's hurting
42:02 someone yeah you know I can just be
42:04 totally cool in every situation even
42:07 Clint Eastwood got a little pissed off
42:10 and Unforgiven right you just shot an
42:13 unarmed man you should decorate his
42:16 place with my best friend
42:18 god damn was a good line or decorate
42:22 them with my friend well being really
42:26 angry about Flat Earth that didn't seem
42:29 very cool to me you know being really
42:31 angry at Globus the other way because
42:33 you gotta have it on both sides right it
42:36 doesn't seem very cool to me
42:37 now you can speak your opinion and be
42:41 firm about your opinion say I just think
42:43 it's [ __ ] oh you're not getting
42:45 angry you're just basically saying I
42:47 think the Big Bang is a bunch of
42:49 [ __ ] they told me my whole life
42:51 when I got into cosmology super-deep as
42:53 a kid physics breaks down before the Big
42:56 Bang occurs but they always told you
42:59 well we're figuring it out which means
43:00 we're making it up
43:03 well it's 35 40 years later and that
43:07 physics problem has never been solved
43:11 all right you know why because people
43:15 are willing to believe things if they
43:18 can usurp that moment and usurp that
43:20 claim to feel intelligent now I'm in a
43:25 very distinct position in my life to be
43:28 very excited about Flat Earth and for
43:30 those of you who are different ages I
43:32 would say that the I don't know what the
43:35 cutoff is I think it has to do with your
43:36 life experience but when you've lived a
43:40 lot of life like I have least for my
43:43 money I've lived a lot of life had a lot
43:45 of careers there's been some places it's
43:47 really I'm good the idea that someone
43:51 especially from this show as far as the
43:55 listeners which I call you like many
43:57 scientists right if you were able to I
44:01 don't know you get a rich uncle and you
44:03 just haven't brought up Flat Earth to
44:05 your uncle and or you inherit a bunch of
44:07 money and you actually have diplomatic
44:09 relations and you can get into that
44:12 little treaty down there that they
44:14 signed in what 1954 to get all the
44:16 countries to say no one's allowed at the
44:18 South Pole unless you get permission
44:20 somehow you can break through all that
44:22 red tape and you're gonna fly maybe an
44:26 unmanned drone over the South Pole to
44:31 come out the other side you put two
44:33 people where you think that you know
44:35 you're gonna send it this way it's gonna
44:36 come out over here and you go off and do
44:39 it and it crashes into the dome wall
44:41 just like the scientist that the the
44:44 Encyclopedia Britannica said
44:47 in 1858 or something like that all right
44:51 that thing crashes live on the internet
44:55 streaming wouldn't that be just an
45:00 awesome boost to your life you know
45:03 maybe if you're in your teens in your
45:04 20s and you kind of want the world to
45:06 hold together as a society cuz you got
45:08 some dreams and you can see how you're
45:09 gonna do it you know all the little
45:11 steps and if they prove the world is
45:13 flat and gods on the other side is gonna
45:15 make things a little strange or there's
45:16 aliens somewhere or the dome owners come
45:19 racing in to reset the planet and flood
45:21 the whole joint maybe you're not looking
45:23 forward to that but at my age with my
45:27 experience it seems awesome
45:30 it seems so so awesome to have someone
45:33 prove this thing is a flat disk in space
45:36 this is some sort of matrix this is some
45:39 sort of contact lens that we're living
45:41 inside of I don't know about you but
45:44 that seems so awesome so exciting think
45:49 about the frontier of science think
45:51 about think about any one of you that
45:54 believes it's a globe and you don't
45:56 think we went to the moon
45:57 all right how you gonna ever get NASA to
45:59 tell the truth Donald Trump walks up and
46:01 talks about how we went to the moon
46:03 complete [ __ ] you know why the guy
46:06 does it baby's calling their bluff by
46:08 supporting him he did he did send a
46:11 tweet out when Nancy Pelosi you remained
46:14 the House Majority Leader he sent her
46:16 tweet you know a tweet out saying I'm so
46:18 glad that Enzi Pelosi got that now she's
46:20 just continued to be a a thorn in his
46:26 side right here comes a helicopter so
46:32 maybe it's the same thing he's just
46:33 telling NASA hey you know let's go to
46:35 the moon and that's why they denounced
46:36 the 2024 mission and you know he's gonna
46:39 call their bluff he's saying oh yeah you
46:41 went to the moon all right let's do it
46:42 I'm right here show me I think you're
46:44 lying but I'll support you until you
46:46 fail but now imagine this the
46:49 flat-earthers prove it I don't know how
46:51 they do it but they prove it 100%
46:54 so ii the drone hits the dome wall nasa
46:58 is punched their ticket is punched the
47:03 whole world knows that everybody lied
47:05 now maybe you can go up in orbit and you
47:08 end up doing the circle that the moon
47:09 and the the Sun is doing right how
47:13 awesome is that I mean you wouldn't want
47:16 that to happen I think that for me it's
47:18 like this to the degree that I want a
47:22 flying saucer to land in a baseball
47:25 field and Washington DC just like the
47:29 Day the Earth Stood Still 1951 I want
47:33 someone to prove this place is a dome
47:36 because my own mind would just blow
47:39 right I'm convinced it's a ball
47:42 the moon is a ball the Sun is a ball all
47:45 those planets are balls even the weird
47:47 starry things that Dave keeps recording
47:50 which is our one of our moderators he
47:53 hits it with this super zoom 1000 X zoom
47:55 camera it looks like plasma land on a on
47:57 a some type of sphere bubbles in water
48:01 all that good stuff doesn't matter
48:03 doesn't matter that that happens doesn't
48:06 matter what you see doesn't matter that
48:07 eclipses and lunar eclipses and solar
48:09 eclipses are all round doesn't matter
48:10 there was the dome there's the mark
48:13 right there with the drum left some of
48:15 its debris stuck to the wall right there
48:17 and we're right here now we're at the
48:19 dome wall we've driven a bunch of
48:21 vehicles directly to the dome wall and
48:24 people are like writing their name on
48:26 the wall with their fingers right it's
48:28 some you know Game of Thrones thing
48:30 isn't it funny the game of thrones tend
48:32 to tended to create the whole Flat Earth
48:34 model that big ice shield that's down
48:36 there right this is cool like how can
48:39 you not get excited about the notion and
48:41 then how can you not fuel your buddy who
48:46 believes completely opposite of what you
48:48 fuel right you're into space travel you
48:52 know standard straight-up SpaceX is all
48:54 ajith it rings great and we're just got
48:56 a space station up there and all that
48:58 footage that's got wires and blue screen
49:01 and and augmented reality crap that
49:04 we've proven
49:05 the guy flying with the harness behind
49:08 the two astronauts are doing the
49:09 interview I mean straight up Hollywood
49:11 harness I showed this to so many of my
49:13 special-effects buddies and they were
49:14 just like we use those we use those on
49:17 set what the [ __ ] is it doing in the ISS
49:19 and I'm like I don't know you tell me
49:20 and they're just like oh my god this is
49:23 all a lie you show experts men and they
49:26 know more about it than you do and they
49:28 give it up I mean they give up believing
49:31 on it in it and some of these kids are
49:33 like worse than me they were mega uber
49:36 science geeks when they were kids I mean
49:38 I was a pretty damn good science geek
49:39 but they they just had their hearts
49:41 broken all right I don't know how you
49:45 couldn't be excited and it'd be one of
49:47 two things right let's say you're a
49:49 pissed off globe er all right art okay
49:52 so if you're pissed off globe airs a
49:53 couple things you'd probably want to
49:55 have change in the world one you never
49:57 want to hear a flat earther talk again
49:59 about what earth so you are gonna have
50:02 to go your space agencies and say look
50:05 NASA stop faking pictures of Earth from
50:09 space would you we need a legitimate
50:11 shot of Earth from space not your space
50:14 station with all the fish Islands crap
50:16 and all your bubbles flying around and
50:18 et cetera et cetera by the way there's
50:21 there's a new piece of software that was
50:23 advertised on one of the news networks
50:26 it was an AP Reuters article I think new
50:30 software removes water from underground
50:33 shots and they show this coral reef at
50:37 the bottom of the ocean with obviously
50:39 all the distortion of water and the blue
50:41 and then they showed a half half and a
50:44 half of the software being run and I'm
50:46 telling you it looked like it was just
50:47 sitting in a field Wow
50:50 where do you think that software got
50:53 developed and why would it have been
50:54 developed of course there's you know
50:55 plenty of do you see researchers that
50:57 could use it but if you're filming the
50:59 ISS exterior spacewalks and water that
51:03 piece of software would be awesome
51:05 wouldn't it it would remove all
51:06 distortion and make it look like it was
51:08 in where outer space except there's no
51:11 stars
51:11 there's no Milky Way the immutable Milky
51:14 Way the so damn brad is ridiculous it's
51:16 bright when you're in the middle of Lake
51:18 Havasu
51:18 or in the middle of a field somewhere
51:20 with no light pollution it's just too
51:23 mixed metaphor is deafeningly bright
51:25 right and now you're in space with no
51:27 atmosphere distortion no light
51:29 distortion or no light interference of
51:31 any kind and you're not seeing anything
51:33 give me a break
51:34 give me a break so helping your friend
51:38 get to the end of his fighter of the
51:40 journey by supporting your friend is
51:44 what you want to do by a gyroscope I
51:47 keep telling you guys this right by a
51:49 gyroscope from some salvage yard of
51:53 planes like go to a salvage yard in your
51:55 local area do a gofundme I'm sure you
51:57 can make the money in two seconds let's
51:59 say it cost 50 grand I bet you've raised
52:01 a hundred you say look I need to I need
52:03 to let's say let's say if it's in the
52:06 it's inside some dashboard or some old
52:08 Cessna plane it's 30 40 years old but
52:11 fully functional you find a good one
52:13 right you call it a salvage yard you say
52:14 do you have a functional gyroscope yeah
52:17 all right so what do you want for it
52:19 five grand all right great now you're
52:21 gonna have to take it somewhere to make
52:23 sure that it's functional and then you
52:25 go buy a ticket on a plane or you
52:28 charter a plane because you don't have
52:30 some [ __ ] you know
52:33 tsa telling you can't take it on playing
52:35 is a climb or someone on the head with
52:36 it or whatever but you just tell me it's
52:38 a scientific experiment the whole
52:40 internet is watching chart charter
52:42 yourself a private plane I want you to
52:45 just do this flight there we have a
52:47 couple people in Canada we're hot on
52:49 Flat Earth and one of them is trying to
52:51 pull this off I'll make sure their name
52:54 was for now but let's fund them they get
52:58 it they get it engineered by some
53:00 scientists locally to make sure it's
53:02 powered up and running and it should
53:04 spin directly perpendicular to the earth
53:07 in say Ontario then you buy a flight to
53:11 the southern tip of Florida now we don't
53:14 have to go to South America and go
53:15 through other issues but if you could go
53:16 to Mexico City be awesome right and all
53:19 you're gonna do is land you maybe get
53:21 off and do some lunch in the terminal
53:24 get back on the return flight come back
53:26 but here's your flat earth proof it's
53:29 perpendicular to Ontario if it's a flat
53:33 earth and equal all the way to Mexico
53:34 City it still should be flat
53:36 perpendicular to your lap but if it's a
53:39 round ball it should rotate quite a bit
53:43 probably over 45 degrees take a picture
53:47 of the whole way and you'll know you're
53:48 on a ball or you're on a flat disc all
53:52 right it would be over now we'd have to
53:56 then if let's say we prove it's a ball
53:59 then we'd have to explain all the other
54:01 anomalies we're seeing things far away
54:04 still showing up in cameras you know sea
54:06 level right pylons on bridges that
54:09 should be hundreds if not thousands of
54:11 feet below the horizon on the other side
54:15 well maybe we have refraction wrong who
54:18 knows but at least we can make some
54:20 progress get to the bottom of it
54:22 but now here's the thing Glover's what
54:25 if this dude lands in Mexico City and
54:27 that thing is straight as an arrow
54:29 perpendicular to the ground now it's a
54:33 disc not what you're gonna do
54:36 even I sitting here with my expanding
54:41 Earth theory would have to essentially
54:45 say okay if it is flat then someone has
54:52 worked extremely hard to make it appear
54:57 as if we're on a globe it still negates
55:00 everything that NASA's lied about and
55:03 even if I can't explain it what I would
55:06 probably do to be honest with you does I
55:08 would adopt the theory that's very
55:10 simple I would simply say that whoever
55:13 made this place was trying to give us
55:16 the illusion there were some
55:19 insignificant ball in space probably not
55:23 to make us feel insignificant as beings
55:26 but to make us focus on ourselves as
55:28 opposed to worshipping some Supreme
55:31 Being and losing everything that is the
55:35 human condition that makes reasonable
55:38 sense to me
55:39 and you know what I would probably be
55:43 floating on cloud nine for months and
55:45 months and months if not the rest of my
55:46 life that it is a very designed location
55:53 regardless of who made it you know my
55:56 hope would be yeah I had to be careful
56:00 what I say here because I don't know if
56:02 I want to get everything I'm asking for
56:04 at this point I would see this if
56:08 finding the dome wall in mass right the
56:13 whole world hears about this story it's
56:15 a sensation all over the internet and we
56:19 publish the recipe to buy a Jaa's
56:22 gyroscope to retrofit it to work in your
56:25 lap and we start talking about tickets
56:27 all over the place people in London fly
56:29 to Cairo you know someone in northern
56:33 Russia a flies to southern India or
56:37 whatever something from the tip of South
56:39 America flies to Mexico City as well we
56:42 teach everyone how to do it it is
56:43 absolutely confirmed that this is a flat
56:46 disc well maybe maybe disc still out
56:49 there but then we started getting the
56:51 extra funding to go to the wall to find
56:53 the the dollar stuff right okay if
56:57 finding out that it's a dome in mass
56:59 causes them to reset the interior of
57:02 this place then I probably don't want
57:06 that to occur right well little kids of
57:08 the world to grow up and have wonderful
57:10 life so I don't want some [ __ ] alien
57:12 coming near and [ __ ] everything up
57:13 now then there's the Morse the more
57:18 spiritual super celestial sort of end
57:21 game which is it's all been a test by
57:24 God for us to discern our reality and to
57:28 see if in Mass what happens when you get
57:31 your whole reality swapped out for a
57:33 different one right now what's funny
57:35 about it is is that up until five
57:38 hundred years ago roughly the whole
57:40 world thought it was flat and everybody
57:42 continued living no big deal but the big
57:45 deal today is that we now have
57:46 technology that we didn't have 500 years
57:49 ago to go to the wall and knock on a hey
57:51 is anybody there isn't
57:52 there so if aliens are friendly and
57:57 they're coming in and going okay you now
58:01 get to partake of our technology you now
58:06 get to learn about where you are just
58:09 like first contact in Star Trek you hit
58:11 warp and here comes the Vulcans right
58:13 all right I dig that idea but if God
58:18 comes down here and you know now he's
58:20 involved he's like look this was the
58:22 test and you have to but you can live
58:26 inside or not live inside and I take
58:30 that but knowing that God exists is a
58:33 like a really hi how you doing I'm
58:36 George Burns I'm actually God you know
58:38 if that would ever occur then man kind
58:43 loses free will just like every
58:47 sociological experiment on planet Earth
58:50 we no longer behave properly because we
58:52 are now observed and so there has to be
58:56 on their behalf either aliens or God I
58:59 trust God way more than aliens but
59:01 they'd have to have or he would have to
59:03 have a part two of our development do we
59:07 all just die and go into soul world does
59:10 Jesus walk in anybody what's up so I've
59:14 never heard it postulated ever and I'm
59:19 sure it has been a guess of people just
59:21 logical thinkers but the idea is that
59:25 what if the the people that know that
59:30 went down there in the 30s and perhaps
59:33 met the people that made the dome
59:35 they're not God they're you know doesn't
59:39 mean God doesn't exist it just means he
59:41 did you know he didn't personally make
59:43 this joint they meet the programmers
59:45 that make the matrix happen they meet
59:47 the aliens that built a place together
59:48 whatever we're doing here right let's
59:50 say it's a dome okay flat earth but they
59:54 had this all explained to them okay
59:57 here's a deal we're running the
59:59 experiment you know maybe the aliens are
60:02 just like us they're like like you're
60:03 part of us
60:05 but we really wanted to know because
60:07 we're millions of years old on our side
60:08 on the other side of this den were
60:10 millions of years old and you know the
60:14 truth of matter is we actually are on a
60:16 ball but you don't you've never seen the
60:19 ball on the outside so what we've done
60:21 is we have created a world inside this
60:24 petri dish this contact lens that
60:27 follows the general rules of a ball we
60:30 even made sure expanding earth which is
60:31 the way the real ball is on the outside
60:33 is the way you see your earth and so you
60:35 have double proof that's the way it
60:37 worked even though you suppress that
60:39 knowledge but here's the thing
60:41 if you expose this to all of your
60:46 occupants inside you blow the experiment
60:47 and you can't really integrate with us
60:52 because we're millions of years old in
60:54 terms of the science of everything that
60:56 we do you wouldn't even recognize a
60:58 dinner plate if we showed you one you
61:01 wouldn't be able to eat our food the
61:03 atmosphere that we breathe is a little
61:04 bit different than yours so the best you
61:06 could do is go live in another dome or
61:08 we could all have kind of a big kumbaya
61:10 press release moment where some of us
61:12 come down with a little space helmets on
61:14 just like Mars attack and you're not
61:19 allowed to play war Overson while we're
61:20 here but we we have a little discussion
61:25 a little powwow and it we just mess up
61:28 everything
61:29 so if you could we've already got it
61:30 worked out we've already had contingency
61:32 plans before we even built the place we
61:34 need you to sign a treaty with all the
61:36 world all the countries of the world and
61:38 make sure by the way there's been a lot
61:41 of new countries created since 54 so it
61:43 would be interesting to know if they all
61:44 sign on to the treaty once they get
61:46 created but we need you to protect this
61:49 it's for the good of man that you
61:51 continue to propagate this idea of a
61:54 globe and you know the the one thing
61:59 that kind of negates this this little
62:01 fantasy I'm putting together is that
62:03 let's say that they say okay well we're
62:05 gonna help you launch a space program
62:07 that's going to give the illusion and by
62:10 the way if you could launch any sort of
62:12 fictional shows on TV fictional movies
62:15 will provide you with whatever you need
62:18 monetarily you know what do you guys use
62:20 you guys using gold okay we'll give you
62:21 some gold it's real easy we'll get you
62:24 the money you know maybe these
62:25 billionaires are like don't worry about
62:26 it we got it all worked out but we're
62:29 not gonna give you you know syrup on
62:32 energy systems we're not going to give
62:34 you flying saucer technology you've
62:36 actually found some of our old vehicles
62:38 you see us every once in a while and we
62:40 come and visit you those grades well
62:43 they're just robots they're just robot
62:45 species we created they're organic but
62:47 you know they come and check out things
62:50 here and there but you just have to stay
62:53 inside just because that's where you
62:55 came from
62:56 you're indigenous to what we have
62:58 provided inside this contact lens you
63:00 cannot easily survive outside or maybe
63:03 maybe a bunch of you could but majority
63:05 of you can what are we supposed to do
63:07 with you know people were in the rain
63:09 forest they wouldn't even understand if
63:11 you told him the place was flat yeah of
63:13 course again we lived most of our life
63:15 on this planet thinking it was flat and
63:18 it was just God was above and it was
63:20 water and what have you maybe their
63:24 whole thing with the star is the stuff
63:25 that Dave is recording is a facsimile of
63:28 space but it doesn't exist for us as it
63:32 does for them because they're actually
63:33 the other side of this thing could you
63:36 imagine that I mean in all actuality
63:39 your Globus would be right in that there
63:43 is it we do live on a ball it's just
63:45 massive it's huge it has nothing to do
63:48 with the star that's floating the Sun is
63:50 floating or the moon is floating it's
63:52 just it's all outside and maybe you get
63:53 outside and so like it's very similar
63:55 but it's not the same but it's all been
63:57 built as a facsimile of the overall
64:00 universe that's on the other side of
64:02 this thing can you imagine that a bunch
64:04 of people that have passed who were
64:06 scientists or even amazing fictional
64:09 writers like Michael Crichton which for
64:12 some reason I had like a Mandela effect
64:14 with Michael Crichton where I I had read
64:17 where I thought I'd read that he died at
64:20 50 but he died at 66 once I finally
64:22 started realizing how old he would have
64:25 to be he to make all the stuff he did in
64:27 the early seventies he'd be like a
64:28 prodigy child
64:30 but what if these people are exiting out
64:31 the dome like a you know you can make it
64:34 come on out here you know just will
64:36 orchestrate your death there on earth
64:37 but you can come out and chill out and
64:39 your fans or your followers or whatever
64:41 your family be a little upset but come
64:43 on one of the things I put in my first
64:45 episode something I want to throw on you
64:47 guys as the possibility of a PSYOP now
64:51 I've got flatters psyops the whole
64:52 episode if you guys want to watch it if
64:55 you think about the KGB guy mmm boy
64:59 there's a lot of logic to them doing
65:01 this just to kind of divide us again
65:03 again divide up everyone who thinks his
65:05 fighters conquer that whichever one is
65:07 the weakest is always gonna be fighters
65:09 because popular science magazine tells
65:11 you it's a ball okay great but there's
65:14 this dude Picard
65:16 back in the early 30s who built a sphere
65:20 hot-air balloon I can't remember offhand
65:23 how high the guy went and I think it was
65:26 about 75,000 feet up but this dude went
65:33 up in this thing this is the story and
65:35 you can find it on Wikipedia you can
65:36 find photographs of the dude although it
65:38 looks like a Hollywood bang you can see
65:40 pictures of his ball and then and the
65:43 whole thing right and the story goes is
65:44 that he he went up in this thing there's
65:47 a liquor commercial from Canada that
65:49 does a beautiful CG version of this
65:51 thing I'd cut it in but it would get
65:53 copyright strike then I want to do that
65:55 but he goes up and the thing actually
65:59 spun quite a bit and then it I think it
66:01 finally calmed down but when he finally
66:03 got back down to earth one he went way
66:06 way up in the sky and he came down very
66:08 close to where he took off relatively
66:10 speaking to a spinning globe and he said
66:13 that the world was a disc with upturn
66:15 edges that's his classic phrase and
66:17 that's why a lot of flowers go look this
66:19 dude went up and that's what he said now
66:22 I want to throw this on you here it is
66:25 absolutely positively possible that that
66:28 dudes entire existence unless you have a
66:30 relative that knew the guy was there
66:32 when it went up this dudes completely
66:36 fake it's possible and I will give you
66:39 proof in one second but they could
66:42 hire an actor built a prop render it and
66:46 CG I mean act the whole thing out and
66:50 even cut and paste other things who
66:52 knows right and create this do from
66:54 scratch and then that's your point of
66:55 reference there's a story about the
66:57 woman who went to the South Pole and she
67:00 got on a snowmobile and went to the edge
67:04 she was supposedly convinced this thing
67:07 was a flat disc and she then took a
67:10 camera with her and the story is is like
67:13 63 or something like that she went up
67:15 there and then she said she found the
67:16 edge took a bunch of pictures came back
67:18 to the vehicle put the camera on the
67:20 vehicle with a note saying this is flat
67:21 I found the edge and I'm out of here
67:23 because I'm gonna join the other side
67:25 and then she disappeared and then the
67:27 people that found the camera said that
67:29 all the film was overexposed now
67:32 convenien right she could be faked too
67:35 matter how elaborate the backstory is
67:37 these two people could be completely
67:39 fake giving you the sense that there's
67:41 some sort of lineage to this issue why
67:44 do I know this well I used to work in
67:47 Electronic Arts the video game company I
67:49 believe the dude's name is Neil Young he
67:52 runs Zynga right now he's a genius
67:56 in the late 90s he came up with an idea
67:58 which I can't even believe he got
68:00 greenlit but the dude was so ahead of
68:02 his time it was just crazy he had seen
68:05 the x-files was a big fan and he created
68:09 a video game called majestic for those
68:12 of you don't know majestic was the name
68:13 of the first Q clearance project after
68:17 Roswell's crash whitley strieber what a
68:19 great book about it called majestic
68:21 which you could barely find anymore
68:23 I suggest you buy a copy and read it
68:25 it's really cool it's a fun fun thing he
68:27 registers it under nonfiction now what
68:32 Neal did was he created a videogame and
68:34 my department had to supply him with a
68:37 tremendous amount of art resources to
68:39 create and encoding resources to create
68:42 his websites but he bought dozens and
68:45 dozens of domains I want to say hundreds
68:47 but I don't even know what the total
68:48 list was when I went down and met with
68:49 him with my artists and producers
68:54 it was dozens and he and I flew to
68:57 England a couple times so I got a chance
68:59 to kind of sit and drink beers with the
69:00 guy but the idea was you would sign up
69:04 to this video game you buy a box and it
69:07 came with very little in it because the
69:09 whole thing was pretty much on web and
69:11 he created a fictional world of fake
69:14 websites fake corporations fake personal
69:17 websites which had all kinds of wild you
69:20 know clues and stuff is like living in
69:22 x-files but in addition to that in
69:25 addition to creating a fake past for all
69:28 these companies okay almost nobody knows
69:31 this game ever existed it's a real shame
69:32 and the reason why it got cancelled was
69:35 that the date 9/11 happened the box that
69:38 we had just delivered to the shelf of
69:40 this game had a plane going right
69:41 towards a World Trade Center I mean wow
69:43 cuz he did the same thing x-files did
69:45 started off with aliens and then changed
69:48 it to terrorism because they find out
69:49 the narrative for aliens can go for it
69:52 has a limit depending on your writers I
69:54 probably could have found a way for him
69:56 to go longer but whatever
69:57 I trust Neil but you sign up with this
70:03 thing and I think he still had a an API
70:07 for beepers definitely on an API for
70:10 your phone I can't remember if a 2000
70:13 our phones had text messages I think
70:15 they did right so he had that he had
70:17 faxes and he had emails but he also had
70:21 just straight a phone number and you
70:23 agreed you you signed a disclaimer
70:24 online you said yeah I'm willing to do
70:26 this wild-ass game which is a life
70:29 interacting experience right and there's
70:32 a funny story the the CEO sorry the VP
70:36 of games for EA comm was the dude by the
70:40 name of Chris McKibben super dude he was
70:44 somewhere else he flew out to one of our
70:46 other studios to check on him and he was
70:48 coming back to San Francisco
70:49 in San Francisco at the time around 2000
70:52 2001 you would get out of your plane and
70:56 SFO was notorious for having bad cell
71:01 phone reception so your phone would go
71:03 dead the second you got off the plane so
71:05 you could call out there on the tarmac
71:07 but you
71:07 make a phone call internally your phone
71:09 would die if the signal would die so
71:12 he's got his fiancee at the time who's
71:14 now his wife he's got tons of kids he
71:17 was talking to her you know I picked me
71:18 up I'm at home you know I'm here so
71:20 she's like circle on the airport waiting
71:22 for him to get out and of course when he
71:25 hops out of the plane boom the phone
71:27 calls dead and as he told the story and
71:30 this is just a genius man he hits the
71:35 baggage area or whatever place where
71:40 they pick you up and his phone rings and
71:43 of course it's his wife because he was
71:45 just on the phone with her but instead
71:48 it was majestic but he didn't look at
71:51 the caller ID or didn't have that
71:52 feature or whatever was but he just
71:54 picks it up hey honey what's going on
71:55 and now he hears a woman on the other
71:58 side of the phone screaming bloody
72:01 murder she is being attacked killed I
72:05 don't know what the script was at the
72:06 time but his heart goes you know 90
72:09 times faster than it normally does he is
72:11 freaking out and it takes him a few
72:14 seconds to realize that's probably not
72:17 my wife's scream oh my god the suggest
72:21 that calling me right so he was sucked
72:24 into a false reality as a part of a
72:25 video game
72:26 and it was something we made and it was
72:30 a game I mean you knew it was the games
72:31 we weren't violating any sort of ethics
72:33 there but now imagine take that same
72:36 game and turn it into the flat earth
72:39 movement turn it into the globe movement
72:42 turn it into anything you want fake news
72:46 in you know we've been living in fake
72:49 news world probably since the early 60s
72:51 when Rod Serling did the 1959 interview
72:53 which all of you need to see or he told
72:56 the guy that was interviewing I forgot
72:58 it was Dan Rather or Cronkite or
73:01 somebody super famous back in the day he
73:03 told everyone look they are doing what
73:06 he called this is a genius human being
73:09 Rod Serling was liked off the hook
73:11 brilliant if he had his IQ measured I
73:14 don't know
73:14 between 165 and 185 somewhere in there
73:18 for sure except he smokes cigarettes too
73:20 much
73:21 of course the fake news told him it was
73:23 good for him right but he said there was
73:25 something called pre censorship that was
73:27 starting to happen and he said that
73:29 reporters are being hired who believe
73:32 the dogma that they are about to report
73:34 there's no more journalism anymore in
73:36 these people and slowly over time
73:38 they're gonna replace everybody of
73:40 course we all know about Project
73:41 Mockingbird which was in the mid 50s
73:42 this alphabet Agency purposely did the
73:46 Hearst Corporation yellow journalism
73:48 level or deception on a level that no
73:51 one had ever conceived of the television
73:53 was exactly like it is an AI pet goat to
73:56 feeding the kids brain intense man so
74:02 let me ask you your opinion somebody
74:08 proves it's a flat disc they touch the
74:12 wall they go over what would we thought
74:15 was a wall and it turns into lush
74:17 tropical worlds and there's another
74:19 coast on the other side of the disc
74:21 there are a dozen if not more gigantic
74:25 continents full of advanced human beings
74:28 maybe even primitive human beings maybe
74:32 even real violent human beings who knows
74:33 right
74:34 predators we'd never seen insects that
74:37 eat you alive insects that are bigger
74:39 than us right whatever the case might be
74:42 but we're able to prove it now does fake
74:46 news survive or does fake news tend to
74:49 go away
74:50 because we're having a moment of
74:51 lucidity for all mankind
74:53 I mean the amount of lies we would
74:56 uncover out of universities alone would
74:58 immediately reveal itself
75:00 all these tenured professors hanging on
75:02 to Big Bang black holes dark matter it
75:05 all goes away any claim of being able to
75:08 look deep into space with the Sofia
75:11 telescope on the 747 which is the Hubble
75:15 telescope let's just say that that all
75:18 gets washed out - it's all been
75:20 synthesized in a computer it's all been
75:23 synthesized in a canvas for someone's
75:25 painting a high-definition image so your
75:28 globe er that has to surrender to Flat
75:31 Earth let's just say that would be me
75:33 and then everything start
75:34 to get more truthful even if it's truth
75:36 you don't want to hear at least it's
75:38 some different so rage Flat Earth rage I
75:45 don't get it
75:47 I don't get it at all you're not wasting
75:50 your time considering theories that are
75:53 different than your own you're just
75:56 considering a theory it's different from
75:57 your own I mean how many times let me
75:59 just give you a little example here how
76:02 many times do you see a an advertisement
76:06 for something that you have no interest
76:08 in and you're scrolling your feed in
76:10 Instagram Facebook whatever Twitter
76:15 someone's trying to sell you a t-shirt
76:17 you don't want now let me ask you how
76:21 angry do you get to see something you
76:23 have no interest in I mean you might get
76:25 a little like god dang and I hate these
76:26 stupid advertisements but I mean do you
76:29 really like take pencil to paper do you
76:33 do you write a letter or an email to
76:35 someone I don't want to see any more of
76:37 this revenue-generating stuff that you
76:39 have to do to give me this free service
76:42 yeah you just scroll past it someone
76:46 likes Hillary Clinton you don't like her
76:48 you just roll past it you're a little
76:50 disappointed maybe because she's evil
76:52 flattered if I don't know I mean is it
76:55 really that hard to believe in our
76:58 Facebook locked Facebook group we
77:02 equally represent and believe me the
77:04 moderators know this and they monitor it
77:07 specifically to balance the
77:11 representation of any globe versus
77:14 flatter stuff and you know we approve
77:16 like dozens of posts every day from
77:20 people that are globus and theirs and
77:22 the thing is is that weird thing is is
77:24 that you're flat earthers at least that
77:26 run the page I don't get any emails and
77:30 oh my god I got all these stupid glow
77:31 burs no disrespect whatsoever in fact
77:34 what I talked to one of our moderators
77:36 is a big flat earther you know he very
77:39 politely asked me he goes do you really
77:40 think it's a globe you know and I just
77:43 his tone of voice when he asked me I
77:46 just thought a great person
77:48 what a great person that way he asked me
77:50 because he is completely convinced this
77:53 flat and he's doing his best to come up
77:55 with experiments to prove it and I love
77:58 him for it it's like yeah buddy you go
78:00 man and I told him I said look I you
78:02 have no idea how much I want you to
78:03 prove whatever shape this place is and
78:06 if it's flat my god let's have some fun
78:08 in my lifetime I mean come on think
78:10 about it your big lover okay great
78:12 wonderful but if you were alive when it
78:16 was proven to be flat man you could tell
78:20 your grandkids and great game grandkids
78:22 those stories depending on where we end
78:24 up after it's discovered you would be
78:27 you know part of the old guard gonna be
78:30 grandpa grandma tell me the day that you
78:32 know where were you when you found out
78:34 that it was flat you know it's like
78:37 instead of instead of one of those
78:38 acidic things like where were you when
78:40 9/11 happened where were you and JFK
78:42 yeah shot it would be hopefully not a
78:45 big disappointment that is flat you know
78:47 whatever it is what it is right and you
78:49 would be there to usher in the new era
78:52 don't eat your genetics to the overall
78:55 sanity of man reengineer your own mind
78:58 I'm sure the answer would be something
78:59 like if you bar globe er especially be
79:01 like well that was a really weird day
79:04 but it you know I'm glad to have the
79:06 truth as opposed to a lie it took us all
79:08 you know another 10 years to sort of
79:10 unravel our brains because we've been
79:12 Todd for however many years you were
79:14 alive before this happened that it was
79:16 one way you know it was actually the
79:17 other way and you know the funny thing
79:20 is I think about Bill & Ted's Excellent
79:22 Adventure
79:23 and imagine him going back and grabbing
79:26 play-doh and I don't really know what
79:29 that guy believed but imagine he was a
79:30 flat earther because everybody thought
79:32 it was flattened right and again they've
79:34 you know the idea that globe earth only
79:37 goes back 500 years is a complete lie I
79:39 mean people believed it was a globe a
79:41 long time ago and again remember the
79:43 hieroglyph for a year is a sphere with
79:46 solid color in it meaning the Sun and
79:48 the year the symbol for a month is a
79:50 sphere with a hollow interior which is
79:51 the earth and looks like they knew which
79:54 way it was or they had a belief it was
79:56 one way or the other but anyway you
79:59 bring Plato back in a time machine
80:02 on the day that it's gonna be announced
80:03 it's flat and just imagine that guy he's
80:06 like yeah what did you guys think it was
80:09 oh we thought it was round what gave you
80:11 that idea
80:12 well okay surrounded NASA you know and
80:16 you have to explain him what the hell
80:17 that is right but he just laughs ready
80:20 if it was flat he'd just laugh and go
80:22 yeah that's weird that you guys got it
80:23 all upside down I mean did you really
80:24 feel like you were moving you know I
80:26 didn't you know thought it was all
80:27 everyone understood you're right so
80:31 anyway hopefully this episode was fun
80:33 and not bad but if you haven't been a
80:37 deep thoughts radio calm please go it's
80:39 highly functional nowadays the the
80:42 statistics on the site are way up from
80:44 what they used to be man what used to be
80:46 a record-breaking day is sort of an
80:48 average day now so it's cool so
80:49 everyone's finding what they want to
80:50 find the one thing I don't mention
80:52 enough is that there is a search field
80:54 there so if you are looking for an
80:57 episode that you don't know exists or
80:59 you thought you saw a long time ago just
81:01 type in a keyword I will tell you that
81:04 some words even from my own searching
81:06 back on my old episodes they'll be words
81:08 that I used differently so like I was
81:11 trying to look up an episode for a
81:12 friend of mine called the death of
81:16 chivalry and I thought I might have
81:18 called it chivalry is dead and I called
81:20 it the death so I looked up dead didn't
81:22 find I was like that's weird pretty sure
81:24 I use that word so zip chivalry and I
81:26 found death so if there's a different
81:28 tense of a word sorry for that a morbid
81:31 example there but just tried different
81:33 tenses on the word but usually you'll
81:34 find it plus there's a category list on
81:36 the site it keeps everything a nice
81:37 little you know logical bundles so if
81:40 you're a moon person get on the moon
81:42 missions right I don't think it's any
81:44 surprise that my moon missions are
81:46 absolutely the most popular videos on
81:49 this channel the other one is that the
81:52 Roswell crash is getting pounded right
81:54 now so Roswell is a long time ago folks
81:58 that's a season two and that thing is up
82:02 there right now with the best of the
82:06 episodes in terms of daily views it's
82:08 not probably in the top 10 for overall
82:10 views but right now it's going to be in
82:12 the top 10 here and it about six months
82:14 if it keeps doing what it's doing
82:16 but there's two options for video I'm
82:18 now doing a little bit of a longer
82:20 bumper because there's something coming
82:22 up here the December 10th update to
82:24 YouTube is a big deal they're trying to
82:26 say that they're gonna cancel channels
82:27 that are commercially viable who knows
82:30 right who knows whether they how they
82:31 interpret deep thoughts I don't think
82:33 there's gonna be a lot of human
82:34 intervention until someone has to
82:37 petition so what if you wake up in this
82:39 channels gone on YouTube
82:40 December 10th or 11th or whatever and
82:44 then I gotta go through a petition
82:47 exercise with them which I now have
82:50 enough views and enough whatever to get
82:52 actual support so that's cool and let's
82:55 say they turn its back on in a couple
82:56 days because of that you want to have a
82:59 bit shoot account [ __ ] shoot is the
83:01 competitor to YouTube it's bi TCH ute
83:05 calm but just go to the website deep
83:08 thoughts video com click on it do me a
83:10 favor okay if you're on YouTube and I
83:13 don't care if you're never gonna watch
83:14 another video of mine get over to bid
83:16 shoot create an account that helps their
83:18 entire financial model that helps them
83:21 prove they've got the the viewers the
83:23 rate of growth and if they need to raise
83:25 money to make it faster better whatever
83:28 your subscription to their channel even
83:31 if you never go back is very important
83:34 they do have an app for everyone's phone
83:35 and tablet so definitely get that if you
83:37 like to watch things on your telephone
83:39 unfortunately I have not heard of any
83:42 [ __ ] shoot for the TV but again if they
83:44 get a lot of subscriptions it starts
83:45 taking over it's a freedom of speech
83:47 area it's only 1080p that I've been able
83:49 to upload as soon as I do 4k it never
83:53 ever encodes it so you know I'm good
83:56 with that
83:57 but there's the two links for the
84:01 podcast and it's pretty generic but
84:03 there's one specifically for iTunes one
84:05 for Google Play and one that's just
84:06 generic just get on the device that you
84:08 like to listen to things on go to the
84:09 website click on it it'll find the app
84:11 on your phone that's defaulted for the
84:13 podcasts RSS feed there are three social
84:18 media outlets at this point it may
84:21 change
84:22 there's the lock Facebook group I
84:24 mentioned some of the greatest people on
84:25 planet earth in that group I mean I love
84:28 everybody we
84:29 had any rebel rousers in a really long
84:31 time
84:32 the other ones Twitter Twitter's
84:34 starting to pick up a little bit people
84:35 are starting to retweet the episodes and
84:37 and I do a little bit of tweeting here
84:39 and there I just try to have fun
84:41 actually if you look at my tweets I'm
84:42 trying to make people laugh or a wake up
84:44 a little bit
84:44 the other one is mine's calm which is a
84:47 direct competitor with Facebook it's
84:49 actually way prettier than Facebook just
84:52 just to let you know it's still a white
84:55 site but it's really friendly really
84:57 beautiful we have 42 subscribers on
85:00 there as of right now I posted up the
85:03 last by 5 videos
85:04 no one's clicked anything because I
85:06 don't think anyone's on mines calm but
85:08 that's another actual legitimate
85:10 competitor to Facebook honestly and
85:13 they've got a tipping system and all
85:15 kinds of good stuff so they it's just a
85:16 really cool model I think it's all
85:18 blockchain based so is bid shoot
85:21 I think it's blockchain as well the
85:24 other one our methods of donating to the
85:25 show financially there's patreon which
85:29 again if you put a buck in what you
85:30 typically get at the videos before
85:32 anyone else gets to see them plus just a
85:34 few that no one's ever seen before I'm
85:36 gonna try to increase that a little bit
85:38 part of it's like if I create a really
85:40 great video I don't want to you know and
85:42 no-one on patreon wants me to do this
85:44 but you know I kinda want to give
85:45 something special away every once in a
85:46 while the other one is PayPal some
85:50 people have given me some direct
85:51 donations super appreciate it the other
85:55 two are just products that I want you to
85:56 have there's some affiliate links but
85:58 again I mean no money off these things
85:59 ever but one of them is the brave
86:01 browser you need to get it stop using
86:03 Chrome stop using Firefox brave is super
86:07 fast it's based on the chromium kernel
86:09 but they don't spy on you they cut off
86:12 all the trackers all the advertisements
86:15 all the autoplay videos it's beautiful
86:17 then you need to change the search
86:20 engine from Google the DuckDuckGo
86:23 DuckDuckGo right now is getting so
86:25 popular it's a little bit slow at the
86:29 entry in you know fall of 2019 I'm sure
86:32 that'll speed up over time especially as
86:33 they get more use because again they can
86:35 solicit investors to take take on stuff
86:38 they don't have any metrics that they
86:41 track on you
86:42 so if you use the brave browser with dr.
86:44 go you are absolutely living in sort of
86:47 the equivalent of like a tor browser
86:50 except they don't necessarily scramble
86:52 your your IP address but again that's
86:54 sort of a gigantic scam people but the
86:56 other one is Backblaze and I'll just
86:58 give you the version I they have a $5
87:01 version but it only goes back 30 days
87:02 you give them seven bucks infinite hard
87:06 drive space two computers I mean
87:09 everything I use on my laptop and my
87:12 desktop and I've you know I have certain
87:14 folders where I'm like I don't need that
87:16 in the cloud I just check them off and
87:18 they get ignored it's awesome but I
87:20 probably have again about 18 terabytes
87:22 of information on their service that has
87:25 saved me several times it's probably
87:26 saved at least four episodes of this
87:28 show or something went wrong something
87:31 before I realized it so definitely get
87:33 yourself that because it's super
87:35 powerful there are no season 1 episodes
87:37 on this particular channel the reason
87:39 why is that I used a bunch of my own
87:41 music from my collection which I really
87:45 love that because that's the way radio
87:46 stations do it because they have the
87:47 infinite license to just put anything in
87:49 at the beginning of a show it you know
87:51 part of it just exposed a dimension of
87:53 who I am as a human being which I really
87:55 liked and so I can't do it because
87:57 YouTube either banned in most of the
88:00 videos banned them in Europe only or
88:03 took all the money so I was like screw
88:06 that so I've created a whole new channel
88:08 for that there's no revenue generation
88:10 possible because they changed the rules
88:13 about how to get to that point so you'll
88:14 never see any ads it's just it's just
88:16 nice if you just go to the website
88:18 everything's on there that you need to
88:22 see what I might end up doing is
88:24 swapping out over winter a lot of the
88:27 YouTube feeds on the website to bid
88:30 shoot [ __ ] you tends to settle down and
88:33 succeed so we need to get over there and
88:36 create accounts so we've had since I've
88:38 been saying this we've had you don't
88:40 probably good ten people go over there
88:42 right away and make account so be one of
88:44 those people you don't have to ever use
88:46 it just get over there and sign up for
88:48 it that's all I got for you so until the
88:51 next episode take care of yourself and
88:53 someone else and I will see you in the
88:55 next deep thoughts
88:56 / now
