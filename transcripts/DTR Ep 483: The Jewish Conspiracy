00:31 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:32 deep thoughts
00:35 i thought i would uh just throw down a
00:36 quick video
00:39 sort of discussing uh a sentiment that's
00:42 building up
00:43 on the facebook channel because uh
00:46 you know i respect all of your opinions
00:48 greatly
00:50 and uh there's been a subject that keeps
00:53 coming up
00:54 it comes up you know kind of
00:55 sporadically and
00:59 i'm not so concerned about our
01:01 disagreement
01:02 uh if there is any with this particular
01:04 subject matter but
01:07 um i don't want it to
01:10 eat you up if there's anything i can do
01:14 to kind of
01:16 relax your mind because i think if
01:18 you're agitated
01:20 about information intake
01:23 then all kinds of weird [ __ ] can happen
01:25 you know
01:26 this may or may not be just a facebook
01:28 episode
01:30 but it has to do with this sorry
01:32 anti-semitic
01:35 jewish cabal accusation that is
01:38 floated around a lot and
01:42 i'm just going to give you my experience
01:44 with the way that i've incurred this
01:45 personally because i you know
01:49 part of me doesn't get it but part of me
01:50 does get it you know i i don't know
01:52 exactly where this starts so
01:56 what's the official conspiracy because
01:58 there's two there's two giant
01:59 conspiracies that
02:01 uh that have you know a basis in reality
02:05 at one level and then it i think it
02:09 it uh
02:12 it sort of falls apart in some realms
02:17 but again because there is an
02:19 anti-semitic league
02:20 you know there's a bit of a challenge
02:23 with
02:25 discussing it anywhere in public because
02:27 you know if you start to talk about any
02:29 possible
02:30 cabal within this group of folks then
02:33 you know these groups come at you and
02:37 you know it's um here's what i find
02:40 interesting
02:41 so the two that i know of that are
02:42 constantly asserted is the zionistic
02:45 banking cartel
02:46 all right and then there is the
02:49 hollywood
02:51 jewish cartel okay
02:55 well do zionists exist absolutely of
02:57 course they will tell you to your face
02:59 they exist
03:00 but what you need to understand is it's
03:02 not some jewish club
03:04 you know 100 you can be any race and
03:08 join their movement you don't have to be
03:10 arab to join their brotherhood
03:12 you know until they win maybe and then
03:14 you're gone but whatever
03:16 who knows you know the jewish hollywood
03:19 thing
03:22 is very very interesting because um
03:27 you know hollywood was definitely
03:28 founded
03:30 outside of any jewish influence
03:34 and so you know it's like uh
03:37 eventually these businessmen got
03:40 involved with it found out it's power
03:42 found out it's fun and then
03:44 nepotistically or racially or whatever
03:47 yeah there was some preferential moments
03:50 where
03:50 you could only get into certain groups
03:52 if you were of that race but now let's
03:55 stop there for one second
03:58 and let's realized that that game's been
04:00 played by every race
04:01 forever and i think that it's just kind
04:06 of strange that we go oh
04:07 well white people can do it you know the
04:09 caucasian german
04:11 valhalla warriors can do it but you know
04:14 if you're jewish you can't do it
04:15 if you're jewish it's a big cabal if
04:17 you're jewish it's bad
04:20 all right so the subject was brought up
04:24 and i'm glad it was brought up i respect
04:26 the fact it was brought up
04:28 that there's this sort of um there's a
04:31 meme posted to facebook
04:33 our locked page the basic basically
04:36 uh insinuated and called quite directly
04:38 trump
04:39 is is israel's [ __ ]
04:44 and um
04:47 yeah so let's let that sink in for just
04:50 one second
04:52 so the idea is that what's trump's uh
04:55 link to
04:56 israel well he's got a uh
04:59 son-in-law kushner who's a jew
05:02 he's a jewish guy all right apparently
05:05 first and foremost no jewish people are
05:09 allowed to marry
05:10 into the trump family he is to be an
05:11 anti-semantic racist and never let his
05:14 sons or daughter ever get with a jewish
05:18 person
05:19 and then that's the first rule the
05:21 second rule because you can you can
05:23 launch this conspiracy
05:24 if that just occurs the second thing is
05:27 is that if that guy is involved with
05:28 banking
05:30 well there you go right there in your
05:32 face you know [ __ ] the shining was all
05:34 about the moon landing
05:37 but the other things are that
05:40 trump right from the very beginning said
05:42 israel is our friend and
05:44 we will not take a position against it
05:47 because
05:47 obama who was uh who is
05:51 a muslim he's self-admitted
05:54 although he also self-denies which is
05:56 really strange it's like who cares man
05:58 dude just own it
06:00 if you own it in a weird way where
06:01 you're lying about it then
06:03 everyone's got suspicions and
06:04 conspiracies against you and all that
06:05 kind of stuff well
06:07 i believe trump is not only a christian
06:09 but i think he's a catholic as well
06:12 it could be wrong but i think that's
06:13 right okay
06:16 well i want you to go into any christian
06:18 church in the united states of america
06:19 or your country of choice
06:21 and ask them what they think about jews
06:23 in israel
06:25 and i would be shocked if you heard any
06:29 comment out other than they are the
06:32 chosen people
06:33 and um
06:37 you know we must protect israel at all
06:39 costs
06:42 okay so why is trump so special for
06:45 taking that attitude
06:46 he's also the president united states
06:47 now of the biggest country
06:49 with the biggest army not the biggest
06:50 country physically but the strongest
06:52 country in the world in terms of
06:53 military force
06:54 all right not trying to brag it's just
06:57 there
06:58 quite frankly i don't know i mean i
07:00 guess i like the fact that we're
07:02 very powerful but it certainly is a pain
07:04 in the ass when people want to start
07:06 wars and yank us into [ __ ] finish it
07:08 for them
07:09 thank you french people of the
07:12 40s and 50s for starting or no 50s and
07:15 60s for starting north korean
07:17 war and vietnam but now he's
07:21 made his visit over there he also
07:23 visited the crown prince of saudi arabia
07:26 and got him to
07:29 take some pressure off of israel's
07:31 existence
07:34 trump also moved the capital or sorry
07:36 our our embassy to
07:40 um their capital
07:43 and so he's bad i guess for doing that i
07:46 guess or it shows that he's part of a
07:48 big cabal i mean
07:50 you know what if israel put their
07:52 embassy their number one embassy in
07:54 wichita kansas
07:56 would that make any sense why not do it
07:57 in washington dc
07:59 that's our that's where all of our
08:00 politicians are why would you be in some
08:02 weird spot
08:04 now i think that one of the kind of
08:07 underground sentiments
08:10 that i don't know if anyone feels
08:12 totally comfortable with is the
08:13 palestinian settlement crunch of the
08:16 israeli
08:18 yeah of israel right so palestinians had
08:20 a big spot in there
08:22 i've always mentioned that terry jones
08:23 gotta bless his soul he passed away last
08:25 year
08:27 or maybe it was earlier this year he did
08:30 a great documentary on the crusades in
08:32 the 90s
08:32 for the bbc and you know he mentioned
08:36 the formation of israel and he made a
08:37 point to say look at the time of the
08:40 formation of israel
08:42 the country was pretty much 50 50 jewish
08:45 arab and everyone got along
08:48 and then all sudden because of some
08:49 stuff some germans did to some jewish
08:51 people
08:52 way up in europe the concession was is
08:55 they get to take arab land as a result
08:57 of the thing in in
08:59 world war two i forever will never get
09:01 that
09:02 ever i know that they in their what i
09:05 call make-believe book
09:07 you know that's their big holy ground
09:08 and that kind of stuff that's the land
09:10 they wanted but
09:11 um i think you got to do some different
09:13 discussions and different rationales to
09:15 why
09:16 they get that land from people had
09:18 nothing to do with what happened in
09:20 europe
09:22 and then of course there was the sort of
09:24 talking out of both sides of their mouth
09:25 and now we're not hurting palestinians
09:27 we were palestinians all right you know
09:28 we took the land we took the land no
09:29 we're not hurting him
09:30 and of course the palestinian states
09:32 just absolutely shrunk
09:35 but one of my good friends who's a
09:38 jewish guy
09:39 he's a full-on atheist according to him
09:42 when he visits israel he goes you know
09:44 80
09:44 of the population is atheist they don't
09:47 believe in anything
09:48 at all not even an afterlife okay
09:51 nothing zero but he said look
09:56 because people don't understand on
09:58 average
09:59 that the the jewish community just
10:01 roamed around the world and never had a
10:04 state of their own
10:06 and so the fact they've got this tiny
10:08 little country down there
10:09 and that's all they want is this tiny
10:11 little country and he said yeah it's a
10:13 bummer
10:14 that the arabs got pushed out he doesn't
10:16 like that either because he doesn't
10:18 believe any jewish right or
10:20 sorry religious rationale for that at
10:21 all
10:23 because he goes look the arabs have tons
10:25 of land in eurasia
10:26 and so he's kind of like well
10:30 it's a bummer but they got some place to
10:32 go and again he hates it it's just so no
10:34 it's almost sort of like
10:35 um the native american situation with
10:39 europeans coming over it's just a it's
10:40 just a horrible thing
10:42 you know and i guess a hundred years all
10:44 the palestinian land will be gone and
10:45 then the kids will be sitting on top of
10:47 that
10:48 guilt trip that you know it's very legit
10:50 that we sit on top of with the native
10:52 americans in europe i'm sorry in america
10:54 excuse me
10:55 coming from europe so you know
11:00 we're trying to get out of wars
11:03 and if there's conflict in the world
11:05 then and it's one of our allies
11:07 okay and israel can handle itself for
11:10 sure but
11:11 if for any reason my god you know all of
11:14 the arab
11:15 states uh mounted up armies and said we
11:17 are finally gonna go
11:19 you know west and knock this country
11:21 into the ocean knock all those people
11:23 into the ocean and all of our
11:25 palestinians will be rejoined to their
11:26 old farms and all that kind of stuff
11:30 then america would be dragged into it
11:33 europe
11:33 would be dragged into it it would be
11:35 horrible
11:37 so we're kind of stuck between you know
11:39 rocking a hard place
11:40 it really is kind of a shitty situation
11:45 uh terry jones also went on to say that
11:47 you know when israel was formed you had
11:49 arab families palestinian families that
11:52 had owned
11:54 an acreage of land however much it was
11:57 for like 900 years
11:59 and people just came in and said get off
12:01 get off your land it's hours down
12:04 this is important to remember that i
12:07 want you to know what i know
12:09 so that we can kind of compare notes as
12:10 to how deep a cabal could go
12:14 so let's go back to the zionist thing
12:18 as far as i understand it zionism is
12:20 more of a banker
12:22 related movement there's probably a lot
12:26 more deep philosophy than just banking
12:28 of course but that's the one that the
12:31 conspiracy is really attached to
12:34 and what is the initial way that one
12:35 gets inducted into this
12:39 i was fortunate to get awaken at least
12:42 to the point where
12:43 i was told about all the monarchy
12:45 families all of the
12:48 ashkenazi jews that really got into the
12:51 money
12:52 changing thing you know the rothschilds
12:53 are really ashkenazi jews
12:55 they're not jewish by blood they're
12:57 jewish by conversion
12:58 now again they may have married into uh
13:01 jewish blood and as far as i understand
13:02 it too the um
13:04 the technical definition from the jewish
13:07 community of
13:08 you qualifying as a jew goes in two
13:11 different steps
13:13 at a minimum your mother has to be a jew
13:16 if your father's the only one in the
13:18 family is jewish
13:20 and your mother isn't there are factions
13:22 over there that believe you're not
13:23 jewish
13:24 how bizarre is that you get fifty
13:26 percent of the blood
13:27 because it comes from your mom you're
13:29 not legit
13:31 my friends who are comedians in the los
13:34 angeles area who are definitely jewish
13:36 they have jewish fathers and non-jewish
13:39 mothers
13:41 some of them from canada some from new
13:42 york whatever
13:44 but they will actually
13:47 tell their friends and you know there's
13:49 like a
13:50 it's like a tiny little you know jewish
13:52 community that's sort of spread out
13:53 inside of um
13:55 los angeles but they would come to my
13:57 friend's shows
13:59 and there would always be a faction that
14:01 was hasidically jew
14:03 and i guess that's the way you say it
14:05 they're hasidic jews
14:07 which means they're really pure blood
14:08 jews they they wear that very specific
14:11 outfit you know they've some of them
14:12 were the kind of fun i don't want to
14:14 call it the wrong name but they have you
14:15 know specific
14:16 hats that they wear it's really cool
14:18 looking when you see it in real life
14:20 but they have you know the curls down
14:21 the side they've got those um
14:24 the cloth hanging off their hips i don't
14:27 know what any of that stuff means you
14:28 know
14:30 i do know that leonard emory was one
14:32 cool dude
14:34 but they would make jokes on stage
14:36 fairly immediately because they wanted
14:37 to acknowledge the people that came and
14:39 bought tickets and got their two drink
14:41 minimums and stuff but they would say
14:43 oh well i would say in one specific
14:45 concert i saw
14:47 i guess that's what we'd call it it's at
14:49 the improv of melrose
14:51 and uh comedian uh went over and said
14:55 you know well you know i
14:56 got our jewish you know people here
14:58 today and he goes or you know some joke
14:59 about it you know in case you're
15:00 wondering yeah those are jews over there
15:02 and he says but you know i want you to
15:03 understand it because i'm not a full jew
15:05 they wouldn't consider me fully jewish
15:07 because i don't have this or that
15:08 other thing and it was really funny
15:11 because on that particular concert there
15:12 was a kid right in the front
15:14 with the full you know authentic garb on
15:17 and he was just shaking his head and he
15:19 wasn't laughing he was like yeah you
15:20 know you're not
15:22 and it's just very interesting because
15:24 we're gonna get to the chosen people
15:25 thing
15:26 here shortly
15:29 the other interesting comedic thing that
15:31 occurred at one night
15:33 because we had um get ari there
15:36 uh probably about three or four guys
15:39 there
15:40 and it i've been so i've been to like
15:42 dozens and dozens of their concerts
15:44 because i used to do all their promo
15:45 stuff
15:47 and um
15:51 that one would touch the holocaust every
15:52 single time right
15:54 and have just at least a mention of it
15:56 or something like that
15:58 and so after seeing this over and over
15:59 and over again
16:01 i uh i tested their sense of humor and
16:04 they were all kind of huddled in the
16:05 back just before the show was about to
16:06 start
16:07 and i walked over and i go okay guys um
16:10 who's got the holocaust card tonight
16:12 and they all looked at me really funny
16:13 and i was like well one of his gonna
16:15 have to talk about it so i'm just trying
16:16 to get it straight who's got the card
16:18 tonight
16:18 and they died laughing and i think it
16:21 was ari or somebody goes
16:22 i'll do it okay he walked out and did it
16:24 you know
16:25 but you know so
16:30 i wonder if folks that carry these
16:33 conspiracies against jews know any jews
16:36 you know because you have to be able to
16:38 separate the people
16:40 from the bankers because think about
16:43 think about it this way
16:45 imagine you're jewish and you're over in
16:47 israel and you're in this little dinky
16:50 country
16:50 with a fairly small population around
16:53 the world
16:54 and yes you do have plenty of heroes who
16:57 are jewish
16:58 right in all different english
16:59 industries or what have you
17:01 and but the majority of everybody else
17:03 in the world is
17:05 i don't know white arab black mexican
17:09 whatever chinese indian and so
17:12 they could easily say the opposite
17:15 conspiracy well the whities the blue
17:16 eyes you know blue eyed devils and blah
17:18 blah blah blah blah or whatever the
17:20 chinese and the russians or whatever
17:22 and they could make the same
17:23 conspiracies back the other way
17:26 that the white people control [ __ ] right
17:29 now the king and queen of england are
17:32 our former uh you know the windsor name
17:35 is fake i mean it's an it's
17:36 it's like it's a real name but they they
17:39 added it because they were the um
17:41 sax gothberg and
17:44 supposedly they're all german i don't
17:47 know how this works you know
17:50 i get it for a while there when we
17:51 started doing all of my uh my family
17:53 started doing their lineage
17:56 there's a point back i don't know how
17:58 many
17:59 hundreds of years but this the the first
18:02 names really started turning into like
18:03 what looked like
18:05 usually jewish male first names
18:08 and so a few people were really curious
18:10 like oh my gosh do we have jewish
18:12 ancestry we don't know
18:13 so everybody got their blood test or
18:15 whatever wanted to do that and there was
18:16 none
18:17 registerable in anyone's blood so it was
18:20 just a popular name thing at the time
18:23 but the the other thing that happens
18:26 and you know i have to say i have seen
18:29 dozens of
18:30 documentaries on israel from all
18:32 different angles and i
18:34 you know i've only seen one documentary
18:36 where they interviewed this woman
18:38 who lived in one of the new uh was it
18:42 they call it the gaza strip
18:44 homes that were taken from the
18:46 palestinians under
18:48 bulldozers and bombs and all kinds of
18:50 stuff
18:52 and she said well she was absolutely
18:54 remorseless
18:56 and she was like well yeah of course
18:59 this is arlene that was our land before
19:00 and um uh we're the chosen people so
19:04 you know tough titty right i think
19:07 that's pretty rare
19:09 because i shared that with my other
19:10 friend i used to have two jewish
19:12 partners
19:13 one was almost half half she was adopted
19:16 so she's
19:17 a half russian jew and what's really
19:20 interesting is with my partners
19:23 they were atheist families pretty much
19:25 or christian i think
19:26 maybe on one side but the idea was that
19:28 they really just didn't
19:29 have any interest in their religion at
19:31 all until their 30s
19:32 and then one the husband went off and
19:35 started learning
19:36 actually i think he actually was raised
19:38 with hebrew
19:39 but he kind of like knew just what was
19:41 in the book he didn't know how to speak
19:42 it fluently so he was going to school
19:44 for that he kind of got her into because
19:45 they were having a kid
19:47 well let's make sure that we pick sides
19:49 here with like what we're going to do
19:51 we're gonna teach
19:51 christianity we teach judaism or nothing
19:54 let's just figure it out
19:55 and they thought there was enough value
19:57 in the jewish side to go ahead and go
19:58 for it it made sense right
20:00 for them it's their choice not hurting
20:01 me they're not hurting their kid
20:04 you know but there's this whole thing in
20:06 the bible about the
20:07 144 000 um
20:10 why is 144 tribes looks like somehow 144
20:14 thousands in it too
20:17 start sprinkling here so the bible you
20:21 know
20:21 holds out and it really kind of blows my
20:24 mind because you have this
20:26 this bible created it like what uh
20:29 technically 1000 a.d
20:31 and you know it's a lot of strong
20:32 evidence to suggest it's a roman
20:34 creation but there was a very powerful
20:38 jewish you know community at the time in
20:40 rome
20:40 that's why it's in the bible that's why
20:43 jesus always has to talk to the rabbis
20:45 as well
20:47 there's big confrontations with rabbis
20:48 in the new testament right
20:51 but the question is is like do you think
20:54 there's
20:54 chosen people and what i find just
20:57 fascinating about the whole
21:01 christian loyalty it's totally raining
21:03 on me right now christian loyalty to
21:05 this
21:05 jewish tribe concept is that how can
21:08 one i never had anyone answer the
21:10 question so maybe you can answer it for
21:11 me
21:12 but if you think jesus is the savior and
21:15 god
21:15 himself and all this kind of stuff i
21:18 don't understand how there could be this
21:19 endorsement for
21:22 a group of people that completely deny
21:24 your savior's
21:26 power structure right and all of his
21:28 miracles and all that stuff
21:30 and it was funny because when i first
21:31 moved to california
21:34 i worked at the tax place you know turbo
21:35 tax place
21:38 and our head cpa was jewish
21:42 super cool progressive guy total atheist
21:44 but he said that um
21:46 at one point he was talking to
21:49 he told me the story he was talking to
21:51 the family rabbi
21:52 and he said that you know he was the guy
21:55 and i was like 18 when he was telling me
21:57 he was a guy told me he goes
21:59 we're probably wrong and we're all going
22:00 to hell this is really funny
22:03 so the chosen tribe thing just i'm lost
22:07 i don't know
22:07 what that means i don't know why
22:12 anyone would believe that a god would
22:14 create chosen people and then not chosen
22:16 people
22:18 but as i said on facebook and i want to
22:20 repeat it here on the show i think that
22:22 that sort of paradigm
22:24 is one of insecurity where
22:27 you if you're doing if you think you're
22:30 going to be rejected you want to write
22:31 some sort of
22:33 loyalty passage that
22:36 you know well don't you know we're the
22:38 good guys don't mess with us you know
22:39 we're the chosen ones we don't want to
22:41 be a part of that religion of yours
22:42 because it's [ __ ] wacko
22:44 but definitely we're the chosen ones and
22:45 your whole
22:47 bible you know supports this so just
22:49 back off
22:51 i don't know how to get it man
22:55 i think that um
22:59 i guess the other thing that's sort of
23:00 lost on me a little bit and then it
23:03 isn't an is because coming from europe
23:05 and being in america which is the
23:07 ultimate melting pot right
23:08 there are other melting pots in the
23:09 world you know south africa is pretty
23:11 melty and
23:12 australia's turning really melty but
23:14 there's you know europe's doing really
23:16 well
23:18 but it's interesting to say like i'm
23:20 german right um
23:21 of at least three fourths german uh the
23:24 other fourth
23:24 uh we think is german we're not quite
23:26 sure whatever maybe there's one guy
23:28 swears it's norwegian don't know
23:30 but anyway i have always been over here
23:33 which is native american land
23:35 and i've always been surrounded by even
23:37 growing up
23:38 uh mexican and black you know they were
23:41 sort of like this
23:42 uh you know at times various families
23:45 were considered almost royalty in my
23:46 hometown you know
23:48 and so i i you know i
23:52 being told as a kid i dual citizenship
23:54 until i was 18
23:56 and because i couldn't easily go over
23:59 and do their uh one year of army
24:02 training which sometimes i regret not
24:04 getting into the american army and or
24:05 american armed forces at least and
24:08 going over to germany i don't know how
24:09 to speak german so it would have been a
24:11 cluster who had been yelling at me and
24:13 jerome would be like i don't know what
24:14 you want me to do
24:16 so this identity where i feel like i
24:19 need to have a country
24:21 that belongs to my genetics
24:24 um you know it's like i've always wanted
24:26 to visit germany as an adult and hang
24:28 out and just see what it's like but you
24:29 know what would come
24:30 what would become apparent very quickly
24:32 would be that i'd probably have
24:35 you know maybe i have a the genetic
24:37 affinity for engineering
24:39 um but i don't know i don't know if i
24:42 have anything in common with anyone over
24:43 there it's not a racial thing for me
24:46 i'm more interested in the paradigm of
24:47 how you live
24:49 are we do we all believe in common law
24:51 and you know no
24:52 you know world trade organization and no
24:55 who
24:55 and no [ __ ] eu and other globalist
24:58 crap
24:58 then were on the same page other than
25:00 that you know you just happen to be
25:02 german and so do i in a lot of and a lot
25:04 of
25:05 genes in my life right
25:09 so this why the reason i mention that is
25:12 i don't understand
25:13 personally this need to solidify the
25:16 jewish community into a country
25:18 that just doesn't you know i understand
25:20 that other people do
25:22 but it being such an imperative i don't
25:24 understand i don't know
25:27 so the trump thing is that you know if
25:30 you're a christian at all
25:32 there's a huge push to constantly carry
25:35 you know israel's agenda
25:38 all right but the other thing too is
25:42 um this is going to be kind of risky
25:44 with the way i say this and i have to
25:46 make sure that you understand my
25:47 position
25:48 first there's a lot of bankers
25:51 everywhere
25:52 okay and man they are every race on
25:54 planet earth
25:56 and because man is so corrupt
25:59 it's it's it's the reason why socialism
26:01 can't work because human nature can't be
26:03 controlled
26:05 that's the reason why it can't work for
26:07 now that's what we have to have another
26:10 i'm gonna say a few thousand years if
26:11 not ten thousand years of evolution
26:13 mentally to be able to really go okay
26:16 now we can make gene roddenberry star
26:18 trek world a reality
26:22 now the other thing is
26:25 if you're not jewish
26:28 then i don't know that you know what
26:30 it's like
26:31 to be them and i know that's a stupid
26:34 statement but
26:35 think about um if you're british
26:38 you can call upon a couple thousand
26:42 years uh
26:42 at least as a british society i don't
26:45 know you go back a thousand years
26:47 somewhere in there 800 or so and say
26:51 we've accomplished all this i mean the
26:53 queen of england conquered 45 percent of
26:55 the
26:56 inhabitable space on this planet as a
26:58 personal property to herself
27:00 and the family okay that's pretty
27:03 impressive wouldn't you say
27:05 uh if you're spanish from spain
27:08 well the king and queen of spain right
27:09 now are extremely powerful
27:11 they have a huge history battling out
27:13 with all the other countries
27:16 uh german well germania i mean it
27:19 for i think technically the majority of
27:22 europe at
27:23 any one point in time between the
27:24 beginning of europe's early inhabitants
27:27 perhaps with the what is it the six
27:29 kings
27:31 you have the whole place being germania
27:35 a very rustic rough joint to live right
27:40 on and on down the block
27:43 so i understand that if the jews are
27:45 running around europe
27:47 sort of like the kurds are today right
27:49 the kurds don't have a country
27:51 they're just a people so they're always
27:53 kind of being treated like homeless
27:54 people
27:55 at the northern tip of a bunch of
27:57 countries over there
27:59 and they're like guys you know we kind
28:00 of have a group of people we
28:03 breed together and what have you could
28:04 we just have a little plot of land you
28:06 know you got all this uninhabited crappy
28:07 land
28:08 we'll take it we'll take it we'll build
28:10 it up
28:12 so i understand the sentiment of the
28:14 jews wanting to say look
28:17 living in germany was really dangerous
28:18 for us and you know we can debate all
28:21 day about the holocaust and what
28:22 happened all that kind of stuff but
28:24 nothing changes the fact that they all
28:26 got put on trains and hauled off to
28:28 these
28:28 camps that happened
28:32 you've seen the videos of people getting
28:34 shot in the street for not wanting to
28:36 get
28:36 on the trains you know that's on video
28:40 you've seen the experiments they did on
28:41 these people i mean it's a very legit
28:44 bad thing so the idea is to say let us
28:48 have a little plot of land
28:49 i know it's going to be inconvenient but
28:51 we got to pick some place we'd like to
28:52 go to the place that's got jerusalem and
28:54 all that kind of stuff
28:55 and then we can protect ourselves
28:58 please help us protect ourselves and
29:00 then we'll be quiet we'll be cool we
29:02 won't hear any more things about
29:04 you know the persecution of jews in any
29:06 particular way it'll just be we live
29:07 there and we're going to
29:08 clear this area i was going to take a
29:10 few hundred years get it all squeezed up
29:12 and protected
29:15 so i can vicariously understand their
29:17 rationale
29:19 for that it's unfortunate that
29:22 it had to happen the way it happened
29:24 both in the case of the
29:26 world war ii situation and the
29:28 post-world war ii creation of a country
29:30 that was being shared by
29:32 arabs as well it's bad
29:36 but this sort of
29:40 routine mantra the trump is somehow
29:43 working for this deep state i talk about
29:45 it a lot right
29:46 on the show because it just kind of
29:47 filters in every once in a while
29:50 but saying he's like a [ __ ] of israel
29:53 is sort of strange to me let's say
29:56 you take all the money that's printed in
29:58 the entire world
30:00 that that exists to control society
30:04 and then you have to put it in a pie
30:05 chart according to racial control
30:08 i'd be fascinated if the jewish pile is
30:11 even remotely a majority
30:15 don't know don't know and it depends on
30:18 how much
30:19 you slice the the
30:22 metric of which you're you're saying is
30:24 it if someone has a drop of blood in
30:26 them they're a zionist they're a jew
30:28 um like the windsor family i we don't
30:30 know i don't think they got a kind of a
30:31 jewish last name at one point
30:34 i don't care what race you are it's it's
30:36 almost like that that old saying that
30:37 says um
30:40 i'm not going to call you a a bad name
30:43 because of your gender or your race i'm
30:45 going to call you a bad name because
30:46 you're an [ __ ]
30:47 right and so i kind of operate like that
30:50 it's like well
30:51 i don't really care what race you are i
30:54 mean if it's a part of the dynamic to
30:55 defeat you
30:56 and maybe that's part of the strategy
30:58 but at first it's just kind of like
31:00 you know hey you just knock off the
31:02 compound interest crap
31:03 and this fiat thing you got going and
31:05 we're getting rid of that just sorry
31:07 it's gonna all go back to some point i
31:10 don't kill
31:10 i don't care if it's jelly bean back you
31:12 know
31:14 and there's all this talk about when i
31:15 mentioned it
31:18 in the uh other corona episode but this
31:20 idea of us getting off a fiat and
31:22 getting back on
31:23 gold and you hear economists say well
31:25 there's not enough gold there's not
31:26 enough gold to back the money
31:28 and you're kind of going you know have
31:30 you seen bitcoin
31:32 how much does it take to buy let's say
31:35 um
31:37 bitcoins way down right now like 5 500
31:39 bucks which is a massive fall from last
31:41 year
31:43 it was 10 000 a few months ago
31:46 now it's the 5500 last november was 8
31:48 700.
31:50 it's okay you want to buy something with
31:51 bitcoin like a candy bar or something
31:53 well how many bitcoins is that going to
31:54 take point zero zero zero zero zero one
31:57 okay great okay so that means
32:00 you've seen the math on how we could
32:02 back something with a gold currency
32:06 all fiat systems around the world
32:11 including zionist systems will fall
32:14 apart immediately the second that
32:15 america goes gold-backed and gets rid of
32:17 fiat currency the second that the world
32:19 sees the power of a gold-backed currency
32:22 they'll do the same thing and then the
32:24 money changers game
32:26 which ran i guess about as long as the
32:29 um
32:30 the mason game it's over
32:33 it's like these things take a while to
32:35 kind of get everybody on the same page
32:37 and boy the internet has been wonderful
32:39 and teaching everybody
32:40 those mechanisms right but here's the
32:45 here's the thing about the trump thing
32:47 which i don't understand like
32:50 i guess i just haven't had anyone ever
32:52 explain their position to me
32:54 when it comes to accusing him of being
32:56 some deep state asset right
32:58 because you have to understand i got
32:59 people in my family who say this kind of
33:01 [ __ ]
33:02 but when i actually ask them to parse it
33:06 they're at dead zero they've got nothing
33:08 and no other words come out of their
33:10 mouth
33:10 the only thing that was ever asserted
33:12 was the thing i keep mentioning which is
33:14 one of my family members said um
33:17 i think he's a bilderberg and i think
33:18 he's been to the meetings and i think
33:20 he's doing their bidding
33:21 and i think he's going to start a war
33:22 with iran and blah blah blah everything
33:24 that they've said
33:25 is complete horseshit they've never seen
33:27 daniel estelin's book they've never
33:28 looked at a thousand
33:30 telephoto lens photographs of
33:33 everyone who drives in the place and you
33:35 shoot they shoot it into the car
33:37 but also when they shoot down into the
33:38 place and everyone's partying outside
33:40 people arriving in helicopters people
33:42 exiting
33:43 they post to interview all the workers
33:45 they get the agenda
33:47 out of the trash cans i mean the amount
33:50 of people that
33:50 mean the amount of information we know
33:52 about these meetings is so comprehensive
33:54 that it's even hard for them to disinfo
33:56 it
33:58 i talked to daniel estellin once
34:01 it's funny because i got another friend
34:02 of mine that also talked to him
34:06 and one thing he told me that was uh
34:08 fascinating which i
34:09 i don't know if it was in his book i
34:11 think he just told me personally
34:15 but he said that he was uh in a hotel
34:17 outside of the bilderberg
34:20 group and a guy came to him and said he
34:21 was going to give him
34:23 some information on it and then he said
34:26 that when he um
34:28 parted ways with this guy that he was
34:31 about to get into an elevator and the
34:33 door opened up and he
34:34 almost stepped in the elevator but it
34:36 wasn't there
34:37 like he was going to fall to his death
34:39 and for him it was like
34:40 they just tried to kill me they lured me
34:42 to this hotel to get whatever
34:44 information i was going to get
34:45 and they were trying to get me to walk
34:47 into the elevator without it there
34:49 that's pretty interesting trump has
34:52 never been to these meetings people
34:56 he just hasn't i mean you know the guy's
34:58 a baller
34:59 i mean you know if the if the chief
35:02 editor of the washington post
35:04 arrives at a bilderberg meeting which he
35:06 did in a helicopter
35:09 you don't think trump's going to arrive
35:10 in a helicopter and just really like do
35:12 the steve jobs thing there was a steve
35:14 jobs meeting he did in europe
35:16 and uh people were really frustrated
35:18 with him because he came in a helicopter
35:21 and he made the helicopter circle the uh
35:25 this manor house that he was meeting in
35:28 and they all went oh there's the
35:30 the boy wonder trying to show off the
35:32 fact that he's he's landing in a
35:33 helicopter now whether or not
35:34 he was even trying to do that who knows
35:36 right you never admitted that
35:39 maybe he did i don't know but donna
35:40 would probably
35:42 show up in a [ __ ] gold-plated goddamn
35:43 helicopter just his style
35:47 he'd want to show off if he thought that
35:49 was a big deal he's never been to
35:50 bohemian grove
35:51 i got people that go to bohemian grove
35:53 that are friends of mine
35:55 they've never seen the crazy [ __ ] that
35:57 alex jones talks about but then again
35:59 they know they're not at all the events
36:00 either
36:02 basically say we smoke cigars drink the
36:04 finest whiskeys on planet earth
36:06 and everyone brings cases of like the
36:08 finest cubans in the world and the
36:10 finest booze and everyone just sits
36:12 around and talks and
36:13 drinks and smokes and eats
36:16 one of my second degree friends
36:20 um was there for like three days
36:23 twice in a row i mean two times in a row
36:26 so you know
36:26 [ __ ] happens there but i think they've
36:28 calmed the events down
36:31 but anyway the press has been attacking
36:33 donald trump since he got into office
36:37 and it's like it's relentless it's
36:40 demented
36:40 it's crazy there is definitely trump
36:43 derangement syndrome
36:44 it is a [ __ ] mental illness that
36:46 people are catching like their cat
36:48 disease right
36:50 and so if he's playing ball
36:53 none of this would happen you know when
36:55 he took off from canada
36:57 after that g summit had to go shake
37:00 hands with
37:00 uh kim jong-un in uh singapore
37:04 you know trudeau throws him under the
37:05 bus the second he [ __ ] takes off and
37:07 they shot a [ __ ] missile at the
37:09 goddamn air force one which was caught
37:10 on a weather camera
37:12 uh off the coast of washington right i
37:14 think
37:15 that's where the guy wrecked the plane
37:18 yeah yeah
37:18 he's really on their side you know they
37:20 really love him to death and he just
37:22 tweeted uh less than a week ago that the
37:24 obama administration was the most
37:26 corrupt
37:26 uh administration ever is the guy
37:29 playing ball
37:31 what [ __ ] universe do you want i
37:32 don't get it man i mean i'm up for your
37:34 explanation anything come
37:36 up with but i don't get it
37:39 it's um i'm gonna share what i think is
37:42 going on
37:44 with the trump loathing crap and i'm not
37:46 pointing this anyone in particular
37:48 it's mostly my outside friends that post
37:50 on um
37:52 facebook when you hate yourself
37:56 get a big problem on your hands
38:00 if you net up you'll fix yourself and
38:01 you will stop hating other people but
38:04 when you hate yourself
38:05 since the mind can't really accept that
38:09 it has to divert it has to project
38:14 and it will find something or someone to
38:16 hate that's why a lot of racism happens
38:19 in the south
38:21 as the american dream fell apart for
38:23 instance
38:25 people found themselves without jobs and
38:26 of course was because of that mexicans
38:28 because that black guy because whatever
38:29 somebody else was the problem
38:32 and so now because the narrative is so
38:36 thick to hate trump because he's
38:37 globalist that he's supposedly working
38:39 for
38:40 or working endlessly to destroy him like
38:41 george charles would be trump's best
38:43 friend
38:44 if he was working for these guys he
38:47 would literally go up and post trump as
38:48 the best president ever
38:50 everyone would be doing that the dems oh
38:52 [ __ ] they'd be working with trump every
38:54 single day
38:55 advancing all of the previous obama
38:56 agendas but what happened
38:58 trump got rid of all of obama's agendas
39:00 and he's trying to get rid of all the
39:01 rest he hasn't done yet
39:03 tpp would have passed bringing jobs back
39:06 to america that's the last thing they
39:08 won
39:09 last thing they won okay so when you
39:14 start hating someone else
39:16 because you can't deal with your own
39:17 self-loathing you know you're full of
39:19 [ __ ]
39:20 you know you're full of [ __ ] and you
39:24 know
39:24 when you tourette's it out to the world
39:26 that you
39:27 know deep down inside subconsciously
39:29 that you're actually exposing your own
39:31 problem
39:32 and so how do you reinforce this
39:35 illusion that you have your [ __ ]
39:36 together
39:38 you engage in suitable intellectual
39:40 behavior to try to prove
39:43 that you're really a deep thinker
39:46 that you're really a good person all
39:48 this kind of stuff
39:49 that you you you do you do virtual
39:51 signaling [ __ ] all the time
39:54 see me i i just gave a dollar to
39:55 homeless person did you see it
39:57 i got a selfie of me doing this with a
39:59 homeless person you see you see how good
40:00 i am i had to tell you about this right
40:02 i tell you i'm a vegan too
40:06 i don't kill anything with eyes unless
40:07 it's human
40:10 the thing is is that that doesn't work
40:12 either
40:13 it only works for other people in the
40:15 psychosis
40:17 and because life requires a lot of hard
40:20 work dedication
40:21 and ups and downs that you have to pick
40:23 yourself up from and hey
40:25 a lot of the downs these days has
40:27 nothing to do with your responsibility
40:28 whatsoever
40:30 everywhere on planet earth you should be
40:32 able to get the american dream
40:34 where you are but sometimes you gotta
40:36 fight for your uh
40:38 fight for your freedom because your
40:39 predecessors and your country let it all
40:42 go to [ __ ]
40:43 or never got their [ __ ] together
40:46 all right sometimes i wonder you know
40:50 if we were to take trump completely out
40:52 of the game and take you out of this
40:54 universe the one that you're in right
40:56 now the matrix that you're living in
40:57 right now
40:59 and we erase everything that you hate
41:03 but we put you in a fair and balanced
41:05 world we're gonna have to work hard
41:08 to get anything that you want in life
41:11 would those people that are in this hate
41:13 game
41:15 be able to survive and if they couldn't
41:17 make it happen because
41:19 they have traits within their character
41:21 that they have adopted evolved
41:23 that make them lazy that make them you
41:26 know
41:26 laziness will kill you i mean laziness
41:28 makes you look the way you don't want to
41:30 look
41:30 makes your brain not work the way you
41:31 want it to work so
41:33 you look in the mirror you're the mirror
41:35 is your enemy
41:37 what would they hate at some point with
41:41 the hate finally come back on themselves
41:42 so much that they go
41:44 i'm either going to kill myself i'm
41:46 going to get my [ __ ] together and you
41:48 know what kill myself
41:49 and depending on your belief of death
41:52 and afterlife maybe that's terrifying so
41:54 you go and you
41:55 you put down the bon bons and the cake
41:57 and the [ __ ] ice cream
41:59 and you uh you look at something heavy
42:02 and you start to pick it up
42:04 okay and then you start to feel that
42:05 rush of working out
42:07 you read a book and your brain's just
42:09 sucking in the words like
42:10 thick oxygen you're like oh my god this
42:13 is so good to get educated on something
42:16 i even like this subject it's great
42:19 and we get you all the way up like like
42:22 kanye west told me
42:24 we habilitate people we don't
42:25 rehabilitate people we habilitate them
42:27 up
42:29 and they get repaired on their own terms
42:32 because there's no one else to hate
42:34 maybe we just remove all the humans from
42:36 earth and we just go there you go man
42:38 near fantasy there's no one to hate
42:41 go now let's say
42:44 that this person i'm talking about this
42:46 hypothetical person
42:48 fixes their life now the mirror
42:51 is their best friend in fact they like
42:53 reflective surfaces right
42:55 a little bit of the narcissism that's
42:57 healthy right
43:00 one of the things i hate is that people
43:02 tell people you know you can't love
43:04 yourself
43:05 i have an episode called loving yourself
43:06 and it's super duper important to hear
43:08 if you don't
43:10 yeah you're totally allowed to love
43:12 yourself who the hell would tell you not
43:14 to
43:15 now there's ego which is a little bit
43:18 different than just loving yourself
43:19 right
43:20 that's why i did an episode on that as
43:21 well confidence
43:24 you should be allowed but hey you know
43:27 what
43:27 if you like the way your face looks
43:29 today where your clothes fit you today
43:32 the way your hair looks whatever you
43:35 should be able to enjoy that
43:37 but we bring you back to this exact
43:39 matrix where you left off
43:41 where you were full of all this 8888
43:44 scapegoating to the max right
43:48 you might look at everything completely
43:50 different
43:52 you might look at donald trump different
43:53 you might look at everybody different
43:55 and you're like well again i'm not like
43:58 anyone else
43:59 and therefore if i'm not like them
44:01 there's always things that i wouldn't do
44:03 that they do
44:06 one of the big things is um that people
44:09 have a problem with and i understand it
44:11 but i'm gonna tell you a little story
44:12 that i think i've told one time in my
44:14 life on this show
44:17 but it's the whole thing about um name
44:19 calling
44:20 trump's a big name caller
44:24 but he does have his rule his rule is
44:28 once i think you're against this country
44:31 or a liar or a treasonistic person which
44:34 is all the same thing
44:37 i'm gonna name call you i'm gonna give
44:38 you a little nickname and i'm gonna
44:39 destroy you
44:41 yeah it could be a lot worse could be a
44:43 lot worse but i'm just gonna call you a
44:44 little name i'm gonna make sure
44:46 and the name is gonna kind of highlight
44:48 one of your features
44:50 that isn't very good
44:53 and typically you know it highlights
44:56 your behavior with trump right
44:58 sleepy joe has to do with the fact he's
45:00 suffering from dementia
45:02 right bernie's the socialist
45:05 warren's the liar you know i mean it
45:07 just goes on on pocahontas because she's
45:08 a liar
45:09 there's an episode that probably will
45:10 come up for this one that addresses her
45:12 issue in detail but now here's my
45:16 personal experience with my game company
45:20 i'll try to make this fairly quick i had
45:22 two coders working for me that were
45:24 doing an amazing job they just finished
45:25 a
45:26 project and just did an amazing job we
45:29 got a lot of money for the project
45:31 and they they were capable of doing the
45:33 project
45:35 and letting us keep 75 percent of the
45:37 project and it was nearly a million
45:38 dollar project
45:40 so that's good right so what did i do
45:43 i rewarded them by giving them one
45:47 while they were doing the project 20 000
45:49 a piece a month
45:51 40 grand out of our pocket but they were
45:52 doing so well
45:54 i said you know the quality is really
45:55 high now our cto had to go in and fix
45:58 one of their things but
45:59 still some of the best employees i've
46:01 ever had in my life
46:03 so after they were done i said take a
46:05 month off and i'll give you another 20 a
46:07 piece
46:08 40k out of our bank sounds pretty uh
46:11 pretty
46:11 understanding and nice right and trying
46:13 to be a cool guy
46:15 now i had been soliciting my partners to
46:18 create a generic
46:19 fighting engine
46:22 that had we done it we would have
46:24 collected a
46:25 uh about a 400 million dollar
46:29 paycheck at the end because my buddy
46:31 from ea went and created the same engine
46:32 and that's what he cashed his company
46:34 out for
46:37 i think i think that's the number tens
46:40 of millions if it was anything less
46:43 anyway so i said you guys want to uh
46:46 we call it project z i said do you want
46:49 to work on project z
46:50 this is what it is i think you guys are
46:52 perfect for it and
46:54 we'll keep your pay the same we had a
46:57 lot of money in the bank okay
47:00 they said great this is awesome we're
47:02 gonna kick its ass send over the design
47:04 send it over i mean it's
47:07 it was already like i don't know 50
47:10 fighting engines out there all he had to
47:11 do was like copy what was out there but
47:13 we had it all documented it was great
47:14 so a month goes by now the way that
47:17 coders work in the professional world in
47:18 case you don't know is they write code
47:20 and there's a central repository online
47:23 that they have to check their code into
47:25 every single month or every day usually
47:28 and they share the code you know they
47:29 check in
47:30 out files just like a library
47:33 and so if they don't work we can tell
47:35 and if they work we can tell so a month
47:38 goes by
47:39 and there's not a single stub checked
47:41 into this
47:42 code which means nothing has been
47:44 written so you know it's not uncommon
47:46 for the very first
47:47 kernel of code not to get checked in
47:48 until much much later in the project so
47:50 we were just like
47:52 hey guys uh it's time for you to get
47:53 paid
47:55 can you check your code nothing
47:59 hmm okay so
48:03 this is about a week before their payday
48:05 was going to end on that on the month
48:07 i think we were paying them once a month
48:09 it's a giant
48:10 giant lump of cash and they had probably
48:12 each one of them had 100k in the bank
48:14 over the last six months
48:16 but anyway um
48:20 were holding the check back just just
48:21 assuming it would be no problem these
48:22 guys had never let us down well
48:24 fast forward they demanded their
48:27 paycheck and they weren't going to work
48:28 on the project anymore
48:30 unless we paid them and i was like hey
48:32 it's cool man just check in your code so
48:33 we can see what we got for the first 20
48:36 and there was nothing and they hadn't
48:37 done anything one of the guys called me
48:40 up crying on his phone
48:41 a grown man crying on the phone
48:43 apologizing for scurrying up he's going
48:44 to make it up to me
48:46 it's like okay well you definitely can't
48:48 get the paycheck now but i'm with you i
48:49 understand [ __ ] happens it's cool
48:52 i mean had he continued to call me and
48:54 we would have probably worked out a
48:56 little stipend to keep him on you know a
48:57 5k or something to keep him alive or
48:59 whatever maybe even just deduct it from
49:00 the next paycheck or whatever
49:02 right i'm a fair dude one guy kind of
49:05 went quiet
49:07 and then over the next week they called
49:09 and then said they were going to sue us
49:10 for the money
49:12 so i was like ooh the only thing that
49:15 pisses me off in this entire world
49:17 unanimously is [ __ ] the team
49:19 you do that um i'll give you a chance to
49:22 talk
49:23 but if you don't say the right words you
49:25 are out
49:26 loyalty is big you know in a project
49:28 okay
49:30 so my partners i wrote an email and that
49:32 partner said well
49:33 let us see it first i said okay
49:36 so i sent it to him and it was pretty
49:38 harsh not a lot of dirty words or
49:40 anything that's unprofessional but i'm
49:41 definitely very stern with them
49:44 you know saying you didn't check in your
49:45 code what are you gonna sue me for you
49:47 know this is ridiculous
49:48 at this point you're really taking up my
49:50 time so
49:51 you might be able to expect some counter
49:53 suing here
49:55 all right my partner said oh that's way
49:58 too
49:59 way too confrontational and they they
50:01 pussified the email and said please send
50:03 this out i'm like this is not going to
50:04 work
50:05 oh you know we'll just give it a try all
50:07 right whatever
50:08 i'm just one guy i need to you know
50:10 respect my partner's judgment maybe
50:12 they're right
50:13 i knew they were wrong send it out there
50:16 now
50:17 it comes back even deeper telling us
50:19 exactly how they're going to sue us and
50:21 all this other stuff
50:23 so say hey dudes we need to send that
50:24 original email i sent
50:26 nah let's try another one and they wrote
50:27 one and i sent it out
50:30 they just dug in deeper and so i said
50:33 okay
50:34 guys this whole wimpified way of dealing
50:38 with criminals
50:39 is not gonna work you gotta deal with
50:41 them on their level they don't
50:42 understand this
50:44 you're showing weakness and that
50:45 weakness is being turned into more and
50:47 more
50:47 suing so i finally wrote my email
50:52 one guy immediately jumped dropped
50:54 completely out the guy was in his 40s he
50:56 was smart
50:57 it was really so sad too because i loved
50:59 what they did and
51:00 the guy he dropped out was like a og
51:03 coder made so good and i was so just
51:05 shocked
51:06 that this was even happening but the
51:08 younger kid
51:09 in his early thirties uh he he held to
51:12 it
51:13 he said he's gonna go to the labor board
51:15 and say that he had completed work and
51:16 that we weren't paying him for his work
51:18 i'm sitting there going dude one you
51:20 called me and cried and left the
51:21 voicemail which i have on record
51:23 recorder two you didn't check in any
51:26 code
51:27 i i repitched it to them each email i
51:29 sent i said look you check in that code
51:31 and show me i don't care if you write it
51:32 tonight
51:33 but show me a month's worth of progress
51:36 even conceptual modeling of the code
51:38 and we'll talk again [ __ ] happens you
51:41 need another month off you need two
51:43 months off
51:43 that's all you need to say is like man
51:45 we're really just wiped out from that
51:46 project
51:47 maybe give us 10 a piece you know i
51:49 probably would have done it
51:51 i probably would have flown them up or
51:53 flown them down to where i am to have a
51:54 good meeting to kind of
51:55 further blow out the code and get them
51:57 excited but i we couldn't work that out
52:00 so this kid takes me all the way to the
52:02 labor board in los
52:03 angeles we spent 7 500 on an attorney
52:07 to do a big background check on this kid
52:08 he was involved a bunch of weird
52:10 projects that went south and
52:12 just just a bunch of stuff turns out the
52:16 kid spent his last dollar to buy his
52:18 plane ticket
52:19 down to us now he had blown all the
52:21 money he got from me
52:23 and every time i see that i think
52:25 someone's got a drug habit problem
52:28 so my attorney partner just decided
52:32 i'm gonna call this guy so much
52:33 someone's gonna answer the phone
52:35 and boy were her instincts right
52:39 his girlfriend answered the phone and
52:41 just went yep here he is boom
52:42 and gave the phone to him and uh
52:47 he had said that he had gotten really
52:48 sick and all this other stuff now we had
52:50 found out
52:51 he's like i think he even admitted he
52:54 had a cocaine habit
52:56 so his girlfriend and her kid should
52:58 have been rolling in the cash they could
53:00 have nearly bought a house well they
53:01 should have been able to put the down
53:02 payment and probably pay off the first
53:04 third of the house
53:05 at least first fourth of the house with
53:07 the money we gave him
53:09 all gone he comes to labor board and we
53:12 had an arbitrator
53:13 that's how it works this woman
53:16 she read the case before she walked in
53:18 the room she sits down
53:19 he's on the right we're on the left i
53:21 wasn't there
53:22 but my cto my attorney and my uh
53:25 my my attorney and there and the one we
53:28 hired
53:28 was there the kid starts yapping as i
53:31 heard the story
53:32 and the labor board lady says you've
53:34 already lost
53:36 so i don't want to hear any more out of
53:37 you
53:39 what do you want from this side and
53:43 obviously knowing we can't squeeze the
53:44 guy for anything we're not trying to
53:46 hurt his life any more than it's already
53:47 hurting
53:48 we just like we just want this dismissed
53:50 that's all
53:52 so she dismissed it and the kid tried to
53:55 talk again pissed her off
53:57 she didn't she there's nothing she can
53:58 do she just told him to be quiet
54:00 turns out this kid had no money to get
54:02 home he thought he was going to get a
54:04 big 20 000
54:05 check from us and then buy a ticket at
54:07 the airport and fly home i'm not sure
54:10 how you got home
54:12 now why do i tell you that story in the
54:13 midst of all this name calling stuff
54:14 that trump does
54:18 when you have career politicians that
54:20 have been in there forever and they have
54:21 gotten away with
54:23 so much so much criminality
54:27 you know somehow pelosi's worth 200
54:29 million dollars but she's only earned
54:30 eight as a senator
54:34 she admits to going to pyongyang and
54:36 trafficking guns with the cia
54:38 on video that's that's pretty awesome
54:41 biden who touches all the kids in the
54:43 world
54:43 i mean on camera and what's he do when
54:45 he's not on camera you know maybe he
54:46 does nothing else but what he's done on
54:48 the camera boy i wouldn't let him around
54:51 my kids
54:53 on and on down the line again elizabeth
54:56 warren stole
54:58 uh i mean as i've had the numbers
55:00 relayed to me 420 000
55:02 a year at harvard university for 10
55:03 years running under the auspices
55:05 that she was native american thus
55:08 stealing that money
55:08 from another qualified native american
55:12 and then on and on and on down the line
55:13 making up all these rumors about uh
55:15 pregnancy discrimination which does
55:16 exist but she didn't incur it
55:20 she's a liar so what do you got for
55:23 liars
55:24 a bunch of soft spoken words
55:27 no if you do that they sense weakness
55:30 and they will continue to pound on your
55:32 door they can they can
55:34 get their way well imagine you're trying
55:37 to run a country that's been
55:38 [ __ ] over since jfk was killed
55:42 you're trying to fix a mountain of
55:45 problems with a layer of dust on it
55:47 thick enough to
55:48 you know choke an elephant
55:51 you really need distractions by people
55:54 that are lying their asses off
55:55 especially having to run against them
55:57 for a presidential election you think
55:59 that he should be going well you know
56:02 warren i hope she does well and no
56:05 grow up this is a
56:09 grown-up world not a little kitty world
56:12 anymore
56:14 and you know again let's just run some
56:16 statistics in the brain here
56:18 you act like [ __ ] to these people
56:20 they will knock you out of your position
56:22 take control again roll the whole thing
56:25 up into a globalist
56:27 thing part of gender 21 is a crash world
56:30 economy and bring everybody down to
56:31 third world level it's in their
56:32 documentation
56:33 how how do you want to live your life
56:35 right
56:37 the one guy that we've had in office
56:40 since kennedy
56:41 who's doing kennedy-esque things and a
56:43 whole lot more you want to really take a
56:45 [ __ ] on that guy and make sure that he
56:46 can't do his mission
56:48 [ __ ] you and on all that [ __ ] right
56:51 just
56:51 take donald for what he's trying to do
56:54 it's definitely going to take more than
56:55 four years
56:56 that's going gonna take more than eight
56:57 years so he's got to set this place up
57:00 and lock it down in a way
57:01 that being greedy and being a criminal
57:05 is not rewarded now he's gonna have to
57:08 do some evolutionary steps because he
57:10 had to get reelected in order to get his
57:12 last four years
57:14 let's hope he can pull it off because if
57:15 we go to the other side oh my god was it
57:18 gonna be [ __ ] buying he's gonna die
57:19 in six months into the job and he's
57:20 gonna hand it over to [ __ ] hillary
57:22 clinton
57:23 or whoever else michael obama really
57:27 sorry michelle obama i didn't mean to
57:29 make that mistake that obama made twice
57:31 on camera
57:33 i'm willing to listen to anyone's story
57:36 anyone's belief system anyone's
57:38 criticism and quite frankly you could
57:40 probably change my mind
57:42 about generally anything but you're
57:44 gonna have to really bring
57:45 the substance right let's say that you
57:48 believe we didn't go to the moon because
57:49 of all the things i've discussed on the
57:51 show and a bunch of things that you
57:52 believe that i haven't even heard of yet
57:55 all right we didn't go now
57:58 if someone's going to sit you down at
57:59 nasa and say okay
58:02 mr misses whatever we did go
58:06 okay all right well um i'm i'm all ears
58:09 man
58:10 let's let's go through all the math
58:12 let's go on you know how does a rocket
58:13 work in space pushing up nothing
58:15 let's go through everything how'd the
58:17 slingshot theory work how did those
58:18 suits work how's the temperature problem
58:20 work on
58:22 and on and on they're going to have to
58:23 really bring the substance right
58:26 well the same thing goes and should go
58:28 for everything else you're willing to
58:30 believe
58:31 now for some of these criminals it's
58:33 easy because some of them are just right
58:34 in your face
58:35 your source is right in your face man
58:38 right in your face i know he says he's a
58:39 jewish guy
58:41 they said he you know i heard a
58:42 recording of him talking about turning
58:44 in the jews when he was a kid during
58:45 world war
58:46 ii he's yeah i guess he's old enough to
58:50 pull it out
58:50 he's almost 90 years old at this point
58:53 but uh he looks german to me i'm just
58:57 gonna tell you
58:57 i've said it if he's jewish he must be
58:59 ashkenazi jew i don't know what
59:01 what his thing is but he the older he
59:03 gets he looks like some of the people in
59:04 the [ __ ] nuremberg trials
59:07 okay so maybe he's jewish whatever i
59:08 don't think he is
59:10 but it's like um any any
59:14 conspiracy needs to have some substance
59:16 and again
59:18 what i think is fascinating is this with
59:20 the the trump
59:22 bashing [ __ ] that goes on
59:26 you have got an intelligence agency two
59:29 of them
59:30 that during his election tried to get
59:32 all the dirt on this guy and they
59:33 possibly could and guess what they had
59:34 to do
59:35 they had to write a fake dossier with a
59:38 bunch of fake stuff in it which now
59:39 they've had they've been caught with
59:40 their pants down
59:42 they even surveyed his entire campaign
59:45 ease dropping on him
59:47 reading all of his emails da da still
59:49 couldn't find anything
59:50 the only thing i ever heard that he was
59:52 involved in that was controversial
59:54 besides the school that went under
59:57 was that uh during one of the
59:58 construction projects in in new york in
60:00 the 80s
60:01 he hired a polish company that had a
60:04 bunch of construction workers
60:06 and he asked them if they were legal and
60:09 they said um
60:11 yeah sure they're all legal and they
60:13 weren't not all of them were legal
60:15 and so like we didn't have the internet
60:17 we didn't have like interpol over here
60:18 to check everybody's background and make
60:20 sure
60:20 so you gotta shake a hand at some point
60:22 get [ __ ] done
60:24 okay what i didn't hear as
60:27 any rumors of trump having people killed
60:29 to get his buildings
60:31 um passing code or passing certification
60:35 or to get people out of their apartments
60:37 you know
60:39 you know i recently read a story that
60:41 had a woman who
60:43 was working for trump a black woman who
60:46 ended up getting
60:47 involved with drugs and she ended up
60:48 tanking really bad at work and she was
60:50 about to get fired into her
60:52 credit she just totally coughed it up
60:54 one day to her her manager
60:57 and said you know what i'm i'm just
60:59 hooked on drugs and
61:01 it's destroying my life i don't even
61:02 know what to do but if you fire me
61:05 i'm gonna be on the streets so this gets
61:08 escalated up to trump
61:10 and trump just said okay stuff happens
61:14 what do you need i have a bunch of
61:16 places i can send you
61:18 he sent her to go get rehabilitated she
61:20 did
61:21 she followed all the advice today she's
61:24 drug free
61:25 i think it's 20 years now she's been
61:27 drug free from this thing and she saved
61:28 her life from that whole thing
61:30 but supposedly he's a massive racist
61:32 right
61:34 i think trump in the united states of
61:35 america is one of the single
61:38 biggest employers of a founding member
61:40 company name right so
61:42 for instance um tim coke inherited
61:46 apple so he's not the founding member of
61:48 the company sam walton is dead
61:50 so trump is the founder of trump
61:52 enterprises right or whatever he calls
61:53 his company
61:56 pick any race i bet trump is at the
61:58 tippy top if not
62:00 the top employer of any race you want to
62:03 pick on planet earth
62:04 in this country you know say maybe some
62:07 you know aborigines or something
62:09 but the dude has been you know good to
62:11 his people like crazy and they say it
62:14 so okay you've got you've got democrats
62:18 that were so desperate to get [ __ ] on
62:19 trump
62:20 that you know radio stations called in
62:22 and faked to uh what does it
62:24 um shift that they had dirt on trump and
62:27 he was willing to listen to it
62:28 it's like that's how desperate they are
62:30 because they have nothing on the guy
62:31 so a random dude on the internet
62:34 who calls trump a bunch of [ __ ] names
62:37 is somehow got more intel on trump than
62:39 all these
62:40 uh you know intelligence agencies that
62:42 are being able to look at every time he
62:43 takes a crap
62:45 wow you're good man you need to go work
62:47 for the intelligence to go work for the
62:48 democrats
62:49 totally tell them you got it all figured
62:51 out man bring all your paperwork and
62:53 your real dossier
62:54 and all this other stuff and they will
62:56 they will reward you beyond your wildest
62:58 dreams trust me
63:00 you'll sell out all your countrymen
63:01 you'll sell out the entire [ __ ]
63:03 planet to do it
63:04 but you will be so celebrated by the
63:06 globalists
63:07 because you have it all figured out man
63:09 a [ __ ] meme has it all figured out
63:11 for you
63:12 don't be that guy don't be that girl
63:16 we have a chance to reset things and
63:18 remember
63:19 more powerful than any one person is an
63:22 idea
63:24 the idea of freedom is now spreading
63:26 across the world
63:28 i know china is trying to say
63:29 everything's cool and communism rules
63:32 but i guarantee you there are more
63:33 people in china right now
63:35 questioning their government than ever
63:38 in their history
63:39 except maybe when mao got everybody
63:40 killed but it is at a peak right now
63:43 absolute peak the paris protesters you
63:46 know they're all kind of locked in right
63:48 now but
63:49 they defied and went back out after the
63:51 first quarantine but you know france
63:52 still has their borders open so i don't
63:54 know how they're going to keep everybody
63:55 inside
63:57 they've smelled an idea probably not the
64:01 same one that we have over here
64:02 or where you have your dream where you
64:04 are but it's still
64:06 sort of the same thing let's all prosper
64:07 shouldn't we or shall we right
64:10 i think you feel me
64:13 anyway i feel compelled to put this one
64:15 out it sort of addresses
64:18 five years of comments five years of
64:20 this assertion
64:21 and probably ten years before the show
64:23 ever started the stuff i had to read
64:27 we all want the same thing in general
64:30 right
64:32 i'm not that impressionable in this
64:34 world and boy if you want to change my
64:36 mind you got to bring the goods
64:38 and so reverse engineer that statement
64:41 to the point that the belief systems i
64:42 have are based on some
64:44 shallow wishful thinking
64:48 if i ever see personally okay
64:52 trump doing something overtly globalist
64:55 overtly against the american dream
64:58 overtly against his promises
65:00 i'll make an episode immediately and
65:02 rush that thing out the front door
65:05 guarantee it my frustrations right now
65:09 make it really simple the cue thing is
65:11 just really [ __ ] annoying okay
65:13 i hope everything they're saying about
65:15 on a-chan about this blackout with this
65:17 virus is a hundred percent true because
65:19 all these arrests are happening and no
65:20 no
65:21 i don't want anyone to have the record
65:24 that some of these
65:25 posts suggest right i don't want tom
65:27 hanks to be a bad guy i don't want
65:28 anyone else to be a bad guy i hope it's
65:30 all
65:31 i hope those couple rumors are untrue i
65:33 don't want anyone to be like that but if
65:36 they are
65:36 they gotta face the consequences right
65:39 now the other big thing
65:40 it's really only one other thing at this
65:42 point
65:44 is that the two-tier justice system
65:48 is currently being enforced a bunch of
65:51 people are free
65:52 who are up on charges and they shouldn't
65:55 be free
65:56 but again as president of the united
65:58 states you can only
65:59 ask departments to do the right thing if
66:02 they refuse to do
66:04 it i don't know what power any one of us
66:05 have let's say you become the president
66:07 united states and you say look
66:08 department of justice don't we have
66:10 enough evidence to put that person in
66:12 jail
66:13 and if they come back and say yeah maybe
66:16 well
66:16 i don't know we're not going to waste 50
66:18 million dollars trying to try to put
66:19 this person away we can spend the money
66:21 better
66:22 what do you think president maybe it
66:23 cost 100 million dollars to put someone
66:24 like hillary clinton in jew
66:26 and so they have to make that decision
66:30 i think most people would raise their
66:31 hand and say yes
66:33 but you know we have a bunch of hearsay
66:36 you know
66:37 i do want to make a a statement here
66:39 because when i was doing the uh
66:40 corona 1918 episode
66:44 in the corona series i've been passing
66:45 what has been the hearsay on the
66:47 internet but hopefully qualifying it to
66:49 you enough that
66:50 i don't necessarily believe it's true
66:52 and you shouldn't necessarily believe
66:53 it's true either
66:54 i wanted to highlight things so that you
66:56 guys could have it in your brain in case
66:58 it does happen
67:00 but then at the end of the episode i
67:01 said hey let's when i ask you for your
67:03 personal experiences with the virus
67:05 let's not use hearsay
67:07 so the difference there is when you talk
67:09 about what's going on in your world you
67:11 want to have very
67:12 very literal streamlined
67:16 pieces of evidence and not hearsay when
67:18 it comes to what you're experiencing in
67:20 your country
67:21 in terms of what is the floating around
67:22 the internet that's always going to be
67:24 your say
67:25 it just will so anyway hope you feel me
67:28 with this
67:29 if you haven't been to
67:30 deepthoughtsvideo.com please go short
67:32 bumper today
