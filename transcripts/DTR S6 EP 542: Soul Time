00:11 [Music]
00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen
00:37 on today's episode i'm going to smoke
00:40 this awesome maker's mark dipstick my
00:43 dad sent me here so i wanted to film it
00:45 so he could see it
00:47 because it's been a while since i've had
00:48 one of these and i love these things but
00:50 they're usually kind of expensive
00:52 and the guy i go to doesn't sell them
00:56 let me get this thing undone here
00:59 oh oh that smells delicious
01:02 i could just chew on this thing like a
01:04 piece of beef jerky
01:07 now today we're gonna have a discussion
01:10 about time
01:13 oh my god this thing is so perfect
01:16 you get sticks and tubes they always
01:19 stay
01:19 just so fresh and supple
01:23 if you can describe a cigar like the
01:26 kind of person you'd want to be with for
01:27 the rest of your life
01:28 it's a good steak
01:39 um
01:42 holy cow that's nice
01:47 wow the brand is uh
01:53 just says the bourbon cigar
01:56 helicopter's out tonight so we'll see
01:58 where he's going there
02:00 i think they just like to watch the show
02:02 from above
02:04 so we've talked about time in many
02:06 capacities on this show
02:08 there's even a time travel episode a
02:10 time management episode an
02:12 end of times episode why because i just
02:14 looked those all up and i remember them
02:19 big old mouthful of maker's mark so good
02:23 here's what i want to cover on this show
02:26 here's your hook how many of you have
02:29 contemplated for a split second in your
02:31 life
02:33 winning the lottery or making it big
02:36 but you make it big instantaneously not
02:38 some long drawn out thing
02:41 and right away the blissful wishful
02:44 thinking that we get out of that
02:46 simulation in our mind if we don't
02:47 actually experience it raise your hand
02:49 if you have
02:51 is that you have lived your entire life
02:54 up to that
02:55 moment in time of making it big
02:58 worrying about your bills worrying about
03:01 your retirement
03:02 worry about paying your kids tuition
03:05 perhaps a nice wedding
03:07 being able to take care of your family
03:09 that's getting older
03:11 and suddenly at the stroke of a
03:14 lottery ticket or some contract you sign
03:17 and some
03:18 royalty check coming in you no longer
03:20 for the rest of your life have to worry
03:22 about that
03:23 constraining thing which is all
03:27 consuming when you have the normal
03:30 burden
03:31 of paying bills and living a life that
03:34 you think you
03:36 can tolerate let alone deserve
03:40 okay so let's replace money
03:43 with time as the helicopter comes around
03:47 another time what if
03:51 there was a transformation or a
03:54 transcending moment
03:56 where you no longer have to worry about
03:58 time
04:00 to accomplish what you can accomplish in
04:02 the form that you might be in
04:05 i think if you're a habitual listener of
04:07 the show you will know my opinion about
04:10 many of the things that will be
04:11 expressed at least in the first
04:13 30 minutes of this episode what i'm
04:15 going to do is advance that
04:17 to make sure you understand sort of my
04:20 approach towards
04:23 the time when we don't have time to
04:26 worry about it all now when you need
04:28 bills paid
04:29 you think about money you think about
04:32 holding cash in your hand or a credit
04:34 card or you think about a bank account
04:36 but if you won a lottery and you hooked
04:38 up all your stuff to auto pay and you
04:39 got an account and you just said look
04:41 i never want to see a bill again that's
04:43 why you can take money out of my account
04:45 to pay yourself this salary be careful
04:48 doing that of course
04:49 we'll take all your money don't ever let
04:51 anyone really manage all your money
04:54 not even relatives but put governors on
04:57 how much they can take out and
04:59 if they could take it out without your
05:00 consent now if you're getting sold you
05:02 don't even know you're alive then
05:03 go the next person that you trust and
05:05 imbue them with that power
05:06 but be careful in those scenarios too
05:09 but here's my platform for this
05:12 episode if you can hear my voice
05:17 i assume that your human being living in
05:19 a temporary vessel
05:22 and death is something that we can't
05:25 escape but even the word death
05:28 is a misnomer it is a
05:32 misdirection of actually what's
05:34 occurring
05:36 because in my opinion death is birth
05:40 but as a human being do we ever get a
05:42 moment in our existence where
05:46 money and time is not even an issue
05:50 and the answer is yes the answer is yes
05:54 because it goes like this
05:56 when you lay your head down at night if
05:58 you are prone to dream
06:00 even it's just once a year or like a lot
06:03 of us
06:04 every night when you're in your dream
06:08 i'm willing to bet that 99.9 of the time
06:13 you have no concept of time and you have
06:15 no concept
06:16 of money and what i mean by no concept
06:19 of time
06:20 is that you no longer worry about time
06:24 it's not a subject that's in your
06:27 midst when you're dreaming isn't that
06:30 interesting
06:30 i mean i dream sagas every night you
06:33 guys are probably
06:34 tired of me telling you that it almost
06:35 sounds like i'm boasting it's just
06:37 the facts the only time i have a
06:41 reference to time well it's going to get
06:42 all loopy isn't it is if i have to go
06:45 the restroom
06:46 and i get up and i have to do that thing
06:48 and then i go back to bed
06:49 or i just roll over and i realize oh and
06:52 it's still black outside which means
06:55 i got several hours to go before i have
06:57 to physically get up
06:58 to do my work that if i go back to sleep
07:01 and fall back in that dream
07:02 all those constraints are over when i
07:05 think about this blissful transformation
07:07 in the lottery ticket thing when it
07:09 comes to money
07:10 money money money money oh my god where
07:12 am i making more where am i going to be
07:14 able to make more
07:15 am i putting enough away if i don't have
07:17 any money at the moment of retirement
07:18 where the hell am i going to live
07:20 those are real life things we got to
07:22 deal with
07:24 you can understand it as a kid because
07:25 you have to get off your butt at some
07:27 point move out of your parents house and
07:28 go do what you got to do with your life
07:30 and without any
07:31 pressure help kids would live in their
07:35 bedroom they grew up in their whole life
07:36 they probably bring their spouse in
07:38 there
07:39 so there's logic to that the world used
07:42 to be a little bit different when you
07:43 got older you live with your
07:44 your younger kids try not to be a pain
07:48 in the butt
07:49 and you move on now i'm
07:53 i guess you could say you know it's
07:54 funny when you answer the question and
07:55 someone will say are you religious
07:58 and you see i'm not very religious but
07:59 i'm pretty spiritual oh yeah me too
08:02 get those kind of conversations right
08:05 i am spiritual and almost a literal form
08:09 i believe in spirits
08:13 what kind of spirits am i believing in
08:16 through a chain
08:17 of probably hundreds of micro events and
08:19 probably half a dozen major events
08:23 i believe in spirits i think i've
08:26 well i know i've interacted with a
08:28 couple
08:29 who were past who came back and so for
08:33 me
08:33 that world is very very real and
08:37 there's nothing that could pry it out of
08:38 me besides the lobotomy
08:42 now there's also spirituality with which
08:44 i've chosen to believe
08:47 and i've chosen to believe it from what
08:49 i believe to be a logic ecosystem
08:52 of our souls i've articulated about it
08:55 several times on the show
08:57 we're going to put it all in one episode
08:58 here
09:00 because there's the basics of that
09:01 ecosystem which i'm going to refresh you
09:03 on
09:04 in terms of my belief okay and then
09:08 we'll go from there now we typically
09:11 will say that in this matter-based world
09:14 that we physically interact with and of
09:16 which we have defined as reality
09:18 right that's the first first thing we
09:20 have to do is say this is reality and
09:22 everything else isn't
09:23 well we have our five senses
09:27 that we use to acknowledge any sort of
09:29 action or event that's occurring in our
09:30 life
09:31 and then we have scientific equipment
09:34 which
09:35 we'll look at concussive waves of energy
09:39 like sound we look for electrons
09:43 we look for really any disturbance in
09:47 electromagnetic fields
09:49 and that's reality that's what
09:50 scientists think about and what's funny
09:53 is i don't think scientists have taken
09:55 inventory of
09:56 gee we haven't created a new form of
09:58 sensing something in a very very long
10:00 time
10:01 so they are actually pretty [ __ ] in
10:04 their thinking
10:05 in terms of being held back and being
10:07 slower in their development in those
10:09 regions
10:11 and perhaps there's an area of science
10:12 that i'm unaware of where they actually
10:14 are trying to do this please enlighten
10:16 me if you know of anything
10:17 but i have not heard of a new invention
10:19 that senses
10:21 anything more than spectrums of light
10:24 spectrums of sound
10:26 and spectrums of electromagnetic
10:28 interference
10:29 which then can deduce subatomic
10:32 particles and other things
10:34 pretty much that's it supernatural oh
10:37 man
10:38 and less supernatural involves one of
10:41 those three metrics
10:43 well it's just in your imagination isn't
10:45 it
10:46 and of course your imagination isn't
10:48 real right
10:50 if you're a writer of either music or
10:53 story
10:54 you will know that imagination is
10:56 extremely real
10:57 the only difference is that you pull it
10:59 out of this undetectable
11:01 thing called your mind and you put it
11:04 down in a medium which can be either
11:06 listened to or read or seen or
11:07 experienced or all the above
11:10 the more you open your mind and get
11:12 creative
11:13 it's a muscle what are you good at the
11:15 stuff that you do all the time
11:17 the more you allow yourself to be
11:18 creative the more
11:20 it would seem that the spectrum of what
11:23 you can sense
11:24 expands unlike pop science which is
11:29 locked
11:29 in these coveted
11:33 brain dead brain numbing
11:36 areas of science meaning it's good
11:40 at what we've discovered it's not a bad
11:42 thing what we've discovered but come on
11:43 guys
11:44 it's a few more frontiers out there i
11:47 believe that
11:49 for at least a few generations this
11:52 doesn't always have to be a family
11:53 oriented thing but we're going to do
11:54 with family first
11:56 as soon as you transcend to the other
11:58 side there's obviously going to be
12:01 an existence on the other side that
12:04 facilitates these spiritual experiences
12:06 that thus
12:07 that us humans have had with various
12:09 folks that have already passed
12:11 but the question starts at that point
12:15 once you transcend obviously time won't
12:18 be a relevant thing
12:19 that you need to worry about because
12:20 your soul cannot be destroyed
12:22 period it can't the collection of energy
12:26 of whatever that is not probably
12:28 anything that we use in this world to
12:30 run a circuit
12:31 it can't be destroyed you can't hide
12:33 energy in the universe and you can hide
12:35 something in a container
12:37 you can move it around so the person
12:38 looking for it can't particularly find
12:40 it on that day
12:41 but it still exists we all have these
12:44 visions of heaven
12:45 but they're very remedial because we
12:48 really can't conceive of such a place
12:50 heaven is usually described with verbs
12:52 of
12:53 or sorry adjectives of emotion it's a
12:56 good place it's a fun place it's a happy
12:58 place
13:00 okay i wouldn't argue i don't know if it
13:03 has all the other emotions that are
13:05 negative
13:06 sadness and cathartic feelings and the
13:09 clint feelings and all that kind of
13:10 stuff don't know
13:12 be interesting if you never had those
13:13 emotions again could you really
13:15 appreciate any of the positive emotions
13:18 maybe so maybe it's like a drug trip you
13:20 never come down from
13:22 no withdrawals because you never come
13:24 down
13:25 my assumption is that you get
13:29 for all intents and purposes a
13:31 decompression phase where you
13:34 have now left a body
13:38 that potentially you could have lived in
13:39 for a hundred years
13:41 or even more well if your soul
13:45 is participating through your pineal
13:47 gland to create a mind
13:49 it uses your body to sense anything and
13:52 give you this
13:53 instance of life that you have which is
13:56 everything
13:57 because you don't have total access to
13:59 what you were
14:00 previously in some literal form meaning
14:02 you can't just
14:04 go i need to ask grandma a question but
14:06 she died 20 years ago
14:08 20 hey grandma hey what's up and you're
14:10 just going back up there in heaven
14:12 having a conversation you don't have
14:13 that access at least i don't have that
14:15 access
14:16 bless you if you do the uh
14:20 the sort of tongue-in-cheek thing is
14:23 that you do build up a bunch of
14:25 fantasies and desires of things you wish
14:28 you could have done when you were alive
14:30 in the particular instance you're in now
14:32 so when you pass
14:34 it might be kind of fun to think about
14:36 well you know i'm sure my dad
14:38 wants to meet elvis presley at some
14:40 point in his lifetime
14:42 well elvis is on the other side
14:45 is he still gonna want to do that after
14:47 he transcends or is that erased because
14:49 his relative
14:51 form of being has now transcended
14:54 he's in a much better place not that
14:56 this place was bad but he's in a much
14:58 better place
15:00 instead of going to a a big theater he
15:03 goes to a massive theater he gets to see
15:04 all his favorite movies again plus
15:06 everyone that's every movie that's ever
15:07 going to be made after he passed
15:09 gets to enjoy it but as a spirit
15:13 in a linear time format that's aligned
15:15 with our linear time format or is time
15:18 even a consideration of existence on the
15:20 other side
15:22 if one achieves immortality on the other
15:24 side or at least visits the
15:26 the always present immortality world on
15:30 the other side
15:31 then what does time matter but
15:34 the second that we try to say that a
15:36 spirit can interact with us in this
15:38 world which again i've experienced at
15:39 least
15:40 twice very vividly one with
15:43 three witnesses and one that i just
15:46 know that when my mom called and said
15:48 that her mother died i said yeah she
15:50 visited me that morning told me she was
15:51 on the other side and she was
15:52 she was in a great place okay
15:56 so obviously if a soul is going to
15:58 interact with you
15:59 in this world they're interacting from
16:01 whatever perspective they have
16:03 into our more constrained perspective on
16:05 this end
16:07 it is my hope that time is fairly
16:10 infinite on that side and that
16:12 they could run off and spend a thousand
16:14 years engaging all of their fantasies
16:17 they wanted to win a bodybuilding
16:19 contest they want a minute when a beauty
16:21 pageant they always wanted to be an
16:22 artist
16:23 a musician whatever whatever fantasies
16:25 you had meet people
16:26 i want to meet tesla and sit down and
16:28 have a really long conversation
16:30 he could smoke a pipe i'll smoke a cigar
16:34 but i still feel like if i need to come
16:35 back to earth and interact with say
16:38 my offspring or their offspring's
16:39 offspring or whatever
16:41 that i can still get back to their time
16:44 one of the greatest
16:45 analogies of time that i've had given to
16:49 me
16:49 which has been used by other people so i
16:51 know that a lot of you out there have
16:52 heard this
16:54 is god's perception of our life
16:58 if you take every year that you're alive
16:59 and you put it into a boxcar
17:01 on a train so whatever year you're in
17:04 you're in 1999 or 2021 or whatever
17:09 god can see all the cars of your entire
17:12 life he knows how long you're going to
17:14 live
17:14 and so if you live to be 101 you have
17:16 101 cars
17:19 so you stare down into the cars
17:22 or he stares under the car so you can
17:23 see everything you're going to do when
17:24 you're going to be upset when you'll be
17:25 happy
17:27 everything you're going to do and with
17:28 that analogy everyone is a bunch of box
17:30 cars
17:31 and their own personal custom train and
17:34 if you were so on the other side like
17:36 god
17:38 it's interesting we don't really talk
17:39 about god having or being a soul but
17:41 i guess he's the big og soul out there
17:43 you know
17:46 we could go off and mess around and
17:49 come back and the car's still there can
17:52 you go back to a car
17:54 that has already passed in the time
17:55 frame that
17:57 you were on earth meaning you let's say
18:00 you pass away
18:01 and you have a relative that was um
18:05 20 years younger let's say you die at
18:07 100 they're 80
18:09 but you really want to go back and maybe
18:12 influence them according to their wishes
18:16 which i think would probably be a rule
18:18 when they were 12
18:19 but they're already 80 when you die is
18:22 it possible to go back to the 12th car
18:26 and say hey you know they were making a
18:29 choice about their life and
18:31 you want to be there to influence them
18:33 the way that they told you when they
18:34 were 80 that they
18:35 either had a miracle moment where they
18:38 made the right decision and they
18:39 man they were so fortunate or maybe
18:43 they i wish they made a different
18:45 decision and you'll try to wean them
18:46 over to the decision that they wish they
18:48 had made because you can see it clearly
18:49 in your life too
18:50 yeah you probably shouldn't have done
18:51 that probably should have taken that
18:53 vaccine
18:55 i believe that the elders of my family
18:57 going up at least
18:59 one generation but probably maybe even
19:02 two generations
19:03 maybe more they're babysitting their
19:06 family line
19:09 at a minimum their family line why
19:12 because it's their bloodline
19:14 is it a narcissistic thing not at all
19:17 it's just that's my family soul blood
19:21 probably runs thicker than
19:22 human blood even if they're turning into
19:25 kind of a
19:26 person they're not really proud of
19:28 they're still going to be there to guide
19:29 them out of whatever
19:31 formative moments when they were young
19:32 that made them sort of a jerk
19:35 see if they can't repair them over time
19:37 i know plenty of people that were ornery
19:39 when they were young and they really
19:41 cooled off became amazing people later
19:43 in life
19:45 maybe there's a part to this game it's
19:47 something like that
19:49 now at the same time i also believe that
19:51 friends and friends who
19:52 become really your family when you get
19:54 older they also can do that
19:57 your best bud your bestie he or she can
20:00 come in and
20:01 help you doesn't mean you're going to
20:04 talk to them or see them in your mind's
20:05 eye
20:06 have a conversation with them or
20:07 anything like that but you just sort of
20:09 feel them
20:10 now the other layer i add is a romantic
20:12 layer
20:14 and i think a lot of people do this
20:18 is calling on your mentors
20:21 your mentors are in my spiritual world
20:25 are two different types of mentors you
20:27 will have mentors that you met
20:29 in this world as a human being and they
20:32 pass before you because
20:34 potentially they're much older than you
20:38 and maybe you even had a difficulty
20:42 explaining yourself to them at a
20:44 particular viewpoint
20:46 maybe you studied the red pill side of
20:48 things and they died with the blue pill
20:50 but the second they died transcended and
20:51 found the truth they found that the red
20:53 pill had a lot more truth in it than the
20:54 blue because that's the priority of the
20:56 red
20:56 is to find the truth regardless if it
20:58 hurts or not
21:01 so now they feel a little bit
21:02 embarrassed and they say oh gosh you
21:04 know that kid really did have his act
21:05 together
21:06 and uh here i was always contesting his
21:09 beliefs because i was too
21:11 good to see evil it wasn't a defect it
21:15 was a
21:17 attribute but now i need to i need to
21:20 help out and you know what there's a lot
21:22 of the world that needs to be fixed
21:24 and so you get that support
21:27 a friend of mine's mother died recently
21:30 and she was blessed to live
21:31 i think 95 but she was such a young 95
21:36 i'm telling you man i saw pictures of
21:37 this woman at 94
21:39 95 and she looked amazing so like she
21:42 was in her maybe
21:43 mid-60s early 70s but she was puerto
21:46 rican and she had that amazing blood
21:48 that just keeps you young man
21:50 but it was devastating to her daughter
21:53 she loved her mom and she's going
21:56 through that morning process right now
21:57 and i told her i said look
22:00 your mother understands you more now
22:01 than she ever did she gets to
22:03 participate with you more than she ever
22:04 did and your father passed away much
22:06 much
22:07 earlier than that he died very young
22:12 and now the two are together the two
22:14 soul mates are now mates again
22:16 potentially it just depends on how it
22:18 works on the other side right
22:21 so take homage that they will be there
22:24 to influence you
22:25 to love you to be with you of course you
22:29 miss them
22:30 because no matter how rich your
22:32 spiritual experience is
22:34 i'm yet to hear an experience that
22:35 anyone's had that lets you hug them
22:37 again
22:38 outside of a dream i think i told you
22:41 guys that um
22:42 several years ago i had a dream and it
22:45 was the most unique
22:47 dream of this kind i've ever had if you
22:49 remember the movie total recall the
22:51 sales pitch
22:52 to arnold schwarzenegger was uh
22:55 he was buying a virtual vacation because
22:57 in the future you just can't get away
23:00 and so there's all these wild you know
23:03 places you can go
23:04 and they'll implant those memories in
23:06 your mind and then you get to feel like
23:07 you have this vacation you get that
23:09 relief
23:11 but the sales pitch was well
23:14 how'd you like to buy an alter ego
23:18 and he goes what and he says well you
23:19 know what's the same thing in all your
23:20 vacations what's always the same in all
23:22 your vacations and he goes what
23:24 is you you're always the same he goes
23:27 why don't you want to don't you want to
23:28 go back as a rock star or a millionaire
23:30 or a secret agent and that's when
23:32 he goes yeah that one secret agent when
23:35 you dream
23:36 most of the time you're you i mean
23:39 at least the consciousness version of
23:42 yourself
23:44 you don't really think about age when
23:45 you get old when you get into a dream
23:47 excuse me when you get older that's
23:48 funny
23:49 yeah you you're just you
23:52 you're a soul in your dreams
23:55 dreams are a huge huge factor i think in
23:58 understanding the universes which is why
24:00 they're enforced on you
24:02 you must sleep and when you sleep
24:06 it just depends if you have dreams or
24:08 not
24:10 but i had this dream that i was a little
24:12 kid
24:13 and i was in this kitchen and my
24:15 grandmother my first grandmother passed
24:17 away because she was much older than my
24:18 other grandparents
24:20 i she was in the kitchen
24:24 and i haven't seen this woman since
24:26 1995.
24:27 in fact i haven't seen her physically
24:29 until probably 94-93 i can't remember
24:31 last time i saw her
24:33 i mean i remember the day i saw what
24:35 year it was
24:37 and i hugged her in my dream and i i
24:40 said to her i said grandma how are you
24:41 here
24:42 because you're not in my world and the
24:45 interesting thing was twofold
24:48 my mind was a child's mind
24:51 speaking in childish phrases that's how
24:54 i said it to her i said because in my
24:55 world you're not there
24:57 and the other thing was i could hear my
24:59 own voice
25:01 and unlike ever before or ever after
25:04 i had a little kid's voice and i was
25:07 just hugging my grandmother i always
25:08 wouldn't let her go
25:10 and she didn't say anything back to that
25:12 response just in case you're interested
25:14 but i just hung onto her tight and the
25:17 dream ended
25:18 there's a twilight zone with the the kid
25:22 from the corn episode
25:24 and the kid from lost in space i think
25:26 is his first episode the kid must have
25:28 been
25:30 five to seven somewhere in there i think
25:32 he might have been five
25:33 amazing little actor man but the
25:35 episode's about a grandmother that's in
25:37 love with their grandson
25:38 just loves him to death and she's sick
25:42 and the twilight zone is that she gives
25:44 them this toy telephone
25:46 for christmas and they used to pretend
25:49 that you know they're having phone calls
25:50 so he put the phone to his head and she
25:51 talked from the other side of the room
25:52 and they talk over the phone
25:54 and then she passes away fairly early in
25:56 the episode
25:58 and the twilight zone is that the kid
26:01 after she died wouldn't leave his
26:02 bedroom
26:04 but he wasn't unhappy and his mother
26:07 finally goes up to check on him and he's
26:10 talking to somebody on that telephone
26:13 and he hides it a couple times and then
26:16 i think he lets it slip that
26:17 grandma told him something on the
26:19 telephone and they think okay so the kid
26:22 is
26:22 is still disturbed from his
26:25 grandmother's death and so
26:26 because she talked to him on the
26:27 telephone when she's in the same room
26:28 he's just faking it
26:30 but then the mother runs over to the
26:32 telephone once and holds it up to her
26:34 ear and she hears her mother-in-law
26:36 talking on the other side
26:37 creepy as hell dude perfect right
26:40 but the other kind of mentor that you
26:42 might have is one that you never met
26:45 but one that you have studied
26:48 you have learned as much as you possibly
26:50 can
26:52 about this individual using history
26:55 books
26:56 and using perhaps the output of their
26:57 life
26:59 i have a friend who worships tesla
27:04 and i mean she knows tons about the guy
27:06 she's not a scientist or anything
27:08 so she doesn't understand the mechanics
27:10 and everything but she's just fascinated
27:11 with
27:12 the final products that he kept creating
27:14 the inventions
27:17 i am enamored with him as well but i
27:19 don't feel like i have any
27:21 real spiritual connection with the guy
27:24 there's just not that history available
27:28 for me personally to feel who he was as
27:30 a person besides a really good peaceful
27:32 wonderful soul
27:35 but there are two others that i
27:38 romanticize
27:39 in my profession and i try to call upon
27:43 them
27:43 to influence me when i'm directly in
27:47 what i'm doing now i will talk to them
27:49 outside of
27:51 any profession or doing my profession
27:53 but it's to prime them
27:55 for when i touch the keyboard to do the
27:58 right thing
27:59 writing movies i know it sounds silly
28:02 but we all have these little secrets
28:03 don't we
28:04 this is why i want to share this one
28:05 with you and it's just to illustrate
28:08 uh one how crazy i could be but two it
28:11 provides a platform for us to discuss
28:13 these things in a context
28:15 that may or may not
28:18 have a a reality in our life
28:23 but the two gentlemen that i have called
28:25 on and this probably started in the late
28:27 90s for me
28:29 was stanley kubrick and rod surly
28:33 and yes it was a really funny admission
28:35 to vivian when i said yeah i
28:37 talked to your dad and i've been talking
28:38 to him for years and she was like really
28:41 i said yeah she thought it was great uh
28:44 rod serling
28:45 is obviously the master writer of all
28:47 time
28:48 there are a lot of incredible master
28:50 writers but for me
28:52 what rob was able to accomplish in his
28:54 prolificness
28:55 and his perfection was astonishing
29:00 i once heard a um
29:03 was it jack klugman the guy played
29:06 quincy
29:08 he was interviewed in the late 90s he
29:10 had like larynx cancer or something
29:13 he had this really scratchy voice but he
29:14 said there was a scene
29:16 in one of the twilight zones where he
29:17 thought the dialogue was a little silly
29:20 and i think it was the episode where he
29:22 played a trumpeteer
29:24 who met gabriel the angel
29:28 but he said at one point the actor was
29:29 playing gabriel who also played
29:32 lincoln he looked like lincoln it was
29:33 crazy
29:35 they kind of thought the dialogue seemed
29:37 silly and they rod was on the set one
29:39 day
29:40 because apparently he was made a routine
29:42 of always watching his stuff get filmed
29:45 and he got rod pulled aside and both of
29:47 them are like hey do we really have to
29:49 say this dialogue i mean we could say
29:50 the same thing a little bit differently
29:52 and rod stressed with them he goes no no
29:54 he goes those words are really important
29:56 you have to say the words shakespeare
30:00 would have
30:01 slapped him across the face uh glugman
30:03 he would have slapped glug went across
30:04 the face like
30:06 you know speak the words that are spoken
30:07 for you and rob was right
30:10 rob picked his words very carefully he
30:13 knew how his words would be interpreted
30:15 over time
30:17 he knew that to make things really
30:19 modern
30:20 would disturb its playability for the
30:24 future
30:24 that's what i believe rob is also the
30:27 master of
30:29 hooks of payoffs of really
30:34 embedding inside of anything that he
30:36 wrote a deeper message
30:39 you know i do it on the show i sneak all
30:41 kinds of topics into other topics
30:44 one cross-pollinating you to other
30:46 episodes so you see more than just one
30:47 episode before you go away
30:49 but two to hit you as deep as i possibly
30:51 can to get your mind to
30:52 trigger i learned that from rod
30:56 i may have even subconsciously started
30:58 doing it before consciously realizing it
31:01 but when i write a film or design a film
31:04 first of course
31:06 i am thinking about every episode i ever
31:08 watched and even though other people
31:09 wrote fifty percent of the twilight
31:11 zones he wrote the first fifty
31:13 i'm thinking about all of them everyone
31:15 that he entrusted the charles beaumonts
31:17 the earl hammers
31:20 i trust them and i listen to their
31:22 voices and i try to say okay
31:24 and what's fascinating about it is
31:27 it works stanley kubrick is in the game
31:32 to help me express those ideas in a
31:35 visual format
31:36 to make sure that in camera it's going
31:39 to be not only
31:40 a fun story but it's also interesting at
31:42 the same time the words that i've chosen
31:44 to
31:45 to communicate to a reader is something
31:48 as valuable to see on a big screen
31:51 it's there do i always succeed
31:54 of course not but anytime i fail
31:57 that's when i blame myself anytime i
32:00 succeed
32:01 well i share the winnings in my opinion
32:04 it allows spirits to have sort of an nx
32:08 project on the side again
32:11 i told you guys way back in season one
32:13 my philosophy of the universe which is
32:15 that it invests in you
32:17 if you invest in it don't beg for a
32:20 guitar solo if you don't notice a
32:21 guitar don't beg for a movie unless you
32:25 start writing something down on paper
32:28 now i'm going to throw kind of an
32:29 esoteric thing at you
32:33 which is i believe that the digital
32:34 media potentially robs your interaction
32:37 with the universe
32:38 i know it sounds silly but imagine you
32:41 type a document into a computer
32:43 and it stored a bunch of bits on a hard
32:45 drive do you really want the spirits of
32:47 the universe to try and decipher
32:50 all the things you typed in someone has
32:51 to be over your shoulder every split
32:53 second a day so they can transcribe it
32:54 down so when you shut down your computer
32:56 or hit the screen saver
32:58 they remember what you wrote
33:01 that's why i've had profound success
33:03 being more analog
33:05 during the construction phase of a story
33:08 or pretty much anything in my life to be
33:10 honest making a video game
33:11 design get a pad and paper
33:14 get a pen or a pencil i always work with
33:16 pen myself
33:19 because pencil wears off after a while
33:23 and there it's on a page it's always
33:25 available to the matter based world
33:27 to peruse and if some spirit needed to
33:30 see what i wrote well they can just dial
33:31 away the other pages
33:32 and look at the one that's written down
33:34 no deciphering no binary translation to
33:36 ascii
33:37 it's right there i'm going to remind you
33:40 that a friend of mine's grandson
33:41 is a super prodigy kid and i mean that
33:45 at the extreme level he told his
33:47 grandfather he said
33:48 because the kid reads about 2000 pages a
33:50 week in paperback books or hardback
33:53 books
33:54 but analog books he's going to this
33:57 gifted school now he's actually out he's
33:58 into college now
34:00 but he said when he was going to this
34:02 gifted school that they all got ipads
34:04 when they got into school is the super
34:05 duper fancy thing
34:07 because you're so smart here's an ipad
34:09 he said grandpa
34:10 you know when i read war and peace
34:13 i can remember the whole thing if i read
34:15 it in a book book
34:16 a paper book but i can read a hundred
34:20 page book
34:21 on an ipad and i can't remember it two
34:24 weeks later
34:26 i mean i remember but not that much i
34:28 couldn't recall the details
34:29 like i can if i read the analog book
34:33 interesting so
34:36 how does school work typically i know
34:38 we're off the topic of time but we're
34:40 going to
34:40 fold this all back in well you read you
34:44 study then you go take a test you get a
34:45 good grade you move to the next thing
34:47 the next thing the next thing
34:48 well if they've got an erasable memory
34:50 machine
34:51 whether it be intentional or involuntary
34:54 you come out of med school
34:56 having studied in a ipad maybe you're an
34:59 abject [ __ ] and you're
35:01 you're a walking death machine for your
35:02 patience
35:04 but you study it in a hardback book you
35:07 go take your test and
35:08 wow after you graduate everything you've
35:11 learned is in your head
35:12 for the most part now you're the best
35:15 doctor ever
35:16 well they got they have doctors strung
35:18 out on giving away prescriptions and all
35:19 this other kickback stuff
35:21 chemotherapy massive kickback program
35:23 the biggest kickball
35:25 pic kickback program on planet earth is
35:28 chemotherapy
35:29 so yeah of course they're going to give
35:30 you a chemical that kills 93 of its
35:33 patients
35:35 because the other work is hard man gotta
35:38 member stuff
35:40 now it could be i'm just gonna be my own
35:42 devil's advocate
35:43 so you don't have to at least as much
35:47 i was an only kid so when you're an only
35:49 kid
35:50 guess what starts happening if you want
35:52 some friends sometimes you gotta imagine
35:54 them in the room
35:54 now i never had an imaginary friend at
35:56 most i talked to my stuffed
35:58 bears until i was about six but i didn't
36:01 feel like they were talking back to me
36:02 i didn't think that they told me to go
36:05 do things
36:07 just one-way ticket man
36:10 and i don't have the blessing of being
36:13 in my living room and uh
36:14 calling out a celebrity's name or you
36:16 know mentor's name and saying
36:18 you know i need your juice right now and
36:21 all of a sudden poof epiphanies occur
36:24 but if i'm at my screenwriting software
36:28 it is amazing how sometimes that stuff
36:30 just falls in my head
36:32 but one could construe that well you're
36:33 an only kid so
36:35 of course you have this need for a
36:38 companionship
36:40 and because you grew up outside of any
36:42 companion that would be a brother or
36:43 sister
36:45 this is how you invented this the kink
36:49 in the chain with that theory is that i
36:50 had tons of friends
36:51 or at least enough friends all the time
36:54 and i was the sort of commander-in-chief
36:56 of everything that we did
36:57 so you know not only did i have buddies
37:00 but they'd follow what i said
37:01 you know and so i don't know i really
37:05 enjoyed my private time
37:07 as private time only a couple times in
37:10 my entire life did i ever go to my mom
37:12 and say
37:13 i'm bored and she'd give me an idea and
37:14 it usually worked and i go off and do it
37:18 but after about seven or eight that game
37:20 was over i had plenty of companionship
37:23 so i don't know i don't think that
37:24 that's a huge factor for me personally
37:26 but maybe i'm blowing smoke up my own
37:28 holes
37:28 and look it's coming out my mouth you
37:31 know there's
37:32 all this talk about computers that have
37:36 been designed
37:37 quantum computers simon parks likes to
37:40 say
37:41 that have this project looking last
37:43 thing the bunch of people jumped off on
37:45 but a computer could suddenly see into
37:47 the future
37:51 well you'll read the book chaos so you
37:53 understand the
37:54 the principles of this but i'll try to
37:55 catch you up on this whole idea
37:58 the idea is that a quantum computer was
38:00 say 100 secure
38:02 stabilized qubits zero percent failure
38:06 could technically uh look at
38:10 several samplings of time
38:13 and try to calculate the mesh in between
38:16 these
38:17 moments in time i give you a really
38:19 simple example
38:21 take your average day you lived a 24
38:24 hour period
38:25 and you give this quantum computer as
38:27 much
38:28 literally physical information as you
38:30 possibly can about what state your body
38:31 was in when you woke up
38:33 perhaps when you ate lunch when you came
38:35 home from work what you did at night
38:38 maybe some of your sleep habits via some
38:40 other device that's tracking how many
38:41 you wrote the times you rolled over
38:43 whatever
38:44 and it will say okay like a chess game
38:46 simulator
38:47 i'm going to try to calculate me being
38:49 the quantum computer
38:51 the probability of events that occurred
38:53 to get you to that
38:55 exact physical state that i know you
38:56 were in the next sampling
38:58 the more sampling the less simulation
39:01 but remember how the quantum computer
39:02 works
39:04 a quantum computer can go in all
39:07 directions
39:07 of conceivable reality that it is taught
39:10 to to maintain
39:11 all at the same time so instead of a
39:14 algorithm that might have to run for a
39:16 thousand years to
39:17 calculate your middle ground of a single
39:20 24-hour day
39:22 the quantum computer with 100 qubits
39:24 without error
39:26 could technically do it instantaneously
39:30 now it may not be exactly correct
39:34 but what it has done is created a few
39:37 samples if not a million samples of what
39:39 could have occurred
39:40 between the first sample and the second
39:42 sample
39:44 but now here's the catch with any
39:47 computer being able to predict
39:49 the future now it might be
39:52 pretty illogical to say i got a family
39:54 in america
39:56 and every single one of them are
39:57 criminals this dude's a bank robber this
40:00 dude's a rapist this dude's a klepto
40:02 blah blah blah do you think that their
40:04 children
40:05 raised in the same household will have
40:07 the same
40:08 sort of criminal behavior in this
40:11 minority report
40:12 low brow computer goes yeah oh man look
40:15 at that that's so
40:16 so fancy well that's just logic man
40:19 it's just a socialistic or sorry
40:23 a social construct that these kids
40:25 raised in that laws don't
40:26 apply to us those are for suckers and
40:29 the whole game of life is to
40:31 get it for free no matter how much you
40:33 cause pain to others
40:35 that's just the way we're going to do it
40:36 we're not going to work hard you know
40:38 but reality reality what has captain
40:41 kirk taught us
40:42 about reality the fabled captain kirk
40:46 fictional character in the show star
40:48 trek especially as romanticized in the
40:51 films
40:53 he broke the system he passed tests that
40:55 starfleet had for him because he thought
40:57 90 degrees different
40:59 than what starfleet thought well
41:02 starfleet
41:02 experienced up to that point i forgot
41:04 what the test is but there's this
41:06 simulation that he was given to break
41:09 him
41:10 to make him fail to see how he dealt
41:11 with failure but captain kirk thought
41:14 differently
41:14 and he won the simulation and he was the
41:16 first and only guy to do it
41:18 i think that's the storyline no one else
41:20 did it after him
41:21 it's kind of name it's it's really cute
41:23 it's really cool
41:25 but there you go the computer can know
41:27 all the particles in the universe
41:31 but human thought is controlled by an
41:33 outside force
41:34 that a computer doesn't have access to
41:37 and that's called your soul
41:38 or your spirit so unless that computer
41:41 can tap into the soul
41:43 and engineer back engineer heaven and
41:46 all the souls and all the other forms of
41:48 life
41:49 and then physically understand the
41:51 transistor of the soul
41:53 it's never going to be able to predict
41:54 what we're going to do
41:57 and so the idea that there's
41:58 conceptually a computer that could
42:00 predict the future
42:02 it would only be able to predict really
42:05 coarse
42:07 sociological behaviors when it
42:11 figures out how many people were a
42:13 strangle thing over their face
42:14 for a an indication that has a
42:18 20 of a single percent chance of killing
42:20 you
42:21 then it can figure out the complicity
42:24 and docility of a human being
42:26 and then say yeah we can push them a lot
42:28 further because they're all morons
42:31 sure that's a coarse brush that's not a
42:33 fine brush
42:35 that is not going to predict anything
42:37 that's going to be
42:38 the plan it's not going to be able to do
42:41 that it never will be able to do that
42:43 not ever okay weather prediction
42:46 programs as documented in the book chaos
42:49 relied on the fact that the
42:50 meteorological supercomputers would have
42:52 to know
42:54 every single particle in the atmosphere
42:57 and everything that control the
42:58 atmosphere a volcanic explosion controls
43:00 the atmosphere
43:02 an earthquake could change the
43:04 atmosphere
43:05 leaking plasma from the center of the
43:07 earth will change the atmosphere
43:09 magnetic ejections from the sun
43:13 can control the atmosphere none of which
43:16 these computers will ever be able to
43:18 predict
43:20 now the fundamental question that we
43:21 always ask ourselves is time really a
43:23 thing
43:25 relatively absolutely it's a thing that
43:27 exists
43:29 we operate by state changes in the
43:31 universe
43:33 people call what i'm in right now night
43:34 time
43:37 if the sun was out you called daytime
43:39 you were young once now you're older
43:42 okay so that's your relative time your
43:45 relative time is different than my
43:46 relative time
43:48 if you're a young person you damn well
43:50 know you look at old people every once
43:52 in a while and you go man
43:53 that dude's really old whatever that
43:55 dude did he already did it
43:58 so i wonder what he's thinking about
43:59 today
44:01 if you meet someone who's like in their
44:02 80s or whatever and you know they're
44:03 retired well what do they do all day
44:05 you're working your butt off you're
44:06 doing something totally aggressive
44:08 you're trying to get your
44:09 mark on this universe but you know
44:12 they're not
44:13 they're just trying to wake up every day
44:16 maybe they have a hobby here and there
44:18 but they're at a much lower expenditure
44:21 than you are
44:22 does heaven have state changes does the
44:25 soul have a state change
44:28 yeah probably but you know what
44:32 if you had a bank account that had ten
44:33 thousand dollars in it and you want to
44:34 travel around the world you're gonna
44:36 have to be really strategic about your
44:37 tickets
44:38 your food and all this other stuff it's
44:40 gonna literally limit depending on how
44:42 frugal you are
44:45 how long you can travel around the world
44:47 but if you had a million dollars and you
44:48 want to travel around the world well
44:49 geez you might be able to travel around
44:51 the world for 10 years
44:53 easily probably more than that
44:56 because things are a lot cheaper outside
44:58 of modern countries but if you were
45:00 infinitely rich would you even think
45:04 about your bank account you would go do
45:06 what you want to do when you want to do
45:07 it
45:09 well if you're a soul do you introduce
45:13 into your consciousness as a soul
45:16 any tracking of time
45:19 the answer is probably no and if they
45:22 don't have any limitation
45:25 and no association with our timeline
45:28 which really means they can come into
45:30 your life at any
45:32 age that you exist
45:35 then they don't need to worry about well
45:37 i gotta watch my kid here don't worry
45:39 i'll do all my fantasies later
45:40 i'm gonna watch my kid until they get to
45:42 this point and then i'll go take a break
45:43 and come back
45:44 man i would hate to find out they made a
45:45 bad decision i could have changed
45:47 it resulted in early death or some
45:49 demise or some negative thing
45:52 you know they'd stay on you until you're
45:54 done too and then you meet them and then
45:55 it's like woof now let's go have some
45:57 fun as fish right
45:58 if there's no one else they want to
45:59 watch i kind of don't think that's the
46:01 case
46:03 it's just instinctual there's no science
46:06 in it
46:07 that also starts to beg the question can
46:10 you influence yourself
46:13 if time doesn't matter on the other side
46:14 and there's complete access to all time
46:16 frames on the other side
46:19 could you come back and influence
46:20 yourself to make a better decision
46:23 it would seem that that's not occurring
46:24 because bad decisions are made
46:27 but is it our lack of open-mindedness to
46:30 hear the voices come in
46:32 i was talking to a friend of mine and
46:34 she had some very successful people in
46:35 her family
46:36 and she is behaving like them
46:40 but it's two generations back it's her
46:42 grandfather that's this
46:43 massive entrepreneur super successful
46:47 and he died i believe in the 90s
46:51 and so now in the 21st century deep into
46:53 the 21st century's first
46:55 quarter here she's a very successful
46:58 entrepreneur
47:00 and i think that she is 100 engaging the
47:03 genetics
47:04 that are her grandfather's genetics and
47:06 it always seems to leapfrog right
47:08 you get a lazy generation then you get a
47:10 hard working generation you get a lazy
47:12 one you know
47:13 it just seems to do that it's like a
47:16 a tapestry where there's odd even
47:20 threads going through one white one red
47:22 one white one red
47:24 and she resisted me for a really long
47:27 time with that theory
47:29 and then this last year happened and she
47:31 managed to make more money in that
47:34 ridiculous year we had last year that
47:37 she's ever made in her entire life and
47:38 she's like this is crazy i can't believe
47:40 i'm making all this money
47:41 and i'm still annoyed by all this crap
47:44 going on
47:46 and it was in this i don't know there
47:49 was a huge transformation in this person
47:51 last year all for the good
47:53 all for the good and now she's
47:55 open-minded to it
47:57 she's open-minded to the fact that yeah
47:59 maybe i am channeling
48:01 my grandfather i don't necessarily hear
48:02 his voice you know i'm speaking for her
48:04 but i told her i said well look what if
48:07 the spirits on the other side are trying
48:09 to talk to us but we are so
48:11 indoctrinated to close off their
48:12 existence as secularism
48:14 as this fungus growing on the surface of
48:16 the planet
48:18 transhumanism moving in
48:21 and we have a great comment by ronnie i
48:23 want to mention on this episode
48:25 right at this point which is
48:28 his comment was you know do you ever get
48:30 the sense that we are being
48:32 talked out of our humanity talked out of
48:35 our spirituality
48:36 talked out of god by those that don't
48:39 want to relinquish any power
48:41 to any other higher source i'm like yeah
48:45 i think you're right i mean i do think
48:47 you're right
48:49 for those that have never uh really
48:51 listened to the debate of flat earth
48:52 versus round earth
48:54 it's it's partially about the
48:56 experimentation
48:57 of you know science that really you know
49:02 there's some stuff that needs to be
49:03 explained here because laser tests over
49:05 large frozen lakes don't have any
49:09 curvature at all man and they're
49:10 supposed to be way underneath the
49:12 horizon man
49:13 but the real push the deeper push is
49:18 science is erasing god and this other
49:21 model of the world
49:22 maintains a god
49:26 in their life you know now maybe
49:29 you know i'm not going to get off on
49:30 that whole flat earth around earth thing
49:33 because i know annoys a lot of you
49:34 one way or the other but transhumanism
49:38 is a an actually fairly old topic
49:42 especially in the video games
49:44 role-playing games
49:46 which is be careful how much of your
49:50 humanity that you give away to a machine
49:53 because you'll stop being human
49:55 shadowrun the role-playing game had
49:57 essence points
49:58 the more you replaced your body with
50:00 computer parts
50:01 and i forgot what they call reflexes
50:05 like instant reflexes or something like
50:06 that we replace your nervous system with
50:09 a bunch of wires to go faster than your
50:10 nervous system
50:12 you lose your essence and there was only
50:14 so much essence you were
50:15 essence points you could lose before you
50:17 couldn't put anything else on your body
50:19 unless you become some mindless cyborg
50:23 it's interesting how people thought this
50:25 through
50:26 geez three decades ago only three and a
50:29 half decades ago
50:32 ralph's bakshi's movie wizards
50:35 starts off with two brothers that are
50:37 born one who's a
50:39 mystic wizard who's all about holistic
50:42 nature and the other one was a satanic
50:45 crazy evil bastard who
50:48 tried to conquer
50:52 that which he despised which was good
50:55 through technology and there's a big
50:58 holy war at the end of this movie
51:00 it's an amazing film especially on a
51:04 story level
51:05 now it could be argued that worrying
51:07 about the spiritual realm as a living
51:09 being is sort of a fruitless
51:11 waste of time because you got to live
51:13 this life and that's the one you're in
51:16 i can't really argue against that theory
51:19 i think if that's your priority that's
51:21 the world you're going to live in and
51:23 that's the priorities you're going to
51:24 have and you're going to have a great
51:24 life
51:26 if you feel like your brain is advanced
51:28 to a point where
51:30 you do understand that you're not
51:33 criticizing anybody who
51:34 wants to hold back on this sort of
51:37 mental migration into these other
51:38 conversations
51:40 but you feel like well you know i only
51:41 use about two percent of my brain to
51:43 govern the loops i live in all day long
51:45 taking a shower getting
51:47 food doing your work going to bed repeat
51:49 repeat
51:50 and you got a lot of brain cells left
51:52 and so you're kind of like what else was
51:53 going on here i mean i got
51:55 got this worked out and you start ebbing
51:58 into these other realms of thought
52:00 now the big big question that helps you
52:04 i think mitigate whether or not you're
52:05 interested in these kind of
52:06 conversations or not
52:08 is a silly analogy of i give you the
52:11 book
52:12 that explains the afterlife
52:16 completely it's 100 accurate written by
52:19 god himself
52:21 unlike the bible it's this it's the
52:23 bible after the bible
52:25 what you're going to go into once you
52:27 die as a physical human being
52:29 transcending directly into your spirit
52:31 form
52:32 it cannot be eliminated it's your
52:34 guarantee
52:36 what if all these questions i'm
52:37 proposing in this episode are answered
52:39 in this other book
52:41 how would that affect your daily life
52:43 today
52:44 like i said in the previous episode
52:46 you're still gonna get hungry
52:48 you still gotta eat you're still gonna
52:50 wanna
52:52 do things in life personal things things
52:55 with other people
52:57 i think that the biggest concern that
52:59 most of us have with this theory
53:01 is and this is for us to us right from
53:04 from
53:05 you to yourself is that if
53:08 we became super familiar with this
53:10 beautiful ecosystem of potentially
53:14 dying as a human being born as a soul
53:16 again
53:18 where you get to gather up potentially
53:20 everything you've ever done
53:22 as a point of reference meaning you've
53:25 lived
53:25 an infinite number of times and you pass
53:29 on
53:29 to this other realm and all those
53:31 previous experiences are at your beck
53:33 and call
53:34 now just like as a human being you would
53:36 never want to be
53:37 sitting anywhere in the universe with
53:39 every thought you've ever had in your
53:40 life with every history moment
53:42 that you've ever had in your mind at one
53:44 time that would be just
53:45 insanity right it'd be a white noise
53:48 picture of something that would probably
53:50 debilitate you greatly i'm assuming the
53:53 same goes for being a soul
53:56 just like a computer you got your hard
53:58 drives for everything you've ever typed
53:59 into your computer
54:00 but you have memory for what you're
54:02 thinking about right now
54:04 it may not even matter what you were in
54:06 the past when you get to the other side
54:09 when you go into a dream do you worry
54:10 about other dreams that you've ever had
54:13 not really does it happen well
54:16 it doesn't usually happen in the word in
54:18 the field of memory
54:20 or sorry worry excuse me but you
54:24 might be and i've got a few places in my
54:26 dreams this hasn't happened for a couple
54:28 of years it's kind of a bummer
54:30 i guess no it probably happened last
54:32 year at some point but
54:34 there are places i go in my dreams that
54:38 there's about i don't know probably at
54:40 least half a dozen places
54:41 that i remember and they're like old
54:44 familiar sets
54:46 that when i get back to those sets i get
54:48 this warm fuzzy feeling like i'm back
54:51 i'm back in the attic of my uncle's
54:52 house that doesn't really exist
54:54 i mean he had an attic but the place i
54:56 dream is like this really cool
54:59 like just warm amazing
55:02 kind of study or yeah it's like a study
55:05 there's a desk with the roll
55:07 the roll top on it and it's got books in
55:09 it it's got these cool like
55:10 chip and dills chairs kind of thing it's
55:12 just really quaint and interesting
55:14 i got another one that's sort of this
55:15 art deco building which i believe is a
55:18 movie theater
55:19 it has a big escalator that actually
55:21 turns around a corner
55:22 doesn't stop it turns around the corner
55:24 which doesn't exist in real life
55:26 as far as i know but i have a few of
55:28 these places and when i go back it's
55:30 really
55:31 nostalgic and fun there's again a
55:32 futuristic version of my hometown
55:35 that i've seen a couple times it's never
55:37 quite exactly the same
55:39 so maybe there's something to that when
55:41 it comes to you and your soul
55:44 but now what if as i've suggested in
55:46 several episodes
55:48 what if dreams are pretty much exactly
55:51 what it's like to be on the other side
55:52 except you're more lucid
55:54 in fact you're 100 lucid now part of
55:57 that would be a bummer because
55:59 unless you can you want real people
56:02 and real souls in your afterlife you
56:05 don't want a bunch of fake
56:07 actors even if they are real souls in
56:09 your dreams
56:10 you know you don't i definitely dream
56:12 about people
56:14 in my family and when they're in my
56:16 dreams they're not the same people
56:18 so they're not the same souls for sure
56:20 someone's acting out that role or i'm
56:22 acting it out for them in my mind
56:25 i think one of the things we don't
56:26 really discuss on point
56:29 but is something that we all yearn for
56:32 if you believe in an afterlife is that
56:36 as much as we want control of our life
56:39 aka our mind in this reality
56:44 we want at least that much control in
56:46 the afterlife
56:47 but i think the sort of low-hanging
56:49 fruit expectation
56:50 is is that we want more control of our
56:53 life
56:54 once we pass on you know part of my
56:58 sort of knee-jerk reaction about what i
57:00 hope
57:01 my first moments on the other side are
57:03 like
57:04 it's always a tangible world
57:08 sort of like a dream and that is
57:10 free-flowing in that it doesn't have to
57:12 adhere to any
57:13 structural reality of architecture in
57:15 this world
57:16 but yeah i mean it would be cool to get
57:18 to the side
57:20 and there's sort of a ceremony of some
57:22 sort your loved ones who know you so
57:24 well
57:24 will put together a scenario which is
57:26 the most incredible welcome home
57:28 party you've ever had in your life they
57:31 know everybody you want to
57:33 meet and they're all there and they're
57:35 all in the right positions they're all
57:39 looking at you like let's just say you
57:40 wanted to have a conversation with tesla
57:42 but it's not the very first thing you
57:44 want to do you want to hug your
57:46 loved ones and your best buds that are
57:47 on the other side
57:50 but tesla is there he's in some new gear
57:52 by the way
57:53 looking pretty sharp and he's just
57:55 looking at you like
57:56 we're gonna get our time don't worry go
57:58 hug your grandma
58:00 and she's like oh man it's gonna be
58:01 great you know one of those little
58:03 fantasies
58:04 then of course there's the logic that we
58:06 can't conceive of it
58:08 so why try i endorse that too
58:12 it's a little harder to deal with that
58:13 right totally unknown unknown unknown
58:16 i mean nothing will be the way that you
58:19 expect it to be but it'll be great
58:21 that's fine but then you're back to your
58:24 loops of life again right you're back to
58:25 that two percent
58:26 okay well i i threw a big
58:30 bucket of water on that fire but if we
58:33 came to peace
58:34 with that book about the afterlife
58:37 would we live this life the way we
58:39 should be living it
58:41 my suspicion is no in fact my fear
58:45 would be that as i mentioned in other
58:48 episodes that suicide
58:50 might become this option for everybody
58:52 well hey man it's gonna be great another
58:53 sign
58:55 then that brings in the big debate is
58:58 there a penalty
59:00 for punching out early i think that's
59:03 very relative
59:04 i really doubt it quite frankly
59:07 doesn't mean i want to do it believe me
59:09 if i get bumped off it's uh
59:12 someone else doing it no matter what
59:15 they tell you
59:17 so we as i've suggested for years
59:20 i think we are quarantined from this
59:22 other reality
59:24 to protect this reality now
59:28 part of me gets frustrated with that
59:29 whole concept because
59:31 let's say this let's say that there's a
59:34 rule system on the other side and it's
59:36 it's got some super complex rules that
59:38 you and i can't understand perhaps as
59:40 humans
59:40 there's definitely some low hanging
59:42 fruit restrictions
59:44 this first contact prime directive thing
59:47 that we could understand
59:48 and it's one of these things of you
59:50 cannot prove
59:52 to the other side that we exist because
59:54 that can kick off this chain reaction of
59:56 all the things i just said
59:59 however it does happen by the way
60:02 it does happen like i've been i've seen
60:05 the proof
60:06 that this place exists i'm just telling
60:08 you man i've seen it
60:10 i've had moments occur
60:13 okay so i already believe that that
60:17 realm existed before these other events
60:19 occurred to me
60:20 truly 100 i don't know
60:23 exactly how their world works i'm just
60:26 telling you i know it exists
60:29 so if you have that level of belief
60:32 especially those of you who believe in
60:33 god and have always believed in god you
60:35 know that
60:36 no matter how long you live your life
60:37 you'll always continue believing in god
60:41 then this idea of somehow
60:44 proving that god exists if god were to
60:47 come down and talk to you
60:49 probably doesn't apply to you because if
60:52 god did come down and talk to you you'd
60:53 be like well
60:54 i feel super honored my mind is blown
60:57 but that doesn't change
60:58 it didn't change anything inside your
61:01 belief system because all it did was say
61:04 i got privileged and the ultimate
61:07 celebrity of celebrities
61:08 god himself came down and said hi to me
61:11 doesn't happen
61:13 but it's interesting if you believe in
61:16 spirits
61:17 like if i go back to walt disney
61:21 or disneyland and walt disney comes up
61:23 to me a second time
61:25 and and has the conversation with me for
61:27 two seconds or says don't get on that
61:28 right it's got a problem
61:29 or blah blah blah blah blah
61:33 it's going to be a wonderful experience
61:35 but it doesn't change the fact i think
61:37 he
61:38 goes there still doesn't change the fact
61:40 that i believe in an afterlife
61:42 it's just i got another piece of
61:44 information from a person
61:46 that i've already got a piece of
61:47 information from at that park
61:50 so what rule is being broken i know
61:53 there's at least a dozen of you out
61:54 there if not
61:56 1200 of you or more that listen to this
61:58 show
61:59 and you may have had this thought which
62:01 is the following
62:03 you're unique you believe in these
62:06 things
62:07 for whatever proprietary reason you do
62:10 whether you've had an experience or not
62:11 doesn't matter
62:13 you believe in these spirits you believe
62:15 in god
62:16 and all that is is a central
62:18 consciousness to this whole universe
62:20 the being that maybe is responsible for
62:22 forging all this into existence and
62:24 sustaining it second to second
62:26 all right doesn't mean you get your way
62:29 just because you believe in them
62:31 but you feel like okay i've lived a good
62:34 life man you know still got plenty of
62:36 years left
62:37 i'm gonna do some some more neat stuff
62:39 while i'm here
62:41 can we upgrade my program
62:44 can't we interact with the other side
62:48 because we have this advanced in
62:50 consciousness we have this enlightenment
62:52 that allows us to believe and see more
62:56 can't they change the script just for us
62:59 so that we can see something interesting
63:01 and get almost uh well like let's just
63:04 say this is this is my i'm obviously
63:06 talking from my own projection and my
63:07 own belief system
63:10 but the thing is is like okay this is a
63:12 petri dish
63:14 which may have a more proprietary group
63:15 of people that are watching us and doing
63:18 this experiment like i said in instant
63:19 earth
63:20 theory okay so that's them they're just
63:23 the ones outside this
63:25 this experiment okay they don't have
63:27 celestial powers
63:28 in my opinion but the idea is
63:33 let's say that doesn't exist we live on
63:34 this ball floating in space we're
63:35 totally in significant
63:38 relation to the entire universe but very
63:39 significant to our creator
63:43 our creator most likely has created us
63:46 for a particular reason of some sort
63:48 whether it's
63:48 super super subtle or some massive thing
63:52 on point
63:53 the idea would be if they were to bend
63:56 this rule or at least say
63:58 for all of these constraints that are no
64:00 longer constraints for a particular
64:02 individual
64:04 this woman has always believed in god
64:05 her whole life and she's 80 years old
64:08 now we can go down and say hi to her
64:11 based on our belief systems because
64:12 we're not breaking any rules
64:15 star trek let's take that as an example
64:18 star trek has a prime directive
64:20 what's the prime directive until a
64:21 society hits warp speed
64:23 but not to be interacted with and this
64:25 is something that's handed down from the
64:27 vulcans to the humans
64:29 now what if they
64:33 found a society on a planet hasn't hit
64:35 warp yet
64:37 who knows how far they are away from
64:38 warp however they have a complete
64:40 philosophy on that planet
64:42 that aliens exist and their
64:45 their estimation of how aliens meaning
64:48 us
64:49 vulcans romulans klingons all those
64:51 people
64:52 they've theorized it all and they've
64:54 said
64:56 it's just a matter of time before they
64:58 come down and visit us and they've got
65:00 spaceships conceived and federations of
65:03 space conceived and the fact that
65:04 they're going to inherit
65:05 a whole new book of rules about
65:07 interacting with other societies once
65:08 they hit space
65:09 travel capability well now would picard
65:12 be so
65:13 worried about touching base and making
65:15 contact when that's exactly what they
65:16 believe
65:17 and they're so mentally and socially
65:19 advanced that they're not going to panic
65:22 they're not going to panic they're not
65:23 going to lose their religion they're not
65:25 going to lose their their culture
65:27 they've already pre-calculated
65:28 everything
65:31 well it seems like you could go down and
65:33 say hi right you're going to be
65:35 surprising anybody
65:38 their mythos won't be altered
65:41 nothing will be confirmed besides what
65:42 they've already confirmed ahead of time
65:46 okay i think there's a lot of us humans
65:49 they're exactly the same way with the
65:50 afterlife
65:52 we have proof proof enough to believe in
65:56 it
65:57 so now what would happen to the through
66:00 the
66:00 human experiment of the creator
66:05 to allow into our lives a spiritual
66:08 presence
66:10 let's say that um you know you you want
66:13 your
66:14 long-lost loved one or friend to come
66:16 visit you in your living room maybe you
66:17 live alone or
66:19 there's just a time and a place that
66:21 that's really could be
66:23 your quarantine little situation and
66:27 you're not going to be able to prove
66:28 anything to anyone else no one's going
66:29 to walk in the room and see einstein
66:31 talking to you you know
66:33 so why not because here's my
66:36 feeling my feeling is if this is never
66:40 allowed
66:41 and maybe it's happening in a different
66:42 part of the universe maybe there's
66:44 parallel universes where this is
66:45 occurring
66:46 the idea is wouldn't god himself
66:50 or at least the spirits underneath him
66:52 learn something new
66:54 by letting something new happen
66:58 and taking advantage of this time thing
67:01 to allow it to occur
67:03 i think the answer is hell yeah and yet
67:06 it doesn't happen
67:07 now an atheist might move right in and
67:08 go yeah there you go there's proof
67:10 there's no god
67:10 makes no sense right if there was a god
67:13 why wouldn't that occur
67:15 why is it that biblical scriptures say
67:17 that god was talking to everyone all the
67:19 time and all of a sudden once the
67:20 printing press comes around the video
67:21 camera
67:22 wow all these gods disappear now you're
67:25 just living in a elite controlled world
67:29 it's hard to argue isn't it unless
67:32 you've had
67:33 proof i like these frontiers of thought
67:37 i like parsing
67:40 supposedly the logic that we've been
67:42 given
67:43 from ourselves to ourselves right from
67:45 humanity to us
67:47 they tell you well of course not this
67:50 and of course that
67:52 and then you start thinking about you're
67:53 like no no no no that sounded good
67:56 when i was like eight years old but i've
67:58 had 50 years to think about it or
67:59 whatever
68:00 age you are and you're like i don't
68:03 think that anymore
68:05 something should be different here
68:06 something should be more versatile here
68:10 so if it is true that they're there and
68:13 yet they still won't parse
68:14 or sorry pierce the sort of laws of the
68:18 universe
68:20 then you're sitting there going what's
68:22 my afterlife going to be like when you
68:24 pass over to the other side like so many
68:25 people have had
68:27 near-death experiences where they see
68:28 their body and they float up and they
68:30 even some of them
68:31 touch the spiritual world talk to
68:33 relatives talk to random strangers say
68:34 it's not your time and they put you back
68:36 down your body and you're in this
68:37 painful
68:38 cast in some hospital bed but you just
68:40 went to heaven and back
68:42 if you do finally pass at the very end
68:44 of your life
68:45 and everything is a metaphor at least of
68:48 what you already
68:51 it'll believed really interesting to
68:52 find out what the green room's like you
68:53 know you sit in the green room and
68:54 you're like you're decompressing out of
68:56 your
68:57 human to soul transformation
68:59 transcendence
69:00 i mean first question on my mouth is
69:02 gonna be why
69:04 why were you so sequestered from us at
69:07 least those of us who already conceived
69:09 of the whole thing
69:10 not accurately you know but and not even
69:13 remotely the majority of how it really
69:15 works on this side but
69:17 you know it's like this let's use
69:21 disneyland real simple
69:23 it's another world inside those park
69:25 walls it really is a different world man
69:28 well before you go i mean before you've
69:31 ever walked in those doors
69:34 well you know it exists because you're
69:36 going there
69:37 once you get within you know anaheim's
69:40 um
69:42 streets you can start seeing the tips of
69:45 rides you know
69:46 so it's all starting to kind of come
69:47 into focus
69:50 but you haven't actually been in it yet
69:53 but what if you got to the front door
69:54 and said something no you can't come in
69:56 you can't come in
69:57 why well it's just not your time you you
69:59 can't conceive of anything that's in
70:00 here and you're like yeah i can
70:02 i can conceive i don't know 99 of the
70:05 park
70:06 but i saw the matterhorn you know and i
70:08 saw that you know
70:09 the tower of terror which is now the um
70:12 guardians of the galaxy right you know i
70:14 knew those things were in there i don't
70:15 know how they work i don't know if it
70:16 goes up and down or left or right or
70:18 whatever
70:19 but you know i know it's in there let me
70:21 go inside
70:22 no no no not until you know everything
70:24 about what's in here until you have this
70:26 arbitrary moment in time where you
70:27 actually pass away
70:29 may you look inside maybe as a hint is
70:32 the only thing that's palatable
70:35 now there'll be some people that are
70:36 very religious that think this is sort
70:37 of a sacrilege
70:39 line of speech but i'm
70:43 i'm gonna estimate that's a pretty uh
70:46 pretty small group of people now 100
70:49 years ago
70:50 i'd be the majority of the people and
70:52 i'd probably be strong up somewhere
70:54 i think what's interesting is it's just
70:56 as people get polarized in political
70:58 parties
70:59 and they can't see outside of their
71:01 political affiliation
71:04 these conversations tend to one never be
71:07 discussed right i mean you let me know
71:08 if you've had conversations like this
71:10 anywhere else in the entire world
71:12 because i'd like to visit
71:13 trust me usually it's like you got high
71:16 in college and you had this conversation
71:18 one time but no one else in the room
71:19 understood what the hell you were
71:20 talking about while you're having this
71:22 massive massive triple quadruple
71:24 epiphany
71:25 that you forget the next morning i just
71:28 think that
71:30 we are almost as a young person and this
71:33 has nothing to do with your body age
71:36 but as a young mind we find security in
71:39 polarizing ourselves into
71:41 paradigms of belief all handed down from
71:44 the elders in most cases
71:46 what some of these shows are designed to
71:48 do is to free you up from that
71:50 polarization
71:52 we know that individuals here on earth
71:55 have discovered things because usually
71:59 one of two methodologies
72:01 one is serendipity you just bump into it
72:05 and oh my god this is a reality let's go
72:06 with this right
72:08 usually technical inventions happen that
72:09 way
72:11 then there's the other side of it which
72:13 is you you never locked your brain down
72:15 too much and to be able to keep thinking
72:19 well the rest of the world was not
72:20 thinking it's hard to wait for a
72:23 serendipitous thing to occur isn't it
72:26 how do you wait for that that could be a
72:28 lifetime
72:29 and you may discover nothing i prefer to
72:33 go for it
72:35 and i think that you know all of us
72:38 who have encountered any level of
72:41 measurable enlightenment
72:42 and that's your definition not mine
72:46 it's removing the shackles around
72:51 your mind around what you're told is
72:54 possible and what is
72:56 impossible religion
73:00 is a whole separate construct from this
73:02 conversation so please don't get those
73:03 mixed up
73:05 but the afterlife is definitely one of
73:08 those things where
73:09 we simply are well there's a bunch of
73:11 people that are afraid of it
73:12 afraid of dying and so they can't get
73:15 near the conversation
73:17 and then there's some people are just
73:18 the nihilistic and they're cares
73:20 whatever
73:20 you know and that's fine there's
73:22 something i'm saying now with this whole
73:25 political climate that we have and
73:27 people waiting for something massive to
73:28 happen it's like
73:29 i call it christmas face
73:32 just go into christmas phase let it be a
73:35 surprise
73:37 very few things all i'll say that about
73:40 i think falling in love should be a
73:41 christmas surprise
73:42 i don't know if you can go after it i
73:44 don't think you can like the universe
73:46 rewards it that way but these kind of
73:49 subjects are definitely things we can
73:50 pursue
73:52 and because we
73:56 seem to have like a barrier of thought
73:59 when we try to go
74:00 in these real esoteric directions
74:01 because honestly it's almost like being
74:04 in a dark room
74:05 that has no walls and so you're like
74:08 what do i grab onto what
74:10 what's the next you know rock climbing
74:13 cliff ledge i could put my fingers on to
74:15 pull me pull myself up to the next level
74:18 well if the whole world is mute about
74:20 these subject matters
74:22 any subject matter then
74:26 there is none you have to find it
74:27 yourself which means you're gonna be
74:28 exploring your mind
74:30 constantly being very astute
74:33 at what you experience mentally tiny
74:36 little thoughts you might be having that
74:37 may be handed down from outside
74:39 a spirit giving it to you trying to cue
74:42 you up for this next thing
74:44 i'm in a position being your host of
74:48 coming up with
74:49 you know hundreds and hundreds of
74:50 episodes that'll hopefully be engaging
74:52 to you
74:53 and so i think of a lot of subjects i
74:55 think i could make an episode on
74:57 but i just i use the stanley kubrick
74:59 test i go but it would be boring
75:01 so no thank you i don't want to be known
75:04 for that
75:05 so anyway hope this opens your mind a
75:07 little bit further in that particular
75:08 direction
75:10 the big question is do souls
75:14 have time or does it it and because
75:17 times
75:18 may not be a factor for them anymore
75:20 like like a
75:21 an infinite economy for your personal
75:23 spending
75:24 does that change how we interact because
75:26 they don't have any relative time no
75:28 pressure from time
75:30 but we do so if they want to cross that
75:33 barrier into our world
75:35 how would it relate to a time
75:37 relationship
75:40 food for thought man anyway
75:44 if you haven't been to
75:44 deepthoughtsradio.com just get there and
75:46 bookmark it
