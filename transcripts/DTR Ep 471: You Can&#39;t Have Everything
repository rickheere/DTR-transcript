00:29 good evening ladies and gentlemen and
00:31 welcome back to deep thoughts so before
00:34 we get into today's subject it's 52
00:38 degrees out here and for whatever reason
00:40 it feels like 42 we had this listener at
00:45 one point and I don't know what the
00:49 guy's deal was but I think he's popped
00:53 over to [ __ ] shoot recently and he's
00:57 got this [ __ ] thing he's doing to
01:01 the videos which I just I find it
01:02 fascinating which is Hillary's who I
01:04 want to mention it he keeps eating my
01:10 videos with these comments where he
01:13 without definition without accusation
01:15 with the specifics he thinks that I am
01:19 being paid to do this I don't know 1:30
01:22 a.m. at 52 degrees outside mm-hmm
01:26 because that's what I would do if I had
01:28 money to do this I work a full day and
01:32 then this is the only time I got but the
01:36 dude says stuff like I used to watch his
01:40 videos until I realized he was playing
01:43 for another hand or something [ __ ]
01:45 weird like that and it's very
01:47 interesting that I have a whole episode
01:50 on shields but I did it way back in
01:53 episode 1 or sorry season 1 when we
01:56 still had em kilcher radio going because
01:59 we're being accused of being shills at
02:00 the MK ULTRA radio side which is so
02:04 funny I mean it's just like shows that
02:07 our chili oh my god they're production
02:09 values are [ __ ] insane you've got
02:11 Studios they've got green screens
02:13 they've got people helping to edit the
02:15 thing together they don't work they come
02:17 out with a video every day they don't
02:21 get shadow band they don't have every
02:22 goddamn video demonetized the second
02:24 that I upload them I just uploaded dream
02:27 birthing it was finished encoding and
02:30 within 20 minutes it was demonetized
02:33 now they allow me to get it a review of
02:37 it and I'm sure it'll be
02:38 rhe monetize but of course they [ __ ]
02:40 me because I don't have that many
02:41 listeners but some other time you guys
02:44 are all done clicking through then the
02:46 ads are turned on and I make nothing
02:48 right I just think it's interesting that
02:51 I think the shelves are now becoming the
02:55 ones that call you shells there's an
02:58 interesting I think that they're there
02:59 to get in there and infect the
03:01 credibility but they don't say anything
03:04 because they have no case right it's
03:06 like dude what's your case where my
03:08 shill like waking up the world is in the
03:10 21 there ain't no one being paid to do
03:12 that trust me we're gonna do episode
03:16 it's going to get into being misled and
03:20 probably my next episode I'm gonna
03:22 record which is gonna get into this
03:25 [ __ ] you know Donald Trump [ __ ]
03:28 time-traveling thing this project
03:29 Looking Glass thing talk about some
03:31 [ __ ] chili channels a lot of good
03:33 queueing on channels whether he'd be
03:36 real or not or whatever he's real but
03:38 with a naughty sexually okay who he says
03:40 he is who the [ __ ] knows right but that
03:43 dude trying to convince you that you
03:45 know the Trump family is a bunch of Time
03:47 Traveller's because Ivanka Trump trolls
03:50 the internet with he was a trip around
03:55 the world wearing all the clothing
03:57 that's in this fictional book in the
03:58 eighteen hundreds she's trolling you man
04:01 but whatever but yeah I think it's it's
04:05 people are being lured into really bad
04:09 situations it will credible situations
04:12 initially and then it's all being turned
04:13 right now so it'll be real interesting
04:15 in Co 2020 turns out but this episode is
04:20 based on this crazy musician I just
04:24 found I don't want to pronounce his last
04:27 name improperly his first name is Mark
04:29 ma RC and he's this live recorders kind
04:35 of like a Reggie Jackson but he does he
04:38 plays a keyboard play Zelda percussions
04:41 sings on it he's an amazing vocalist he
04:44 just craps gold bars I contacted you got
04:47 to see if he let me interview and we'll
04:49 see he's in New York
04:51 what a little ad-libs songs he put
04:52 together which was just utterly
04:56 brilliant I'll put his link down below
04:58 is that he said you can't have
05:01 everything
05:03 period can everything you want is
05:07 basically the other statement and there
05:11 was an old Rolling Stone song you know
05:13 that was you can't always get what you
05:15 want but you'll find sometimes you get
05:18 what you need and that was obviously an
05:22 old statement that the Rolling Stones
05:24 brilliantly turned into a song I mean so
05:27 my favorite songs have ever done I never
05:29 grew up being a huge Rolling Stones fan
05:31 was never not into them I guess what it
05:34 wasn't into the Beatles at all there's
05:36 something about the hype level with
05:38 those guys just rubbed me the wrong way
05:40 nothing to do with their music nothing
05:41 to do with them individually it just was
05:43 a cultural thing that kind of gag me a
05:45 little bit but it really triggered
05:48 something in my brain because I thought
05:50 it is so true and you know I think maybe
05:55 a hundred years ago you wouldn't have to
05:58 tell anyone that you can't get
06:00 everything that you won I mean up here's
06:04 the value to you as listeners okay it
06:06 really depends on your age but here's
06:09 I'm gonna say it if there's something
06:12 you haven't done that you really wanted
06:15 to get done in this lifetime and you
06:17 still have time
06:19 this episodes for you if you're young if
06:23 you're under 30 and you're hearing me
06:26 this quite frankly could be the most
06:28 powerful episode you've ever heard in
06:29 your life
06:30 if you don't have a mentor that's
06:32 telling you the same sort of thing
06:34 because here's the deal one of the
06:39 saddest realities about being a human
06:41 being is that well especially today with
06:47 the education really low common sense
06:49 almost non-existent and forces agendas
06:57 you know these agenda21 folks these
06:59 globalists they're pulling your brain
07:01 apart they are filling up your mind with
07:04 travers√©e and conflict that I didn't
07:08 grow up with and every decade back from
07:11 my age bracket means people older than
07:13 me they didn't grow up with much of it
07:15 either now there were definitely
07:16 different movements here and there again
07:17 we I just recorded an episode that will
07:20 probably air before this one about all
07:23 the assassinations in the 60s so in some
07:27 cases they grew up with more tarp
07:29 turmoil Vietnam War protesting and the
07:34 50s it was all about the dick Euler
07:35 threats and even if you just had one
07:37 focused threat you're way better off
07:39 than what we grew up with today which is
07:42 you know if you're not you know
07:43 identifying as straight then you got all
07:46 these wars you have to fight if you're
07:48 not white you have all these wars you
07:49 have to fight you know it just goes on
07:51 and on and on but it's not about any
07:55 event here's here's the bummer when we
08:00 are young and uneducated we make a
08:05 crapload of decisions that affect us
08:06 forever and I mean a crap load of
08:10 decisions now sometimes those decisions
08:13 are the greatest mistakes you'll ever
08:14 make
08:15 or it'll even be the greatest decisions
08:18 you made intentionally even though you
08:22 look back and you go oh my gosh can you
08:23 believe I decided to do that but it
08:26 worked out for me I took a chance and it
08:27 all worked out but I'll tell you that
08:32 one of the one of the toughest emotions
08:37 you can deal with as a human being and
08:39 it's at a micro level and it's at a
08:42 macro level is the feeling of regret all
08:47 of us have a tiny bit of regret it could
08:50 be something that you said to someone
08:52 something you did to someone something
08:54 you didn't do
08:55 didn't say could be an opportunity that
08:58 you let pass you know it could be that
09:01 you were scared you were tired you were
09:06 drugged out of your mind whatever and
09:09 something came and went it could be that
09:13 you perhaps in one year of your life
09:17 said man I really got to learn how to do
09:18 this and if I learn how to do that
09:21 really really well you will perhaps and
09:24 press the right person make the right
09:27 amount of money gain that social
09:29 mobility that you need but you turn on
09:33 the video game instead he turned on that
09:35 marathon session on Netflix and you just
09:39 wasted away and then the couple years
09:43 pass and the moment came when you
09:46 realize perhaps because someone next to
09:49 you didn't dial out someone else next to
09:53 you did hunker down and you watch them
09:56 get on that train and they go to
09:58 pleasureville and you're stuck back on
10:00 your sofa going in that loop when we are
10:05 immature and inexperienced we have
10:10 knowledge but no wisdom we make a bunch
10:13 of decisions because life sort of pushes
10:16 us in that direction now there's a lot
10:20 of fallacies with the way that we do
10:21 this because we believe that you roll
10:25 with the punches more often than we
10:27 should consider our life something that
10:30 we design once you start realizing you
10:34 can design your life you can design who
10:37 you are as a human be grow your hair out
10:39 long cut it off dress and the trends of
10:45 the world and look like a tool or make
10:47 up your own fashion just piece together
10:50 stuff that no one else pieces together
10:51 maybe you go get a bunch of suits from
10:53 the 1800s and you look different you
10:56 look go where a shark suit from 1962
11:00 you're gonna roll different whatever
11:03 turns you want whatever hits your soul
11:05 and rings that chime that tuning fork
11:09 inside you that says yeah this is us
11:13 nearly every single musician that you've
11:15 ever enjoyed has most definitely almost
11:19 as an imperative gone with that path and
11:23 a lot of times are criticized for making
11:27 those decisions for the first couple of
11:29 years they did it
11:30 and then later on people start getting
11:32 jealous because he did it I mean I can
11:36 tell you you know David Bowie there's a
11:38 real good example of a guy that boy he
11:40 went his own way man the whole time he
11:43 was alive he went his own way and
11:45 criticized you know his entire life for
11:47 doing that stuff you know imagine when
11:50 we kissed walked on stage for the very
11:52 first time for guys and makeup guys a
11:55 demon when guys a space do1 dudes a cat
11:58 one dude just has a star on his eye I
12:01 don't know their music was really good
12:04 so that probably softened the blow a
12:05 little bit but when gene Simmons shows
12:08 up on the Dick Cavett show to do an
12:10 interview he stays in character the
12:12 entire time your minds a little blown
12:15 Prince that dude vented his entire
12:18 fashion now he definitely took something
12:20 Jimi Hendrix he took something from I
12:22 think even Adam Ant
12:24 that a man it goes on and on and on but
12:28 we're not talking about that we're
12:31 talking about making sure that you take
12:34 a moment to wake up in your own life you
12:37 know we're so worried about waking up to
12:38 the world and all the the deep politics
12:40 and all the agents that's important and
12:42 that's good and if you got time to do
12:44 that because you love your life and you
12:45 made at least overall your mean of
12:48 decisions you're very satisfied with
12:50 when you come to terms with things that
12:52 you had to give up your regrets are
12:54 there but they're not deep they don't
12:56 hurt you bad then you're good but our
13:00 youth I don't know about what state
13:05 they're in because what ends up
13:08 happening and what I think I'm seeing
13:09 with all these social justice warriors
13:11 is that they have made a bunch of
13:13 horrible decisions because they have no
13:15 guidance their parents are obviously
13:18 almost entirely worthless unless the
13:20 child for whatever reason decided to
13:23 become just a rebel out of a nice family
13:25 but usually was it the Jerome said in
13:29 the movie under the cherry moon he goes
13:33 because I hate stupid people
13:36 he says you find a stupid kid you follow
13:41 him home knock on the door
13:43 and a stupid person will answer he's
13:47 talking about the whole family and so we
13:51 don't want to be in that category and
13:55 stupidity is obviously we've been
13:57 obvious for some people but stupidity is
14:00 when you have been told all that you
14:02 need to know and you ignore it out of
14:06 stupidity out of laziness
14:09 maybe the examples around you or
14:12 horrible I showed you guys my tattoo of
14:17 Sydney's signature on my right wrist and
14:20 I remember when I got my first tattoo
14:22 back in 93 and it eventually evolved
14:27 into my coat of arms I looked at it I
14:31 put it on my desktop of my computer way
14:33 back in the 90s and I looked at it
14:35 looked at it every single day because I
14:36 thought you know what these things are
14:38 forever I've never done it before so I
14:41 need to contemplate forever for at least
14:45 a year it's just an interesting I'm
14:48 gonna use a finite amount of time to
14:50 consider an infant decision now I don't
14:52 live an infinite number of years at
14:55 least my body doesn't rate so it's a
14:58 little bit of an exaggeration but my
15:00 family lives well the genes I'm related
15:02 to they lived for a very long time as
15:03 long as you use your mind don't suffer
15:05 from dementia and poison yourself with a
15:06 bunch of crap there's a high likelihood
15:08 I'll hit 100 gonna get by bus so I got
15:13 to take care of my body I gotta make
15:15 sure I don't have regrets with how I do
15:17 things
15:18 now the cigar lounge that I chill out at
15:23 has a tattoo parlor about three doors
15:26 down that's where I got this tattoo this
15:28 latest one which is coming out great by
15:30 the way but I see a ton of really young
15:34 kids going in there and getting
15:36 themselves tattooed to the to the night
15:39 now some people make really educated
15:41 decisions and I'm not trying to judge
15:42 anybody because I think tattoos are sexy
15:44 as hell sometimes but when I was younger
15:47 he wasn't as sophisticated the tattoos
15:50 were not as interesting and we're not as
15:52 well thought out because it was still
15:55 kind of odd to get
15:57 leaves it was odd to get tattoos on your
15:59 back I mean it was just it wasn't a
16:02 well-thought-out art profession and so I
16:08 would see like Ren and Stimpy the
16:10 cartoon characters would get popular for
16:12 a couple years and people get those on
16:14 their body and then boom Ren and Stimpy
16:16 he's not even on TV anymore you're like
16:19 how do you feel now so on top of it but
16:24 let's breakdown life into some
16:28 categories so that we can start putting
16:30 a paradigm together now this isn't a
16:32 rule this is just a guideline for us to
16:35 have this conversation now for those of
16:39 you who have listened to all 500
16:40 episodes I say more than the number
16:43 because I've got a ton of unnumbered
16:45 episodes right I don't think I'm quite a
16:48 500 just yet I'm getting close I said
16:52 way way back five years ago that I
16:55 divide my light of life up into three
16:57 categories the very first category of my
17:00 consideration of existence is me I gotta
17:04 take care of me first without me
17:06 what difference does it make if I'm not
17:09 here I'm not healthy and I'm not happy
17:10 what difference does it make in any
17:13 other category of my life so you always
17:16 have to take care of you now if you have
17:19 a wise soul in your life and you're
17:21 about to have children whether you be
17:22 the mother or the father the wise so
17:24 we'll tell you that once you have a
17:26 child it's no longer about you it's
17:28 about your children and that is very
17:30 very true
17:32 what I think that means is that we
17:34 generally prioritize our children over
17:36 everything else in the world but the
17:39 truth of the matter is at all times
17:42 you are the number one priority now
17:46 doesn't mean that if your child's
17:47 standing in front of us you know an
17:49 oncoming bus that you wouldn't run out
17:51 sacrifice your life to save your child's
17:53 life that's different that is a terminal
17:57 situation that's where you can flip the
18:00 priorities and make sure that your child
18:01 goes on and you eat the bus but if
18:05 you're not happy
18:08 what life can you possibly provide for
18:10 your child even if you're a part-time
18:11 parent you have to be happy for those
18:14 visits you have to be happy because you
18:17 need to go on living you know it gets
18:19 harder as you get older it's absolutely
18:22 true it doesn't get you know level ten
18:26 from level one or anything but it it
18:28 increases difficulty your body starts to
18:31 shut down slowly over time your eyesight
18:34 starts to suck you know you're you're
18:36 just not as young as you used to be and
18:39 once you start realizing you start
18:40 hitting that threshold it's interesting
18:43 the next one up I'm just gonna say in
18:47 chronological order is usually your job
18:52 your profession how are you sustaining
18:54 yourself because it is almost just an
18:57 extension of you if you're rich and you
19:01 don't need to work then this doesn't
19:02 really apply to you but if you need to
19:05 earn money to pay bills then work is the
19:08 very next thing because work will
19:10 determine how how happy you are as an
19:12 individual if you like what you do and
19:14 you don't even feel like you're working
19:15 if you hate what you do it's almost
19:19 impossible for you to be happy as a
19:21 human being if you do not like what you
19:23 do for a living and that's a fact and
19:27 that leads back to those decisions we're
19:29 gonna get we're gonna get there in just
19:31 a second but the third thing that's on
19:34 my list the second thing that we incur
19:36 after we deal with ourselves
19:38 is the formation of our family families
19:42 got all kinds of definitions right your
19:43 partner whatever that might be and your
19:46 children however that might occur
19:48 whether you have your own children adopt
19:50 children or whatever your children could
19:54 also be your pets and that sort of thing
19:56 but again there's something very
19:57 different about a child because it lives
19:58 more than eight to twelve years and it
20:01 actually grows and matures right it
20:03 draws silly little scribbly pictures and
20:06 since this is you mom and then in four
20:08 years it actually looks like you and
20:10 then in eight years it is you I mean
20:12 it's just you know humans are much
20:14 better than pets in my opinion because
20:16 they evolve and grow and the more you
20:19 participate in your child's life
20:21 the more they're on track you don't want
20:24 to come as a johnny-come-lately parent
20:26 where you ignore your child until they
20:27 become a problem and then you try to go
20:29 on a discipline this is another thing
20:31 that we do when we're younger I was
20:35 extremely observant and I actually
20:38 interviewed adults when I was younger to
20:41 make sure that when my kid arrived I was
20:43 at least as equipped as I could possibly
20:44 be intellectually for my age and for my
20:48 experience right now it's very very very
20:52 common for us to be the pinball and a
20:55 pinball machine as I used to say we're
20:59 just bouncing around this this field
21:02 what's in a pinball machine
21:05 there's bumpers there's flippers there's
21:08 kickers there's all kinds of wild
21:11 contractions that can hold the ball and
21:14 throw more balls on the screen another
21:16 thing but you're just subjugated to
21:19 whatever is banging into you the guy
21:22 back at the flippers that's probably the
21:25 g.od popping every once a while moving
21:27 your own giving you more energy to go in
21:30 a direction and sadly for way too long
21:35 in our lives we allow that to be the
21:37 case we're just this serendipitous
21:39 subtotal of everything that's happened
21:42 to us as opposed to being a very
21:44 deliberate creation of our own devices
21:49 right remember the old video of the old
21:52 pinball games no matter how old you are
21:54 you probably played one they had this
21:56 magnet button and it was above the
21:58 flipper button and in two different
22:00 locations on the playing field you get
22:03 this magnet thing and this electromagnet
22:05 it would turn on underneath the wood and
22:07 that ball would just go BAM and stick
22:09 and for the first moment other than when
22:12 you pull the flipper at the very
22:13 beginning the plunger right you're now
22:17 controlled that ball with a nut you can
22:19 move it around at all doesn't really
22:20 matter but at least you stopped it and
22:21 it's not gonna move until you say it
22:23 moves when I tell you that the 70s were
22:28 amazing in the 80s were amazing for the
22:30 reason that you were expected to come up
22:32 with your own fashion
22:35 you were expected especially in the 80s
22:36 to come up with your own hairstyle but
22:39 if you shave one side of your head and
22:41 left the other part to grow out you
22:43 colored in a million different ways you
22:45 do a tail you grow a mullet whatever you
22:47 did you were expected to come up with
22:49 your own look the shirts you picked the
22:52 pants you picked the shoes you picked
22:53 everything whether you wore a watch or
22:55 not I mean it was all you know what
22:57 sunglasses do you wear what eyewear do
22:59 you were you were expected to design
23:02 yourself and one of the major up tics of
23:05 that methodology is that by the time
23:09 life really started and whatever 18 22
23:12 depending on your schooling you already
23:15 had a tremendous amount of practice
23:17 taking control of your life and crafting
23:20 here you are and seeing the successes of
23:22 your decisions and the failures this
23:26 episode is about getting as much from
23:27 life as you possibly can
23:29 but even that imperative even that just
23:31 that goal can be crushing if you don't
23:37 temper it a little bit and make some
23:38 choices early in life we are taught by
23:42 marketing departments all around the
23:45 world that your to get everything that
23:47 you want constantly it's what credit
23:48 cards are about go get what you want I
23:50 just got this um it was an advertisement
23:54 in the middle of this video game I play
23:55 on my butt is app that I play on my iPad
23:59 and it does like interstitial ads to pay
24:01 for the play of the game which is
24:04 starting to get sadly prolific and it
24:07 shove me over to some Capital One credit
24:10 card and you scroll up this website you
24:12 just have to sit on the website for 60
24:14 seconds it's appalling nothing to look
24:16 at I already have a Capital One car what
24:18 the hell so I'm looking through and it's
24:20 telling me like a 10-point pitch about
24:22 why I should get a card it's all about
24:25 having fun and especially about blowing
24:28 your money in events where at the end of
24:30 the day your credit card bill has no
24:34 tangible equivalent meaning you're not
24:37 buying a guitar you could resell you're
24:39 not buying something of tangible you
24:41 know assets that you could actually sell
24:42 to someone else and make some money back
24:44 if you pinched yourself real hard it's
24:46 like going out to dinner going on
24:48 vacation
24:49 all perishable stuff so that's a
24:53 marketing department actually unless
24:56 you're rich unless you have a great job
24:57 or you have a lot of financial control
25:00 it's gonna destroy a lot of people's
25:02 lives because they're you know oh my god
25:03 free money but now let's go back to the
25:07 first quadrant you because this story is
25:13 really about you and it will simply
25:15 affect the other two it will affect what
25:19 professions you choose for yourself and
25:21 in the end when you're sound and you
25:24 love your job at least you like your job
25:27 what you have to offer your children and
25:30 your spouse or your partner it's gonna
25:33 be in invaluable remember when I told
25:37 you guys I repeat it all the time
25:40 because I want you guys to think about
25:41 it the way you determine your
25:46 compatibility with another human being
25:47 is to figure out what their purpose is
25:49 in life their theme of life do you help
25:56 others are you creative are you here to
26:00 create experiences are you here to help
26:03 those who do whatever your theme is in
26:07 life and it's usually very simple very
26:09 very simple you have to find a partner
26:12 that believes the exact same thing or at
26:14 least has to be supplementary you might
26:17 be the creative one and you're going to
26:19 partner with someone who enables your
26:21 creativity it's fantastic I got friends
26:24 that have live life's together like this
26:26 and man they're just powerhouses and
26:28 they're always happy it's tremendous but
26:32 how are you gonna find out the answers
26:34 to these questions hmm it goes back to
26:38 my old friend or my friend Eric I guess
26:42 he's kind of an old friend but my friend
26:44 Eric he told me once he goes um he likes
26:49 to hike out in the woods told story once
26:51 before but he said look what he likes to
26:53 be in nature he likes to hear nature he
26:55 likes to smell nature he likes to be in
26:57 it he just drives all over the place in
26:59 hikes is a big dude too
27:01 and he said one of the most frustrating
27:03 things is people walking by him with
27:06 headsets on that are so loud that he has
27:08 to hear their music and he said you know
27:11 it just infuriated him because he's like
27:13 why come out to the woods and and run
27:16 around if you're all you're gonna do is
27:18 put a headset in and dial out of being
27:19 in the woods when I go to a park or a
27:21 track because you really don't care
27:23 about anything now obviously he has an
27:26 opinion it's fairly fairly biased and I
27:28 can understand why they want to be in
27:30 nature at the same time but he made a
27:31 very profound comment at the end of his
27:33 statement his rant he said I just think
27:36 the younger people of this world can't
27:40 listen to their voice inside their head
27:42 they can't have a conversation with
27:45 themselves they can't hear themselves
27:46 because that's a terrifying voice of
27:49 perhaps failure and whether or not he's
27:53 accurate about that particular group of
27:55 people I definitely believe that that's
27:56 true I find that people who drive around
28:00 in their cars with just music playing
28:03 constantly they cannot drive their car
28:06 about how without having the stereo up
28:08 so loud that if you were to try to have
28:09 a conversation with them it's
28:11 technically impossible and variably they
28:14 try to have the conversation with you
28:15 and they end up saying what what what is
28:17 like hey turn the [ __ ] radio down
28:19 dude let's have a conversation like some
28:21 adults would do no I understand you want
28:26 some deep thoughts radio all day I mean
28:27 hey come on but you should have some
28:30 time we have nothing on and you think
28:33 about life and think about yourself and
28:34 you think about decisions you me some
28:36 that are good some that are bad now
28:40 making a bad decision I want to dispel
28:43 as quickly as possible in this episode
28:45 we all know that failure is literally
28:49 one of the most beneficial things you
28:51 can ever accomplish or experience I
28:53 should say because it tells you about
28:56 yourself don't feel bad if you fail feel
29:01 good it's like the old story that used
29:03 to tell us if we got into quality
29:05 assurance inside software companies and
29:07 they would say the rookie QA guy or gal
29:12 when they find a bug
29:14 they try to overlook it and not put it
29:16 in the bug database to be fixed because
29:18 they feel like they have committed a
29:20 crime
29:21 like they are responsible for the bug
29:24 instead of saying oh I got one now if I
29:28 report this and the coder fixes it then
29:31 however many million people buy the
29:32 product they're not going to ever have
29:33 this problem ever it's a good thing and
29:37 that's our life it's okay now when
29:42 you're younger that's when you want to
29:45 have all your mistakes happen from the
29:47 second you can start controlling your
29:48 life and I don't care how old you are
29:50 eight years old up right make those
29:53 decisions make those mistakes learn from
29:56 those mistakes and make different
29:57 decisions thus creating a more
30:01 beneficial happy life now as I've said
30:05 several times on the show when I was a
30:07 kid you you develop trade skills before
30:11 you're 18 tons of them you know before I
30:15 was 18 years old I could professionally
30:17 code a computer professionally that's
30:20 what I did when I came out I immediately
30:21 sat next to people 10 years older than
30:23 me and I was running loops around I
30:27 could paint professionally illustrate
30:29 professionally both digital and analog
30:30 oil and kerlick pin and in pencil right
30:35 there really Doug pastels her or was it
30:40 the chalk stuff the charcoal yeah I
30:45 could do it but I didn't like it though
30:47 messy and gross nobody wanted that crap
30:49 in their house anyway I could pretty
30:52 much service a car quite a ways
30:55 rebuilding an engine completely by
30:57 myself probably not but I could probably
31:00 do half of a engine rebuild by myself
31:03 depending on the car get in today's cars
31:05 are way more complicated back in the 80s
31:07 and early 90s you could still find the
31:09 spark plugs right without taking your
31:11 objection manifold off the top but I
31:14 know how to sing GLE I knew how to build
31:16 I mean I had all these skills and you
31:21 know you can assume that it was the
31:24 Stockman I was a clerk I mean it was
31:25 like all those little jobs you have in
31:28 your team
31:28 that'ss Adly that seemed to be the only
31:30 experience the kids have before they
31:33 need to get a job right so the cool
31:37 thing about that was when I moved to
31:38 California at 18 years old or 17 very
31:42 quickly 18 I just got an engineering job
31:46 instantaneously within a month and a
31:48 half I had the job great people asked me
31:53 if my high school ring was a college
31:55 ring but what do we have today you
31:59 almost never have any skills but the
32:02 kids who do are insane I hate the kids
32:04 who are teenagers who are developing
32:06 skills are like 3d animators 3d modelers
32:09 their video editors you know some people
32:13 really they just they just they're all
32:15 over the place some kids are some little
32:17 girls are like 14 to 12 and they can
32:19 shred a guitar that's certain happening
32:22 in the Zoomers are starting to come back
32:23 because they're sick and tired of this
32:25 this digital world of shallowness so
32:30 it's always a dream to see but now let's
32:34 talk about the career thing once you
32:38 figure out generally who you are as a
32:40 theme which is basically when do you
32:43 most turned on in the world when you're
32:45 not doing something physical with
32:46 somebody else but when you're totally by
32:48 yourself and you're creating something
32:49 or servicing something when are you most
32:52 happy once you figure out that theme
32:56 let's say that you like to create visual
32:58 experiences okay that's a theme how
33:03 could you create a visual experience
33:04 there's all kinds of ways you can create
33:07 a visual experience you could be a
33:09 painter or an illustrator and you're
33:11 gonna load up galleries with your work
33:13 with hopefully deep expressions inside
33:16 your work but you could be a
33:19 videographer and make your own movies
33:21 you could be a director and a writer do
33:24 your own editing on your computer that's
33:26 a visual experience has a lot of other
33:28 dimensions to it as well but that's part
33:31 of a visual experience you could be an
33:32 actor on stage creating a visual
33:36 experience for people to be a dancer
33:40 you see where I'm going with that right
33:44 once you figure out your themes you
33:47 could then figure out what careers feed
33:49 your theme what if your mathematician
33:53 those different levels of mathematicians
33:56 write a basic mathematician becomes an
33:59 effete astok accountant and saves
34:02 everybody's bacon you learn how to file
34:03 taxes you learn how to take care of
34:05 books and you make you have a job for
34:08 the rest of your life because an
34:09 accountant won't always have work it's
34:10 just it's just easy if you even went out
34:13 on your own agreed your own accounting
34:15 agency and then you bomb out you just
34:16 walk into any accounting agency around
34:18 the world and say I'm I'm a great
34:20 accountant got an open seat got some
34:23 clients I'll make it happen
34:25 but upper end mathematician might go off
34:28 to work for an aerospace company or you
34:31 work for a big machine learning company
34:33 and you get super intellectual with your
34:35 data analysis which is one of the
34:36 hottest careers in the world right now
34:39 I'm gonna give you one more and then
34:41 we'll move on if you were musical right
34:45 well there's musical people that know
34:47 how to recites music meaning they sit
34:50 down read sheet music and they're really
34:52 excellent at playing the oboe the violin
34:54 or whatever and so they can go work for
34:57 bands depending on their maybe their
34:59 drummer guitar player or whatever but
35:01 they can also work for you know
35:03 symphonies your Phil you know LA
35:07 Philharmonic I know a couple guys from
35:10 that for the LA Philharmonic because
35:13 they come down and smoke cigars with us
35:15 but you could also write music and sell
35:18 to other people one of my girlfriend's
35:19 answers ultra famous at this on in the
35:23 backend she's ultra famous nobody knows
35:24 who she is now but she writes all this
35:27 music for the kpop bands back in the day
35:30 in there
35:30 I guess you could call it a pop bands
35:31 the Japanese pop bands she just wrote
35:34 tons of it she wrote the lyrics
35:36 she wrote the music she'd teach the kids
35:37 how to pronounce the words and he just
35:39 blew up over there so she was a very
35:42 famous enabler and boy she got paid well
35:44 she owned her house the other thing that
35:47 is usually required with one of these
35:51 goals is you have to get educated about
35:53 the hell you doing but the sooner you
35:56 start that education could be ancillary
36:00 education as to pose as opposed to
36:03 primary education meaning if you have
36:06 never played any instrument in your
36:08 entire life but you feel this yearning
36:09 in your heart perhaps you have it in
36:11 your family you know your brain is wired
36:13 for it but you never have taken it up
36:15 and you're over 18 and so you're already
36:19 in the bill making realm of life so you
36:22 got to go make money to pay your bills
36:23 so you have a limited amount of time
36:24 between your career and living to learn
36:28 this you're gonna have to get some
36:29 formal education from somewhere it could
36:31 be a neighbor it could be a music store
36:33 it could be a college but you're going
36:35 to have to get some sort of formal
36:37 education to test yourself out you're
36:40 going to need you know
36:41 excuse me you're going to need music
36:43 theory you got any voice leading you're
36:46 gonna need to figure out what you do
36:47 what's your favorite instrument do you
36:49 sing
36:49 don't forget your voices as a major
36:51 instrument people ask me for 20 years
36:53 where you know what do you play I'd go
36:55 through the list of instruments that I
36:56 play and then eventually I just say you
36:59 know what I'm best at singing but I play
37:03 a bunch of instruments as well the
37:05 singing is where I just effortlessly
37:07 performing right so figuring out who you
37:12 are as an individual really requires for
37:14 you to listen to your own voice inside
37:16 your body and because most of us have to
37:19 get into a car to get to work and
37:21 carpooling just don't work in this world
37:23 right you have plenty of opportunities
37:26 to listen to yourself keep the radio off
37:29 take a few minutes between deep thoughts
37:31 radio episodes but the more you
37:34 understand who you are these decisions
37:37 start to become very easy to make you
37:42 are then designing yourself now we're
37:46 gonna get to this everything component
37:48 after we get to the basics here because
37:50 I suffer from the everything problem and
37:54 some of you do too if you don't thank
37:58 your lucky stars that you can focus when
38:02 I was a kid they always said learn how
38:03 to do one thing better than everyone
38:05 else and you'll never one
38:07 work for a living and to ever be out of
38:10 work and that's what that means as
38:13 you're so happy with what you do you
38:14 don't feel like you're working and
38:16 you're never out of work because someone
38:17 will always pay you to do that my mentor
38:21 and friend said me to just pass last
38:23 year that's what he did with his life he
38:27 drew from the age of three and up and he
38:31 was just wired to illustrate he just saw
38:34 the world in three dimensions when we
38:36 had no three-dimensional software I mean
38:39 my god this guy got to the age of 40
38:42 before there was any real methodology
38:46 for anyone in the world to create 3d
38:49 imagery at least in a commercial sense
38:53 and then he just went on you know by the
38:55 time he got the opportunity to be in
38:57 Star Trek the motion picture he had the
39:00 skills
39:01 well that's 1977 actually 76 77 by the
39:06 time you got into production on what he
39:09 had to draw which is the vide your
39:10 entity but by that time he even working
39:13 since the 50s he went to Art Center for
39:16 two years didn't technically graduate
39:19 until they gave him an honorary degree
39:20 he didn't care he was a concept designer
39:23 for Ford on his first day he went in to
39:25 just be a normal desire they saw his
39:27 portfolio and said gee who the hell is
39:29 this like that's the new kid tell him to
39:31 pack up his stuff and bring it upstairs
39:33 and he's jet-setting around the world to
39:35 be a concept designer Syd prepared his
39:38 skills so when the opportunity showed up
39:42 he walked right in with zero resistance
39:45 and I mean zero resistance so we want to
39:51 be like Syd in our own genre of whatever
39:53 we love to do now family relates to this
39:58 episode in that you know unless you're
40:02 Larry King having brand-new children at
40:04 80 years old there's usually a limit to
40:08 our capabilities of having children you
40:12 know women because of all the toxins
40:14 that are designed to make them sterile
40:16 they lose usually the capability of
40:19 carrying a child fourfold
40:21 say around 45 that's usually the oldest
40:24 female can pull it off these days and
40:26 it's all due to food toxins water toxins
40:29 air toxins because in my own town I mean
40:33 you know to have a baby at 50 wasn't a
40:36 huge deal the kids perfectly fine
40:39 perfectly fine so you know ladies have
40:46 this very interesting thing and I could
40:49 just tell you if some were to hold a gun
40:51 up to my head and say what's the what's
40:55 the cycle for women and desiring
40:57 children I say well some are born to
40:59 want it from 14 and up or even 12 and up
41:02 every every daughter likes a little B
41:05 because they have this maternal instinct
41:07 now technically speaking when a female
41:10 starts administrating that's really the
41:12 Nature's Way of saying you can have kids
41:14 now but obviously we penalize that sort
41:18 of thing in this world for good reasons
41:21 until at least they're 18 make some
41:23 decisions you know but at you know early
41:27 thirties is when the woman you know my
41:29 friend Jessica Chobot she I think she
41:33 was like 30 we're out having drinks this
41:37 before she met her husband and she was
41:40 saying I'll never have kids I'll never
41:41 and I'm looking at her thinking come on
41:43 you're beautiful you're SuperDuper
41:45 brilliant and you're just a fun person
41:47 you really play video games you know
41:49 like all these hot girls on the internet
41:51 that lie about playing video games and
41:53 the read a script and you know she's
41:56 like I had whatever I said look in two
41:57 years within two years you're gonna want
41:59 to have a child on a level that you
42:01 won't be able to control and two years
42:04 later she not only was married but she
42:06 had her first child she's happy as could
42:09 be and she's a career woman at the same
42:14 time I don't believe she has a second
42:15 child but it happened that happened
42:18 exactly like that
42:19 and hit her like a ton of bricks because
42:23 and I said it to her because I've had
42:25 plenty of friends that went through this
42:26 face now we all have different times
42:30 when things actually occur to us but
42:32 the the important thing I want to put on
42:38 you is that you have to think of
42:40 everything you would ever want to do in
42:42 life and then prioritize it based on
42:45 your age take all your risks when you're
42:48 young especially when you're living in a
42:50 room you're renting from some friend
42:52 you're you know maybe you're still
42:54 capable living at home and you're in a
42:55 nice area like Los Angeles for every
42:57 single career in the world exists plenty
43:00 save your money
43:02 take those risks do things for free that
43:04 you would never be able to do for free
43:05 when you're in your 30s because as you
43:09 move into your higher end goals that
43:11 those opportunities are much more
43:13 difficult to pull together unless you
43:15 have a very understanding wealthy
43:17 partner now I'm gonna tell you a story
43:20 but my buddy Bobby blazer who's the
43:22 drummer for rat he's told this story a
43:26 number of times in public but he told me
43:28 that because I edited his book as well
43:31 tales of a rat he told me that when he
43:36 was in his teens he first thought he
43:38 wanted to play the guitar his best
43:40 friend wanted to play the drums so his
43:42 best friend bought the drums he bought
43:43 the guitar and they started jamming
43:45 together and Bob started going hey you
43:47 mind if I play the drums a little bit
43:48 and he starts playing the drums and his
43:50 buddy goes well I'm not helping the
43:51 guitar
43:52 turns out they swap instruments
43:55 permanently just here you keep this I'll
43:57 take those but Bob told himself he says
44:01 if I'm not in this profession by the age
44:04 of 18 professionally
44:07 meaning every dime he generates to live
44:10 life is coming out of playing drums he
44:13 did they could ever make it as a rock
44:15 star by the age of 18 he was so good at
44:19 playing the drums he got pulled on a
44:21 world tour with this European guy who I
44:23 cannot remember his name he does two
44:27 years on a world tour he gets married
44:30 very quickly around 18 and by the time
44:34 the guys in San Diego who had a band
44:38 called Mickey Ratt which they then
44:39 chopped off the dudes name it took rat
44:41 at the NRA TT
44:44 they pulled bobbin because bob is 20
44:47 years old he's already done a two-year
44:49 world tour
44:50 he plays amazingly plays anything Bob
44:53 can play I think Bob knows like 3500
44:57 songs so he just show up to a concert
44:59 where people are playing other people's
45:01 music and he just goes oh yeah that song
45:03 boom boom if he doesn't know how to play
45:05 the song which is hilarious I was at a
45:08 concert once he did for his buddies
45:11 corporate party there's one song you
45:13 didn't quite remember and the the guys
45:16 just sat there and told him oh it's like
45:17 this and then you fill and then you do
45:19 this oh yeah I got it we went out and
45:21 just killed it so Larry's I have to say
45:23 that when you see a professional drummer
45:25 play versus your buddy who's really good
45:27 it is day and night men it is like
45:30 ballet versus you know crunking or
45:34 whatever so he made a goal and he got it
45:40 at 18 he planned his life you know I
45:46 think I've said before I was 14 and a
45:48 half and I'm at my house in Kansas it's
45:53 summertime and my dad's got me in this
45:55 ritual where he details a car for like
45:57 freaking 4 hours he gets $35 what a big
46:01 nerd thing that was we could have got a
46:03 hundred bucks with stuff he likes old
46:05 ladies so he's detail their cars and I
46:07 was the slave for the day you know D tar
46:09 and washing and polishing and buffing
46:11 and washing and you know also they crap
46:13 but somehow my dad again I got in this
46:15 conversation about my life which my dad
46:18 isn't that deep and so I was like
46:21 something came out where I said I said
46:25 we'll figure how I lit up to this but I
46:28 said he said something like you don't
46:30 know what you want to do with your life
46:31 I said yeah I do I want to be a computer
46:34 programmer I think you said it again you
46:38 dad's almost you know because he's he's
46:41 not being mean he's just taking the
46:43 average 14-year old and going I don't
46:46 know any 14-year olds who want to be
46:48 something and they actually be coming
46:50 right you're all full of crap
46:51 right and so I respect the fact that he
46:54 was just going with his instincts but
46:56 turns out that's what I
46:57 to do and he may have even galvanized me
46:59 a little bit more to become a badass
47:02 coder but I mean I was really really
47:05 good I mean I was like [ __ ] insanely
47:08 good in my another reason why I know
47:10 that is that when I started working with
47:12 adults and we started comparing
47:13 portfolios you know what I did for my
47:16 high school junior junior year term
47:19 project still eclipses most of my
47:22 friends entire life accomplishments and
47:25 so funny if I interview at a company and
47:27 I have to talk to these really young
47:29 kids they're like well you know under
47:31 your how do you know do your hand you
47:32 really know how to do this I'm just like
47:33 dude if you live to be a [ __ ] hundred
47:37 years old you'd be you'd be lucky to do
47:41 all this [ __ ] I've done in my lifetime
47:42 and coding it's really funny so don't
47:47 let anyone as well get into your brain
47:51 and [ __ ] on your dreams because they're
47:54 yours and I tell you the best way you
47:57 can avoid someone crapping on your
47:58 dreams and let me just say your narrator
48:02 speaking from experience and this seems
48:05 very counterintuitive don't tell anyone
48:11 don't tell anyone what you're doing just
48:14 do it and the longer it takes for you to
48:17 get that goal the more it's gonna be
48:19 difficult to conceal it
48:20 but don't tell anyone and it's a really
48:24 strange thing I mentioned this probably
48:26 three or four times and all the episodes
48:28 but I went to a ray bradbury's lecture
48:32 once in Ventura California my buddy Kyle
48:34 from in kilcher back in 89 he calls me
48:37 one day ray bradbury is gonna talk
48:39 it's his tiny venue we're gonna get to
48:41 medium and stuff and I said yeah dude
48:45 sure man I went out there and areas on a
48:46 podium or like eight feet from him he's
48:50 a science fiction writer if you guys
48:52 don't know he's on the most famous ones
48:54 of them all wrote the Martian Chronicles
48:57 but he said and he said when you start
49:01 writing a book he said don't tell
49:03 anybody because the universe gives you a
49:06 finite finite amount of energy to write
49:09 your book and if you spin that
49:11 economy on bragging about doing it
49:13 you're spending the the exact calorie
49:16 energy of creativity that would have
49:19 gone into the book and there's something
49:24 about that little thing that is applies
49:27 to anything that you're doing my uncle
49:30 stopped smoking once he said he
49:33 literally stopped forever he said you
49:35 know people go oh you know Clint is so
49:38 good for you to stop some and he said
49:39 don't don't do that
49:41 he said don't give me any celebration
49:43 for doing this just let me not smoke
49:46 anymore because I want to it's like
49:48 hiccups you know you don't think about
49:50 hiccups if you want to get rid of them
49:52 and as soon as you get rid of them don't
49:54 think about them anymore there you go
49:55 compress your diaphragm you'll get them
49:57 back again rate the other thing is is
50:00 that you will try careers that you don't
50:05 necessarily but you'll find out you
50:08 don't like them as much as you thought
50:09 you did and that's power
50:11 that's super power there is no need to
50:16 feel depressed at all try your career
50:19 and if you don't like it or whatever you
50:22 know you're trying to trade skill of
50:24 some sort if you don't like it do not
50:25 get depressed go completely opposite
50:28 direction go poof I thought I wanted to
50:30 do that and I don't think I do now it's
50:33 going to the next thing because there's
50:34 an infinite amount of things that you
50:35 want to do trust me
50:37 whether or not you realize it or not
50:38 just turn the radio off goes in out
50:41 somewhere and you'll have so much on
50:44 your list you you'll be back to being in
50:46 an anxiety level trying to deal with
50:48 which one should go first
50:51 but now let me throw this at you and I
50:53 don't know how many of you suffer from
50:55 this issue because I have suffered with
50:58 this issue and it's gonna sound
51:01 potentially braggadocious I apologize
51:04 and my son are so cystic it's not but
51:09 sometimes you're good at everything that
51:11 you touch because you think things
51:13 through you plan you design you don't
51:16 just jump in and you know hope you can
51:18 pull it off you look at it and go you
51:20 know I think I'm ready to do that yet
51:22 right like for instance
51:24 I'm trying to give a stupid one a stupid
51:27 one might be that you were in a scrappy
51:31 neighborhood when you were young and you
51:32 had to defend yourself by boxing or
51:36 whatever fighting in general every style
51:38 of fighting whatever your kids you don't
51:39 need style and maybe you went all the
51:41 way through 18 years of that stuff and
51:43 then you see UFC fight on TV and you're
51:45 like oh man I can jump in the Octagon
51:47 and do that and then you realize people
51:48 have mixed martial arts they have you
51:51 know Gracie jiu-jitsu and you're just
51:54 wrapped up like a pretzel in five
51:55 seconds and you can't breathe in your
51:57 time trying to tap out but you can't get
51:59 your hand out you know so the idea is
52:02 sometimes when you plan you look at that
52:06 UFC thing go man those are pros mcwrap
52:10 when I was a kid those guys will knock
52:11 you clean out right you might look at
52:15 fine art you want to be a painter or
52:17 something and you painted and you loved
52:19 it
52:20 but any other you look and you look at a
52:22 Rembrandt you go oh man okay how do I
52:25 get brushed steel like that you know and
52:27 make a facebook photo realistic okay
52:29 well it's gonna generally take this
52:31 amount of time to to practice and
52:34 practice and practice but sometimes it's
52:40 just I don't know like I have had
52:42 experiences where my biggest kiss of
52:44 death was I would try something and I
52:47 would ace it and then I would get bored
52:50 of it and move on to the next thing
52:51 which I guess it's not a crime but what
52:54 it did what it did was it gave me the
52:56 alkyl aid blew up my confidence that I
52:59 can figure out how to do stuff fell in
53:03 love with it did it and thought oh I'll
53:06 just put this aside for now and then
53:09 I'll come back to at a later time
53:10 sometimes I did and sometimes I didn't
53:13 and then your skills can atrophy right
53:17 kids who get you know well like I said
53:20 when I was nine I was probably painting
53:22 like I was 20 and so when I was 20 I
53:25 could bang out of painting in three
53:27 hours
53:27 that people in the 50s can't do you know
53:30 I mean it was just when these things and
53:31 then but then 20 years passes and I
53:34 haven't painted I haven't painted in
53:36 well that's not true I always have a
53:38 paint project haven't paid it like I
53:41 used to paint for probably 20 years
53:43 which is big giant you know album covers
53:45 and all kinds of wild stuff I do my own
53:48 wild surreal [ __ ] and I had just haven't
53:52 done that in a while
53:53 and if I did I'm gonna have to get back
53:54 into the whole thing I mean to oil them
53:57 I do krill ego kennels to be wet all
53:59 over my house constantly let's go cray
54:01 leaks or whatever okay now they do that
54:03 before but you know I wanted to write
54:06 music well oh my god I must have
54:09 practiced on a guitar for three years
54:11 for hours and hours and hours every
54:13 single day not taking any lessons like
54:15 an idiot I can read music but I can't
54:18 read it like live right you can't just
54:20 give me a sheet of paper and go there go
54:22 but I can sit with the band and watch
54:25 someone else play something and go oh I
54:27 see what key we're in and I can just
54:29 fiddle on the neck of a guitar and
54:30 figure out what key we're in it's kind
54:31 of horrible while I'm figuring out but
54:33 once I figured out man I then I could
54:34 riff it's crazy same with the piano
54:37 that's why like vocals cuz I can just
54:39 hear it and go boom and do whatever I
54:41 need to do but programming you know crap
54:45 like tax software and then getting back
54:48 to my roots and programming video games
54:50 drawing video games doing sound effects
54:54 writing scores for video games writing
54:56 scores for weddings scores for this and
54:59 that so I've I've developed a ton of
55:02 skills I was a professional all these
55:06 things you know four times it'd be like
55:08 someone asked me what do you do for a
55:09 living and in that particular year I've
55:13 been a database engineer an internet
55:16 database engine I've been an artist I've
55:19 been an artist for fashion I've been
55:20 artists for the websites I've done 3d
55:23 yard I've done 2d yard I've done sound
55:25 effects packages for the Gameboy
55:27 advanced you know I didn't Madden and
55:30 toy soldiers and but this thing time
55:33 running a big department of a bunch of
55:35 folks I mean it's just like it's hard to
55:36 say it was like and I just do a lot of
55:38 stuff and I'm also studying
55:40 screenwriting on the side so you can get
55:44 to a point where you are in love with
55:46 several different things
55:49 so what do you do to deal with that well
55:54 if you're young I want you to a big grin
55:56 on your face and say maybe I can get it
55:59 all but let's prioritize we don't
56:05 usually prioritize our love and life
56:10 financially but there is a there is a
56:14 definite benefit to that when you look
56:18 at all the careers you could do which
56:21 one's gonna pay the most and which one
56:23 are you the most inclined to be good at
56:25 right now even if there's a learning
56:27 curve you get a little bit of a learning
56:29 curve on this one very steep learning
56:30 curve on that one the little one doesn't
56:34 pay as much as the big one but you can't
56:36 get to the big one for X number of days
56:38 months years so you have to do a little
56:41 bit of a game inside your mind to say
56:43 okay here's what's gonna happen I'm
56:46 gonna professionally do this lessor one
56:49 but I don't need to learn much because
56:50 I'm gonna do that little tiny learning
56:52 curve move into that profession and then
56:55 do that eight hours a day or whatever
56:57 and then I know if you got about four
56:59 hours because I'm young had only kids
57:01 don't have a wife or a husband I got
57:02 four hours after work to learn this big
57:05 one then on the weekends it's 12 hours a
57:08 day boom boom in a row if you can crank
57:10 out more than do it but don't get
57:12 yourself too tired because then you
57:13 won't absorb new information even though
57:17 some amazing things gonna happen and the
57:18 quote unquote well Valerie are the 11th
57:22 hours it used to say and then I want you
57:25 to use the old Tony Robbins trick
57:28 because this is what is really powerful
57:31 now I'm gonna say this to you and you're
57:34 gonna hear it and you might agree right
57:35 away and for those of you done Tony
57:37 Robbins you definitely know what I'm
57:39 talking about here but here's the trick
57:41 of what I'm about to say you're gonna
57:44 hear it and if you don't do something in
57:46 your life to write it down you're gonna
57:50 do it once or twice and you're not going
57:52 to do it again and it's not because
57:53 you're fighting me or fighting the
57:56 theory or being lazy even you're simply
57:59 going to forget if you don't put it down
58:01 on a post
58:02 somewhere post-its are actually
58:04 phenomenal little mechanisms one
58:06 remember if you write something down
58:08 with an analogue hand you remember way
58:11 more than typing it into a computer the
58:14 reason why I remember my movies from
58:16 front to back if someone says what
58:18 happens and you know this general area
58:20 of act 2 act 3 or 4 I can punch in it's
58:25 because I've written it down with my
58:26 hand first several several times
58:28 re-enacted it for friends analog right
58:31 and then I just happen to have a digital
58:33 copy of the actual tax rate but here's
58:37 the trick in order to give yourself a
58:41 little bit of glue a little bit of
58:44 double stick tape inside your brain to
58:46 go get these things that you eventually
58:47 prioritize and again I recommend
58:49 everything be analog pen and paper to
58:53 write all this stuff down we have to get
58:56 back to that we have and it's not be be
58:58 me an old-fashioned guy it's just me
59:00 being me using the if the tried and true
59:06 techniques to make your brain function
59:08 deeper to remember it better
59:11 you need to envision the world that you
59:14 will be in if you get that goal what do
59:20 I mean all right
59:22 you let's say or um a painter I love
59:26 going for creative things cuz it's way
59:28 easier what does a painter get to do for
59:31 a living
59:32 travel the world pick a genre and paint
59:36 paint expressions maybe have your own
59:38 little studio one you don't have the
59:41 eight-hour day grind for someone else
59:43 you've got a 10 to 12 hour drive for
59:45 yourself but it's like sex it's so much
59:48 fun you don't want to stop it
59:50 and you you know when you really get
59:53 into painting you can barely find the
59:58 the Constitution to finish the one that
60:01 you're on the perseverance to finish the
60:03 one you're on because you're dreaming
60:04 about the next one you're gonna make and
60:07 so you can't sell yourself out short
60:09 stick with your details be your own
60:11 abstract critic that's once its biggest
60:13 points in life is you have to be able to
60:15 abstract
60:15 self away from what you're doing and to
60:17 be critical of what you do and that'll
60:20 make you the best of anything that you
60:22 do in life but what life you're gonna
60:26 have what conspicuous consumption do you
60:29 want to get into do you want to have a
60:30 five million dollar house do you want to
60:32 have a five hundred thousand dollar car
60:34 you want addresses in special suits
60:36 every single day you want to just be
60:38 looking like you're a beach bum you got
60:41 your house and Oahu and but you're
60:45 actually worth millions you know who
60:46 cares maybe it's not money at all maybe
60:48 it's I just want to have a a wife or a
60:51 husband that loves me that empowers me
60:53 doesn't try to put my flame out you know
60:55 the person that's attracted to your
60:57 flame but the second they get you they
60:58 try to put you out you want to have some
61:00 beautiful kids they grow up in a world
61:03 that perhaps you didn't have a chance to
61:05 grow up in or maybe you want them to
61:06 grow up in the exact kind of world did
61:09 you grow up in envision what you're
61:14 going for probably wouldn't be a bad
61:18 idea to go back and listen to my episode
61:20 of Law of Attraction because there's a
61:21 lot of that DNA in that episode of how
61:24 to do it way back in season one I
61:27 believe a lot of you are very familiar
61:31 with those the image boards that people
61:35 create so you get a cork board if you
61:37 want to make it really dynamic and easy
61:40 but you look up a bunch of pictures of
61:42 things that you want in life you print
61:44 them out and you put them on this board
61:47 and you could be all over your apartment
61:49 all over your car it there's no rules
61:52 man I told you guys that I've gone
61:56 through my Lamborghini phase right
61:57 really funny story for me when I got a
62:00 chance to drive a Huracan for about six
62:03 months it was one of the most religious
62:06 experiences I've ever had because of the
62:08 utter craftsmanship of this car and it
62:10 just felt like me you know it just I
62:13 don't know it was the most beautiful
62:15 white with black trim badass Huracan is
62:19 my girlfriend's car it's a you know two
62:24 hundred and twenty thousand dollar car
62:26 and so I remember telling her in the car
62:29 I said you know this it's gonna be hard
62:31 for you to believe me but I said this
62:33 car is completely inspired my entire
62:35 life to get to this level and so for the
62:38 next couple years I put it as my
62:40 background on my computer I rotated
62:42 through a few different models and it
62:45 was just this juice I want to have my
62:47 start up with my LED screen technology I
62:50 you know should have easily paid for
62:51 that car in two seconds but of course
62:53 things happened but here's what ended up
62:56 happening in the end ended up hanging
62:59 out my smoke lounge a lot and we had a
63:01 kid in there whose entire family fixed
63:04 his exotic cars and even though he said
63:06 look all the new Lamborghinis are really
63:08 well put together there's not a bunch of
63:10 maintenance issues but he said you know
63:12 the brake job is like eight thousand
63:15 dollars if you have to you know fix your
63:17 rotors get your rotors some of the
63:19 aventador rotors your 25 grand he said
63:22 you know it gets really expensive really
63:24 fast even when all things are going
63:26 right for you so you have to have mega
63:29 bunny and I started thinking about that
63:32 and I started looking at the car I
63:35 started also seeing those videos of kids
63:37 spit on the cars scratch the cars
63:39 because they're so jealous that anyone
63:42 can own those vehicles plus there's a
63:43 bunch of douchebags that just own them
63:45 and where I live some good people own
63:47 him where I live - so I thought you know
63:48 what I'm gonna get lumped into a bunch
63:50 of crap that I don't want to get lumped
63:51 into and I divorced my mind from the
63:54 concept but it's because they created
63:57 that focus board thing that I was able
63:59 to go through the entire kubler-ross
64:01 effect you know anger denial negotiation
64:04 acceptance with letting go of that idea
64:08 now if I stumble on to ten million
64:11 dollars I will show you my Huracan what
64:15 I wanted to be a musician in the 90s I
64:19 was just I just kept getting better and
64:21 better and better my studio software and
64:23 cranking out music and it was just it
64:26 was just really living with the Angels
64:29 in terms of just writing a bunch of
64:31 music but I started of course it was the
64:34 90s and so you start hearing about the
64:36 tours that were happening in the 90s
64:37 with all the heroine and all this other
64:38 crap
64:39 people started overdosing and then I'm
64:42 just going geez
64:43 I wouldn't want to have that lifestyle
64:46 ever just to walk on the stage you know
64:49 for a couple hours a night and get
64:51 worshipped by a bunch of fans and then
64:54 hit the road again and have to you know
64:56 sit in the bus for 36 hours to get to
64:59 the next city and when I finally met Bob
65:00 and we started hanging out he started
65:02 telling me the stories of what it was
65:03 like it and the 90s it was a little bit
65:05 better they get me near a mega
65:07 multi-platinum band you can fly every
65:10 once in a while these bands don't fly as
65:12 much as you think they do but that what
65:14 happens with bands and rappers and all
65:17 this [ __ ] is that they will make one big
65:21 giant VIP trip someone will pay them to
65:24 do a VIP trip like they'll say oh you
65:26 want me there we're gonna have to put me
65:27 on a g5 and into someone some
65:30 corporation will do it or some venue
65:31 will do it and they get the cameras out
65:34 and they film the crap out of that and
65:35 they make it look like every time I
65:37 travel I fly my own personal private jet
65:40 you know you know Prince nearly went
65:43 bankrupt with that regimen because he
65:45 was flying the Concorde constantly it
65:48 literally said he had to sell his
65:50 catalog to Warner Brothers because he
65:53 had managed to get himself in so much
65:54 debt
65:55 flying jet-setting between Paris and
65:58 Minneapolis a little big deal but I
66:03 tuned out of it I literally let go of my
66:05 music ambitions because of that which
66:07 was dumb now I look back I have a little
66:11 bit of regret of like I didn't achieve
66:14 like one song that was sold in the
66:17 public eye like a like a Crystal Method
66:19 song or something a prodigy song I
66:22 should have pushed one all the way out
66:23 the door and at least given up at that
66:26 point if I still want to do it but that
66:28 point I'd have massive skills and would
66:30 have been able to continue cranking it
66:31 out and of course the sad thing about
66:34 Allmusic is that unless you're really
66:36 lucky to come up with your own very
66:38 specific sound and texture everything in
66:40 creating the past sounds like crap
66:42 because you can hear the old instruments
66:43 the old keyboards and stuff feeling me
66:46 you made a Beatle buddy and so you know
66:51 but as you you know they say the time
66:54 heals all that's another methodology if
66:57 you do
66:57 have a regret and it's almost I mean
67:00 there's massive regret that very few
67:02 people have in this world the time will
67:04 heal almost everything that you have as
67:06 a regret even a relationship you didn't
67:08 have something you said to someone you
67:11 know I don't know if I ever did an
67:14 episode on regret to check that out and
67:17 I've talked about it quite a bit but
67:20 there was this super embarrassing moment
67:23 that I had I think just prior to moving
67:25 to San Francisco where I had this kind
67:27 of cleared out of my system but I was
67:29 raised in the Midwest and there was a
67:35 this is just a little digression on
67:37 regret for one second it was probably my
67:39 most embarrassing moments of my entire
67:41 lifetime
67:42 I went to San Diego I told story one
67:45 time so if you remember this you have an
67:47 elephants memory I go to San Diego and
67:51 we're staying at this beach house that
67:52 this dude owned he was this massive
67:54 landscape or like super famous
67:56 landscaper for all the big big
67:58 aristocratic families that lived down
68:00 there we're talking about the heirs to
68:01 like Sears and Roebuck Montgomery Ward
68:04 all those kind of kids very trust fund
68:06 kids many of them are still CEOs of
68:10 their parents company but I'm with my
68:13 girlfriend and we got two people in the
68:16 front we were a couple and we had the
68:17 guy that owned the house to my right I'm
68:21 saying you know a little too backseat
68:22 and they turned on the radio and it was
68:26 Kenny G now it doesn't take a genius to
68:30 realize that if you're metal head or a
68:32 techno fan and Kenny G comes on was a
68:34 little you know whatever you call it
68:35 thing just a saxophone or clarinet
68:38 somewhere in the middle there the thing
68:40 with the reed you know it's real soft do
68:44 you know Quiet Storm kind of music and
68:46 everybody in the car took a [ __ ] on this
68:48 guy everyone was like oh yeah yeah that
68:51 guy and I said the F word f AG I called
68:57 him an F AG okay I am NOT saying that
69:01 because of his perceivable orientation
69:05 he's straight as an arrow but I said the
69:07 word because that music just it was a
69:09 phrase that I learned in the Midwest
69:11 and again we didn't have anyone it was
69:14 profoundly out of the closet and those
69:16 who were we respected a hundred percent
69:17 so I'm just saying this is just like a
69:19 slur I'm holding my girlfriend's hand
69:22 over here to the left she's from Queens
69:24 New York so she's like yeah tough hombre
69:27 she start smashing my fingers and it
69:31 surprised me was like whoa I was like
69:33 what you know the guy next to me is gay
69:37 who owns the house who has been nothing
69:40 but a gentleman it's all of us and he
69:42 was cool he heard a million times and
69:46 later you know she told me the case gay
69:49 you know and I didn't have any Gator a
69:50 story guy like the guy who just didn't
69:53 have anything you know flamboyant about
69:54 him or anything maybe that would've
69:56 helped me out not saying stupid things
69:58 but I felt awful obviously that I said
70:03 something didn't mean what it sounded
70:04 like I said I hear him if anything this
70:06 guy has been nothing but a gentleman to
70:07 us and then the mistake I made so that's
70:10 the first level regret but I'm 21 years
70:13 old
70:13 fresh 21 so I lack the maturity to pull
70:20 him aside and say I'm really sorry about
70:23 what I said I didn't mean it the way it
70:25 sounded because he probably would have
70:27 said a door he was like the edgiest dude
70:30 you've ever met in your life I mean this
70:31 guy told jokes at the at the dinner
70:34 table that I couldn't possibly repeat on
70:37 this show I couldn't even repeat the
70:38 word he was defining on the show which
70:40 is a very sexual thing and so he was
70:45 very edgy he wasn't like some soft but
70:48 anyway it haunted me so bad that like
70:51 about five years later before the
70:53 internet was out there I tried to find
70:55 out who he was and I actually called the
70:57 ex-girlfriend I said look who was that
70:59 guy there's no I have no idea why I said
71:02 well you know I said that thing in the
71:04 carny she's just laughs she was like you
71:05 think he's gonna remember that she she
71:08 said you think he's gonna remember you
71:10 that's like yeah you're probably right
71:12 I just felt horrible so you can make bad
71:14 decisions outside of your own personal
71:17 preferences about what you want to do
71:19 with your life so in your life it's all
71:23 about
71:24 missed opportunities but if you even
71:27 have two things you want to do that
71:30 whatever age you are you're gonna have
71:32 to make the choice that's why you really
71:35 need to sit down and think everything
71:36 through and maybe as analytical as this
71:39 sounds and it's pragmatic and non
71:41 creative as this is although I think
71:43 it's fairly pretty creative take your
71:46 two ideas put pros and cons down the
71:50 column right two-sided comm pros and
71:52 cons right all the pros you can imagine
71:54 about your life if you get that career
71:57 and then all the cons that you might
71:59 have to incur such as I want to be a
72:02 professional musician okay money maybe
72:07 you're famous for the rest of your life
72:08 which makes life a little bit easier and
72:11 you'll be able to create a nest egg
72:12 before you're 40 and then maybe don't
72:14 have to work anymore because the cons
72:18 are you gonna be on the road a lot
72:19 you're not gonna be all have a normal
72:21 family anymore you're gonna be around a
72:23 lot of drugs and alcohol and you're on
72:26 you're on the hook for an album every
72:28 single year do you have the Constitution
72:29 to great brand new songs twelve
72:33 acceptable hits every 12 months if any
72:38 of you know the story of Boston the band
72:41 which I always thought the album covers
72:43 were just some of the coolest stuff ever
72:44 and I was gonna confuse cuz Boston's
72:46 album covers and yellows album covers
72:49 look very very similar Boston I believe
72:52 the story goes they made two albums and
72:54 they're just from outer space man I mean
72:57 they're so amazingly crafted and
72:59 produced it is it's like Allah you know
73:02 you may not like ABBA but their music is
73:04 like alien [ __ ] man it's like they're
73:06 aliens that came down and Sweden or
73:09 something or Switzerland wherever
73:10 they're from there and they were
73:12 insanely talented may not be I hated
73:14 them lotta Tatum but I wasn't lazy on
73:16 her when I was a kid listen to kiss
73:18 mom's was an Abba out front but now as I
73:20 listen to them as an adult music was
73:23 amazing and Boston is one of those bands
73:25 the Boston created a third album so here
73:29 they are just tearing up the charts in
73:30 the early eighties mid 80s they came up
73:34 with this well they wrote this third
73:35 album but they got in some big dispute
73:37 between
73:38 the band members or the record label or
73:40 something and it took a long time for
73:43 that album to come out by that time it
73:47 came out and you had the hardcore Boston
73:49 fans about it but it wasn't onboarding
73:52 new fans missed opportunities and was it
73:57 really worth it only they'll be able to
73:59 tell you and the you know the the thing
74:04 that we have to here's a positive way to
74:08 look at this this argument that I'm
74:10 proposing in this episode which is you
74:11 can't have everything that you want you
74:14 will never get everything you want how
74:15 could you get everything that you want
74:17 hopefully you can because you have a
74:19 really short list and your priorities
74:23 will change just so that you know for
74:24 those of you of my age or older you
74:26 definitely know this is the case you
74:28 have a bunch of stuff on your list in
74:29 your 20s it's a little bit smaller your
74:31 30s and then it's almost like it has
74:34 every decade so let's say you have 20
74:36 things that you want to do when you're
74:38 in your 20s it's 10 things in your 30s 5
74:41 things in your 40s and maybe two and a
74:44 half and your 50s and then you're down
74:45 to whatever you got in your sixties
74:47 right you may not be able to get
74:50 everything that you want and you may
74:52 hate that challenge someone saying to
74:54 you you know you can't have everything
74:55 in joint and then you're just like screw
74:57 you I'm gonna get it hey forget that
75:00 have to keep it as long as you can
75:01 especially if you're young because just
75:03 that bumper-car attitude towards life or
75:05 you just kind of crash into everything
75:07 hey it's testing your brain it's testing
75:11 who you are as a person it's testing
75:13 Society and because you normally have to
75:16 cooperate or have opportunities that are
75:18 provided by the culture of your time you
75:21 you may want to do something like what
75:24 if you want to be a crooner singer okay
75:26 we don't have very many crooners anymore
75:29 right you're sort of Frank Sinatra kind
75:31 of guys but maybe that because that's so
75:35 unique you can find a few nightclubs or
75:37 casinos in Vegas or Atlantic City or all
75:41 the other casinos in the world to do
75:43 that profession and do it really really
75:44 well used to be that crooner guy and one
75:48 of the Star Trek series that Cameron
75:50 which one
75:53 Voyageur I think think he was enterprise
75:58 geez I can't remember so sometimes you
76:01 will have everything set up
76:03 but life the world society isn't
76:06 interested that's pretty rare but it
76:10 can't happen to you but here's my here's
76:12 my thing to you okay you may not be able
76:15 to get everything that you want but
76:18 nothing should be able to nothing should
76:20 be able to stop you from at least
76:24 getting your favorite ones and that's a
76:28 pretty decent compromise wouldn't you
76:29 say
76:31 now I'm not personally convinced that as
76:38 long as your list is like five or less
76:40 and you're in your 20s or your late
76:43 teens I'm not sure there's a lot of
76:46 problems you're gonna have with getting
76:48 up to five plus there are different
76:52 levels of getting it right so I gave you
76:56 some personal examples of my own let's
76:58 say that what I just told you about my
77:00 music career was fully realized at least
77:04 to the level one of realization right
77:08 instead of me getting wrapped up and a
77:11 bunch of sidetracking stuff in the 90s
77:13 when I was really hot and making music I
77:16 focused I cranked out one tune then my
77:20 one-hit wonder thing right I get it on
77:23 will soon to be iTunes let's say I even
77:28 get some Club Play it's a radio play it
77:30 was in the Bay Area I probably could
77:31 have walked into half the nightclubs and
77:33 played it but I get one at least and you
77:38 know once you make one you can you can
77:39 pull out derivatives for at least three
77:41 or four other tunes
77:42 you know exact plagiarized himself so
77:45 the p-funk sort of prints you you're
77:47 told to plagiarize yourself when you
77:49 start talking to a record producer per
77:51 album at least rate but let's say I get
77:54 that out and I hang it up well it's not
77:57 a full-fledged totally successful music
78:00 career but I will at least have the one
78:03 sort of proof that I could do it and now
78:07 that proof would be a lot more difficult
78:10 to do because I'm older then I got bills
78:13 and I got other goals right but let me
78:17 just take you down my path so my path
78:21 for those five things would have been
78:22 being a professional artist did it
78:26 several times in several different
78:27 media's mediums excuse me being a
78:31 programmer I programmed you know tax
78:35 stuff corporate stuff video games being
78:40 a musician okay well I definitely get
78:42 paid several times to be a musician from
78:45 video games to both like you know
78:48 knockout Kings and AD in their 98 to the
78:52 gameboy advance stuff plus a bunch of
78:54 private venue stuff I got paid to do it
78:57 it was a blast now the one I didn't
79:00 realize that I wanted to do but when I
79:02 finally got bit by it I loved it which
79:04 was having my own company I've always
79:07 had my own company since I geez was
79:11 probably at least 23 years old but I was
79:17 a sole proprietor and so that when I
79:19 started my video game company I got a
79:21 chance to experience you know I had a
79:22 ton of people Electronic Arts as
79:24 employees like 55 people there start my
79:27 own company you only got to about thirty
79:28 at the biggest but we employed a 75 man
79:31 teaming in Peru burned by a British guy
79:37 and his wife so you know it depends on
79:40 how you splice that old thing but making
79:42 people's lives and their dreams come
79:44 true through my entity was just a reward
79:48 that I couldn't have couldn't have
79:51 imagined right I guess being an educator
79:54 is something else I've done but you know
79:56 I never imagined being an educator it
79:58 just happened sort of like being in
80:00 charge of my own company or whatever but
80:03 this last one is writing film right and
80:06 so you know I've got three films that
80:10 are pending right now and so you know
80:15 if one of those pops then there you go
80:19 I've sent one to the top and out the
80:23 door and so the only way to really hedge
80:26 that bet is to just continue writing
80:29 original content constantly don't rip
80:31 off anyone else's idea be original
80:33 because hey you know it was Bernie and
80:36 Hollywood Oh someone's gonna rip off
80:38 your idea I'm like well you know we'll
80:41 come to a settlement if that ever
80:42 happens it'll be soft and easy for
80:44 everyone but honestly a ripoff artist
80:48 that's all they can do is this rip stuff
80:50 off and then they'll be exposed for
80:52 being ripoff artists and then they'll
80:53 lose their job me I'll never run out of
80:57 ideas I'll never run I I have probably
81:00 let's see I've written four of the 17
81:02 ideas I have and I just came up with an
81:04 18th idea which is I should be my next
81:06 script and so you know I've got plenty
81:08 of scripts to write for the rest of my
81:10 life and I'm gonna have new ideas as
81:12 time passes right but I have to
81:15 prioritize my life you know this show I
81:19 would have never imagined in a million
81:21 years making this show and it was my
81:23 buddy Kyle with the other show the audio
81:26 show only MK ULTRA radio that you know
81:29 if you go to the YouTube channel it's
81:31 actually YouTube and then it's like a
81:32 see I guess for channel and then it's
81:34 you'll see in cable to radio because
81:36 this channel right now that you're
81:37 watching on YouTube used to be the MK
81:39 ULTRA radio channel and I've since moved
81:42 all those into their own channel and
81:44 archive them all they're very current
81:48 events and so they don't really have a
81:49 lot of value going back and listening to
81:51 them like like these episodes that are
81:53 more generic and you know the meat of
81:55 life sort of thing but you better
81:58 believe man I mean on my whiteboard in
82:01 my office right now just so that you
82:03 understand the DNA of my life
82:05 one the time management episode I
82:07 created in season 1 which is on the
82:10 website deep thoughts radio calm you
82:12 won't find it here on this channel is
82:15 something that I do every single day as
82:18 a regimen which is every place I am in
82:21 the world I am trying to either push one
82:25 of my goals forward or I'm taking a very
82:26 strategic break I know how many minutes
82:28 an hour
82:29 I'm gonna spend doing it I don't like
82:31 check my watch or anything but not gonna
82:34 do still and every once in a while to
82:35 chill out and eat food I just went there
82:37 the other day and every row to ride I
82:38 just ate and had a drink and hang out
82:40 with my friend and boom it's great but
82:44 on my on the whiteboard in my office I
82:49 have I think I called it like ideas I
82:54 think I've got also my phone as well but
82:58 I've got a list of 10 things that I'm
83:01 gonna do in 2020 I think the list should
83:04 be complete within the first quarter of
83:07 this year and then I have things that
83:10 are business things that are in a second
83:13 list which is my to-do list so the
83:16 idealist is brand new things that I've
83:18 never moved you know an atom in that
83:22 direction but I'm gonna do this is like
83:24 developing new product lines and
83:26 pitching the right person to making
83:29 phone calls like I'm gonna go back to
83:31 Chapman University this year talking
83:34 like my my acquaintance slash friend if
83:39 we spend more than an hour together
83:40 we're friends again but bill crier who
83:42 gets me into teaching lecture on
83:44 weekends and so I'm gonna do that
83:46 because it just keeps me nice and fresh
83:48 and I mean I haven't taught a single I
83:51 haven't done a single classes there I
83:53 don't think since I've started this show
83:56 which maybe me or maybe not sure I'm not
84:00 sure if I taught it gnomon School for
84:03 film and television several times during
84:05 this show so I'm gonna you know brush
84:08 off some of my old curriculums and get
84:10 in there and just you know try to pass
84:12 this kind of information directly to
84:14 students for the various subjects that I
84:16 teach and so you know when I walk in the
84:20 office it's written analog on the sheet
84:23 now
84:23 even though it's written there yours
84:25 truly has to turn around and read it to
84:28 myself once a day even if I could just
84:31 recited to you I still read it off the
84:32 board because it reprogram is in my mind
84:34 to remember okay you were gonna spend X
84:38 amount of time at dinner X amount of
84:40 time at the smoking lounge I always
84:41 bring my computer with me so I can
84:42 always
84:43 about now sometimes what I do is I'll
84:47 play a round of like little video games
84:50 little apps and stuffs you know just
84:52 kind of check in those games you just
84:53 kind of have to do your base i play
84:55 clash of clans i've played it for geez
84:57 since it came out i play a few other
84:59 games like that so you're in and out in
85:02 like three minutes but you get that
85:04 little fill I played I played a little
85:07 bit my brain didn't have to think about
85:08 anything and so that is you know the
85:14 basis of how I live my life right now I
85:17 mean I I go to sleep about 4 o'clock at
85:19 night in the morning
85:20 it's probably about 2:30 or 3:00 right
85:23 now and I'll wake up seven hours later
85:26 typically force myself out of bed think
85:30 about all my dreams I go eat my lunch
85:32 eat the same lunch every single day this
85:34 same food the same restaurant every
85:36 single day in the middle the afternoon
85:38 keeps my metabolism super high so I can
85:41 not gain weight would stay full all day
85:43 I come home I work a good probably six
85:47 hours at least I hop out do my dinner
85:51 5050 I'll either go home again but I'll
85:54 make it to my lounge talk to my buddies
85:55 to get a little bit of social
85:56 interaction because we're always looking
85:58 at the new conspiracy stuff new queue
86:00 updates news updates watch a movie
86:02 together just laugh together think about
86:05 new ideas share whatever happened in our
86:07 day I'm usually out of there by around
86:09 10:30 11 o'clock and then I come home
86:12 work at other three hours and then I do
86:15 an episode and I crash and the whole
86:17 thing repeats that's my my regiment
86:20 right now and I mean involved right now
86:24 and my god probably probably no less
86:28 than for businesses and I have probably
86:32 at least three or four clients that I
86:35 help on a routine basis as well so my
86:38 life is very fresh and just new you know
86:40 I go help all my friends who's running
86:42 for Senate and I'll go help one for any
86:44 selling his instruments my comedian
86:46 client my last one best buddy Jimmy
86:48 Della Valle will update his website then
86:52 I'm working on a new script and most of
86:54 the script working is in my head right
86:55 now but I'm at the point now
86:57 we're starting to overflow need to get
86:59 out on paper and so I'm going through my
87:02 regiment there so I push every single
87:08 day when I had my child you know at my
87:12 house when she was little you know I
87:14 worked around her schedule she always
87:17 got up before me always be up within
87:20 half an hour an hour and fer waking up
87:22 and then you know I get her up and get
87:23 her fed and get her watching her
87:25 favorite old school movie was either
87:28 Willy Wonka or Wizard of Oz that was her
87:30 two best two favorite films she just
87:32 chill watch I come out eventually and
87:34 then you know take care of all her
87:37 things spend the whole day with her
87:38 chilling out and then of course she's in
87:40 bed by 6 or 7 o'clock at night when she
87:43 was really little and then as she got
87:45 older I let her watch my regiment so it
87:48 kind of wore off on her and so you know
87:51 it's no mystery to me that she went
87:53 through college and kicked its ass and
87:54 became a teacher in chemistry it was
87:56 like I brought her up in science made
88:00 some mistakes in that room because I
88:01 didn't have all this knowledge I have
88:03 today but in the end she got a great
88:05 career in a great subject matter which
88:07 it works because it's real it's not some
88:10 foo-foo career right and so you know we
88:14 have teachers and all throughout my
88:15 family so my kid being a teacher is like
88:17 oh yeah totally
88:19 it's in your blood kid you know enjoy it
88:22 and she's loving it right so get serious
88:28 about your life you can design
88:32 everything that's a variable in your
88:34 life your appearance your attitude your
88:38 vocabulary I used to change my
88:40 handwriting every year every single
88:42 character from A to Z I would write it
88:44 differently every single year just cuz I
88:46 changed my signature every single year
88:48 and so I could look at a piece of paper
88:51 that I signed I go oh I know that's a e6
88:53 that's 87 it's 88 to 89 I can see but
88:56 what I had done I could paint a painting
89:00 and not put the year on it because I
89:02 knew that signature meant a particular
89:04 year but that goofed up my mind to be
89:06 able to be very sad extra swith just
89:10 character recognition
89:11 it also changed my mind about how to
89:13 write e you know so you can design
89:16 everything about who you are and make
89:20 those choices so that you may not get
89:22 everything but to get all the ones that
89:25 you love and all the ones that are
89:26 important that you continue to be in
89:29 love with again you can want something
89:32 try it and bail out and pat yourself on
89:35 the back and it's almost as if you have
89:38 that kind of moment occur it would be
89:40 almost like go make yourself a trophy or
89:41 one of those trophy stores and put it in
89:43 your office because that was you
89:45 figuring out something very important
89:46 about yourself and what it did was it
89:48 put a rocket engine and all the other
89:50 ones so you were like nope no I want to
89:52 do that I wanted this one and then
89:54 kaboom Bobby blazer thought he want to
89:57 play guitar into playing drums five
89:59 platinum albums leader and however many
90:02 millions of dollars the guy made he's
90:04 happy with his change he's happy with
90:06 the failure that he didn't want to play
90:08 the guitar
90:09 and the funny thing is he actually plays
90:11 guitar still he plays the bass and he
90:12 plays a lot of stuff but drumming is
90:14 what he does beautifully right
90:17 so hopefully this episode is very
90:19 helpful you know some these episodes in
90:23 bed a lot of repeat stuff but they're
90:25 one of the reasons why I do it is sort
90:27 of twofold one by a bunch of new
90:29 listeners that haven't gone back on the
90:31 old stuff - some of you need to hear it
90:34 again it's just good to hear it again if
90:37 I was your friend in your life
90:40 carpooling with you or smoking cigars
90:42 with you you would find me going oh you
