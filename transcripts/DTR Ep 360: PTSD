00:00 [Music]
00:26 you
00:33 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:35 gentlemen today we're gonna talk about I
00:41 think something that's extremely
00:43 important this will not be a flippin
00:47 episode hopefully not a tremendously
00:49 long episode and it's about PTSD and the
00:57 fact that I think that PTSD I mean this
01:00 isn't this isn't revolutionary and if
01:04 let me preface it by this if when you go
01:06 to your doctor your psychiatrist or
01:10 psychologist if you have a means of
01:12 dealing with this and it works for you
01:15 then this little video amateur
01:21 interpretation of the situation may have
01:25 little value do I make this episode do I
01:30 suffer from PTSD if I do it's at such a
01:35 microscopic level I don't realize it I'm
01:39 gonna suggest I do not suffer from it at
01:41 all I don't know that I ever have I
01:43 don't know I'm hoping that the soldiers
01:46 who come back with this and it's not
01:48 just soldiers that's one of the points I
01:49 want to make about making this video but
01:52 obviously they are some extremely
01:54 important individuals I put my start up
01:59 in this building
02:01 I guess it's technically Marina del Rey
02:04 God be careful how I frame this because
02:07 I don't know if I'm supposed to say
02:09 where this place was or what's going on
02:12 but they were pioneering new PTSD
02:15 treatments using virtual reality and so
02:18 I sat down with the gentleman who runs
02:21 the place
02:22 who's a former soldier absolute badass
02:25 let me tell you holy [ __ ]
02:27 and he explained it to me for the very
02:29 first time in a way that I understood it
02:32 back in the day used to call it
02:34 shell-shocked and I think
02:39 the value of this episode is simply this
02:41 if you haven't been to any treatment of
02:44 any kind and you just don't like doctors
02:46 and you don't like the way they talk to
02:48 you and they start talking about the
02:49 limbic system in your brain all that
02:50 it's all true maybe probably but let's
02:56 just say you need a little primer to get
02:58 you to kind of understand things and
03:00 maybe this will just be like something
03:03 that helps you understand something
03:04 completely outside of any war theater
03:07 maybe you've had some abusive situations
03:09 you've been involved with some chaotic
03:12 moments in life we could call them
03:15 accidents maybe you're at a traffic
03:16 accident or or you just witnessed
03:19 something that blew your mind and you've
03:21 always felt a little uneasy after that
03:23 the way this gentleman explained it to
03:25 me I'm gonna paraphrase it in my terms
03:29 because I think it instantly clicks a
03:32 little bit better imagine you have an
03:35 event that gets lost inside your mind a
03:41 traumatic event that gets lost inside
03:44 your mind this thing happened and you
03:49 can't remember it but you are disturbed
03:53 by it and affected by it often if not
03:57 every single day in every minute of
03:59 every day it pops up at different times
04:02 I'm gonna describe this whole thing from
04:04 a much more primal standpoint that I've
04:06 ever heard any Desai Quyet rest's
04:08 explain it to me because I think that
04:10 has a value and it sort of has the
04:13 chance of putting us all on the same
04:15 playing field that you know PTSD and
04:20 shellshock is not something that people
04:24 who are weak experienced and people who
04:26 strong don't experience everybody can
04:30 experience this the only difference is
04:32 is that the event the traumatic event
04:35 hasn't occurred to the other people that
04:37 don't have it whether it be an AED going
04:40 off underneath the vehicle you're in the
04:43 middle of a whole ordinance coming in
04:45 onion you weren't that wasn't supposed
04:46 to happen maybe you just got attacked by
04:49 the enemy you lose someone very
04:53 close to you or not even close to you
04:55 but physically close to you're not
04:56 motion aliy close to but they're
04:57 physically close to you and you're just
04:59 seeing things that no person on earth
05:01 should ever see unfortunately that's
05:05 that has been a very common thing up to
05:07 hopefully we're getting out of Wars now
05:09 hopefully it's going to calm down a
05:10 little bit some of my friends and people
05:17 I've met in life have been abused by
05:19 parents and so that changed them you
05:27 know was I was just watching a beautiful
05:30 documentary on Netflix about the f-1
05:33 Williams family if you guys dig f1 it's
05:37 an amazing documentary if you like just
05:38 anything that has deep touching roots
05:40 it's an amazing documentary but there's
05:45 a gentleman in this documentary I
05:46 believe his name is Jack Williams he was
05:49 involved in an accident and he had his
05:53 neck broken this is his legacy and it's
05:58 not spoiling anything for you
06:00 and they asked and they said well how
06:02 did you deal with all the pain that you
06:05 experienced because he's gone through
06:06 all this incredible pain and he said you
06:08 know the body has an amazing defense
06:11 mechanism against pain it helps you
06:16 forget pain and helps you to ignore pain
06:19 now he's talking about physical pain but
06:24 the brain is exactly the same mechanism
06:26 that helps you manage your physical pain
06:27 is it does your emotional pain it
06:32 compartmentalizes pain it tries to keep
06:35 the past almost out of your purview
06:38 because it doesn't want you to
06:39 experience this it knows you thought
06:41 this was a horrible experience it knows
06:43 that you had in some cases an experience
06:45 occur that had no orientation imagine
06:50 driving down the street to your local
06:52 job local supermarket and a bomb goes
06:54 off underneath your car and your card is
06:57 not gonna fly 30 feet in the air for
07:00 whatever reason you survive but your
07:02 passengers don't people around your car
07:04 don't maybe you're not dry
07:07 glee over maybe you're off to the side
07:08 there's all kinds of traffic accidents
07:10 that have similar events you know tanker
07:14 trucks that rollover and explode well
07:17 who wakes up in the morning going well I
07:19 got to be careful
07:20 maybe this will happen to me but even if
07:24 you know that in your brain that that
07:26 kind of stuff can occur if it does occur
07:29 you're not ready for it you can't be
07:33 ready until maybe it's the second or
07:35 third time and our soldiers who have
07:39 been involved in these situations
07:42 there's nothing like the very first time
07:44 there's something outrageous and amazing
07:46 and god-awful a curse but is that as I
07:51 had it described to me it is a moment in
07:54 time that is lost and so if you knew the
08:01 moment because a lot of people get an
08:03 accidents and your short-term memory
08:05 doesn't get recorded into your long-term
08:06 memory you lose about ten minutes of
08:08 your life if you go into intensive care
08:10 and you're in extreme physical and
08:12 mental shock you may not remember months
08:15 I had a business partner mine get a
08:20 motorcycle accident when the hospital
08:22 got a morphine drip he's in really bad
08:24 shape thank god he's fully recovered
08:26 today but when I asked him if he
08:29 remembered me visiting him in the
08:30 hospital
08:31 off and on for three or four weeks he
08:33 was like nope I don't remember you
08:35 coming in ever I was like wow that
08:37 morphine was something else you know we
08:41 know that there have been horrendous
08:42 experiments on human beings to the
08:44 MKULTRA program in previous incarnations
08:46 in Germany where they tortured people
08:48 and then they treated them really nice
08:51 and the torture event gets erased sorta
08:55 it gets compartmentalized in the back
08:58 whatever conversations they're having
09:00 daren't during the torture phase they
09:02 don't remember in the nice face the nice
09:05 face is a lot longer than the bad face
09:07 but if they torture them again
09:10 everything that happened in the first
09:12 tortured moment becomes instantly
09:14 recallable
09:15 so they have a conversation about
09:17 something they remember the previous
09:18 conversation but not when they're being
09:20 treated nicely it's how they make
09:23 Manchurian candidates there's more to it
09:27 than that but of course that's the base
09:29 science on it so you know the first time
09:34 I ever heard about PTSD it was called
09:37 shell shock when I was a kid and they
09:39 were talking about trench warfare in
09:41 World War one and then it became bombing
09:45 raids in World War two but they actually
09:49 in order to stabilize bombs dropping out
09:53 of planes they created these little fins
09:55 and it just so happened to whistle this
09:59 horrible whistle you all have heard
10:01 those movies result boom the Doppler
10:04 effect on the whistle and then as I
10:06 understand it I mean those of you who
10:08 are big history buffs please weigh in
10:10 and let me know if this is correct I was
10:12 told that they they realized it was an
10:15 extreme intimidation mechanism to hear
10:18 that and so what was initially a
10:20 serendipitous thing became something
10:22 that was it deliberate they made it
10:25 louder and what I understand makes sense
10:29 there's nothing worse than anticipating
10:32 your death or your injury but now this
10:37 organization that was part of the
10:40 building they own the building that
10:42 we're releasing a room from they were
10:44 using virtual reality to give soldiers
10:48 back to the moment that was missed so
10:51 imagine a soldier with all of his
10:53 buddies drive over an IEE Dion accident
10:56 obviously there's some casualties
10:58 there's injuries but they don't remember
11:00 any of it
11:01 and we're gonna get into that second
11:03 phase but what they're able to do with
11:06 virtual reality because people have the
11:08 the notes that were taken when they
11:09 picked up the truck pieces and carried
11:12 everybody away and got everyone healed
11:13 up if possible they recreate the event
11:17 they asked the soldier anything they
11:20 remember about the event where did you
11:21 put your gun that day specifically like
11:23 where you put your coffee cup and
11:25 everything matters because then it
11:27 attaches better to that memory that's in
11:29 there
11:29 swimming around like crazy the recovery
11:34 rate was gigantic the guy said that most
11:37 soldiers 50% of soldiers would drop out
11:40 of a PTSD treatment because it was all
11:42 cerebral lots of conversations
11:45 psychotherapy and it just wasn't the
11:48 sort of thing that a soldier was likely
11:51 to do anyway I mean a soldier is an
11:53 amazing person soldiers a an alpha beam
11:58 they conquer they don't get conquered
12:00 and so this was sort of I guess it
12:03 wasn't working the previous technique
12:05 the virtual reality thing kind of
12:07 abstracted the doctor away even though
12:09 they can hear the doctor talking they're
12:11 in something kind of cool it's like a
12:12 video game in fact the amount of money
12:14 being spent on the VRS a lot so
12:18 hopefully it looks good I never went
12:20 through the process of course but now
12:23 think about it let's look at an on PTSD
12:26 minor for just one second you wake up
12:30 and you can rely on your reality you
12:32 have gathered gather enough protocol and
12:34 rules in your life according to your
12:37 choices you got some from your parents
12:39 your grandparents your buddies TV
12:41 whatever books and you built a pretty
12:45 good life for yourself and then all of a
12:48 sudden something happens maybe once
12:53 maybe dozens of times maybe hundreds of
12:56 times depending on where you are in the
12:57 world and what time you are in the world
12:59 it starts to shake up whether or not you
13:03 can rely on life being reliable it's a
13:09 big deal because we just take it for
13:12 granted before we have it shocked into
13:15 our system that maybe we can't rely on
13:17 things now one of the things I want to
13:22 address right away is that one of the
13:24 documented side effects of PTSD is
13:26 having a lack of confidence in the self
13:28 I want to go after that SuperDuper quick
13:31 because I don't want anyone who has PTSD
13:33 to lose that feeling I want to give you
13:36 some perspectives that you can think
13:38 about hopefully they'll give you
13:39 strength to throw that one away
13:43 get that one off your list forever
13:45 here's the thing you were able to wake
13:49 up and feel a reliable model of life now
13:52 because you have this thing flying
13:53 around your mind and we're gonna try to
13:55 find ways to grab it before you grab it
13:58 just understand you're still as strong
14:00 as you ever were
14:01 you're still as amazing as you ever were
14:03 you're just gonna have to find this
14:06 thing and you're have to lock it down
14:08 but because it's an unknown because this
14:11 thing is running around in people's mind
14:12 and people don't understand as I
14:14 understand it they're soldiers
14:15 and I'm gonna focus on the soldiers
14:16 because it's the easiest one for now
14:19 they don't know this has happened to
14:21 them I don't know why they feel uneasy
14:24 we're gonna get into that next but until
14:27 we find it and we lock it down there
14:31 should be no self-confidence no self
14:33 critique I know it's frustrating to go
14:35 from having receive ibly control of your
14:39 life and then now this this these weird
14:42 waves of emotion come up and you're like
14:45 man I used to be able control this now I
14:47 can't control this there must be
14:48 something wrong with me personally it's
14:52 not you it's almost completely unbiased
14:55 to you a thing has happened to you it's
14:59 a mental thing and you can fix it you
15:02 can fix it and you will fix it so until
15:06 you do cut yourself some slack cut
15:09 yourself a blank check as you feel these
15:11 things come on I want to rebrand it in
15:13 your head a little bit if this works if
15:17 I had a psychedelic drug
15:19 and you'd never taken one in your whole
15:22 life and when a beautiful place and I
15:25 said dude I'm gonna give you this it's
15:29 not gonna last for like 30 minutes
15:31 you'll be completely done will harm your
15:34 body at all but you're gonna go through
15:35 all these weird emotions like a
15:37 kaleidoscope of emotions every motion
15:39 that you can have is gonna go through
15:41 and yes you will go through some
15:43 positives and negatives but you will
15:46 never lose sight of the fact that you
15:47 are you you won't lose control over
15:50 yourself you know your outer body it's
15:53 not gonna react to this you're gonna
15:55 feel it inside your heart it's gonna
15:57 make you feel strange
15:59 there's no terrible panic in the drug so
16:01 don't worry about that but even if there
16:04 was a little slice if you know this is
16:07 happening because I've given you a
16:09 little psychotropic drug or whatever and
16:11 you're like okay I'm gonna do this
16:12 experience maybe it's only five minutes
16:13 long so it's not so terrifying thirty
16:15 minutes is a bit of a long trip if
16:17 you're going negative and I say to you
16:21 look I'm right here you're totally cool
16:23 right yeah all right we talked about
16:26 everything around the room you got water
16:27 we got food we got shelter
16:29 there's no cliff behind you you're good
16:32 nice nice quarantine place and you take
16:35 this you put it on your tongue and you
16:37 start about five minutes later you start
16:39 going through this kaleidoscope of
16:40 emotions like the Everlasting Gobstopper
16:41 of emotion and I said just tell me what
16:45 you're feeling you're like oh my god I
16:46 feel totally euphoric and then the next
16:49 thing you're like oh man I feel a little
16:51 scared I'm like it's just a feeling yeah
16:53 I know it's crazy right or I feel a
16:55 little scared yeah feeling a little
16:57 angry right now oh my god now I'm
17:00 feeling insecure and you're going
17:02 through all these emotions but you know
17:03 it's because they gave you this little
17:05 tiny weird drug now don't take that drug
17:09 if it exists and I'm always there you
17:12 even use some context and then five
17:14 minutes later after it starts every
17:16 emotions about thirty seconds five
17:18 minutes later you're over you to ten
17:19 emotions like what do you think man you
17:21 know you're like whoa I wouldn't do it
17:23 again but that was an interesting
17:25 experiment it put it into context that I
17:28 intentionally had that happen to me
17:30 because I ingested this drug
17:33 now take that and apply it to an
17:38 uncontrollable reaction to PTSD and
17:44 we're gonna get into how this triggers
17:46 and again if you've already done your
17:47 research you've already talked to a
17:49 doctor this is all incidental to you and
17:51 you laugh your head off because you know
17:54 how primitive what I'm saying is but if
17:57 you haven't ever been and you think you
17:58 might be feeling this and again you
18:00 don't have to be a soldier you could
18:02 just have something have happen to you
18:03 it might help be out all right so what
18:09 is the linchpin to PTSD what makes it
18:14 occur at all ever
18:17 well thankfully but there is an answer
18:21 and it is very basic and it's called
18:25 threat when your body feels threat this
18:29 is where you'll hear the word the limbic
18:31 system in your mind it's where this they
18:33 believe thread is processed whatever
18:35 doesn't matter you have to you don't
18:36 have to know the tube in your brain
18:38 that's causing this to occur just know
18:41 that when you're threatened or you feel
18:43 threatened and let's think about the
18:45 different forms of threat as the
18:48 soldiers maybe you're marching into a
18:50 situation you are drawing threat upon
18:52 yourself because you're being the
18:53 aggressor that's one time one form of
18:55 threat some folks are coming after you
18:58 very poignant very specific threat
19:01 because they're trying to hurt you this
19:03 way if you are a citizen in London while
19:08 bombs are being dropped by the Germans a
19:11 v1 or v2 rocket is coming in making
19:15 strange sounds we're bombing them you're
19:18 a German way back in the day just put
19:21 yourself in their shoes you feel
19:24 helpless while you're being threatened
19:28 now when you're attacking you probably
19:31 feel this adrenaline this confidence in
19:35 yourself when someone's coming at you
19:38 very specifically it's not a random
19:40 thing falling out of the sky they're
19:41 specifically coming at you you're
19:43 engaging your fight-or-flight
19:45 were engaging all the strategy of your
19:47 left brain to survive some folks will
19:50 remain completely calm and some folks
19:53 will be very you know it's their very
19:56 first time and so they're very scared so
19:59 we have confidence we have logic we have
20:03 fear and we have hopelessness there's
20:06 other emotions that swim around as a
20:08 reaction to threat right so threats the
20:12 linchpin so when people have PTSD
20:16 experiences again that be maybe overseas
20:20 and they'll be in one of these deserts
20:24 fighting in the in the Hills fighting
20:26 wherever they're fighting jungles and
20:28 they have some unbelievably profound
20:32 experience occur it could be you were
20:34 driving home one day and you saw
20:36 something insane you could be involved
20:38 with something here in the States
20:40 wherever you live in the world it's very
20:42 intense
20:42 you couldn't process it too much what's
20:45 going on people yelled in ways you've
20:47 never heard someone yell if someone gets
20:50 injured you saw a body in a state that
20:53 you've never seen it before it's
20:55 horrific and you empathetically could
20:58 feel their pain you could feel at least
20:59 the family's pain when they get notified
21:01 if someone passed away as a result of an
21:03 experience so then there's remorse okay
21:09 when you have a relapse if you come home
21:12 and again the worst thing was 20 years
21:16 ago you know there there just wasn't a
21:19 tremendous amount of focus on this as I
21:21 understand it you know they've been
21:23 doing shell shock treatments since World
21:25 War one just go watch I know how
21:29 accurate this is but if you watch
21:31 Boardwalk Empire there's a gentleman in
21:36 there who is a sniper who had part of
21:37 his face blown off he wore this mask and
21:41 he was in there and they were trying to
21:44 give him the shell shock test all
21:46 mentally sane are you all right very dry
21:50 very horrible it's not inviting right
21:52 you should be as warm as it could
21:54 possible you today it's so much better
21:56 as I understand it so but the thing is
21:58 if you come back
21:59 and you think I did experience something
22:02 really intense but so far I feel okay
22:05 alright but then you start having those
22:09 emotions I just mentioned and they seem
22:11 to kind of flurry around inside of you
22:13 in a way that you don't seem to you
22:16 don't seem to understand why am I
22:18 feeling this way I don't have anything
22:19 bad happening I'm enjoying a picnic with
22:22 my family and watch a TV I'm at a bar
22:24 wherever the heck you are and this stuff
22:28 just occurs to you and you're let's say
22:32 you're a soldier so used to being in
22:34 control you've been taught how to get
22:36 things under control and you've seen
22:39 stuff and tense stuff and now you're
22:42 just in maybe middle America and you're
22:44 like well nothing there's no threats
22:45 here what's causing this to occur for
22:49 some reason there's an emotional
22:51 checklist inside of our minds the
22:56 emotional checklist is different for
22:58 everybody because it has a different
22:59 starting emotion you have your different
23:02 reactions to it but there's a thing at
23:04 the bottom there's a little checkbox at
23:06 the bottom that we need to discuss and
23:09 the checkbox at the bottom says resolves
23:13 I had all these emotions and I have
23:17 dealt with them and I have resolved them
23:20 when PTSD occurs because the event has
23:24 lost in time you don't have the
23:27 checklist anymore you may not even know
23:29 the emotions that occur during this
23:31 traumatic a moment this traumatic moment
23:34 and so you can't check off the bottom
23:36 checkbox and that's what drives you
23:39 crazy I don't mean to use crazy but you
23:43 know just just irritates the hell out of
23:45 you let me give you a quick physical
23:48 example of this not that you need it but
23:51 let me just give you I stopped at a stop
23:53 sign once I was 18 years old I just
23:55 bought a brand new car lady hits me I
23:59 don't know 20 miles an hour right in
24:01 front of a police station and I was
24:04 looking at my buddy over to the right
24:05 and I got this whiplash
24:07 bent my neck sideways and I definitely
24:12 had a pinched nerve
24:13 didn't I didn't know anything about my
24:15 body at that time I didn't realize you
24:18 know but I was a tough guy right I was
24:20 this tough kid and so a year later I'm
24:24 souping up all my body building and
24:27 stuff and I had this big bar you know
24:30 the one that's kind of s-shaped you know
24:31 it's kind of cool and so I'm doing this
24:33 and all of a sudden on my reps as I
24:35 started getting to the exhaustion point
24:36 I was noticing my right arm was slower
24:38 than my left one right handed
24:43 unbelievably that night a chiropractor
24:45 called me and said hey we're doing free
24:47 evaluations would you like to come in I
24:49 said you know uh yeah I think so so I go
24:51 in and he gives me this grip thing and I
24:54 grip it and there's a little needle on
24:56 the top and it shows you how strong your
24:58 arms are your hands and stuff in your
25:00 arms my left was 10 pounds stronger than
25:02 my right but he goes you're right-handed
25:03 aren't you and I said yeah and he goes
25:06 well you must have a pinched nerve
25:08 because your right hand is 20 pounds
25:10 weaker than it's supposed to be I was
25:13 like it's because of the car accident
25:15 well car accident oh my god yeah you
25:18 should have come in right after yeah I
25:20 was an idiot I didn't know about this
25:22 whole thing this lady could have paid
25:25 for my next six years worth of
25:27 chiropractic care so I started getting
25:30 adjusted and this went on for like six
25:32 years
25:34 little little break in the middle as I
25:37 moved but I was able I had this injury
25:40 that really manifested itself a year
25:43 after the actual injury because it was
25:46 so slow that stuff happens and it
25:51 happens mentally as well I once went to
25:53 a psychologist who's a friend of mine he
25:56 was an elder of the church and he just
25:58 did these little sessions and he asked
25:59 me if he could do a session with me
26:00 because he's a professor he doesn't get
26:02 to practice I said yeah that would be
26:04 awesome
26:05 cuz there I am jesting psychology books
26:07 like crazy and he sits me down he
26:09 managed to pull out an unresolved issue
26:11 I had with my parents it's amazing I was
26:15 furious like when I left I was really
26:17 pissed off and I got in my car actually
26:19 drove faster because I was pissed off
26:21 before the night was over I was just
26:24 like okay I know I'm just
26:27 governed that emotion it was my little
26:29 PTSD I grabbed it I looked at it I said
26:32 ah well whatever you know my parents are
26:35 kids anyway so whatever they screwed up
26:37 I screw up all the time and then it was
26:39 resolved for the rest of my life was
26:42 crazy from what I have been told by the
26:47 professionals in this industry is as
26:49 soon as the soldier is able to capture
26:51 and recreate the moment of PTSD it can
26:55 vanish very quickly now if it doesn't
26:58 vanish quickly there's no big deal you
27:00 just got to keep thinking about it and
27:01 keep managing it sometimes just thinking
27:05 about it and describing it to yourself
27:07 rationally even though you don't
27:09 necessarily buy it over time it'll give
27:13 you a context to reconstruct a moment in
27:19 your life I just told you about a
27:22 treatment that uses virtual reality for
27:24 this now if you're suffering from PTSD
27:27 you might want to look up PTSD VR
27:30 treatment and if you if you haven't been
27:32 able to find it resolve it you just find
27:35 it and have the hopefully the VA pay for
27:39 whatever you got to do to get to a
27:40 facility that can do that I think one of
27:44 the things that might occur because I
27:47 here's what I think as a non PTSD
27:51 soldier especially is that I put myself
27:55 empathetically in the soldiers place I
27:57 almost joined the military I grew up in
27:59 military bases for at least a third of
28:02 my life if not 40 percent of my life I
28:05 wanted to be a Marine oh my god
28:07 you have no idea but I fell into the
28:11 nerd trap and I would often became
28:12 really creative but I always mourn the
28:16 fact that didn't join being vulnerable
28:19 is a hell of an emotion hell of an
28:24 emotion I think that we can travel
28:29 decades and decades and decades of our
28:31 lives without ever feeling vulnerable
28:33 I think dudes can like this this guy
28:35 this Williams guy from the f1 team I'm
28:39 not sure he ever felt vulnerable
28:42 like he did when he broke his neck and
28:45 then it's like it's not just like a
28:47 little injury maybe you lose a finger or
28:49 you lose an arm yeah you know there's
28:51 plenty of ways to continue living with
28:53 missing limbs you can you can do it you
28:56 can be blinded and still function you
28:58 can lose your hearing and still function
29:00 but when you break your neck and you
29:02 become a quadriplegic you're gonna have
29:05 to grow up really fast right and I have
29:09 no clue or maybe I only have a clue what
29:13 that would be like well let's just say
29:17 you look in the mirror and you're still
29:19 that handsome bastard you always were
29:21 when you before you left
29:23 maybe you're even better-looking or
29:24 you're a lady I don't mean to exclude
29:27 females I might be going through this
29:29 but you're looking in the mirror and
29:31 you're going man I'm I'm having multiple
29:33 instances throughout the day where I'm
29:37 having all these emotions go nuts and
29:40 here's something I want you to remember
29:45 one you are gonna find this event and
29:48 you're going to resolve it period give
29:50 yourself time to feeling vulnerable
29:53 well you're just normal but don't forget
29:56 to tell yourself that it's okay to feel
29:58 vulnerable this was an incredible event
30:01 if something happens so and tensley in
30:03 your life that you have a PTSD whether
30:05 it be a domestic situation or war
30:08 theater situation doesn't matter it was
30:11 a big event for you they give it maybe
30:15 for someone else it wasn't such a big
30:16 deal but for you it's intense and maybe
30:20 when you were out with your buddies and
30:22 you're looking at a bunch of stuff that
30:23 is horrific you said things that weren't
30:28 true and maybe they were true for you at
30:31 the moment we're usually that's not a
30:32 big deal I don't care about that I'm
30:35 tough I've seen this before or whatever
30:38 then you get home you're like man I'd
30:40 never seen this [ __ ] before what was I
30:42 saying that for that stuff was traumatic
30:47 maybe you say I'm not even the same
30:49 person anymore
30:51 well it'll happen to you after PTSD is
30:53 over
30:54 after you conquer it or get control over
30:56 it you will be a much stronger person in
30:59 the end so focus on that to not only
31:02 gonna get through this thing and you're
31:05 gonna get through it because at least
31:06 you're gonna have to be honest with
31:08 yourself if you have a spouse be honest
31:11 with them for sure even if you have kids
31:13 it's alright it's alright to tell your
31:16 your kids hey you know daddy experienced
31:18 some pretty insane things mommy saw some
31:20 things that she never wanted to see and
31:22 so I'm just thinking it through I'm just
31:25 trying to find out a new perspective on
31:28 life that these things can occur now
31:33 I've heard it I've read several articles
31:35 on this and mostly the articles will
31:37 people describe the events that
31:41 frustrate them because one gentleman I
31:44 can't remember is like a couple years
31:46 ago read this article were a gentleman
31:48 said he was just driving down the street
31:50 in his little town and he said that it
31:54 was super frustrating to him that people
31:56 were happy around him and that they had
32:00 not a care in the world and that he
32:02 joined the military and he was forced to
32:04 deal with these horrible things and so
32:06 one respect he was like these people are
32:08 so incapable of dealing with what I just
32:12 dealt with he sees them as non soldiers
32:15 and he's probably right hopefully we
32:18 don't have to have soldiers at some
32:19 point in the future right but for now
32:21 unfortunately because there's bankers
32:23 and monarchs we will have Wars it's all
32:27 based on fake stuff right in some cases
32:30 if someone if someone gets in balanced
32:32 in the world it's sometimes that
32:33 imbalance actually happens because
32:35 there's there's money spent to unbalance
32:38 it keep people under educated whatever
32:41 to push a false belief about somebody
32:44 else and sometimes we just got to stay
32:48 where we are in the world because we
32:49 don't integrate well maybe someones a
32:52 thousand years two thousand five
32:53 thousand years behind the rest of us
32:55 okay can you live in your neighborhood
32:58 because they can live in theirs ain't
33:00 cool but if you're forced to deal with
33:02 this this guy was talking about having
33:06 his perspective so changed
33:08 they had this extra layer on top of his
33:11 PSD PTSD excuse me one has to keep those
33:17 two layers separate for his view on
33:21 society this person has been enlightened
33:27 unfortunately they've been enlightened
33:29 in a way that is regrettable and from
33:35 one perspective but again wars have to
33:37 occur but here's the other way to look
33:39 at it if your soldier that comes back
33:43 and you saw things again
33:44 I wasn't technically raised by an
33:47 individual who did this but my dad's
33:50 best buddy as I've said several times he
33:52 he definitely saw it and I spent at
33:55 least three years within his circle and
33:58 it was a very profound three years let
34:02 me take you back a few years because I
34:03 have this experiment I have this funny
34:06 little game I play with people I said
34:08 this a long time ago and I'll say it
34:09 again and you might get a kick out of
34:11 this yourself
34:12 everyone loves to people-watch right so
34:16 I used to travel a bunch sit in airports
34:18 forever looking around people but even
34:22 if I'm in a place where it's just a lot
34:24 of downtown LA there waiting for some
34:26 concert to start or I'm at a concert I
34:27 look around at people and what I do is I
34:30 play the video game thing to say if we
34:33 were back in the fabled King Arthur days
34:39 I look at somebody usually that's dudes
34:41 and I'll see is that guy a blacksmith or
34:44 is that guy I know how that guy is a
34:46 blacksmith yeah oh that thinner guy he's
34:48 probably an archer that medium guy he's
34:52 a swordsman that older skinnier guy that
34:55 it's got the glasses on he's probably an
34:58 advisor to the king sometimes it'll be
35:01 the king sometimes it'll be the Queen
35:03 sometimes it'll be a maiden sometimes
35:06 would be some other intense person but I
35:10 would do this game where I would kind of
35:11 overlay on top of people but what I
35:13 thought they might be in a movie
35:18 if you come back and you have this
35:20 perspective and this can happen without
35:22 any PTSD without any negative effects
35:24 you move to the big city you experience
35:27 a bunch of things and then you go back
35:29 to your little town wherever that is
35:31 you're gonna have this extra layer that
35:33 this other guy had no matter what his
35:36 layer is the gentleman this article was
35:38 having a very intense emotional
35:39 experience with his lair
35:44 but I think about it every town needs a
35:49 chieftain every town needs multiple
35:53 centuries soldiers guards you're just
35:59 one of them you left a boy and you came
36:03 back a man you left a girl and you came
36:06 back a woman not just any man or any
36:10 woman but a strong reinforced person
36:14 that now the entire town can rely on you
36:17 and add thee as you have time to one
36:20 capture PTSD moment identify it and you
36:24 know technically speaking you could have
36:26 multiple moments my thoughts and my hope
36:30 is that if you had like moments dealing
36:34 with one of those moments we'll give you
36:36 the equipment in your mind in a regiment
36:39 to be able to capture the others but
36:42 instead of reflecting poorly on the
36:44 situation and seeing this big Delta
36:47 between you and then this big difference
36:49 between you and them see yourself as an
36:53 elevated partner of society that is
36:56 going to be relied on when things occur
36:59 imagine you go over you're 19 years old
37:02 and you come out roughly when you're 23
37:05 24 years old hell maybe you two or a few
37:07 more times you come out in your late 20s
37:10 so you got all these wild experiences
37:13 usually this PTSD thing is I her as I've
37:16 had it described to me occurs for
37:20 someone who does a short well short
37:22 forgive me for years but you went right
37:26 into the thick of it and so you're young
37:28 you don't have a lot of context for
37:30 these type of Vic's
37:31 appearances and then you come back and
37:33 integrate with your family you've got
37:34 kids a baby that we're born while you
37:36 were gone and you're trying to integrate
37:38 and it's such a difference between war
37:40 and home well think about it if we can
37:46 figure out a way to just postpone any
37:49 any bad reactions to this we just give
37:54 ourselves a big deep breath you say look
37:56 this PTSD is coming around I'm gonna
37:59 find that event and I'm gonna deal with
38:01 it but meanwhile while I go through
38:03 these swimming emotions that I can
38:05 control I'm gonna let folks know I'm
38:08 having that experience I'm a little
38:11 vulnerable when those experiences are
38:13 occurring I will find it I will conquer
38:17 it whether it's a VR camera or me just
38:20 meditating in the backyard and thinking
38:22 about the event calling a few buddies
38:23 that were there to help reconstruct the
38:26 event dude you were there where the hell
38:27 was I what happened but what was the
38:30 next thing up and go in as much detail
38:32 as you can possibly go into and if you
38:35 got to call them 20 times and have them
38:36 say it 20 more times do it record the
38:39 conversation whatever technique will
38:41 work for you you will find that event
38:43 and you will conquer it you will grab it
38:46 and dispose of it well you put it
38:47 somewhere inside yourself or it has
38:49 context it probably will never be a
38:52 positive experience even if you do grab
38:55 it it's a negative thing but it taught
38:58 you the value of life but now let's take
39:02 that other thought and apply it to this
39:03 and then let's move ahead ten years now
39:07 you're in your early 30s well your are
39:11 wherever you are you're in maybe your
39:13 small town it's easier to describe it in
39:15 a small town in my opinion you are
39:18 taking your family from point A to point
39:20 B here's a 4th of July event happening
39:23 or whatever it's all a glorious event
39:25 now all of a sudden there's an accident
39:31 not quite wartime suffering but there's
39:34 an accident and so what you do because
39:38 you have found peace with your PTSD
39:39 moment or moments because you have seen
39:44 yourself as an elevated partner of
39:45 humanity because you have gone through
39:48 the eye of the needle emotionally and
39:50 physically maybe and I know some folks
39:55 that have done this exact thing they've
39:57 been in the war and when things happen
39:59 in the real world everyone else is
40:02 screaming but because you made peace but
40:05 the moment that this happened to you you
40:09 now can march straight into that
40:10 accident and heal people get people to
40:15 safety stop someone bleeding I mean you
40:17 realize a little cut in the forearm can
40:20 kill you if it hits an artery but if you
40:22 just put a little thumb on that cut and
40:24 you tell the person hey we keep your
40:26 thumb on this you're fine but if you
40:28 don't keep your thumb on that we're
40:31 gonna forget to the hospital quick we're
40:32 gonna fix that artery don't worry about
40:34 it you'll be just fine you could save a
40:36 life and so you might be more equipped
40:40 in this world to help human help
40:42 humanity get to these awkward moments
40:45 and think about it the odds that you're
40:46 gonna see something horrific here in the
40:48 States
40:48 it is rare it is rare I mean you know we
40:53 drive down the highway and see accidents
40:55 and you see cars plotted into cars
40:57 thank God cars are way more safe than
40:59 they ever used to be right I mean we
41:00 have sign impact you know bags and all
41:03 kinds of cool stuff so it takes a lot to
41:06 see stuff here in the states so you
41:09 don't have to sit in any any bubble of
41:12 fear that you're gonna imperative ly
41:18 obligatory run into these events know
41:21 you may never but it the other thing too
41:23 is to remember you may not be ready for
41:26 awhile and so it might be one of these
41:29 situations where let's say you see it
41:33 maybe you're driving maybe your wife's
41:35 driving maybe your husband's driving and
41:36 you're feeling the vulnerable thing
41:39 because you haven't quite resolved to
41:40 PTSD moment maybe you simply say
41:42 I can't deal with this you mind if we
41:48 drive around this I mean you know if you
41:50 can help them great get me to someplace
41:52 else I can't deal with this right now
41:54 I'm gonna go through a really bad
41:55 situation now one of the other boomers
41:58 and hopefully this is already nixed the
42:00 issue is that before you understand PTSD
42:04 before you admit to yourself you might
42:06 have experienced it therefore have an
42:09 event that is lost that needs to be
42:10 recaptured a lot of times people
42:14 self-medicate they drink alcohol they
42:18 take a drug and therefore they sort of
42:22 add more vulnerability because as soon
42:25 as you're intoxicated be it by any means
42:28 at all in this world you're no longer in
42:31 control are you you don't want to do
42:36 that because it won't work it'll make
42:40 you more vulnerable and again when you
42:42 drink there's two types of drunks
42:45 there's the happy drunk it's just having
42:48 a great time with it maybe until they
42:51 throw up or something and then there's
42:53 your angry drunk and your angry drunk is
42:55 doesn't have to have any PTSD whatsoever
42:57 but the body's being attacked the blood
43:00 is being thinned out so the brain isn't
43:02 working well the liver is dying the
43:04 kidneys are straining the whole body is
43:06 going into a communication breakdown
43:08 which is what we call being drunk and
43:11 sometimes the brain simply says I don't
43:14 know what you're doing out there but
43:16 you're being attacked we are dying
43:19 inside here you think you're having fun
43:21 but we're dying attack everything out
43:24 there because eventually you're going to
43:27 attack something that's causing this
43:28 problem and it's gonna end obviously
43:32 that doesn't really work because you
43:35 could keep drinking attacking everybody
43:36 wait I have a neighbor excuse I have a
43:40 former neighbor who had a brother I'm
43:43 saying that so it's abstract it far away
43:45 from this person does not exist in my
43:47 neighborhood at all I never really did
43:48 permanently but he had come back from
43:50 Iraq during Christmas time and he was
43:55 seeing the family which was awesome he
43:57 was safe he was all in one piece huge
44:01 guy I mean huge and I went in to the
44:05 kitchen to get a drink and he was in
44:07 there I didn't know who he was he looked
44:09 like there people who owned the house so
44:11 I was like oh must be a relative sure
44:13 enough it was a brother he was already
44:17 kind of lit which I should have noticed
44:19 but then he's he's telling me that he
44:23 just came back from Iraq that he was on
44:24 leave for three weeks and I said well
44:28 that's great man I said I'm glad to see
44:30 you one piece hopefully you know you
44:33 know go over come back on one piece I'm
44:35 just saying some nice things and he
44:38 starts staring at me and then some
44:41 people came in to get drinks as well I
44:43 haven't got anything yet and he pointed
44:45 me and he goes that guy doesn't like the
44:48 military I'm like what the hell are you
44:52 talking about I didn't say anything I'm
44:54 looking at these other people like I
44:56 didn't say anything like that at all
44:58 and then his sister came in and she
45:01 starts waving and waving me waving him
45:04 off and just saying you come on outside
45:05 this guy's got issues maybe he was
45:09 suffering from PTSD
45:10 I don't know later that night he got
45:13 into a huge fight on our street it's the
45:16 biggest fight that's ever happened in
45:17 the 16 years amid this house now there's
45:21 another thing that adds to PTSD as well
45:23 which I also read in another article and
45:26 that is that when a soldiers in the
45:29 theater of war sometimes it's not
45:30 perceived as bad at all it's being
45:33 perceived as extremely productive
45:37 there's am amazing camaraderie people
45:40 have your back all the time it's an
45:43 amazing family when they're over there
45:45 and then they come back and they're
45:47 separated from all their buddies because
45:48 everyone's from a different place in the
45:50 United States it's like a good baseball
45:52 team and now they've lost that and so
45:57 there's a overall sadness to get over
46:00 that you're missing your buddies if you
46:02 ever see the series mash from my
46:05 remember early 70s to the late
46:09 Erichs early 80s they have to say
46:12 Kabaddi which I it's a for those of you
46:15 are totally young and you don't know
46:16 what the hell that was it's about the
46:17 Korean War and a mass unit which is a
46:19 medical mobile medical unit and it's a
46:22 comedy it's a lot of fun but the last
46:24 episode was and there's definitely some
46:27 some sad episodes in the in the series
46:30 but the very last episode everyone
46:32 survives who's at the end right there's
46:35 a one reported casualty in the third
46:37 season but the very end everyone's going
46:41 home and the saddest part was we were
46:44 losing the show which had just become a
46:46 staple and the diet of a three to four
46:49 channel television right you didn't have
46:51 a hundred channels or a thousand
46:52 channels and so we all just turn the TV
46:56 on we play mash and this was happening
46:58 but people went home to their respective
47:00 states
47:01 there was actually a follow-up series
47:03 where they actually four of them I think
47:05 came back together to live in a house
47:07 together in a neighborhood together and
47:09 it was like so that warm feeling of like
47:11 Alki least they're all together again
47:12 you know the people had to say goodbye
47:14 and that's just going to be the results
47:19 of any gathering in the world no matter
47:21 what you're doing whether it be a
47:23 military gathering you used to work for
47:25 a company man I used to have a
47:26 department of fifty five of the coolest
47:29 people on planet earth and Electronic
47:31 Arts when they had to layoff
47:34 was a thirty nine hundred people and
47:37 three giant chunks I guess it's four
47:39 giant chunks it was really sad it was
47:44 super sad we were my department always
47:47 made money for the company we made
47:49 millions of dollars I think it was
47:52 minimum of three million a year for the
47:55 dot-com all the other departments were
48:00 losing cash and that's why everybody had
48:02 to go but my departments like calm and
48:03 we're hanging on to the product
48:04 representation online where we've
48:07 tripled the store revenue more than
48:10 tripled I'm making this episode I've had
48:14 this PTSD thing on my list for probably
48:18 almost two years I didn't know quite how
48:22 to
48:22 attack it because again I'm talking
48:25 about it as an outsider and I have
48:29 friends that have gone through domestic
48:30 things where they have had their
48:34 confidence destroyed and you know you
48:38 know just to get off the soldier thing
48:39 for a second you know there's a lot of
48:41 vulnerable people at least back in the
48:43 day in the video game business and they
48:45 were introverts because of their
48:46 vulnerability and they became really
48:49 good at something creative maybe their
48:52 programmers maybe their artists whatever
48:54 storytellers they're good gamers and
48:58 sometimes no matter what I would do or
49:01 my friends if we had a mutual friend
49:03 that was always sort of weak he didn't
49:07 want to he knew he was weak he didn't
49:09 want to be weak he kind of knew why he
49:10 was weak but he couldn't overcome it and
49:15 may it may be the fact that the PTSD
49:18 treatment that our soldiers are getting
49:20 nowadays might have helped him way back
49:23 in the day but again we hadn't developed
49:25 the science and I just think we hadn't
49:28 talked about it enough to be able to
49:30 have the conversation with each other
49:32 I would imagine because there's
49:35 definitely restrictions about females
49:37 and in the thick of war that this is
49:41 obviously going to be a 95 percent in
49:44 terms of war results you know again no
49:47 disrespect I mean the females have to
49:49 take care of soldiers and all kinds of
49:51 different situations and they definitely
49:53 get out there and get caught by the
49:54 enemy there's been plenty of those
49:55 events so I'm not trying to minimize
49:57 anything but now what is the the funny
50:01 little thing about men asking for
50:03 directions we don't ask for directions
50:06 do we and why don't we ask for
50:08 directions because we're supposed to be
50:11 the man we're supposed to have answers
50:13 we're not supposed to be weak in front
50:14 of our females let alone our family
50:16 that's just directions man that's just
50:20 asking for directions
50:22 alright so what if something is you know
50:28 you travel back to the States you've got
50:29 this lost event or events no one's
50:33 talked to you about this
50:34 so you have absolutely no tools in your
50:38 tool chest
50:38 oh yeah the military wants to interview
50:41 you but you're resisting that anyway
50:43 because I'm strong I don't want to be
50:46 categorically written down on a piece of
50:48 paper as having a problem because that's
50:51 gonna mean more to you maybe maybe for
50:53 some people it might mean more to them I
50:55 got a piece of paper that tells me I'm
50:57 broke well I don't want that piece of
50:59 paper in my life just seeing that you
51:02 might think I think incorrectly that
51:05 will become a permanent stain on your
51:06 insides maybe I think if no one
51:13 communicates to you about this condition
51:15 you could easily become a permanent
51:17 stain on your insides I don't think it
51:21 has to be that way anymore maybe I'm
51:25 talking about my ass but I think if you
51:27 have methods and you have knowledge
51:29 about why certain things are occurring
51:32 to you you've got tools just like
51:37 Spicoli said in fast times there's bhai
51:39 I can fix this my dad has tools now the
51:45 other thing I'm just gonna put out there
51:46 and I'm not a doctor I'm not a doctor
51:51 you know I've heard these everyone's
51:54 heard these if you paid attention to the
51:55 PTSD articles out there you know there's
52:01 people who take their own lives because
52:04 they can't live in this cycle of of
52:08 perceived lack of control and
52:10 vulnerability I don't know if those
52:12 individuals who ended up taking their
52:14 life ever had this discussion it pains
52:18 me to think that they didn't have this
52:19 discussion it pains me to think that
52:21 they would ever take their life for any
52:23 reason when really when it comes down to
52:27 brass tacks they were willing to
52:30 sacrifice their life for their country
52:33 well you're a hero you have you have
52:38 stood up put your money where your mouth
52:40 is
52:41 you went over there you risk things now
52:43 whether you agree with the war that
52:45 you're fighting where they're at you
52:46 come back and go I shouldn't have been
52:48 there
52:48 is that anything don't worry about that
52:51 that's a problem we're all trying to fix
52:53 and the Great Awakening what's important
52:57 is you were willing to sacrifice
53:01 everything including your life
53:04 now the other one that comes out of that
53:06 is the age-old problem of maybe you
53:12 survived but some people in your company
53:16 in your squadron whatever didn't and
53:18 there's obviously an infinite level of
53:22 circumstances that can be applied to
53:24 anyone coming back with that emotion
53:27 perhaps you know in the chaos of war or
53:30 something didn't go right
53:31 you didn't think you you know you had a
53:34 left and a right decision it was a
53:35 binary decision and you picked a path
53:38 where some folks got injured maybe
53:41 passed away and so you might hold that
53:43 guilt but you know what you might have
53:47 gone the other route and something
53:49 totally unexpected that you don't
53:51 realize today would have happened that
53:54 would have taken more lives or an equal
53:56 amount of lives but even if the other
53:59 path would have brought everyone home
54:01 safely
54:03 we're not computers we're not fortune
54:07 tellers we're human beings first time I
54:11 watched a softball game my daughter
54:12 played and I saw the umpire makes some
54:17 serious mistakes with the calls and with
54:20 the other parents and I know I don't
54:21 jack all about it and so I would go you
54:25 know shouldn't it shouldn't they redo
54:28 that call I mean that was obviously
54:29 horrible everyone saw it and this I
54:32 forgot who said it to me goes no he goes
54:34 that's what makes this game amazing is
54:36 that we have human error the whole
54:39 thing's a human game when no one's
54:42 losing their life and a softball game
54:43 hopefully so we blow that off but when
54:47 it comes to a theater of war it's much
54:49 more intense isn't it some of you have
54:52 had the thought
54:54 you would do anything not to see another
54:57 person suffer including trading places
55:03 with them some of you like that because
55:07 your perception is maybe quite
55:09 accurately I don't want to have a whole
55:11 life of dealing with this person having
55:12 passed and I'm I'm in the variable I'm
55:16 in the equation of potentially being
55:18 responsible maybe I'm not maybe I am I
55:21 don't even know there's that whole scene
55:25 in full-metal-jacket the second part
55:27 where they you know they wiggle up to
55:30 that building and people drop very
55:34 important people to us in the fictional
55:36 movie that it is it's not that a person
55:40 won't fight to live but if they do pass
55:45 my guess is they're not wishing everyone
55:47 on the other side all their buddies to
55:49 have a bad life I don't think anyone
55:53 passes saying you know be tormented by
55:57 my moment right now for the rest of your
55:59 life
55:59 I would I would bet that out of a heart
56:05 of a soldier a heart of a hero we have
56:10 to do them a solid and we have to say
56:13 they wouldn't want me to feel this way
56:16 about them disappearing out of this
56:18 world so in order to respect that wish
56:24 from a hero if you think your buddy was
56:26 amazing let's go ahead and finish the
56:29 definition shall we they wouldn't want
56:32 you to feel that way about their passing
56:34 if anything if anything they would want
56:39 you to live a wonderful life to get home
56:41 safely back to that family and if you
56:46 have to
56:46 I mentioned it once in my my episode I
56:49 believe about the afterlife and
56:50 reincarnation and all those things I
56:52 think it's probably my afterlife episode
56:55 you know I lost some buddies in high
56:57 school two accidents and I made a
57:01 decision because I was still in a small
57:04 town at the time
57:06 I had this dream of coming to California
57:08 doing a bunch of wild stuff and I did it
57:13 but as I was doing it I mean as I was
57:17 driving 1,800 miles back to California
57:21 having just taken a trip to find an
57:22 employer I'm like 17 years old this hold
57:27 1976 Dodge Charger special edition at
57:31 eggshell white the nice dent in the back
57:34 fender that the lady who owned it before
57:35 me did I said look let's go all of us
57:42 everybody who left before high school
57:45 was even over right after high school
57:47 was over getting a car let's go this is
57:51 all of us living together getting all
57:53 those dreams that you didn't get to get
57:55 because you you left early that really
58:00 was therapeutic to me to get over my
58:02 friend passing one of them very
58:05 specifically was you know a hero of mine
58:07 and so I worked extra hard and I focused
58:11 extra hard and I always felt like he was
58:13 on my side at my side participating
58:16 celebrating now maybe that actually
58:19 occurs maybe it doesn't even if he did
58:22 come along for the ride but at some
58:24 point he'd go do that was really fun now
58:27 I see that you got to really live your
58:29 life now I'm gonna go go up to where I
58:32 need to go meet you when you come here
58:36 boom I get my life to myself I don't
58:40 feel like he's around anymore
58:41 I may be visits I don't know I want to
58:45 make sure that and I hope this is
58:47 already occurring because I'm not deeply
58:49 involved in this whatsoever
58:50 I want to neutralize through method and
58:55 discussion these little pockets of
58:59 reality were great people I feel like
59:05 they've lost control when they are
59:07 probably the most equipped to be in
59:10 control now again I'm assuming anyone
59:13 watching this video who
59:15 who may or may not be or let's just buy
59:18 may be suffering from a PTSD moment
59:20 whether it be again war theater stuff
59:22 domestic stuff you may be familiar with
59:25 every concept I'm talking about it is my
59:29 hope that through the way I describe it
59:31 it helps I hope that it adds perspective
59:36 such as you can write yourself some
59:38 blank checks every once in a while give
59:41 yourself a break don't feel like
59:43 everything has to be fixed right away if
59:46 you're having a bout of swimming
59:50 emotions that are driving you nuts
59:52 and I understand irrationality to I
59:55 understand you can get I mean Jesus it
59:58 happens to all of us without any PTSD
60:00 you can get angry and just lose your
60:02 frickin mind and say things you should
60:04 never say break something you shouldn't
60:06 break potentially hurt somebody even if
60:10 that occurs and you further embarrassed
60:13 yourself because of the condition don't
60:18 worry
60:19 sit down be honest
60:22 apologize hopefully you won't end up in
60:25 any penal system but even if you did use
60:30 that time to get in touch with yourself
60:32 it's it's just that moment that's lost
60:35 in time capture that moment put it in
60:39 place see your strengths because you
60:42 have strengths see your heroic instincts
60:45 to protect humanity there's nothing
60:49 better the Great Awakening has pulled in
60:52 millions of people around the world who
60:55 have that heroic gene but they don't
60:57 have and you need to go to war so
61:00 they're doing whatever they can to pass
61:01 information around to wake everyone up
61:03 to the craziness anyway hopefully that
61:08 was helpful I invite every single one of
61:12 you who are having the experience to
61:14 share what you're experiencing how off
61:19 target I am maybe how on target I am
61:21 because I want to I want to continue
61:24 this therapy in my own life I want to
61:26 continue it for other people
61:27 maybe I experienced something
61:29 in the near future some point in my life
61:31 that's traumatic and I want to have all
61:33 the equipment I could have - from folks
61:36 that have triaged it and fixed it
61:39 gain control if you've had an experience
61:42 that was successful in treating it
61:45 you've got a clinic that really worked
61:47 for you a process that worked for you
61:49 you realize if you share it down below
61:51 it's forever everyone can read that
61:53 stuff as long as your accounts still
61:55 active and your comments still there if
61:58 you're on the receiving side of it then
62:00 obviously patients is going to be
62:02 further defined beyond anything that
62:05 you've had defined in the past you're
62:08 gonna have to be very careful and
62:11 communicate every day every split second
62:13 what are you feeling what are you
62:14 feeling especially if there's a
62:15 imbalance going on at that particular
62:17 moment as I understand it from the
62:21 articles I've read okay it does come and
62:25 go and it just has a whole swimming of
62:28 maturation of emotions and and you might
62:35 find a tool to deal with depression but
62:37 you don't have a tool to deal with anger
62:39 but you maybe you have one for anger and
62:41 you don't have one for depression if
62:44 depression has any rationality in your
62:46 mind whatsoever just focus on the fact
62:49 that you'll get through this will
62:51 conquer it you will life will be better
62:55 than normal when you're done because you
62:58 will be stronger than all of us that
63:00 haven't experienced it and you might
63:03 save a life at a future point in time
63:05 whether you save another PTSD person or
63:09 you just save someone going through some
63:11 experience because you're so calm you've
63:15 seen stuff that no one ever sees and
63:17 when you're looking at whatever you're
63:19 looking at you're like we imagine you
63:21 imagine you went to war and you either
63:23 have PTSD or you didn't and you came
63:25 home and you you saw some serious
63:28 injuries and maybe even some some
63:30 casualties and your son or your daughter
63:33 wrecks their bike really bad and you
63:36 know they bung themselves up maybe even
63:38 broke their arm you can
63:42 come to their aid in a way that will be
63:46 amazing for that child making them feel
63:49 like they're gonna be just fine
63:53 you know this backyard back here used to
63:56 play catch with my daughter and before
63:58 she was really old enough to be on a
64:01 team in fact I think she's about this
64:04 must have been about eight or nine years
64:07 old the ball went back and I've got some
64:09 rose bushes back there and she leaned
64:12 down and pick up the ball and she drove
64:14 a thorn right into her forehead and she
64:18 pulled back and she felt the sting of
64:20 the thorn and I'm looking at her and I
64:23 see this trickle of blood goes straight
64:24 down her forehead now we have a choice
64:28 about how we're gonna deal with that and
64:30 I she was not a crier she just was like
64:33 who what what's going on and I just
64:37 looked at her and I went oops and I put
64:40 my palm right on her forehead like this
64:42 whoa putting the pressure right on that
64:44 little cut just barely scraped her but
64:46 you know there's a tremendous amount of
64:47 blood in your forehead for whatever damn
64:48 reason I put it on her forehead and I
64:52 said whoops I said you scraped yourself
64:53 let's go to the kitchen because I didn't
64:56 panic because I didn't feed into that
64:58 you know typical reaction of a parent oh
65:01 my god you know my kid didn't cry cuz
65:04 once the parent panics the kids gonna
65:05 double panic rate and we just bought
65:07 into the kitchen and luckily the
65:10 pressure I had put on her forehead
65:11 between right back there at that wall
65:13 and into the kitchen over here I pretty
65:16 much stopped the it stopped the bleeding
65:20 but now my kids gonna see blood she's
65:22 gonna see her own blood I don't know
65:24 she'd ever had seen that before
65:25 and I said and I said what be you scrape
65:28 yourself you got a little bit of put a
65:30 bullet blood coming out right and so I
65:32 just got a paper towel wedded it and I
65:33 just wiped off her forehead and washed
65:35 my hands off so she wouldn't have to see
65:36 a ton of it and I just dabbed it and
65:38 it's kind of like almost fakes but I
65:41 said you want a band-aid and kids love
65:42 band-aids man yeah sure Ian alright dink
65:44 on her forehead no problem the rest of
65:47 the day next day took the band-aid off
65:49 she's totally you well that's what a
65:52 soldier can do or someone who's gone to
65:55 something
65:56 traumatic when they recover or even
65:58 before you maybe even finished you can
66:00 add that security to someone's life and
66:02 be a little hero
66:03 in fact the kids your gigantic heroes
66:06 right but you can help your spouse that
66:09 way and maybe you know maybe it's not
66:12 that easy maybe it goes on for a little
66:15 while longer but again you've had your
66:19 saber sharpened to slay dragons in this
66:23 world see it that way
66:25 anyway if you haven't been to deep
