00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts during the day oh my gosh
00:35 I haven't been able do one during the
00:37 day for a really long time so talking
00:41 about whether I am going to cover again
00:48 even though it's embedded in hundreds of
00:51 episodes without exaggeration whether
00:55 manipulation because you can have like a
00:58 liberal friend that believes in climate
01:01 change because they've seen some data
01:04 and the truth matter is they probably
01:06 have seen some data that's a little
01:08 strange maybe now it's two ways to see
01:12 data one of the ways to see data is that
01:16 you are simply given a piece of paper
01:17 with [ __ ] all over it and then you
01:20 see it and you read you know that for
01:23 these leftist there's a lot of like
01:26 institutions that are still completely
01:29 legit simply because they have the name
01:32 you know the FDA or the CDC you know
01:35 again if you ingest [ __ ] like walking
01:38 dead
01:41 that was a CDC worshiping show for the
01:44 first two seasons CDC is gonna save your
01:47 life right how many times have you seen
01:53 a movie where an intelligence agency
01:55 saves the day but we know that these
01:58 intelligence agencies as of 2017 they're
02:04 some of the most well they're run by
02:06 some of the most corrupt cartel folks on
02:10 planet Earth all right of course I'd be
02:13 out of lighter fluid I'll be right back
02:17 so you have to feel for some people you
02:20 know when you grow up with institutions
02:22 that make you feel like they're
02:23 legitimate they claim to be legitimate
02:26 you know it's a it's kubler-ross bummer
02:31 when you find out that they're not and
02:34 then you go through this anger denial
02:35 negotiation and
02:37 baby acceptance but I think what's
02:42 interesting is is that we definitely
02:44 have a group of people that have shown
02:45 in every category of life that they
02:49 researched us nothing know everything
02:51 that their cognitive dissonance is the
02:53 worst and the highest level in society
02:56 and they're Democrats and then you have
02:59 this other group which is the center to
03:01 write which is the overwhelming majority
03:03 60% plus dot plus percentage that never
03:08 lost the capability of noticing that the
03:10 emperor has no clothes on they don't
03:13 have a problem living their life they
03:16 don't wake up in the morning and go I
03:18 need to you know find a cause and and
03:21 that causes you know to supplement the
03:24 lack of power I have in my own life so
03:26 I'm gonna join some movement right the
03:31 most you have on the extreme right are
03:33 annoying people who are religious nuts
03:36 who try to tell everybody they're going
03:37 to hell that's really the kind of I
03:39 don't know two or three
03:41 thousand-year-old game is played on the
03:43 extreme right but again they're that
03:46 species of people have died down because
03:48 religion is dying off because everyone's
03:50 sick and tired of the [ __ ] they just
03:53 we've seen it forever we're sick and
03:55 tired of it keep your hatred to yourself
03:57 but that groups known all the new groups
04:00 on the left well they're brand new and
04:02 so people are kind of like trying to
04:04 give it a fair chance they're like well
04:06 okay what is the black lives matter
04:07 thing wire why are NFL guys and gals
04:10 kneeling like what's the deal right so
04:14 people trying to figure it out do we
04:16 have a problem we need to solve what are
04:18 the statistics then you get the boil
04:20 call wolf and every one of these new
04:21 movements which is something to the
04:23 effect of the black lives matter tells
04:26 you that all black men are killed by
04:29 white cops and then Candace Owens comes
04:31 on goes you know I'm black and I know
04:35 this does happen on occasion but overall
04:37 it's us killing ourselves and that's an
04:39 easy one to fix if we could just you
04:42 know change our thinking and so that's
04:44 what she's trying to do with the black
04:45 sit movement you know weather
04:47 manipulation has been a wet dream of
04:49 rulers
04:52 probably as far back as anyone needing
04:55 to or anyone ruling over a superstitious
04:59 society that thinks that they can do a
05:02 rain dance and make it rain and they're
05:06 all starving because they're stuck in a
05:10 particular area of the world that is
05:12 having weather issues and they want to
05:15 make rain they want to stop the brain
05:17 they want to stop the floods they want
05:18 to make it float whatever the case might
05:20 be man has always wanted to manipulate
05:23 the weather once man experienced a
05:28 serendipitous moment where for instance
05:30 the there's been cases where the British
05:34 naval force is coming down to invade
05:37 Spain got caught in a storm everybody
05:40 died just mains been caught in it France
05:43 has been caught in it anytime a naval
05:45 force died due to random events anytime
05:51 you had fog on the battlefield where
05:54 people just marching and it aided one
05:57 group over the other someone's trying to
06:01 raid a castle and they're trying to
06:02 climb up a hill and a bunch of
06:03 torrential rains are coming down the
06:04 slopes it's making it very difficult
06:07 those are significant moments in time
06:10 and when military leaders write down why
06:13 they won it's because of the hurricane
06:15 the tornado the monsoon dadada the
06:20 people started going home and wouldn't
06:21 be cool if yeah I wouldn't it be cool
06:23 and you know two or three thousand years
06:25 ago the only real way they can get into
06:29 this is to pray to God
06:32 wasn't it interesting that there's this
06:34 weird threshold with technology the more
06:39 ignorant man remains and the more
06:44 technology advances for a few of men
06:47 then one group of people looks like a
06:50 guy to the other and I'm just gonna
06:53 touch on this as an example as a
06:54 metaphor but imagine that we were in the
06:57 firmament dome but instead of being
06:59 God's big eyeball looking down on you on
07:01 the other side like some of the World of
07:03 Warcraft dungeons
07:04 it's uh aliens another race just like us
07:10 who's looking down on us and they made
07:14 us and they're looking at us and they're
07:15 sociologically studying our evolution
07:17 trying to better understand themselves
07:19 perhaps but I'm just even better
07:21 understanding ourselves maybe they're
07:22 growing something maybe this whole game
07:26 is you need to get through this whole
07:28 game without turning to evil that's all
07:31 you got to do just get to the end don't
07:35 turn to evil don't hurt other people
07:37 don't step on people's heads to get
07:38 ahead never join them and we're going to
07:41 proliferate the world with more and more
07:44 bad guys and you know just like a video
07:48 game where the bosses get stronger and
07:50 stronger and stronger well when your
07:52 little kid we're gonna give you that
07:53 sort of it's just like World of Warcraft
07:56 you start off in a safe area to build
07:58 your character no one can mess with you
08:00 the other side can't take anything away
08:04 from you I didn't think they're allowed
08:05 to be in those areas but as it increases
08:07 so too is the formula formidable nature
08:10 of all the monsters and etc except you
08:14 you can eventually play other humans
08:16 right well in this world as you get
08:18 older and older it seems as if you start
08:21 to become aware acutely of all of the
08:24 corrupt leaders and today we're in an
08:28 avalanche of corrupt leaders from Merkel
08:31 the son of his daughter she's a son who
08:34 knows Queen Victoria but she's a
08:37 daughter of Hitler macron he's a proxy
08:41 of the Rothschilds Trudeau he's the son
08:43 of Castro you know I don't know if
08:46 Castro was bad
08:47 he definitely didn't like the US but it
08:50 just goes on
08:51 there's tons of folks right so as we
08:54 live and and then you know when it comes
08:56 down to us cuz I don't have to deal with
08:57 those foreign leaders necessarily
08:59 speaking well we have on our side
09:02 corporations you know that reports the
09:04 bankers the bankers reports corporations
09:06 corporations can mobilize you know the
09:11 law they can mobilize lawsuits against
09:13 you they can hire on that like the
09:14 pharmaceutical companies are having all
09:16 of these doctors who are against faxing
09:18 Asians brutally murdered I think there's
09:21 over 75 doctors and their family members
09:23 that have been found chopped up and in
09:25 their car trunks because dad or mom is a
09:29 doctor you said you know I don't think
09:32 these vaccinations are healthy anymore
09:34 we don't make them healthy anymore we're
09:35 putting too much aluminum and and
09:37 Mercury inside them it's not that they
09:39 can't work it's just the ones that we
09:41 make are really bad and then poof the
09:43 family disappears right and then we find
09:47 them you know in their backyard pieces
09:50 no one is saying anything the press
09:52 doesn't cover any that stuff oh but we
09:55 can OD on the Charlie's Charles Manson
09:57 things from way back in the late 60s
10:00 early 70s right Oh remember that one
10:04 strange what does all this have to do
10:07 with weather modification well weather
10:09 modification is to feed agendas that
10:12 feed these people that maintained their
10:16 control over us it is simply that now is
10:21 are their weather manipulation that can
10:24 be pulled out of the bag and used during
10:25 a war sure but we're not in that kind of
10:28 war right now right I mean it was
10:30 interesting that there was an earthquake
10:31 in Iran right now around the time of the
10:33 missile strike retaliate issue and
10:35 missile strike on us your part of it is
10:39 just so you understand war just to a
10:42 fundamental degree a lot of you already
10:45 understand this let's say you had your
10:49 having a little fight with a friend it's
10:52 it's a friendly fight it's it's like
10:54 let's just play tag or whatever right
10:55 but you have a fence between your house
10:57 and their house and if you sit down in a
11:00 chair like I am right now and they sit
11:01 down at your honor and you can't see him
11:03 but the game is we have all these
11:04 tomatoes and we're throwing them across
11:07 the thing you will initially throw them
11:11 all until you're out of tomatoes and
11:12 then you're like oh man I probably
11:14 should have thrown them a little slower
11:15 a little more strategic great and
11:18 eventually you do that the next game you
11:21 hit them right in the face with a really
11:22 good because you listen to their voice
11:23 you bring in some data and you throw it
11:26 it hits right in the face and then the
11:27 game over you won that round and now you
11:29 have all your other Tomatoes here
11:32 or any of you play paintball you'll have
11:36 you know guys that just just dump their
11:39 cartridges instantaneously just blah
11:41 blah and they're empty they're empty and
11:43 there's 60 seconds into the fight so
11:47 they're running around trying to find
11:47 you know I'm trying to pour more ammo
11:49 and their thing little paint balls but
11:53 when you get good you hold every round
11:57 because if you get hit you're out you're
12:00 out it's not three lifes in you're out
12:02 you're out immediately and so you want
12:05 to have more ammo than your other guy so
12:08 when we do weather attacks let's just
12:10 say that we created the United States of
12:12 America created the earthquake strike in
12:15 Iran by some nuclear facility we did
12:19 that let's say well what happened so
12:23 sulemani orchestrates this embassy you
12:28 know cou they run in their trailer place
12:31 up burnin or place down or and burn it
12:33 up inside we shoot his helicopter he
12:35 dies he's actually the president of Iran
12:37 he's not just the general but we don't
12:39 think about generals being presidents
12:41 because we don't live in a dictatorship
12:42 when we live in a dictatorship the
12:44 journal and the president are the same
12:45 thing
12:45 Toula and whatever he just takes the
12:50 heat so now they're angry at us they
12:53 have to save face with their people they
12:56 have a big funeral you know state
12:58 funeral for him then they shoot a bunch
13:00 of missiles over technically nobody dies
13:03 but some people did get injured in fact
13:07 some fairly severely and it's the
13:09 concussion on their heads as I heard it
13:11 reported people flown to Germany most
13:14 people back in duty who were reported
13:16 injured but now what happens very
13:21 shortly after that I can't remember what
13:23 the magnitude was but I think it's like
13:24 5.8 somewhere in there Iran has an
13:28 earthquake in a very strategic location
13:30 ah see United States of America may have
13:34 used a weapon de crédit earthquake and
13:39 then we make phone call let me say okay
13:42 that was us that earthquake was us and
13:45 we could put those things in
13:47 and we can make him a hell of a lot
13:49 stronger than that so so it's a
13:53 deterrent now Iran doesn't want war
13:56 because again dictators only risk losing
13:59 everything in a war if you had a good
14:03 country where people voted for you then
14:06 in war everyone's united in the war and
14:09 then everyone comes back to the you know
14:12 starting line after it's over and you
14:14 hug it out and you're like 'hey okay
14:16 where are you okay is the leader okay
14:18 yeah that's great
14:18 instead of the people hate the leaders
14:21 right 95% of Iranians don't like their
14:23 leadership so leadership gets them into
14:25 a war their family members died and it
14:28 looked at the leadership go and look
14:29 what you did to us let's get rid of you
14:32 that's why I Rahm will never throw down
14:35 now whether when is the first indicator
14:40 that we have I should say proof that
14:45 weather modification was possible I just
14:48 saw this documentation recently in 1948
14:53 the United States government conducted
14:56 an experiment where they seeded the
14:58 clouds and created a storm okay there
15:03 you go
15:03 proof positive we can do it again in
15:09 2020 you can hire for a hundred thousand
15:12 dollars an agency to go over your
15:15 daughter's wedding or your son's wedding
15:16 and clear out the storm such at the
15:20 reception and the wedding is clean as a
15:22 bell right interesting that you can
15:26 manipulate the weather even though in
15:28 doing so you create a butterfly effect
15:30 somewhere else in the world imagine
15:32 there's a wedding in Wichita Kansas
15:34 directly in the center of the United
15:36 States of America there spring causes a
15:41 chain of events such that in Tennessee
15:43 there's an f5 hurricane the kills a
15:48 thousand people
15:51 usually tornadoes don't kill a ton of
15:53 people because you can see them and they
15:55 do move slow enough that unless you're
15:57 caught directly in the funnel which is
15:59 where the surprise happens you can look
16:01 at the thing and run away I mean
16:03 physically you can actually just run on
16:04 feet on your foot on on foot and get
16:09 away earthquakes a little different but
16:13 now why would today we be worried about
16:18 weather manipulation at all why would we
16:21 worry well they have hatched a scheme
16:26 and it is a scheme that is appealing to
16:34 the moral fiber of individuals that feel
16:37 the technology has gotten out of control
16:40 but in order to give a concession to the
16:45 individuals that are willing to keep
16:46 this facade going that we have climate
16:50 change created by mankind that is
16:52 natural and not intended not in
16:55 intentional to create the scam and the
16:58 illusion that it's natural what do you
17:01 have you have a liberal someone who's
17:05 again not very tenacious with life
17:09 doesn't really have anything else to do
17:11 with their life and so they need a
17:12 movement climate change is right there
17:14 to give them the movement there's
17:15 pamphlets on how to hate people in the
17:17 climate change movement who to tell on
17:21 just like you know Nazi Germany tell
17:25 when someone watch them get dragged away
17:27 by the government then you know rub your
17:30 hands together of how great you are as a
17:32 human being
17:34 think about the world being some utopia
17:37 and then go back inside your house turn
17:41 on your TV that's creating a big carbon
17:43 footprint use your slave labor created
17:46 telephone your Apple iPhone feel like
17:51 your superior
17:53 drink your fluoride brush with your
17:55 fluoride drink your aspartame each or
17:58 GMO take your vaccinations same exact
18:00 group of people hilarious
18:03 the contradiction in moral fiber
18:05 couldn't be more outrageous with a
18:09 climatologist person Greta Sundberg okay
18:14 it took her a year to figure out that
18:15 she was traveling and the most carbon
18:17 footprint and tense way on planet Earth
18:20 which is private airplanes mm-hmm now
18:24 the whole the whole asinine thing about
18:28 this climate change thing is that
18:30 they're going after co2 carbon now we as
18:34 human being should not be breathing like
18:36 pure carbon right you shouldn't get on a
18:38 steam train from the 1800s right where
18:41 the smokestack comes out stand behind it
18:43 and then ingest all that stuff coming up
18:45 you shouldn't do that
18:46 go ask a coal miner how their lungs are
18:48 doing but that's not what we're talking
18:51 about we're talking about co2 coming out
18:53 of the back of a car now again just
18:57 because I'm gonna tell you the truth
19:00 about the situation doesn't mean that I
19:02 believe we should be using oil for
19:04 anything I think you do have to come to
19:06 terms the fact that oil is not a fossil
19:08 fuel it's a natural byproduct a methane
19:10 gas that's naturally created in the
19:12 bowels of the earth one carbon for
19:14 hydrogen getting crushed by more carbon
19:15 that's turning into crude oil then we
19:19 refine the carbon atoms off of it and we
19:22 get various Octane's of fuel that's the
19:25 truth
19:25 whether you believe the truth or not it
19:27 doesn't give a [ __ ] it's still the truth
19:30 so gasoline is not a fossil fuel so the
19:33 problem with that is is that it will
19:35 always recreate itself in the bowels of
19:37 the earth every oil well will fill back
19:39 up as the earth gets larger and larger
19:42 through the expanding earth principles
19:45 of the electrical universe it's going to
19:49 create more and more oil it's just going
19:51 to do so we have to figure out a way to
19:54 process this stuff into something else
19:56 such that we don't destroy the planet
19:59 but it is creating this stuff naturally
20:02 and so mm-hmm
20:05 we would like to have the atmosphere
20:06 configured for our survival we would
20:09 like the ground to be configured so that
20:11 we can eat off of it but the earth hmm I
20:15 don't really think he cares I don't
20:16 think it really No
20:17 were here maybe I mean it does in it
20:19 doesn't right it's not going to curtail
20:21 its evolution just for you imagine for
20:25 instance you were a microscopic bug that
20:27 could live on a callable caterpillars
20:29 back and whatever secretions come out of
20:32 a caterpillar it's perfect for you it's
20:34 like strawberry sundaes coming out of
20:36 the back of an animal and you're just
20:38 gobbling that up but now the
20:41 caterpillars got to turn into a
20:42 butterfly the cocoons itself the
20:45 secretion stops as a matter of fact the
20:48 calcification around the outside of this
20:50 thing is using you as an agent it
20:53 dissolves you to turn into the wings it
20:56 dissolves you to do something well it's
20:59 just the evolution of the whole thing
21:00 isn't it
21:01 so think about the world is potentially
21:04 more like a caterpillar butterfly than
21:06 just the earth is ours it shall do what
21:10 we tell it to do the plants breathe what
21:15 plants breathe co2 alright we've done
21:20 tens of thousands of experiments where
21:23 when plants incur more co2 they have
21:28 thicker branches yield more fruit yield
21:31 more offspring period now any of you've
21:36 done even just the tiniest dive into
21:38 this whole climate change thing you
21:40 understand that if one volcano pops once
21:43 a year it accounts for over 70 percent
21:47 of all the co2 in the atmosphere slash
21:50 the greenhouse gas layer index of which
21:53 you should be able to recite this with
21:55 me for the listeners that have been here
21:58 a million times it is point zero five
22:01 four percent of a single percent of the
22:04 total percentage of everything that
22:06 makes us warm as a results from the
22:08 greenhouse gas layer index which is a
22:11 list of all chemicals that make us
22:12 warmer the 99.9% chemical that's up in
22:17 the atmosphere that makes us warm
22:18 it's called h2o aka water what are you
22:22 gonna do ban water now weather
22:25 manipulation would be only necessary to
22:28 catalyze this climate change slash
22:31 carbon credit thing in extreme cases
22:34 where we need they need to tell their
22:38 minions there again incapable of
22:42 researching anything minions or L too
22:44 lazy to research anything minions some
22:47 data they want to create you know some
22:51 real events they want to make Dallas
22:54 really hot one day that way everybody in
22:57 Dallas because my god did you feel hot
22:59 it was there's climate change you know
23:01 when I was a kid all right we would have
23:04 days and Kansa because I mowed lawns I
23:09 like to go to the bogs lifeguard I mowed
23:12 lawns and I like to go to the pool
23:15 anyway but we'd have like four weeks
23:18 were almost every single day it was a
23:21 hundred and five not just a hundred but
23:23 105 and because Kansas can get fairly
23:28 humid not quite as bad as Texas letting
23:31 your fairly humid because we have a lot
23:33 of lush green that just sweats right
23:35 it's it's it's a really hot 105 ok so
23:40 that is when they it's also proportional
23:43 what they can actually do with the
23:45 technology so what do we know about the
23:47 technology well we have two principal
23:51 devices that are above ground that
23:54 create storms or erase storms again just
24:00 go see the service that you can rinse
24:02 for your daughter's wedding to erase
24:04 storms that's pretty easy as far as
24:07 seeding clouds will that happened in
24:08 1948 up so we've proven that it's in
24:11 newspapers it's it was a revelation we
24:14 again my grandmother had the article on
24:15 the side of her her kitchen refrigerator
24:19 my whole life it seems strange that it
24:23 was there forever you know and now I'm
24:25 sitting here talking to you about it we
24:28 have the HAARP antenna har RP it is
24:32 patented for this very thing weather
24:36 manipulation they were awarded the
24:39 patent the Navy patented the device in
24:42 the late 50s okay so now we've got
24:45 we've got biplane technology they can
24:48 just see a storm erase a storm we have
24:52 an antenna and way up in Alaska placed
24:54 strategically in a place where no one
24:56 can get to it that ran for what 60 years
25:01 62 years and hey you know what I bet
25:03 they were running it in the 50s
25:06 supposedly they've dismantled it and you
25:09 know I'll believe that the day I
25:10 actually visit it and it's all gone
25:12 photos won't even convince me they've
25:14 gotten rid of it it's too powerful for
25:16 them but they've also built a ton of
25:17 them and all over the world and
25:18 different islands our competitors are
25:22 starting to do it and then we have the
25:26 potential that this technology has now
25:28 been moved into orbit and I don't care
25:33 what you believe about satellites being
25:35 balloons or being argue no settle loons
25:37 of always existed but high-altitude
25:39 satellites I don't care it's up there
25:41 potentially why not infinite power
25:45 sources in space all right so they've
25:50 got technology now are they able to make
25:53 it snow I'm not sure maybe you know they
25:57 move some stuff around by spraying in
25:59 various areas you're kind of moving
26:01 things around in the atmosphere moving
26:05 it to where you want to a tornado is
26:08 nothing more than a cold front hitting a
26:10 warm front and the warm fronts above the
26:13 cold fronts are below and it's they
26:14 slide one slides under one slides over
26:16 and it creates a roll just like a
26:18 cinnamon roll before you start chopping
26:20 it up it's horizontal and then it rains
26:23 on one side of that funnel that
26:26 horizontal rolling it's like a surf tube
26:29 and then that makes it fall to the
26:31 ground and then it tips up and that's
26:33 where you get the funnel that starts to
26:35 chase you around on the ground that's
26:37 why it's rare because it's difficult to
26:38 put these items together but if they
26:42 could spray in one area
26:43 high pressure in one area low pressure
26:45 in another area by erasing and and
26:46 creating storms and then they see the
26:50 crap out of one side they can get that
26:52 whole thing to orchestrate what other
26:56 things make you think
26:59 that the weather has changed because
27:02 weather manipulation weapons are are one
27:05 a tangible thing which is probably where
27:07 it becomes more important but since we
27:10 have this movement run by you know
27:12 mentally handicapped little girls being
27:15 in killed ridden flown all over the
27:17 world instead of being in school to
27:19 actually learn something we have some
27:21 I'm just gonna call it [ __ ] they have
27:25 been messing with data sets probably
27:29 about ten years ago I did a deep dive on
27:31 these ocean buoys that have been
27:34 bringing back data telling us that the
27:35 Atlantic air cited the Pacific Ocean
27:37 that's only where I still place to study
27:39 but the Pacific you know the the Ring of
27:43 Fire it's some lava flow underneath and
27:46 then all of this temperature of the
27:49 oceans we're suddenly rising and rising
27:53 at some ridiculous level not the
27:57 fraction of a percent that makes any
27:58 sense right well I come to find be come
28:02 to find out when I found a few websites
28:03 that were reporting this data and
28:06 they're all government-owned they're
28:09 owned by agent that well they're owned
28:11 by yet nonprofit agencies in some cases
28:15 completely funded by the Rockefellers
28:17 and the Rothschilds and other you know I
28:20 think one was the king and queen of
28:22 Spain funding one you know okay well
28:27 they say to make trillions of dollars
28:29 off carbon credits they're the ones are
28:32 gonna make you depopulate so those data
28:37 sets are not to be relied on and who has
28:40 the money to buy a true professional
28:43 buoy they can put a wire miles down such
28:50 that we can test this stuff and there's
28:52 no what who would pay enough money for
28:55 that data to pay for the entire effort
28:57 of maintenance in this thing what if it
29:00 goes dead well can what how much you
29:02 think that repair process is going to
29:04 take and to bring a big ship out there
29:06 anchor it grab the buoy grab the data
29:09 line which is hooked to a big you know
29:12 fiber some
29:13 metal cable reel the whole thing up
29:15 don't destroy it cuz you know you've
29:17 been did too much it could break it's
29:19 got to be a pain in the ass right when I
29:23 was a kid here's another real simple one
29:25 they've done when I was a kid I lived in
29:29 Kansas and I lived in Massachusetts
29:30 before I came to California because the
29:35 weather in the wintertime especially and
29:38 even in the summer because I worked
29:39 outside like I said it's formidable man
29:42 it's like you know I walked to school
29:44 one day in Massachusetts at 100 below
29:46 zero which was the temperature down plus
29:49 the intense winds and by the time I got
29:51 to school they were reporting that on
29:53 the radio because the wind shear and all
29:55 this other stuff and then II canceled
29:57 school that was re school going son of a
29:59 [ __ ] but you had to look at the weather
30:01 all the time on TV because it determined
30:03 what clothes you wore wasn't you going
30:05 to school or not and one would memorize
30:08 the color scheme that they would use for
30:13 your area and it used to be that the 90s
30:18 were blood-red and over a hundred
30:21 started to turn black but even some
30:25 cases black was only reserved for over
30:27 110 so Death Valley got the blacks and
30:31 everything else got deep deep blood reds
30:32 and it just kind of you know softened
30:35 out to the point where 73 was like a
30:38 beautiful green below that it started
30:40 going blue then it started going to
30:42 purple and into white today they have
30:45 adjusted the color scheme at least in
30:48 some television stations down about ten
30:52 degrees so every single color scheme
30:54 they used to use has been advanced so
30:57 that 73 now is starting to get orange Oh
31:02 because 73 is remotely warm right now 73
31:04 is a temperature that you'll see in
31:07 movies it is the average temperature in
31:09 Anaheim California where Disneyland was
31:11 built where they realized that the your
31:16 body temperature and the atmosphere are
31:19 almost the same or I should say whatever
31:21 atmosphere at the lower level where we
31:23 are is so close you don't even feel
31:26 weather
31:26 you don't feel cold and you don't feel
31:28 hot most of us like it a little bit
31:31 warmer like I said that's why I think
31:34 for for human temperature ratings
31:38 Fahrenheit is superior to Celsius
31:41 because the human body can sense a
31:44 single degree of Fahrenheit
31:46 you could definitely sense a single
31:49 degree of Celsius because it's several
31:51 degrees of Fahrenheit but the difference
31:55 between 74 and 73 for instance or 72 I
31:59 should say is a completely different day
32:01 right 72 you might you might end up
32:04 depending on a breeze or something put
32:06 something on 74 doesn't matter you're
32:08 feeling warm in Celsius it's like right
32:12 around that I don't know exactly what
32:13 the temperature is around that but you
32:15 know the difference between one Celsius
32:17 is a drastic difference and you can't
32:19 track the difference well you want to
32:21 know the fractions of a Celsius degree
32:23 if you really want to adjust your your
32:25 your senses
32:27 so they've adjusted the colors to make
32:31 you psychologically think that things
32:34 have gone up it starts a panic in the
32:36 morning before you've even left your
32:37 house because all the color schemes are
32:38 screwed up what else have they done well
32:42 it used to be that your car temperature
32:44 gauge inside your dashboard this that's
32:47 basically vouching for what's outside
32:50 was 100% accurate now my car has
32:53 actually got a very accurate
32:55 outside-inside gauge in terms of what it
32:58 says and what I feel and when I look up
33:00 at the Weather Channel you know whatever
33:02 apps I got on my phone it's it's
33:04 identical so that's pretty good but most
33:07 cheapy cars especially my my previous
33:10 car which was a Chevy it would tell me
33:15 that it's a hundred and five degrees
33:16 outside now it might be low 90s but at a
33:20 105 degrees outside 105 degree starts
33:22 taking your breath away even a dry heat
33:25 so they've adjusted all of our feedback
33:28 devices in our vehicles to basically be
33:32 potentially ten to fifteen degrees
33:34 hotter than it really is why because
33:37 they put that little temperature gauge
33:38 right down by your window
33:41 on your dashboard right up next to the
33:45 the hood of your car which when it
33:48 closes writes right there at the front
33:49 and it's just a boiling little center of
33:52 your car they know that the plastic is
33:56 thermal izing over the sensor the glass
33:59 potentially is even magnifying the Sun
34:01 down to the sensor they rapin it in a
34:03 little dome half the time which can
34:06 create a a focal point of boiling just
34:08 like a magnifying glass they're playing
34:10 games it's a global conspiracy and it's
34:15 all part of agenda 21 which we're gonna
34:17 bump into after we're over here after
34:19 we're done with this kind of recalling
34:21 what's going on here those the other
34:23 things that they've done to create
34:25 artificial warming datasets well one of
34:30 the most famous things they did in Las
34:32 Vegas and this is all this is sort of an
34:35 educational thing for me when I heard it
34:38 so if you hear this and it's sort of
34:41 illogical to your brain then you're
34:44 normal but it is actually the way it
34:46 works if you want to find out how hot it
34:49 is in Las Vegas
34:50 you put a temperature gate out out in
34:53 the desert very close to town maybe just
34:56 even a mile out half a mile but you put
34:59 it in an area where there's soil on the
35:01 ground and the sensor is just right
35:03 there
35:03 whatever it says is generally wherever
35:07 you are generally what it is right you
35:09 know there's little pockets here near
35:13 what you don't do is bring it inside the
35:16 city put it on a black asphalt roof put
35:22 it on some put it near some cement
35:26 bunker because the surfaces that I'm
35:31 talking about there that aren't natural
35:33 not natural soil well heat that sensor
35:37 up way beyond what it really is and then
35:40 you think it's a hundred and twenty 125
35:42 maybe it's 105 to 110 because it's Vegas
35:48 so when they do that okay so when they
35:52 mess with the sensors in your car
35:54 nothing's gonna happen necessarily
35:55 you're gonna take a photo on social
35:57 media I am in during this really hot
36:00 weather day Emma in Los Angeles just say
36:03 Los Angeles is rarely at hundred degree
36:06 days especially in the last 10 years
36:10 2003 we had a surge because the sunspots
36:12 on the Sun which I'll explain because
36:14 that's a big part of the reality of
36:16 heating right but when you bring a
36:19 sensor from the desert into the city you
36:23 now can incorporate that data into the
36:26 meteorological data that is going to be
36:28 report on national news and then you've
36:31 created a lie of inaccurate data it's a
36:35 lie because those who understand
36:36 meteorology know that that is an
36:39 inaccurate method and a disingenuous
36:41 method of measuring heat and so it goes
36:46 into some liberals brain about how
36:48 climate change is real and they pass it
36:50 around they might even take a screenshot
36:52 of their phone all right now let's say
36:57 that we have research teams that go to
36:59 the South Pole to go to northern Alaska
37:02 and they're taking ice samples they're
37:04 taking photographs of glaciers and they
37:06 are scientists and so they're gonna be
37:09 looking at stuff very intently intensely
37:12 excuse me intentionally intensely and
37:15 they're gonna be bringing back datasets
37:17 so we need to create we'd being the the
37:22 analogy of those are going to benefit
37:23 from this whole thing we need to create
37:27 a few pockets where it's gonna be
37:29 looking like things are bad
37:32 northern Alaska typically has an average
37:35 mean temperature of below 32 or below 32
37:38 fahrenheit is zero Celsius it is
37:41 freezing the point of freezing anything
37:44 over that things start to melt already
37:48 now we should talk about the difference
37:51 between North Pole and South Pole north
37:53 pole doesn't have a continent up there
37:54 it's just ice frozen ocean so it's very
37:59 very flat and if the entire northern cap
38:02 melts which it does about every other by
38:04 the every year and a half it doesn't
38:06 make the ocean rise because
38:08 is uh you know it's 99% already in the
38:10 water that you go to the South Pole it
38:14 has a continent so you have gigantic
38:17 mountains and I mean huge mountains down
38:19 there well its average temperature is 60
38:21 degrees cooler fahrenheit than the North
38:24 Pole it is never going to melt all the
38:27 way off because it is so high it can't
38:30 ever achieve a temperature over 32
38:32 degrees and everything around that
38:36 continent you have the atmosphere is
38:39 always moving from one side to the other
38:40 and so you get sheets of ice that are
38:43 forming on one side and melting off on
38:45 the other or what did the climatologist
38:47 do that try to depopulate the world with
38:50 this carbon taxation they go to the side
38:52 that's melting and take all the
38:53 photographs but what about all these
38:57 people who dig ice out of the ground and
38:59 then take a look at it there are folks
39:02 that have been indoctrinated okay they
39:04 don't know anything about weather
39:05 manipulation it's funny here they are
39:08 studying ice and they come back home
39:09 with all these fear-mongering stories
39:12 the blog that everyone reads that makes
39:13 them feel amazing
39:15 well the jet streams get modified by Kim
39:19 trails ooh what's Kim Trails well it's
39:25 an air assault program was it Brandon or
39:30 Brendan Brendan the former head of the
39:32 CIA in Obama's era just went up to the
39:35 Council on Foreign Relations and talked
39:36 about the fact that they're gonna start
39:38 doing this you hear it all the time
39:39 they've been talking about it for 12
39:42 years now where they're gonna spray
39:44 aluminum oxide into the atmosphere to
39:47 create a shield a reflective shield
39:49 against global warming it is a scam to
39:53 manipulate weather to create the data
39:55 such that they get their way by freaking
39:58 everybody out so when you go to the
40:01 South Pole what do you do you only go to
40:02 the bases that are established you can't
40:05 just wander around I just watched a
40:07 video yesterday about all of the
40:09 applications you have to file to do an
40:11 independent research program in the
40:14 South Pole it's impossible the amount of
40:18 blue to red tape you have to cut through
40:19 is unbelievable
40:22 you have to do like you know surveys of
40:25 your environmental impact on the world
40:27 but you know because you can't you can't
40:29 poop and leave it there you can't bring
40:32 any motorized equipment you can't
40:35 disturb any animal or plant life as
40:37 you're walking on the ground meanwhile
40:40 you can go to Mount Everest whenever you
40:41 want and die and they'll just leave your
40:43 body up there for 50 years no problem
40:47 nope there's no attempt to save you
40:49 there's no attempt to get your body down
40:50 off the hill you're just up there and
40:52 you're dead
40:53 everyone who's reached the the Mount of
40:55 the the peak of Mount Everest has seen
40:57 at least a dozen dead bodies frozen if
41:02 not just a shadow in the ice is the full
41:06 body it's half frozen or wood and no one
41:09 attempts to do anything it's
41:11 disrespectful to touch him so no state
41:14 agency cares but by the way there were
41:16 some dates that were messed up from the
41:18 first time this was reported I believe
41:21 Dube got it wrong the treaty for the
41:25 South Pole was signed in 1959 January
41:27 1st by 54 countries not signed in 1954
41:32 so I've been quoting that five years off
41:34 doesn't really matter it's a ludicrous
41:36 treaty where Russia didn't sign it which
41:40 i think is interesting so in terms of
41:43 changing the ice
41:45 nothing's gonna do that you're gonna dig
41:47 the ice it's gonna give you all kinds of
41:49 historical data it's gonna prove the
41:51 fact that the co2 levels in the Middle
41:53 Ages were way way higher than they are
41:55 today
41:55 and the whole world survived and there's
41:57 no physical evidence that we had
42:00 flooding inland like they say we're
42:02 gonna have today if we don't stop what
42:04 we're doing but you know I've kept
42:06 saying agenda 21 and depopulation and
42:11 carbon taxation so where does this all
42:14 come together
42:14 let's see your total noob to this show
42:16 and you're new to this whole thing I
42:20 almost think there's nobody who's new to
42:22 anything but maybe it's cuz I've been in
42:25 this for a long time okay we have 7.5
42:31 billion people and growing two countries
42:35 are responsible
42:35 for three billion and probably should
42:39 rethink the way that they manage their
42:41 world America is about 350 Europe's
42:45 about 700 some places are you know the
42:49 white man's falling out to face of the
42:51 planet but the people that controlled
42:54 the world know one thing about the
42:57 mathematics of their control apparatus
42:58 the more people there are in this world
43:01 especially foreigners that don't believe
43:03 in their doctrine the more difficult it
43:06 is to control and eventually those
43:09 people will rise up in number learn
43:13 enough to defend themselves learn enough
43:16 to be then aggressive because you learn
43:17 how to defend yourself first then you
43:19 become aggressive second and they will
43:21 move into Europe and they will take all
43:24 these leaders out all these people that
43:26 control us I should say leaders are
43:29 really just you know scam artists but
43:33 your your families that are known for
43:35 this stuff all royalty will be wiped out
43:37 all banker families will be wiped out
43:39 and they know this they know it's just a
43:41 mathematical constant and deep down
43:44 inside if not right on the very surface
43:45 of their doctrine they understand that
43:48 what they do to humanity is so hideous
43:50 and so bad they know that eventually
43:54 everyone will figure out that generally
43:56 every single war that has been fought
43:58 since I'd saved last 500 years at least
44:01 had all been instigated by these bankers
44:04 by these rulers to either make you not
44:07 focus on the bad leadership that you
44:09 have by creating a common enemy
44:10 among the people or it's just a
44:13 profiteering thing where the Rothschild
44:15 is set back several times in history for
44:17 hundreds of years and said okay we're
44:19 gonna finance that guy to hate this guy
44:21 and then this guy's gonna be finance to
44:22 hate that guy and we're gonna finance
44:25 him in a in a way that keeps the war
44:27 fairly proportionate we're even gonna
44:29 work to leak information back and forth
44:31 so one person gets an acre the bomb and
44:33 the other person gets Aviation we're
44:35 going to link the aviation to the
44:36 nuclear people and Nicola to the
44:37 aviation people kind of keeping them on
44:39 an even keel why because they want the
44:41 wars to last as long as possible in
44:44 terms of death count they don't care
44:46 they don't even think about that unless
44:48 it's going to kill
44:49 so many people that there's not enough
44:51 people to fight the war and then they
44:52 might pull one back because it was last
44:54 forever so eventually these people will
44:58 be tied and quartered beheaded shot it
45:03 you know with some shooting range
45:06 they'll be killed and so they know that
45:09 and they therefore have hatched a plan
45:13 to depopulate the world to get control
45:17 again their leverage point is going to
45:19 be different in the future than they've
45:21 ever had in the past and they're very
45:22 excited about this which is to use
45:24 technology to control the people
45:27 drones surveillance they'll have all the
45:32 guns and you'll have none they'll
45:34 control your food supply they'll control
45:36 your pharmaceutical intake which will
45:38 make you very docile
45:39 aka weak to anyone over you they're
45:43 developing robots to do the job so they
45:45 don't have to even be there they don't
45:47 need to worry about loyalty because the
45:48 application inside the robot will always
45:50 be low okay so we have some indicators
45:56 like what makes this real what makes
45:58 this fiction well the only thing that
46:02 makes it fiction in people's mind is
46:03 their inability to believe that that
46:05 this kind of plan could be created
46:07 hatched and implemented but we have some
46:12 indicators don't we now the one thing
46:15 that they figured out in the 20th
46:16 century was that the more they provided
46:18 energy to the population of the world
46:20 the more that we moved around the
46:22 surface of the world and populated
46:25 because we come to a brand new oasis
46:27 some field you know maybe like 50 to 100
46:30 acres no one's there
46:32 alright so this loving couple starts to
46:36 build a log cabin
46:38 maybe there's a few couples to build a
46:41 little town they start having lots of
46:44 kids and then you have a community well
46:46 there was none before so there's a curve
46:50 of availability of energy from
46:53 especially the 1830s when oil started
46:55 being used to move trains there's an
46:59 exact curve of exponential population
47:02 growth
47:03 and so they have made the connection
47:07 availability of energy increases world
47:11 population thus a threat to their
47:14 existence that is why South America and
47:18 Africa have very limited energy
47:22 resources they don't want those two
47:24 areas of the world to explode but China
47:26 has got effectively as much energy as
47:30 anyone else in the world
47:32 they have figured out enough to do what
47:34 they do and these communism to keep out
47:37 any you know counter theories right
47:41 meaning someone coming in and saying
47:43 look you guys are screwing too much stop
47:45 so China is exporting all of their
47:48 people all over the world all these
47:51 stories about how you can't get a visa
47:53 to leave the country that's their
47:55 purpose in life that is the Communist ik
47:58 purpose in life is to get you can go
48:00 anywhere you want and they'll load you
48:02 up with cash and so you can get out and
48:05 set up camp and America and Australia
48:07 New Zealand and Europe and and populate
48:10 because eventually in their mind and
48:13 they're very very clever and they're
48:14 absolutely correct in this algorithm
48:16 China will take over the entire world
48:19 population eventually will all either be
48:22 a derivative of Chinese or will be
48:24 full-blooded Chinese living in an area
48:27 where this is occurring I know that the
48:29 families do not want their children to
48:33 procreate with anyone but Chinese people
48:35 so there's a bit of bigotry embedded in
48:38 just we're talking about fresh boat
48:40 people not necessarily people who grew
48:41 up here they really want you to stay in
48:44 the thing and it it totally makes sense
48:46 they're simply acknowledging and they're
48:49 allowed to acknowledge and they're
48:50 allowed to be bigots like that because
48:53 they're foreigners everyone in America
48:54 just goes well that's just where they
48:55 roll but if a white kids goes you know
48:59 white family were to see you can't eat
49:00 that black girl because she's black
49:02 oh man of course that's a repulsive
49:05 censorship on the family you don't do
49:09 that that's racism that's bigotry same
49:11 neighborhood Chinese situation blank
49:14 check no problem happens all the time
49:17 okay well it's a game people is it
49:21 illegal to do what they do yeah they're
49:23 just playing the game and guess what
49:26 they're winning all right you know I
49:30 don't know I think quite frankly for my
49:33 for my perspective it is a game of wits
49:38 all right if you're playing chess you
49:40 know you don't punch the guy in the face
49:42 because he took your queen you just play
49:45 to get checkmated and hey men the dude's
49:47 better than you and you're a decent
49:49 intellectual human being you just go to
49:52 shame my friend Touche when they played
49:54 another game you know but you don't get
49:56 another chance in reality right once you
49:58 get depopulated out of existence then
50:00 you're gone right so there's this other
50:06 kind of subplot that white people are
50:08 supposed to hate themselves and we're
50:10 suppose to depopulate out of the world
50:11 which is very very strange because the
50:13 controlling bodies that run the world
50:15 are predominantly white so I'm not quite
50:18 sure what they're thinking at the top
50:19 but I think what their thing is we want
50:21 some sweet foreign slaves to do all of
50:24 our artwork and will populate just this
50:26 embedded you know bloodline at the top
50:29 so it'll be the white people at the
50:31 tippy top of the pyramid and everyone
50:33 else will be slaves but to be very few
50:34 of them anyway will always be able to
50:36 depopulate and kill any little group
50:38 that we can that we want to whenever we
50:40 want to I know this sounds really
50:41 extreme sounds like a conspiracy theory
50:44 and not a fact I gotta say it search
50:47 your heart so climate change as enabled
50:53 by weather manipulation techniques Chloe
50:56 again the psychological color scheme
50:59 changes and and thermometers being put
51:01 in ridiculous places and data sets
51:03 coming out of the ocean that are all
51:04 fake and weather manipulation that
51:06 creates you know these concentrated
51:08 one-time one-off events where you have
51:10 like a record cold here and a record
51:12 heat there remember when Al Gore did his
51:15 movie the 2006 December it was all about
51:19 global warming not about any other
51:21 algorithm when someone said okay well
51:24 you've got to get this thing passed by
51:25 2010 because by 2020 we're gonna be in
51:28 the the next mini ice age which is
51:30 cold weather that I'm experiencing now
51:32 we're not gonna be able push this and so
51:34 some genius in the next four years said
51:39 you know I got it we're gonna call
51:41 climate change not global warming that
51:43 way we can take and usurp anything that
51:45 happens with the weather on any
51:46 particular day anywhere in the world
51:48 which is always constantly happening
51:50 right when I grew up in the 70s and 80s
51:52 in the Midwest in Massachusetts New
51:55 England area there's always some town
51:57 that had the coldest day ever the
51:59 hottest day ever nobody freaked out we
52:02 were excited it was oh wow that's really
52:03 cool we lived through that you know but
52:07 what is this carbon taxation thing
52:09 because everyone's getting this in their
52:11 bills today in America the energy
52:14 companies send you emails about how many
52:16 climate credits you have carbon credits
52:18 you have it's happening underneath
52:21 because it's agenda21 so now it's time
52:25 to Xanadu these two things together a
52:27 little bit of rock and roll a little bit
52:28 of country the Osmond family action here
52:31 on one side of the game you get Al Gore
52:35 with this company blood and gore who
52:36 owned the CCX the climate change
52:39 exchange out of Chicago he set himself
52:41 up to make trillions of dollars off this
52:43 thing and then you have this global
52:45 policy system called agenda 21 it comes
52:48 in and says we're gonna rule the world
52:49 by our bought off shills that are in
52:52 every single agency around the world
52:54 then we're going to use the Bilderberg
52:56 Group who finds through headhunters all
52:58 the leaders of the world and they're
53:00 gonna sign off on everything again Jena
53:03 21 / - Jenna 2030 as an aboveground
53:06 agenda in the EU it's not a conspiracy
53:08 at all you meet once a year on it we
53:11 have big summits every ten years it's a
53:13 very in-your-face thing in America -
53:15 conspiracy theory isn't that funny so
53:19 the climate change thing is coming in
53:23 through agenda 21 they're pumping it
53:26 putting billions and billions of dollars
53:29 into anyone that can create fake
53:31 datasets to make you believe in this
53:33 theory it's horrific been on the other
53:38 side the power companies that are owned
53:40 by these corporations
53:43 what else do we have we have again
53:46 nonprofit agencies filling us full of
53:48 false data are now trying to say that
53:52 you have to spend your carbon credits to
53:53 heat your house to cool your house to
53:56 buy food - it's not all there yet but
53:58 it's all planned ok
54:01 remember what I told you about energy
54:02 and population ok when you don't have
54:06 tyranny over your head when you don't
54:08 allow globalists to run your life and
54:10 you find that little plot of land that
54:12 couple acres that you can make your own
54:14 maybe 10 to 100 acres in order to plow
54:18 something to to make an income you can
54:21 have 20 kids no one is there telling you
54:23 you can't do that
54:26 ok now should we be having 20 kids no I
54:30 mean if everybody did it we'd be in a
54:34 climate of population that would be
54:36 unbelievable right but you should be
54:41 able to have at least two that maintains
54:43 population a mother and father have two
54:46 children that replaces the mother and
54:48 replaces the father if they have a third
54:50 child then their increasing population
54:52 right they've had an extra head to the
54:54 count all right so what they've done is
54:59 they've created this climate credit
55:01 thing or this carbon credit thing excuse
55:02 me that basically says you'll have
55:04 enough barely to have one child so if to
55:08 make one you've reduced the whole
55:10 population if you want to have that
55:12 second child to maintain the population
55:14 you're gonna have to actually find
55:15 credits that you can buy off someone
55:18 else who's willing to sell them to you
55:20 through the CCX or other like-minded
55:23 corporations that trade carbon credits
55:25 like a stock exchange in Sal Gore's
55:29 profit margin of course the dude did his
55:33 movie I do this movie I want a Grammy an
55:36 Oscar a Nobel Prize and every other
55:37 thing on planet Earth a Golden Globe and
55:40 everything and I get to be a
55:41 trillionaire Wow
55:43 that sounds like a fall up hill thing so
55:46 now you can't afford to have that other
55:48 kid potentially now the rich get to have
55:53 kids and the poor can't have any
55:56 the more you live in in aggressive
55:59 environments like very cold environments
56:01 in New England or very hot environments
56:03 such as like Houston Texas your carbon
56:07 credits are gonna burn away just because
56:09 you can't afford to live in those
56:11 regions you can't afford to heat your
56:13 house you can't afford to cool it down
56:15 you don't have enough carbon credits for
56:19 you and your spouse of course the other
56:21 thing too we don't really talk about is
56:22 that the world has been designed to be
56:24 divorced so usually our single mom or
56:27 single dad which means you don't have
56:28 enough credits to do anything again this
56:32 is already in motion it's not fully
56:35 implemented but just like Obamacare that
56:38 came around in America you have an
56:40 existence tax when he signed this thing
56:42 up pharmaceutical companies and the
56:44 insurance companies wrote the policy
56:45 Obama lied every single time he moved
56:48 his mouth when he talked about his plan
56:52 he lied he said you could keep your
56:54 doctor keep your plan he totally lied he
56:57 said it would be cheaper he totally lied
56:59 not only were the initial premiums twice
57:02 of what anyone else has they've
57:05 quadrupled since then and your
57:07 deductibles are eight to ten thousand
57:09 dollars your co-pays are 20% but you'll
57:14 be paying fifteen hundred dollars a
57:16 month for a healthy family of three mom
57:20 dad in one child in Texas when your
57:24 average income might be after working
57:27 ten years as a teacher and you're a
57:29 celebrated teacher you might make ten it
57:31 might make sixty grand like big ten over
57:33 the normal pay just a little footnote to
57:36 about that it used to be in America the
57:40 teachers got paid during the summertime
57:42 today we have it so bad with public
57:46 school systems in America especially in
57:48 California that some schools simply shut
57:50 down on particular days and the parents
57:53 have no idea when this is going to occur
57:55 when the parent calls the school and
57:57 says why is my kid off school today and
58:00 I got to find a place you know a sitter
58:02 or something cuz it could be little kids
58:03 it can't watch themselves right the
58:06 school says well we didn't get enough
58:08 money
58:10 the state to keep the school open today
58:11 so we're all taking a day off the
58:15 teachers don't get paid on that day the
58:18 kids don't have any education on that
58:19 day and so it goes year-round because we
58:23 can't squeeze in and the minimum amount
58:25 of days a child should be in school to
58:26 get educated to simply get the material
58:28 into their brain to become decent human
58:31 beings that have trade skills that can
58:33 go and contribute to society that's how
58:36 bad it is here where I grew up it was
58:41 pure perfection
58:42 you started in very late August or first
58:45 day of September we got to school at 8
58:49 o'clock with five days a week you got
58:52 out of three o'clock and you were done
58:55 with school by May 25th so we got the
58:58 last few days of May to ourselves all of
59:00 June all of July nearly all of August
59:02 for a kid to venture out into the world
59:05 as the world was designed to experience
59:08 life to try out all those skills to
59:12 watch your uncle rebuild a car to go to
59:14 your dad's work and see what happens for
59:16 me it was painting and drawing and
59:19 learning how to play instruments and
59:21 program a computer to become a lifeguard
59:24 you know to do these things that I
59:27 wouldn't had Nev time to train for them
59:29 had I been living in the globalist world
59:32 but now let's take the carbon taxation
59:35 system which I just explained and
59:37 agenda21 which you've never heard of it
59:39 you got a researcher woman named Rosa
59:41 Cori ko ir e just look up Rosa agenda21
59:46 I have an episode on it there's a little
59:50 thing in Georgia call the Georgia
59:54 Guidestones
59:56 again if you're a longtime listener
59:58 you've heard this a million times but
60:01 it's a thing that kind of looks like a
60:04 it's reminiscent of Stonehenge a little
60:07 bit but it's built out of what I think
60:09 it's a Burton Georgia something like
60:13 that and they're known for tombstone
60:16 stone so everyone has a tombstone in the
60:19 area can get their tombstone dug out of
60:21 that area because they have the quarry
60:22 and the type
60:23 rock that's usually used for that so
60:25 these things are massive I think they're
60:27 like damn near 20 feet tall they're huge
60:30 they're beautifully bolted to the ground
60:33 there's four of them for these giant
60:35 stones with a kind of a capstone over
60:37 them to look like a Stonehenge II thing
60:39 and then in a circle around that initial
60:44 structure they have these little plaques
60:45 that repeat the message in different
60:48 languages now only one stone has it in
60:51 English and on the backside stone is
60:53 another language so the initial four
60:56 stones have eight languages of the same
60:58 ten commandments of the globalists so
61:04 the two through ten are fairly abstract
61:08 fairly symbolic right Letha mattock and
61:11 you can get behind them you're not quite
61:13 sure what all of them mean but the first
61:15 one is a doozy as I like to say the
61:18 first one reads maintain world
61:20 population under five hundred million
61:25 it's either under or at five hundred
61:26 million in perpetual balance with nature
61:29 this was built in 1981 they still exist
61:33 to this day people have tried to blow
61:35 them up pulled him down
61:37 you can't they're gigantic I mean you're
61:39 gonna have to do something monumental to
61:41 get them to be knocked down but honestly
61:43 they need to be knocked down someone
61:47 deposited so much money in 1981 there
61:50 for 40 years these things have been
61:51 maintained you anyone who destroys them
61:53 messes what they don't destroy them but
61:55 hurts them messes with them the town
61:57 some shills in that town and the banking
62:00 community in that town pay for under
62:04 some infinite contract the restoration
62:07 of the stones someone in that town knows
62:10 who built them and won't release who did
62:12 it and the citizens are perfectly fine
62:14 with that you realize if we found out
62:17 who built those we could start
62:19 unraveling this thing and they just sit
62:21 there like it didn't happen let's be
62:24 extra Floyd the water in that community
62:27 but 500 million in relation to our 7.5
62:31 soon to be 8 billion people is over 96%
62:35 of the world population gone off the
62:37 face of the planet
62:38 now immediately you might say well who
62:41 would do that that's a horrible thing
62:42 the coronavirus starts you know climbing
62:45 all over the country all over the world
62:47 not sure what that's gonna be the Ebola
62:51 one was largely fake and related to a
62:55 diamond industry in Uganda and all the
63:00 regions that were affected by it because
63:02 they tried to protest against the
63:04 corporation's and then this outbreak was
63:08 reported and then the outbreak was
63:09 actually I think physically given to
63:11 those workers so they all passed away
63:13 and they got a brand new loyal workers
63:15 but that's a different conversation now
63:19 like I always say if your population
63:21 limit for the world was 500 million the
63:24 likelihood that you're gonna start at
63:25 that maximum limit is very unlikely
63:28 because you don't want to immediately
63:30 start killing kids because you have one
63:31 too many so in my estimation of a safe
63:35 starting point just this is just a gut
63:38 feeling for me would be about 150
63:40 million to 200 million somewhere in
63:42 there that gives you several hundred
63:44 million to work with you know three to
63:46 35 or thirty three hundred fifty million
63:49 to to work in to me and you're gonna get
63:52 your program down so they're gonna try
63:53 to kill off that many people and if
63:55 they're gonna use a virus then it's
63:57 gonna be difficult to even stop it you
63:59 know you may even go down to ten who
64:01 knows but at one fifty you're well
64:03 within the ninety eight ninety nine
64:04 percent mortality rate depending on the
64:08 world population when this were to occur
64:10 but you can rest assure that that
64:13 monument was constructed by one of these
64:16 globalists someone in America that it's
64:19 very very loyal to the European you know
64:22 bankers that role to control everything
64:26 basically then you look at the paperwork
64:29 of agenda 21 well there's a website for
64:33 Jenna 21 it's all about sustainable
64:35 living which sounds great if everything
64:37 on their website was true - the PDFs
64:40 that you can get up we might actually
64:43 have a fairly good utopia in the world
64:45 but that's not what the real agenda is
64:47 because they lie right Liars lie you
64:51 realize
64:51 right once someone's like an Adam Schiff
64:53 they're always an Adam Schiff they lie
64:55 forever one side agenda 21 paperwork
64:59 they have this world population
65:01 reduction thing but they don't really
65:02 talk about the catalyzing event that
65:04 will enable it they simply have a map of
65:06 the United States of America where 96th
65:11 and a 9% of the population is gone just
65:15 gone man we're living in these
65:18 concentration camps called cities you're
65:22 not allowed to live in the rural areas
65:23 of the world they will come and get you
65:25 and neither heard you into these
65:29 communities or they'll kill you on the
65:30 spot and just let you rot out they don't
65:32 care your bones will beaten up by
65:36 critters insects whatever that if utley
65:39 gonna demo your house they're gonna pull
65:40 up all the roads and we'll be as if man
65:42 didn't exist on planet earth in those
65:45 areas in the cities you're gonna have
65:48 surveillance everywhere in your house in
65:51 every room you'll be unable to have a
65:53 conversation with any other human being
65:55 that isn't listened to transcribed into
65:57 your local language and then read by an
66:00 artificial intelligence that's looking
66:01 for keywords of a threatening nature to
66:04 the state if any code words are
66:06 developed to have secret conversations
66:08 they will eventually find out because
66:11 someone will report those code words in
66:14 order for a little bit of benefit and
66:15 the AI will be updated and then all the
66:19 dissenters will be cut and killed and
66:22 we're just safe again for the globalists
66:24 to run the world so climate change as
66:29 related to carbon taxation is a
66:31 mechanism for the non killer virus
66:37 formula so it's the precursor to this
66:41 kill everybody thing now it's only only
66:45 they know whether or not that's the
66:47 first plan and you know maybe maybe if
66:50 you got in one of their little meetings
66:51 they would say well that's what we're
66:52 trying to do is use carbon taxation to
66:54 get down to this
66:55 96% everybody dead thing naturally over
66:59 time maybe we're gonna put in for 100
67:01 years 200 years to get the rural
67:03 population way way down
67:05 and then we won't have to do this
67:06 extermination event but I don't think
67:10 it'll ever work because as agenda 21
67:13 remains a mystery for most people that
67:15 aren't in the EU we got Africa South
67:18 America North America China well you
67:22 know they're not showing any signs of
67:24 giving up India they don't show any
67:26 signs of being involved with this
67:27 whatsoever neither one of China or India
67:30 were involved in the Kyoto agreement
67:31 which was the first wave of this stuff
67:34 they weren't to let they weren't sunny
67:35 weren't allowed they were allowed to
67:37 sign but they didn't sign so let's say
67:40 you're still skeptical you think all
67:41 this is conspiracy okay what if Greta
67:47 Thumb Berg is actually telling the truth
67:50 which he is but let's just say she was
67:52 she's running around the modern world
67:54 saying how dare you and you took away my
67:57 childhood my kid which aisle did you
68:00 possibly have with that intellect of
68:02 yours right there was gonna be a rough
68:04 ride little girl I don't know what you
68:06 think was gonna happen to your life but
68:09 she's running around First Rule
68:10 countries trying to guilt-trip everyone
68:12 but what sense does that make
68:14 we're the first world we're the ones
68:17 that are making you know
68:18 energy-efficient washers and dryers
68:21 we're making better octane fuel that
68:23 doesn't spew out a bunch of carbon we're
68:25 making factories that have limiters on
68:27 them how much emissions they can make
68:29 even with the D regulations going on the
68:32 United States is still really clean and
68:33 really aggressive we have electric cars
68:35 now hybrid cars why are you talking to
68:38 the cream of the crop people in the
68:40 world that are actually taking this
68:42 seriously not from a global warming stay
68:44 import or climate change standpoint but
68:46 just from a from the standpoint of
68:48 trying to be ethical with the world's
68:52 health Greta
68:55 should be traveling around India and
68:57 China a thousand percent the number one
69:00 world polluters on the planet but what
69:04 is Greta saying what are all the Greta
69:06 disciples say like aoc probably the
69:10 single most ignorant human being in the
69:11 United States of America was that
69:14 occasional cortes occasional cortex is
69:17 what they call her right
69:19 they're telling you that the world's got
69:21 less than you know I mean if Cortez
69:23 cortex whatever she she says it was 25
69:28 years and it was 15 years and it was 10
69:30 years now standing 8 years every time
69:31 she opens her mouth there's less time
69:33 eventually she'll just be in some psych
69:35 ward in a in a room you know shouting
69:38 the world's already ended but they're
69:41 talking about an extinction event due to
69:44 us melting all the caps or woulda come
69:47 again one volcano erupts it's 75% of all
69:51 the emissions that they're concerned
69:53 about but we have half a dozen a year
69:55 that blow up we've got a lot of big ones
69:58 recently so that's gotta be like what
70:00 98% of what they're concerned about
70:03 we're gonna do what he gonna do the
70:06 kappa volcano from erupting right no if
70:09 this was real I mean really real one
70:14 smart people would believe it people who
70:18 are actual climatologist experts would
70:20 believe it
70:21 not just to paid off chills looking for
70:24 our grant I would believe it if it were
70:26 real but you'd have two phone calls that
70:30 would happen either from the EU or from
70:34 our president at the time to China
70:37 President Xi I can't remember who the
70:39 Prime Minister president is of India but
70:42 that guy or girl and we would have to
70:46 say okay we've identified you as the two
70:48 largest polluters in the world you're
70:51 not signed up to any revision istic
70:55 treaties to curtail your emissions so
70:59 that's a problem like you're ignoring
71:00 the whole thing well the rest of the
71:01 world is paying attention to this you're
71:03 totally ignoring it you can't breathe
71:06 the air in Shanghai can't breathe the
71:08 air in Beijing India has its own issues
71:11 in its major cities okay and we'd have
71:16 to say something that would sound like
71:19 the fault now this is crazy because this
71:21 isn't a problem I mean it's something
71:23 that should be fixed but it's not going
71:25 to end the world okay because we used to
71:27 be just as bad as them and we weren't
71:30 suffering any ice cap melting right
71:32 the Industrial Revolution of America
71:34 from the 1880s up America put a massive
71:39 amount of this stuff in the sky and we
71:40 didn't have any global melting issues
71:43 the the oceans didn't rise a single inch
71:45 you know okay but that call would sound
71:49 something like this you have one week to
71:56 shut down all your factories we're gonna
71:58 fax you or email you a list of factories
72:01 that need to be shut down which is gonna
72:04 be the overwhelming majority of your
72:06 industrial output because you've been
72:09 ignoring our caution for the end of the
72:13 world on the eighth day one day after
72:18 this phone call curse you if you have
72:23 not shut down these factories what is
72:25 going to take place is that we're going
72:28 to use an inexhaustible array of weapons
72:32 mostly from space to ionize ki9 Cannon
72:37 direct energy weapon all of your
72:40 factories to the ground they're gonna
72:43 simply not exist overnight then we're
72:48 gonna take another reading in a month to
72:51 see how that's affected the output we're
72:53 gonna go to the next level of your
72:54 output of your pollution this includes
72:59 dumping chemicals into oceans this
73:01 includes outputting toxic chemicals into
73:04 the air well go to Phase two we'll give
73:07 you a chance every single time to
73:09 mobilize your armies to mobilize your
73:11 people to shut all this stuff down
73:13 because you are threatening the very
73:14 livelihood of all humanity on earth but
73:19 because it's fake
73:20 Greta never shows up to this country's
73:22 never says anything and that's why you
73:26 know it's fake you know in history these
73:31 organizations that are like this have
73:33 had these extinction events where they
73:36 genocide they're smart people it's all
73:41 over China's history
73:44 Pol Pot who's named after political
73:49 potentials what his name is named after
73:52 they would kill you know China killed
73:55 all the landlords in the 20th century
73:59 and they killed in seconds all of the
74:02 dissenters against the government which
74:04 essentially were you're smart people
74:05 that understood what tyranny was the
74:09 numbers you know are estimated around 40
74:11 million people in China murdered to make
74:14 sure that the bell curve of intelligence
74:17 flattened out the tyranny was a very
74:20 easy thing to maintain all in the name
74:23 of like some spiritual unity or
74:27 something right
74:28 Pol Pot killed people with glasses
74:30 because he thought people with glasses
74:32 were smarter Wow is that really true
74:36 people with glasses are smarter how
74:39 asinine does that sound right so let's
74:43 take that into account because that's
74:44 happened several times in history and of
74:46 course every dictator gets rid of guns
74:47 first and then they become dictators
74:49 what are you Democrats want to do in
74:51 America they want to get rid of guns
74:53 because it's the precursor to globalism
74:55 slash a dictatorship now they're not
74:58 looking necessarily for a dictator rise
75:00 up in America they just want the global
75:01 agencies of the European Union to
75:04 control America which is why Obama in
75:06 October of what 2016 gave away all the
75:10 Internet control to an foreign agency
75:13 called ICANN they were trying to give
75:16 our Health Regiment over to the World
75:18 Health Organization so Europe would tell
75:19 Americans what vaccinations we had to
75:22 have agenda 21 agenda 21 s main weapon
75:28 is to rule countries by bureaucracy that
75:32 is not elected so we in America were
75:35 real arrogant and stupid and we think oh
75:37 you know we'll just elect officials to
75:39 control all this stuff and long as we
75:41 elect people that believe what we
75:43 believe it will happen okay I don't
75:47 remember any leader besides like Obama
75:49 they wanted carbon credits to become a
75:52 reality
75:53 yet even with Trump in his third year
75:56 I'm getting notices in my email about my
75:59 carbon credits of course I have a ton
76:01 because I single and I don't consume
76:04 much energy but what if I was 25 really
76:08 successful
76:09 maybe average successful don't have a
76:11 big you know bank full of cash and I
76:14 want to have three kids I would struggle
76:18 to afford it if my wife was
76:20 indoctrinated with a million reasons to
76:22 divorce me because if anything happens
76:24 you know it's bad you should go to a
76:26 divorce well then she's making it
76:27 difficult for both of us because she's
76:28 drinking the kool-aid or vice versa if I
76:30 drink the kool-aid so whether
76:32 manipulation is one of the single most
76:35 volatile weapons in humanity right now
76:38 and it's not necessarily kill people
76:40 with storms is to control this globalist
76:44 movement called climate change I have an
76:47 episode on global warming if you want to
76:49 know the facts behind why it's a big
76:50 farce go watch that episode
76:52 it'll be very enlightening and it'll be
76:56 a lot of duplicate information here but
76:58 again the fact that I have to listen to
77:01 this crap come out of people's mouths
77:03 means that I haven't made enough
77:04 episodes about the subject matter which
77:07 is why I'm willing to duplicate my own
77:09 stuff there's a young guy he's from New
77:13 Zealand he's starting to become really
77:15 popular he travels the world he gets a
77:20 sponsorship from a few folks is it the
77:23 kindest person on planet earth he
77:27 travels in all these real volatile
77:28 countries he's been in North Korea he's
77:30 been to Kenya he's been to Iran Iraq and
77:35 he really reveals the truth of how these
77:38 people believe their country should run
77:41 how the world should run whether tyranny
77:43 should be a part of the game and he
77:45 reveals that there are a lot of areas
77:49 that are demonized by the West that are
77:50 actually people like a run especially
77:52 Iranians you know were like I've said it
77:55 an episode that probably as an aired yet
77:56 but they're really wonderful people I
77:59 mean they he didn't have to travel with
78:01 any bodyguards he didn't have to worry
78:03 about anything but he went to Kenya and
78:06 Somalia I think it was Somalia was the
78:10 worst
78:10 and again people are super friendly
78:13 super nice they want to find out where
78:14 he's from us he is from New Zealand so I
78:16 don't know what his experience would
78:18 have been like Eddie said he's from
78:19 America since America has Somalian
78:21 problems we have definitely Iranian
78:23 problems but maybe because New Zealand
78:25 he gets a little bit of a break
78:26 hopefully but what he's in Somalia it
78:29 was illegal for him to move around the
78:31 country without an armed bodyguard they
78:33 had to pay for he had to pay for the the
78:35 gentleman's travel he had to pay for his
78:37 time and it's like 20 bucks for the day
78:41 and then he had to buy the point you
78:43 know the bus ticket or whatever which is
78:45 a few dollars lodging was really
78:48 expensive as a matter of fact his
78:49 lodging was like 35 bucks at night at
78:51 these you know it's really nice hotels
78:54 in fact he's always able to find really
78:56 nice hotels in these locations it's
78:58 really phenomenal but to illustrate the
79:01 difference between the world of the
79:03 first world in the third world and how
79:05 people in the first world can't
79:07 perceived agenda 21 implemented you have
79:10 a situation where he was driven by uber
79:14 to his hotel it was so volatile there
79:19 and these people treating him like gold
79:21 there's their very positive no one's
79:23 looking over their shoulder necessarily
79:25 but they said we're gonna pull this car
79:26 right up to the door of the hotel and
79:30 what you need to do is get your [ __ ]
79:32 ready before I stop the car before I
79:35 stop the car this is the door opens
79:37 there's gonna be a concierge in there
79:39 with a gun with a ak-47 pistol grip and
79:42 you need to haul your ass into that
79:45 hotel just run inside when you're inside
79:48 soon as you're out of view from the
79:50 windows you're safe and he was shocked
79:52 that it was like that but he got a
79:56 first-hand example of what it's like to
79:58 live in these worlds now a first full
80:01 person can't conceive of that can they
80:04 now China has started the Social Credit
80:06 system right well people are starting to
80:09 realize that they're not as free as they
80:12 were under communist rule prior to the
80:14 Social Credit System Social Credit
80:16 system is basically obedience to the
80:19 country and its agendas regardless if
80:22 they're going to benefit you or spite
80:24 you is how you get your sulfur credit
80:28 you must go along with what the
80:30 government says otherwise all your
80:32 privileges are removed
80:34 there's a gentleman already in a sort of
80:38 house arrest situation because he's a
80:40 journalist that has been criticizing
80:42 government officials who were caught
80:44 taking bribes from foreign countries to
80:47 do things in the country which is the
80:49 way China rolls all right you can travel
80:54 out of his apartment down the elevator
80:56 out front there's a plaza there with
80:58 restaurants and food supply places he
81:00 can do for all his amenities everything
81:02 else has to be shipped to him he's
81:04 denied train travel he can't take a cab
81:07 he's an unable to leave well legally his
81:11 area this is already occurred the
81:14 Muslims that are way out in the West
81:17 Western border of China a ton of them
81:20 disappear they're in these concentration
81:23 camps they'll be here you know North
81:25 Korea had and they're denied immediately
81:28 full credit they're automatically born
81:32 into because of bigotry and racism
81:34 they're born into a status that is 50%
81:37 are below but everyone else gets as a
81:39 Chinese person there are these weird
81:42 resort towns or the main town that they
81:45 used to live in has been bombed out of
81:46 existence and it's there in remnants and
81:49 then they have this new sort of Disney
81:51 only in place where these people have to
81:52 work as entertainers it's all like being
81:56 in North Korea where all those you know
81:58 the shafts are fully stocked but no
82:00 one's working there except they have to
82:02 work and they have to entertain can you
82:05 imagine that your job is to go to
82:08 Disneyland this doesn't exist here but
82:11 you have to go there and work as a cast
82:13 member put on an outfit that you don't
82:15 normally wear and imagine I'll tell you
82:19 a funny story when my German exchange
82:21 student girlfriend came over in the late
82:23 80s 89 August of 89 her parents told her
82:27 that we had cowboys and Indians that we
82:31 have stagecoaches that we were sidearms
82:35 she came to California okay
82:37 but they told her all about this they
82:39 even gave her a book and she gave it to
82:41 me read it to each other one night it
82:42 was a little most laughable thing they'd
82:44 also had a whole chapter on how to use
82:45 the f-word properly this is a weirdest
82:48 book I've ever seen in my life but
82:52 imagine now you're taking over by a
82:54 population that's not indigenous to your
82:56 area and they have the Social Credit
82:57 System and you have this globalist
82:59 control over you and now as an American
83:02 me I have to put face makeup on me back
83:09 because I have long had to play the
83:10 Native American and I'm in this
83:11 amusement park and I have to play a
83:13 Native American or I have to play a
83:15 Viking I have to wear a Viking clothes
83:17 for him like you know the 1500s or even
83:20 before because that's how they perceived
83:22 me and if I don't do it I don't get any
83:25 credits whatsoever I can't do anything
83:26 they buy end up in jail maybe I end up
83:28 in a concentration camp for real sounds
83:32 silly but no first world kid with their
83:36 iPhone the latte and their little tiny
83:38 you know Apple laptop has a clue of what
83:41 it's like to lose all these privileges
83:43 but there's an infinite amount of places
83:45 on this surface of this earth where they
83:47 don't have any privileges you know
83:51 Brazil Venezuela they're there in full
83:56 chaos and the people there are all
83:58 indigenous but they're eating each other
84:00 alive because of the the economic system
84:04 has failed them Chavez said he's gonna
84:07 give way old Fox a barrel for 200 years
84:10 poof that country's gone Brazilian
84:13 president said I'm gonna drill that
84:14 second largest oil reserve in the world
84:17 it's off our coast and make Brazil the
84:20 country of the future he was coot out of
84:24 existence in an IMF International
84:26 Monetary Fund executive came in / World
84:28 Bank proxy took over the country
84:30 destroyed it and then she was kicked out
84:33 and it's just been in complete chaos
84:34 ever since ever since right kids are
84:37 killing kids in these two regions of the
84:40 world
84:41 okay now
84:45 well the agenda21 concentration camps
84:47 have those issues probably not but then
84:50 again it would be one of their goals is
84:52 to bring all first world countries down
84:54 to third country status that's in their
84:55 documentation well that just means you
84:58 have to use the state to get everything
85:00 that you need you want some food you
85:02 better be good to the state because the
85:03 state provides you your food you want
85:04 clothing you want a job you want
85:06 anything you don't want to get killed
85:07 you don't get tortured you want your
85:09 kids to experience better life better
85:11 you better obey but even if the
85:13 tippy-top of the agenda21
85:14 plans you're basically a glorified their
85:18 third world citizen enjoy that right so
85:23 when you think about what you can do to
85:26 help the world I would say that the
85:28 first thing you should do is go watch
85:32 every single one of Rosa Corey's videos
85:34 just what let her tell you what's going
85:37 on and they'll take you a while take you
85:39 a few days there are hours and hours
85:41 long but you need to watch everything
85:43 even though she repeats herself because
85:45 she's teaching different areas of the
85:46 United States and Europe about this
85:48 agenda you need to hear it so well that
85:52 there's so many times that you can
85:53 repeat it in a conversation then of
85:55 course you need to do your own research
85:57 you see these depopulation maps then you
86:01 need to research the Georgia Guidestones
86:03 then you need to see a movie like the
86:05 great global warming swindle one of the
86:09 things that I think is funny and this
86:11 was we brought this out on my previous
86:12 show in Kyoto video was that in the
86:16 climate change [ __ ] global warming
86:19 [ __ ] the Sun is never allowed to be
86:22 a part of the equation of why we're hot
86:24 it's hilarious it's not part of anything
86:27 it's all because of co2 that's the only
86:29 thing the only reason why we're warm so
86:32 the Sun has cycles and the Sun cycles
86:35 are based on its electoral electronic
86:38 electrical interior which is a plasma
86:41 energy the same thing on planet Earth
86:43 same thing on the moon
86:44 same thing for everybody in space
86:46 galaxies are completely electrical it's
86:48 all based on a thorough technology I've
86:49 got tons episodes on it but the Sun will
86:52 develop these sunspots
86:55 and these sunspots increase when they
87:00 occur it you're seeing a hole into the
87:02 center of the Sun which is black now we
87:05 don't see that when we look at the Sun
87:06 because of all the diffusion of light
87:07 that comes around the hole right when we
87:10 put a big filter on a telescope and look
87:11 at the Sun surface we can see them
87:14 there's moments in the sun's lifespan
87:18 and any one particular year were a whole
87:20 chasm of the Sun surface is black
87:23 because it's not emitting anything it's
87:26 just you're looking into its black core
87:29 but when this occurs the the reason why
87:34 a sunspot occurs is that the orbital
87:37 mass that's on the outside surface of
87:39 the Sun will do a little because it's
87:42 thick you know it's got a thickness do
87:43 it which is miles and miles thick it'll
87:46 create a little vortex it's just like
87:49 anything in water when you're looking at
87:51 water and a stream when it hits a rock
87:53 it starts spinning when hits a pylon of
87:56 a bridge it starts spinning those little
87:58 vortexes when it opens up this hole it
88:02 creates coronal mass ejections
88:03 CME's it goes down hits the plasma core
88:07 bounces off as the plasma core is super
88:09 SuperDuper powerful and bounces it back
88:12 out into space I think that I think the
88:15 number I've heard recently is 97 percent
88:18 of every CME the mass that comes out of
88:21 the Sun's spewing comes back to the Sun
88:24 because it's so intensely
88:25 gravitationally heavy but that leaves 3%
88:30 to go spewing into the solar system now
88:33 we have the Van Allen belts to protect
88:35 us which is why again no surface of the
88:37 earth has ever been charred black you
88:39 know these things don't just hit us a
88:40 hundred percent plus it's diffusing in
88:43 it's big journey to us but when the Sun
88:47 has sunspots we get really hot and in
88:50 1993 we had three to five sunspots at
88:54 any point in a year that's why I need
88:56 the beach barely had a winner and so the
89:00 summer had three weeks where I don't
89:03 know three or four days of the week it
89:04 was over 100 degrees
89:06 now I've been in Huntington Beach for 17
89:08 years folks that was my first year in
89:11 Huntington Beach next summer was not as
89:14 hot now the summer was really short it
89:18 had a lot of cold days and I don't
89:20 remember a single day going over a
89:22 hundred degrees not a single day in 2019
89:25 did it go over a hundred degrees because
89:27 I do these shows at night I'm always
89:29 looking at the temperature and saying
89:31 okay it's 58 it's 52 it's 46 you know
89:35 I've done I've done episodes I believe
89:38 this last season here in the wintertime
89:41 was 38 degrees up 2013 I couldn't have
89:45 pulled that off because those days
89:47 didn't exist so we neglect the number
89:51 one contributor to our cycle which is
89:54 the Sun it's up in the sky chemtrails
89:57 are extremely real David again admitted
90:00 to several times in public last one is
90:04 the former head of the CIA before Trump
90:06 got up a friend to CFR and basically
90:09 told everyone it's usually under some
90:13 guise of like high-altitude aerosol
90:16 program something like that they don't
90:17 call them chemtrails of course they
90:18 don't call them it those things been
90:20 around for mmm 27 years in a really
90:24 massive campaign I have photographs and
90:27 I guess I'll show you two for this
90:30 episode if you're on YouTube well they
90:32 used to spray my neighborhood in a
90:34 methodology in 2008 that they don't use
90:36 anymore which is extremely obvious
90:39 attentional spring now they spray in a
90:42 much more organic methodology but all
90:45 comes out of a single point just
90:48 northeast of my where I live and so
90:50 you'll see all the trails are fanning
90:52 out from this one launch point they also
90:55 blow it out of San Diego so are in the
90:56 coast when you sell these lines over the
90:59 ocean then come inland and land on us
91:02 it's from San Diego I have taken a
91:05 picture of a plane spraying a trail and
91:07 then again it's supposed to be you know
91:09 anomaly of the sky or whatever fuel
91:12 additives or whatever and then I filmed
91:15 another one coming up with again the the
91:17 crest on the back of the plane was
91:19 unidentifiable and
91:20 took a picture of it and took it inside
91:22 a database of nerds attract all this
91:24 kind of stuff couldn't find the brand of
91:25 that plane so what are the tar the
91:27 chances that a plane's launching out of
91:29 San Diego that doesn't have anything
91:31 that matches global companies and their
91:34 big big planes not a little private
91:36 planes right but while I was taking the
91:38 picture of the second plane coming up I
91:40 saw the third or the first plane coming
91:41 back the other way no trail okay well if
91:45 it's an anomaly of the sky then no
91:47 matter where you fly you're gonna be
91:48 creating these things not the case now
91:50 as I'm sitting here today we have real
91:54 clouds and real clouds are noticeable
91:56 because they're gray but they're also in
91:58 the shape of clouds right clouds are
92:01 made of vapor vapor absorbs light thus
92:05 clouds are great to some extent in
92:10 between the clouds since I've been
92:11 filming I've seen planes leaving
92:14 contrails little tiny one and a half
92:18 second trails behind the plane it
92:20 follows the plane its entire journey
92:21 because there's are ice crystals that
92:23 are coming out of the back condensing
92:24 from all the moisture out of the plane
92:26 and it's melting off within a second to
92:29 half yep today is control free okay
92:34 little tiny bit warmer today
92:35 that's probably what 68 degrees today
92:37 are about 70 when I started the episode
92:40 all right it makes no sense and when you
92:43 get your camera out and you start taking
92:45 pictures of these things you take
92:47 pictures of them for a couple years then
92:50 the patterns all start making sense you
92:53 talk to pilots like good honest pilots
92:56 right we've had named Cale to radio we
92:59 had two commercial pilots that we
93:00 interviewed not on the show but as a
93:02 result of like doing research on this
93:04 stuff to see if we were going crazy or
93:05 not and then two commercial pilots and
93:07 then one private pilot and one of the
93:09 commercial pilots was an alternate
93:11 private pilot on the side everybody said
93:15 the same thing without meeting each
93:17 other it's not us and they're real can't
93:19 report them cuz it's worse than talking
93:21 about UFOs
93:22 you get fired you get banned from flying
93:24 bad news it's very very real am i happy
93:29 this is real hell no right no conspiracy
93:32 theorists with any sanity in their mind
93:34 is ever happy to report a conspiracy
93:38 ever we're not happy that well that JFK
93:42 was ever murdered to begin with we're
93:43 not happy about not going to the moon
93:45 we're not happy about agenda 21 or the
93:48 Georgia Guidestones or any kind of stuff
93:49 what's funny about the Georgia
93:51 Guidestones this is right in your face
93:53 and every time I bring it out in a
93:55 conversation with one of my liberal
93:56 friends and I show it to them they
93:59 really are speechless because in their
94:02 brain this kind of thing can occur in
94:06 their brain everything is a bullet Ares
94:09 and we're just as the as the
94:12 constitutionalist as the republic as the
94:15 maybe slightly right-wing folks were all
94:18 crazy and suppose that we're fighting
94:20 them with falsehoods we're fighting them
94:23 with lies because we just want to win
94:24 and the reason why I Democrat thinks
94:26 like that is a Democrat will will use
94:29 any lie to win look at the impeachment
94:33 trial for Trump I don't care if you
94:35 don't like him or not you would never
94:36 want to be in a trial where dancy Pelosi
94:39 is taking care of your justice because
94:41 you'll now have you will have zero
94:43 representation but we know discovery
94:45 meaning facts that are ever gathered in
94:47 your benefit you'll never know what the
94:49 other side knows you won't get a speedy
94:50 trial they'll try to drag it out forever
94:52 all these things are in our Constitution
94:55 of the United States and they're illegal
94:57 to do you're protected from all that and
95:02 it's because it happened in Europe a few
95:06 hundred years ago again it happened in
95:10 Europe a few hundred years ago and it
95:12 happened for thousands of years before
95:14 that the world lived in tyranny for more
95:19 time that is lived in freedom you know
95:23 after we maybe draw a line in the sand
95:25 say after this point man is civilized
95:26 quote/unquote right so for the kids to
95:30 say there's no way to be in a tyrannical
95:32 world is to basically know nothing about
95:34 history or you ask a white kid in
95:38 America
95:40 who only wants to acknowledge the last
95:42 400 years and say okay now go talk to a
95:45 black kid and asked him about his
95:46 great-great grandmother or
95:47 great-great-grandfather what they were
95:49 doing just 150 years ago 200 years ago
95:52 when the Democrats were lynching them on
95:54 trees to the KKK and denying them the
95:57 abolishment of slavery during the Civil
95:58 War I mean the votes the votes in the
96:02 hill not just you know some rumor that
96:06 someone didn't like black people no they
96:07 voted against it three times there's a
96:12 war going on for your world Europe
96:15 I don't know France Paris those
96:18 protestors they're your only hope man
96:21 they're your only hope and if that
96:25 community doesn't grow and if the agenda
96:29 doesn't spread out beyond just getting
96:31 paid a better stipend every month every
96:33 month or whatever their agenda is it's
96:35 got to go all the way up to agenda 21
96:38 because if you don't stop agenda 21
96:40 it'll give you a little concession at
96:42 the bottom okay okay we only give you
96:43 $1,200 a month in your and your monthly
96:47 stipend from the government and now
96:49 we'll give you 18 mm and then you shut
96:52 up but agenda 121 keeps going then you
96:56 still lost the race men so I want to see
96:59 these agendas proliferate especially
97:01 Europe but they definitely proliferate
97:03 America you know we've got guns and
97:05 we've got a constitution and we've got a
97:06 methodology of living that we're used to
97:08 we're not subjugated by kings and queens
97:12 we don't have them here but we have kind
97:14 of the equivalent bankers and you know
97:17 corporate owners we got the Koch
97:18 brothers then got one of them's gone
97:20 already but we also allow people like
97:22 George Soros this enemy of the world to
97:26 finance all kinds of movements in this
97:28 country which are pure espionage or a
97:31 pure treason of this country the dudes
97:33 allowed to own as a foreign citizen up
97:37 to forty five percent of one of our
97:38 voting machine companies the tally who
97:42 won elections local and globe
97:45 local and national I should say mmm-hmm
97:50 we have a big thing to clean up here
97:52 folks
97:53 and yeah you know what you can't phone
97:54 it in really sorry it's not gonna be
97:57 some pleasant thing but if you want to
97:59 stay out of the blood and gore to quote
98:01 the company name then you need to start
98:04 talking and thinking and researching and
98:07 hey if someone could prove to me that
98:10 everything I've ever said on this show
98:12 this conspiratorial one by one was not
98:15 the case
98:15 amen you'd make me so happy but it gets
98:19 to the point where it's sort like a
98:21 religious conversation you know Rach I
98:23 said in my Jesus Christ episode someone
98:25 coming up to B and saying well no Jesus
98:27 real cuz the Bible says well you're
98:29 using your own kool-aid to try and give
98:31 me kool-aid it's like that doesn't work
98:33 don't try to use information provided to
98:37 you by the enemy to tell you the enemy's
98:38 not your enemy anyway I think you feel
98:43 me
98:44 whether manipulation is a thousand
98:47 percent real it's a thousand five
98:49 thousand percent right whatever is
98:50 absolutely deniable percentage-wise
98:53 that's what it is and you can just look
98:55 it up if you have the courage to do it
98:57 the next thing is for you to understand
99:00 that people think more evil than you do
99:01 at the very tippy top because they feel
99:03 like they're gonna lose control that's
99:06 probably the case let's make it happen
99:09 for them let's make the loss of control
99:12 their worst nightmare come true and then
99:17 we'll all decide what to do with them
99:18 after that if you have been to deep
99:21 thoughts radio Calm please go that's
99:22 where everything is there's two video
99:24 YouTube bits you please make a [ __ ]
99:26 shoot account
99:27 there's podcasting for any device you
99:29 have remember if you use iTunes you
99:31 won't be able to go back to season one
99:32 because they limit the amount of
99:33 episodes you can playback we have three
99:36 social media locked Facebook group a
99:37 Twitter page and mine's calm mine's calm
99:40 is a copy of Facebook but its first
99:42 remem protected say she couldn't account
99:44 there no matter what happens we have two
99:46 ways to donate to the page PayPal which
99:49 is a one-time thing patreon is a monthly
99:51 thing patreon people get the episodes
99:52 but for everyone else and a 20% discount
99:54 on the store there's two products IOI's
99:57 pitch one is sort of anti tyranny
99:59 product which is the brief browser it is
100:00 based on a chrome engine but they cut
100:02 off all the listeners so that Google
100:04 doesn't get any data from them
100:06 they cut out all the trackers all this
100:08 stuff removed the Google search engine
100:10 but DuckDuckGo in there I know it's a
100:12 weird name but it's a great search
100:13 engine
100:14 the initial thing you'll notice if you
100:16 search on deep thoughts video episodes
100:17 is you won't find them in Google but
100:19 you'll find them in DuckDuckGo and
100:20 direct links to the videos when you get
100:23 the results it's a beautiful thing
100:24 the other one is Backblaze which is just
100:26 a great cloud backup software you know
100:30 as we deal with the fact that you might
100:32 have information on your computer that
100:33 is considered contraband which all we
100:35 will call truth on this show having it
100:37 in a cloud is a pretty good deal and
100:39 make no money from brief no money from
100:41 Backblaze I do have it under the
100:43 donation section that's nowhere else to
100:44 put it it was the goal to get an
100:46 affiliate program but their affiliate
100:48 programs are all [ __ ] we do have

101:20 those episodes are strictly to get your
101:22 life under control get you back on your
101:24 feet
101:25 deal with taboos that no one ever talks
101:27 about because they want to keep their
101:29 taboos in their life but other than that
101:32 that's all I've got free today
