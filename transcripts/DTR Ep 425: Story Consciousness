00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen it's the first cold night in
00:36 many many months I've got something on
00:40 my mind I want to just go through it
00:43 almost for my own sake I spent the day
00:46 and an amazing meeting working on a new
00:49 script but this time I'm getting to
00:51 collaborate with a great production team
00:53 who had the concept in the first place
00:56 and it's probably without me without
01:01 comparison the most educated folks have
01:04 worked with on a film and on writing a
01:07 new concept and the subject came up and
01:11 I forgot there was a there's a teacher
01:16 cited about this there's a whole thing
01:18 out there about this someone to give you
01:20 my impression of this and even if you're
01:22 not a interesting you know interested in
01:26 writing you've never written before you
01:28 have no intent in writing I think what's
01:32 going to happen in this episode is I'm
01:35 gonna get your mind to reminisce and if
01:39 you're older and you're trying to ever
01:41 in your life explain your past this
01:48 episode will come in extremely handy for
01:50 you to be able to articulate sort of why
01:55 things are different today and why you
01:57 really can't put the Lightning back in
02:01 the bottle to give your kids an
02:04 impression of what it would be like to
02:06 be in your childhood and this is
02:09 something as a screenwriter you're
02:10 you're really attempting to do it most
02:14 most cases if you're not doing it you
02:16 should try to do it because it is the
02:17 difference between succeeding and
02:19 failing in my opinion and I should
02:22 probably preface that by if you're going
02:25 to write a period piece that is in the
02:29 past that I would say near pass being
02:31 your lifetime so if you're 50 years old
02:35 you got fifty years of life to to really
02:37 talk about maybe -
02:38 seven to ten for you waking up to what
02:41 is actually going on but I think you can
02:43 pretty much start nailing it the second
02:46 you start remembering days within a
02:48 particular year because for me
02:49 personally I remember very specific days
02:54 God before I could even talk but just a
02:57 day you know and then it was two or
03:01 three days and then it was a few
03:03 different experiences but around seven
03:04 years old I don't know what happened to
03:05 my mind some little neurons connected
03:07 this is for me and I'm sure you have a
03:09 different timetable where I just
03:11 remember everything like the same amount
03:14 that I remember about last year is the
03:16 same amount I remembered about being
03:17 seven what was interesting and I
03:20 remembered and what wasn't I whatever
03:23 was repetition but the way that they're
03:25 talking about it today is sort of a
03:27 screenwriting slash story consciousness
03:31 this applies to anything that you're
03:33 doing if you're a playwright if you're
03:35 novelist this applies to you
03:38 and the very first time this was ever
03:41 brought up to me it was today was the
03:43 very first day it was actually described
03:45 as consciousness and I think that's a
03:48 great word and I apparently there's a
03:49 teacher out there that teaches
03:51 consciousness and writing but I asked my
03:58 writing mentor slash guru teacher who
04:02 has sold over 20 scripts in his lifetime
04:06 and he's directed a very legendary film
04:09 back in the day I always kind of keep
04:12 his name out of this case he doesn't
04:13 want to be mention he's very private
04:14 person but he grew up in the 60s as a
04:20 you know college graduate and
04:22 what-have-you and so he finished his
04:23 high school years in the 60s and then he
04:26 got through college and then he
04:27 immediately jumped into the business of
04:30 telling story in one way or another
04:33 totally self-made guy which is awesome
04:36 but he was painting the story for me at
04:41 lunch one day and I said you know why
04:44 don't you write that script just write
04:45 anything back in that era because you're
04:47 an amazing storyteller and you have
04:52 ample material why don't you just write
04:54 that script just figure out anything I
04:56 mean how many you know Norman Rockwell
04:58 kind of movies do we have that reached
05:02 back in the past from today there's a
05:05 ton of them sometimes they're historical
05:08 but he told me he said you know you
05:10 can't you can't do it and I said why
05:14 can't you do it
05:15 he said because and he didn't say
05:17 consciousness but this is really what he
05:19 was talking about he says everything
05:22 that made people feel and think a
05:25 particular way made all of the events of
05:28 that era mean a particular thing to them
05:30 and because society has evolved 5060
05:34 years away from that time period you
05:37 will never understand what that feels
05:40 like today because you have all kind you
05:44 have terrorism and gangster [ __ ] and
05:46 you've got all this modern thinking and
05:50 I like to write in period myself my very
05:54 first film ever wrote was set in 79 the
05:59 one of my next film was like 2500 BC my
06:04 next film was inside a computer and the
06:05 next film was 1985
06:07 now I lived in 79 and I remember it I
06:09 lived in 85 so I remember it and I tried
06:14 to instill this consciousness into my
06:18 story but honestly the achieving this is
06:23 on purely paper with words is probably
06:29 one of the most impossible things you
06:32 can attempt to do I think you can do it
06:34 to a certain extent and you're gonna
06:35 need to talk to your director and he's
06:38 gonna have he or she's gonna have to get
06:39 what you're trying to do stranger things
06:41 did this probably stranger things is
06:46 interesting when I was a kid they
06:47 released the movie Grease and it was
06:50 it's a musical so it's not really trying
06:52 to be that serious and stranger things
06:53 is definitely a character to a degree of
06:56 reality but stranger things for me is
07:00 the furthest back I've seen someone
07:03 accurately cash
07:05 gigantic portions of what it was like to
07:08 live in that era and what they did was
07:10 they sort of pulled out the very best of
07:13 different places in the United States
07:14 and pushed them all in one story so you
07:17 may not have a really bangin mall like
07:19 the one in season three in the area
07:22 where these kids live maybe you do maybe
07:23 you don't
07:24 I don't know maybe a more metropolitan
07:26 area has the Sherman Oaks Mall that Fast
07:28 Times at Ridgemont High was filmed in
07:30 now it's great just as a point of
07:33 reference we all know this films that
07:35 are made in those decades like Fast
07:38 Times at Ridgemont High which again is a
07:39 caricature in large part of certain
07:42 aspects of the way it was like to live
07:44 in those areas but I I have to say it's
07:47 probably more accurate than less
07:49 accurate a more accurate than character
07:51 I would almost put Fast Times there's my
07:54 high ID he grew up in California so it's
07:56 the only reason why I don't quite know
07:58 the exact percentage but I would say
08:00 it's probably 75 85 percent correct but
08:03 it's because it was filmed in those
08:05 areas when you look at the clothing well
08:07 that's what kids were wearing in
08:08 Southern California Los Angeles
08:11 Thousand Oaks area ericeira Sherman Oaks
08:13 area I moved here you know in 87 so I
08:18 know what California was like from 87 to
08:20 90 and I will tell you the consciousness
08:22 of this place took a really bad turn the
08:27 just as a point of reference before I
08:29 jump into this real deep I think that
08:32 the world we live in today is so utterly
08:35 raw it is this era that we live in is
08:41 full of pain and it's not an old country
08:44 you know no country for old men thing
08:46 the kids today live in pain that is why
08:49 everyone is so angry someone is there so
08:52 easily venting hate towards anything
08:54 that they believe in boy they just life
08:57 isn't the way it should be in hate hate
08:59 hate hate hate hate hate even for life
09:01 that is good for people they still find
09:05 the hate arc it's really easy you might
09:07 hate the haters you know I mean it's
09:08 just it's an incestual horrible thing no
09:12 I'm gonna come at this from an American
09:14 perspective that's all I can give you
09:17 America has definitely been through some
09:19 hard times now whether or not Americans
09:22 choose to harvest hate and dislike and
09:26 anger towards their hard times depends
09:29 on the standards and the morals and the
09:31 expectations of humanity so let's just
09:35 say you're late 1800s where children
09:37 were being sent off to factories parents
09:40 would sell their kids to like factories
09:43 and they'd just get on a train and
09:44 disappear forever
09:45 so all those child labor laws came from
09:48 but take Deadwood South Dakota if you
09:52 get the DVD series of the fictional show
09:55 on HBO based on true characters in large
09:57 part you hear about the history and it
10:00 was a it was a tough world and people
10:02 just accepted it this is what we have to
10:04 do they knew no other world so they
10:07 didn't see how things were better now
10:08 they're worse it just you were born into
10:10 this you're in the Midwest plains of
10:13 America in this Sioux Nation sort of I
10:18 know what you call it a valley where
10:21 there's a lot of gold the Louisiana
10:24 Purchase hadn't finished up yet so they
10:26 were there sort of well maybe it had
10:28 finished up but it was they were outside
10:30 the jurisdiction of the United States
10:32 because Sioux Nation so they were able
10:34 to have their own law and of course as
10:37 soon as the government finds out that
10:38 there's gold they're gonna start pushing
10:40 in for that reason and eventually you
10:42 know the whole places join the rest of
10:45 the the Union right so the thing you
10:48 can't do with a film or a story or your
10:54 kids you can't regress them back to your
10:59 innocence and so when you say things are
11:03 funny or things are interesting they may
11:06 not get it at all and when you go back
11:10 and see like one of the easiest ways to
11:12 see this is to look at television
11:15 sitcoms from any one of the decades in
11:19 the past and see what really motivated a
11:22 population to make a particular show the
11:25 funniest show on TV go watch any and it
11:28 really in my opinion
11:31 I mainly grew up in this decade as a
11:33 child but I watched all the reruns from
11:35 the 60s reruns from the 50s
11:37 even the 40s with like Georgia Gracie
11:41 they actually were more sophisticated in
11:43 the past then things got really dumbed
11:46 down in the 70s but you go watch all the
11:50 shows from the 70s in early mid 80s or
11:52 what have you and there's this endearing
11:55 innocence to the humor it's not really
11:58 funny for us anymore go watch Mork &
12:00 Mindy for God's sakes and tell me
12:01 anything really makes you laugh but you
12:04 have to know that when that show came
12:07 out we were in stitches at home at a
12:11 level that was astonishing I mean I
12:14 remember I remember watching work and
12:17 Mindy with my mother my father different
12:19 times and we would just be laughing so
12:23 we look around the room like this is
12:25 really super mega funny I'm a child so
12:28 you might think out well you're just a
12:29 little kid
12:30 him going nananana and all that stuff
12:32 may have been just something that a
12:34 child would appreciate and the truth of
12:37 the matter was my mom was crying tears
12:39 of laughter my dad thought it was funny
12:41 and my dad will love Star Trek and that
12:44 kind of stuff Steve Steve Martin and it
12:49 was a Steve Martin I always mention
12:51 these guys George Carlin Richard Pryor
12:54 are three of the funniest guys in the
12:58 world in the 1970s Steve Martin was able
13:03 to charge incredible amounts of money
13:04 for his performances same with the other
13:08 two guys and the reason why is that
13:11 their jokes were considered the funniest
13:13 jokes ever at the time for the the
13:18 innocence now what's crazy about is you
13:19 might like when I think back about the
13:21 Vietnam War you know technically I'm
13:24 alive for I guess four and a half years
13:26 five and a half years of that Wars
13:28 existence I don't remember any of it at
13:30 all I don't remember anyone mistreating
13:32 soldiers I don't remember any that it
13:34 happened so we just had the giant
13:38 portion of the middle class not nowhere
13:41 near a majority like it's a
13:44 it may even be a single percentile
13:46 rating of people that went to Vietnam
13:48 and came back and they rien integrated
13:52 with their families and my my dad being
13:55 in the military definitely had people
13:57 around us who went there did gnarly
14:00 gnarly stuff man but they're still able
14:03 to laugh at all the stuff on TV plus all
14:07 that stuff was on television all this
14:09 horrible suffering of Vietnam was on TV
14:11 it was one of the first movies or sorry
14:13 first Wars excuse me maybe it isn't
14:15 movie
14:15 one of the first wars were they
14:17 integrated you know live footage from
14:20 the battlefield
14:21 right on you know the nightly news it
14:23 was the thing that sold ad advertising
14:25 right so even sitting at home not going
14:29 to war people were extremely aware of it
14:32 look at the hippie movement protesting
14:34 war and maybe they're too drugged out to
14:37 really understand the massacres of about
14:38 I tell you what if you're sitting there
14:40 on an acid trip thinking about a Vietnam
14:45 War and especially seeing these groups
14:46 and things on TV I remember seeing you
14:49 know guerrilla warfare and South America
14:51 being broadcast on the TV and I thought
14:53 they were guerrillas thought that they
14:55 were Pete you know big you know what is
14:57 in phibian know enough it means a
14:59 primates right I saw a bedsheet with
15:02 blood on it on the TV and I thought oh
15:05 my gosh a kind of big gorilla problem
15:06 dance I thought I was I was afraid of
15:08 gorillas so we were seeing all that but
15:13 we still had goofy wonderful bright
15:16 souls that were there were creating you
15:19 know aren't be rap music we had you know
15:24 was heavy metal it wasn't really in
15:26 existence we had rock and roll but the
15:29 songs were like about you know cat
15:33 scratch fever and you know you get the
15:35 drug trip down Dark Side of the Moon
15:37 coming around you have just yeah Black
15:41 Sabbath bringing in some pretty intense
15:43 you know grooves and lyrics but we had
15:49 disco my gut go watch just just got on
15:53 YouTube and watch Soul Train and you
15:55 will get an idea of how
15:58 innocent we were as a people that'll
16:02 never be put back in a bottle unless we
16:04 can fix society in such a way that all
16:06 of us feel that way but this episode is
16:10 about the consciousness of writing now
16:12 the way I write as I've said several
16:15 times on the show is that I literally
16:18 sneak in this is why I say it I don't
16:20 actually physically see this then
16:22 occurring necessarily but I'm in a movie
16:25 theater looking at the movie that I'm
16:26 supposed to be writing and it's almost
16:29 like I'm not supposed to be there it was
16:31 actually I had a dream once were
16:32 actually dreamed part of the Tron sequel
16:36 I participated in and wrote where I
16:38 would absolutely looking to my right and
16:40 seeing the screen I felt like oh my god
16:43 there it is finished I don't have to
16:46 even do anything I just sit and watch it
16:47 in in a dream everything's perfect the
16:49 way you want it if you're being creative
16:51 music sounds amazing like I always say
16:52 and so it's my it's my effort to
16:57 remember and and wake up and try to
17:01 figure out okay what was making that
17:03 moment occur cuz it's not just words
17:05 coming out of people's mouths in fact
17:06 it's probably only 20% the words and the
17:09 rest of the 80% is divided up between
17:11 the style of the way that the the world
17:15 looks in the movie the ways everything's
17:18 lit the palette that's there and more
17:20 importantly the palette that's not there
17:22 the lights that the light that is there
17:24 and the light that isn't there the music
17:26 if there is anything the sound effects
17:28 that are there all of that contributes
17:32 to making up this this image of reality
17:36 that will be the final product but it
17:40 still has to be perceived by the
17:42 audience of the times right we have
17:46 these movies in history which are known
17:48 as cult classics right
17:50 Nicolle classics are almost always
17:56 almost always related to where was
18:00 society at the time this particular
18:02 movie came out what society was
18:06 obviously tired of the other escapes
18:08 that had been presented to them
18:10 this film whichever one you want a name
18:13 from Wizard of Oz to to Snow White huge
18:18 one Snow White - like Star Wars - Blade
18:23 Runner Star Wars made Blade Runner
18:26 explode for those of us who saw it back
18:28 in the day and loved it immediately it
18:31 was this gritty amazing future noir
18:34 thing at a time when everything was
18:38 super sci-fi which is science fiction
18:40 which means it doesn't have to be real
18:42 bunny in fact they're doing a barrel
18:43 roll there's nothing wrong with that
18:45 stuff but we had seen the first one new
18:50 hope and we had seen Empire Strikes Back
18:52 and soon Return of the Jedi was coming
18:55 and one of the reasons why Return of the
18:57 Jedi at the very end seemed very corny
19:00 to everyone is that we had crawled out
19:02 of that sort of goofy sci-fi into the
19:07 more serious science fiction tell me a
19:10 story that is based on scientific fact
19:13 to the best of your ability of course
19:16 Kubrick bang went out in the 60s but
19:18 then everyone was in the Space Age
19:20 trying to go to the moon back in that
19:21 timeframe so he was congruent with what
19:24 was there and then of course he took it
19:25 to level 11 with a bunch of help from
19:28 other folks and his own brilliance and
19:30 so it will stand the test of time but
19:34 after the Vietnam War we start
19:38 unequivocally the best year the best
19:41 decade excuse me a filmmaking but guess
19:46 what if i sat down an average kid today
19:50 and said okay I have picked out ten of
19:53 the best films and Christ
19:54 that's probably 1982 all by itself we
19:57 have to do 20 or 30 of the best films
19:59 between 1975 and 1985 they may or may
20:04 not understand why any of these films
20:06 were amazing America starts the Vietnam
20:09 War was 63 and ends at middle of 74 you
20:14 know the cleanup is probably taking
20:16 quite a quite a bit longer than that so
20:18 we were in this world that was
20:19 tumultuous in a city can people are
20:22 being drafted
20:24 although people were more drafted in
20:25 previous Wars this one was bad and
20:27 people died and everybody knew someone
20:30 who didn't come home where people came
20:31 home with PTSD situations and we didn't
20:34 know how to deal with it we didn't get
20:35 we call it shell shock and that was it
20:37 you're just deal with it on your own
20:39 it's despicable how countries treat
20:41 their soldiers finally in this last term
20:45 of presidency United States at least
20:47 we're treating our vets right the
20:50 country should be ashamed but it takes a
20:53 few years to really pull together this
20:56 surge of films that comes in 1975
20:59 because everything has to be in in
21:00 progress to release at a particular
21:02 perfect moment in time the big thing
21:06 about snow white is it releases in 1936
21:09 along with other amazing films in that
21:12 time frame but it is in first animated
21:15 film with synchronized speaking on top
21:19 of a animated character the animations
21:23 ridiculous the man emissions amazing and
21:25 yes they did trace film at one point to
21:28 get certain things to go right but come
21:29 on it's still a hell of a lot of work
21:31 and it looks amazing but that film made
21:34 a tremendous amount of money and
21:35 launched the Disney Enterprise to the
21:37 next level but when I remember each
21:40 decade of my life I remember several
21:43 things
21:44 the average music on television or
21:46 excuse me
21:47 the average music on the radio and how
21:49 it makes everyone feel music was such a
21:52 huge thing in the 70s the quality was
21:56 ridiculous okay there's a reason why
22:00 when you sing karaoke or you go to
22:01 karaoke bar there's so much stuff coming
22:04 out of the 70s and the 80s the people
22:06 saying young kids are singing it and
22:07 they even go back you know to the 50s
22:09 the sing Frank Sinatra cause like this
22:11 is real sound man so they've been
22:15 blessed decade after decade after is 30s
22:17 40s 50s 60s preceded the 70s obviously
22:21 and each one of those decades came up
22:22 with legendary artists today it's all
22:26 just created in a tiny little bedroom
22:29 and it sounds like it the other part is
22:32 the clothes that we wore
22:36 society goes to these weird you know
22:38 obviously reinventions but we have been
22:40 lost for thirty years ever since grunge
22:44 happened we've been lost there was no
22:47 expression it was sort of anti
22:48 expression and that's okay too
22:50 punk rock was sort of anti expression
22:52 but look at how punk rockers looked
22:54 amazing I mean their formidable you know
22:57 and their little Nazi people sometimes
23:00 they turn into skinheads or something
23:01 like that but they still they didn't
23:06 just become a punk rocker some folks did
23:09 Mohawks which is a hell of a lot of
23:11 effort they they just did they just
23:14 looked phenomenal when I first moved to
23:15 Bay Area in the early 90s there was a
23:17 bunch of punk rockers at De Anza College
23:19 from England and some of them weren't in
23:22 the college and they were just always
23:24 around but it was like purebred punk
23:27 rockers it look like they're young I
23:29 mean they're 18 to 22 at a time when
23:32 they're decade beyond that what we had
23:34 already done here in America having
23:36 poached a bunch of punk rock movements
23:38 from the from the British Isles as they
23:42 might say in the late seventies early
23:44 eighties we really got super intense the
23:49 way our homes looked how we filled up
23:52 our houses with things you would have
23:54 finishes what you went to retail
23:56 locations they had a look that was one
24:00 way or the other the amount of
24:02 incredible original artwork that came
24:04 out of the 60s and 70s due to drug use I
24:08 don't know if it'll ever be equaled in
24:11 the near future it might take 50 to 100
24:16 years to get society back up to that
24:18 point where we don't demonize drugs that
24:20 don't hurt your body so you can see love
24:23 you can feel God you know you can
24:25 connect all the dots of humanity and go
24:28 why do I hate you again I don't know man
24:30 give me a hug truce you know and so art
24:33 popped out of that colors were chosen
24:36 shapes were chosen album covers were
24:38 just unbelievably creative now we don't
24:41 even have album covers I mean kind of do
24:44 but everyone's trying to look hard go to
24:46 what is it blabbermouth.net I think it
24:50 is it's a rock-and-roll website for a
24:53 bunch of like guys from the eighties cue
24:55 god bless them love the fact they're
24:57 still going but you know nine out of ten
25:00 album covers or you know these guys
25:02 trying to look as hard as possible on
25:04 the cover it's like stop already did you
25:07 ever see the album covers out of the 80s
25:09 and 70s guys if the band members were
25:12 even on the front you're a lucky got an
25:15 album was supposed to give you a
25:17 full-blown virtual reality experience
25:20 you look at the album and the artist is
25:23 prepared artwork that is harmonizing
25:27 with the music that they chose if you
25:29 were lucky you got a poster if you were
25:32 super lucky the album had some really
25:33 cool art on the center maybe it was a
25:35 colored album usually the lyrics were on
25:39 the insert you know around the vinyl
25:41 itself prints was one of the most
25:44 amazing musicians at doing this he would
25:47 literally create an album that just had
25:48 a wild feel and you'd be a little
25:50 disoriented on the next album and take
25:53 your little while to understand his next
25:55 sound would make it happen he was
25:57 creating like a subculture in saiyr
25:59 subconscious inside this overall
26:00 consciousness trying to get everyone to
26:03 the next level of where he was in music
26:05 this affects everything how people spoke
26:11 was completely different from decade to
26:13 decade and yeah you know you got a
26:14 totally tubular and that's awesome and
26:16 all that kind of stuff we still say
26:18 awesome too much probably I'm definitely
26:21 a violator that but you go watch old 50s
26:26 beatnik movies and you hear that daddy-o
26:29 and what's up cat you're square cat you
26:31 know that kind of stuff
26:32 man it's awesome when you really watch
26:34 the Twilight zones especially the one
26:37 with the three aliens came down from
26:39 outer space and they're dressed like
26:40 greasers as their cover they wrote the
26:43 dialogue the way they talked my uncle
26:45 was a greaser back in the day before it
26:46 became an optometrist you know the
26:50 consciousness is really the boundaries
26:53 by which your actors your characters and
26:56 your script will be
26:58 constrained willingly it is their nature
27:02 but the world has a nature to every
27:06 element of the world has a nature to it
27:08 so picking your soundtracks like a lot
27:10 of crappy movies try to make it not so
27:13 crappy by playing you know one-hit
27:17 wonder hits all the way through the the
27:19 movie to keep you on board
27:21 now this scene sucks but I really like
27:23 that song or if you're gullible you'll
27:26 actually map the song onto a crappy
27:29 scene and give the crappy scene a whole
27:31 bunch of credit just because of song
27:32 explain in the background
27:34 what's cool about stranger things and
27:36 the brilliant writing that those
27:38 brothers do is that they beautifully
27:44 constrain the language of the kids you
27:47 know when I was a kid the first time I
27:50 ever heard the f-bomb I can't remember
27:54 which one was first my dad was
27:56 whispering to my mom something and he
27:57 used the f-bomb obviously not at her
28:00 they weren't remotely arguing he was
28:02 talking about something at work he just
28:04 whispered it and just used it absolu
28:06 what's that word you know and then that
28:08 was at a jukebox at a Dairy Queen in
28:11 Derby Kansas and some two kids were
28:13 talking about songs and they used the
28:15 word and I still had no idea what it
28:16 meant so hearing a really dirty word and
28:19 it was really funny how the mind knows
28:22 that's a that's an off limit phrase but
28:28 we were good kids
28:29 I've told you guys several times on the
28:32 show that you know if you watch good
28:36 times set in New York City know if it's
28:39 the Bronx or it was the Bronx I think or
28:43 I can't remember it was but you know
28:45 it's a struggling family in New York
28:48 african-american family if you will
28:49 black family and JJ I think his last
28:53 name's Evans and JJ he's like he's like
28:56 an heirloom to 70s television everybody
29:00 in the world know who JJ was everyone
29:02 loved that guy and he was always just
29:04 this because he's really super young
29:06 when the series starts and it's on TV
29:08 for I don't even know how many
29:09 years as he grows up to be a full man a
29:12 young man on this show just really he's
29:14 really tall it's really funny but he has
29:17 this amazing charm and charisma about
29:20 him that he he can throw it in sold out
29:24 with the big smile on his face and it's
29:26 just it was a hilarious character that
29:28 this guy he's still alive I think but
29:31 he's he had this thing and there was an
29:34 episode where he got recruited into a
29:36 gang in New York and the big thing was
29:39 that they gave him a gun and told him he
29:42 had to use it on somebody during some
29:44 gang on gang fight
29:46 and I mean everyone watching the show
29:50 thought oh my god a gun that's like so
29:54 out there that is so overboard now real
29:57 New York was definitely acclimated to
29:59 using a gun every once in a while but
30:02 there was a reason why during the
30:04 Rolling Stone concert where they
30:06 happened to use the Hells Angels as a
30:10 security detail and a guy pulled out a
30:16 gun and started waving it around the
30:21 crowd and of course Hells Angels guys
30:24 are not someone you want to mess with
30:25 mess with especially the ones in the 70s
30:28 I mean I don't even know how these guys
30:30 got so hard I don't know if they're all
30:32 Vietnam vets I don't know what the deal
30:33 was but they were formidable personified
30:38 okay within seconds of this guy waving
30:43 his gun a dude stabbed him and killed
30:46 him and it was just this is
30:49 inappropriate
30:50 you're now threatening people's lives
30:52 you could just pull that trigger and
30:54 someone could die and the dude who
30:56 killed him just took all those variables
30:58 into account and killed the guy
31:00 obviously horrible on all ends of that
31:04 story but that's sort of how it works if
31:08 you were that foolish to bring out a
31:09 weapon at a concert and you think
31:11 there's something so important that you
31:14 had to bring out a weapon to get your
31:16 point across
31:17 you're obviously in outer space you know
31:20 you have a low IQ you're just not
31:23 processing reality correctly but then
31:25 here comes the equal force the other way
31:27 and you see the footage of this guy's
31:29 just a big a switchblade man just boom
31:32 nails this guy and that changed concerts
31:35 forever
31:36 it changed the consciousness forever if
31:41 you ever heard about anyone else getting
31:43 killed at a concert well as much as
31:45 you're surprised after the very first
31:47 time well that's just what happens
31:50 sometimes honey but we managed to enter
31:53 the 80s at this ridiculous I mean
31:57 ridiculously awesome let me just use
31:59 that word level of consciousness where
32:02 the clothing hit this wild stride I mean
32:05 we were wearing all kinds of weird stuff
32:07 parachute pants and Michael Jackson had
32:09 his beaded jacket everybody wanted to
32:11 own I mean it was it was so funny about
32:14 the beaded jacket is I can tell you this
32:16 is part of the consciousness of the time
32:19 there were probably very few kids in
32:21 their teens okay and least there early
32:23 maybe 16 and under who wouldn't take
32:25 that jacket and a heartbeat wouldn't buy
32:27 it if they could buy it but you look at
32:29 it today and you wouldn't be caught dead
32:31 wearing that thing and that's usually
32:33 how it goes with all the different
32:34 cultures right when you offer a script
32:38 to someone where you were trying to
32:40 capture that lightning in a bottle and
32:42 they didn't live in that era think about
32:45 how tough it is for that person reading
32:48 that script to ever figure it out
32:49 I'm debating in my mind right now to
32:51 make this whether to make this a
32:53 screenwriting episode or just an episode
32:55 I think it's extremely important for
32:57 writers to understand this what's
33:00 interesting is when I watch you know and
33:02 none of us know what's true if you watch
33:06 a Western like Unforgiven for instance
33:08 they can make the world raw with because
33:13 the Western time frame let's just say
33:16 1850 to maybe 1880 where it's really
33:20 that Wild West where all the stories
33:22 come from it has less moving parts and
33:25 so perhaps it's a little bit easier to
33:28 let the land dictate the environment
33:31 you're in a log cabin you're in a very
33:34 you know hastily put together
33:37 would house or hotel or saloon or
33:40 something and then the clothing was
33:42 fairly unified back in those days very
33:45 simple there weren't a lot of choices
33:49 but once you bring it into reality today
33:53 holy crap
33:55 we now have millions and millions of
33:58 choices about how we build each one of
34:00 our homes how we dress how we do our
34:03 hair how we talk what words we're going
34:06 to use or gonna swear a little bit or
34:07 we're not going to swear do we go to
34:10 church or not go to church do we do have
34:12 a fancy car not a fancy car believe it a
34:14 fancy house do we have a studio
34:16 apartment are we young and struggling
34:18 because we have no money
34:19 are we you know relaxing in our 50s 60s
34:23 and 70s because we made a nest egg and
34:25 it's working out so many elements to it
34:29 the thing I missed the most about the
34:31 70s and the 80s I guess the last half of
34:34 the 70s and all of the 80s was the
34:36 innocence and good nature of mankind
34:39 there's the video on YouTube that's been
34:42 watched several times which someone
34:44 walked into a 7-eleven I mentioned it
34:46 once before and they just filmed people
34:49 hanging out in a 7-eleven and everybody
34:52 was goofy and funny and and had good
34:55 intent for each other I think it was
34:58 here in LA they just guy went around
35:01 just talked to people he got a video
35:02 camera which was something that was a
35:04 big deal a color video camera was only a
35:07 few homes at it because they cost a lot
35:08 of money now everyone has a 4k one they
35:10 called a telephone so the idea that
35:13 someone might say well that's just
35:14 because you were young and you were
35:16 innocent so you view it through your
35:18 innocent eyes
35:19 not really I understand there's a
35:22 portion of that you know believing in
35:24 Santa Claus definitely has that magic
35:26 that it's not going to be in my adult at
35:28 the same exact time but if they can
35:30 vicariously look at me having the
35:33 experience they can live it once more
35:34 and more time themselves but know the
35:37 70s and 80s had this innocence
35:41 there's a movie called the car from 1975
35:44 and there's a scene where this car which
35:48 is the devil it's an amazing movie man
35:50 but you're watching your go man it's
35:52 super corny the way the cops were
35:54 talking to each other on the radios the
35:56 card actually pinned a whole group of
35:58 kids in a cemetery with a few women that
36:01 were watching them because they were
36:02 practicing for band
36:04 the men were rushing to the scene
36:07 because they're all cops and they're
36:08 trying to you know cornered this thing
36:10 and with this taking time to get there
36:12 and and so this woman in these
36:15 bell-bottom pants and her seventies
36:19 haircut she thinks it's a kid in a car
36:21 and so she deals with kids she knows
36:25 what it's like and so she starts yelling
36:27 at the what she thinks is a kid in the
36:29 car calling him names called him a
36:31 jackass for how she said I don't know
36:37 like a horse's ass or something she said
36:39 she's a very like kind of not very dirty
36:41 words but in the time it was a big deal
36:43 and this is a horror movie where people
36:45 are getting killed all right
36:47 and still the dialogue wouldn't breach a
36:50 certain level because we didn't smokey
36:54 in the band another great two movies
36:57 that I mean you have to understand man
36:59 Smokey and the Bandit owned America for
37:03 the moment that Sally Fields and Burt
37:06 Reynolds hopped in that car was a Jerry
37:09 Reed Sheree Reeves read the dude that
37:14 played the sheriff whose name escapes me
37:15 so famous he was in the honeymooners you
37:19 know he played his sheriff and he would
37:21 say you know sumbitch or something like
37:24 that and man it was like oh my god he
37:25 said that word you know but this is
37:27 adults and and everyone was just into
37:30 this movie it was the way we behaved of
37:34 course it's it's a little bit juiced up
37:36 because Burt Reynolds was a was an
37:39 odyssey back in those days of just
37:40 absolute confidence and it's very
37:43 handsome guy back in the day Sally
37:45 Fields every dude had a crush on her she
37:48 was the cutest little thing on planet
37:49 earth but eastbound down
37:54 song whatever this song was that Jerry
37:56 Jerry read pretty shots his name played
37:59 was huge on the radio it was huge in the
38:02 movie I know you filmed me but I want
38:05 you to think this thing through for
38:08 where we are today
38:10 what is escapism today escapism is a
38:15 bunch of Marvel movies today they're
38:17 really well done I mean most of them are
38:20 all really well done spider-man not so
38:22 much the new spider-man was great and
38:23 then he's gone now the Iron Man 3 was
38:27 the other kind of floppy movie it's too
38:29 too repetitive but everything else which
38:33 is the overwhelming majority is funny
38:36 they're doing funny now which is great
38:39 but now we create entire consciousness
38:43 separate from the consciousness that
38:45 we're in and that's fine that's that's
38:48 art onto itself Tron Tron Legacy they're
38:53 whole different worlds once you get
38:55 inside the computer everything's
38:56 different Daft Punk is controlling your
38:58 brain with the music the incredible
39:01 designers who made that world just took
39:03 you a different place now the script was
39:05 junk but the actor showed up for work
39:08 they're trying to do their best with
39:10 these crappy lines and but you know in
39:12 the end you look kind of like the whole
39:14 experience because of the consciousness
39:15 saved the film not the individual words
39:19 spoken you know Pixar for a long time
39:23 was able to create that consciousness
39:25 and it seems like Pixar Pixar was
39:29 initially in my opinion plagued with
39:31 talent such that making sequels has
39:35 never really worked out for Pixar oh
39:37 they might make money but no one really
39:41 likes them better than the first Toy
39:43 Story one will always be a consciousness
39:47 experience that you had never
39:49 experienced before the way that these
39:51 things were modeled animated voiced over
39:54 the story was amazing everything was new
39:56 and the script did all their initial
40:01 scripts do one thing extremely well
40:04 which prevents them from creating
40:06 accurate
40:07 recreations in a sequel that replicates
40:10 the consciousness which is that if you
40:13 have a mechanism that is comedy in that
40:17 particular case all these kids toys were
40:20 alive you know and they were trying to
40:22 help the kid but every time the kid
40:24 walked in there leo lay down on the
40:25 ground like they were dead right like
40:27 they were just toys well they had
40:30 exhausted through brilliant writing
40:32 every gag that those toys could have
40:35 done and the only thing that you can do
40:38 to create a toy Toy Story 2 would be to
40:42 create all brand-new toys that somehow
40:45 have the potential gag level that is
40:48 original not used by the previous toys
40:52 in a completely separate world such that
40:55 it all feels new and amazing like the
40:58 first film Star Wars not so much Star
41:02 Wars epic talent in all areas but the
41:06 saga had just revealed a tiny you know
41:10 thumbnail of the world that was the
41:13 rebels against the Imperial forces and
41:17 so they had infinite real estate to keep
41:21 going with that story you know I bet
41:24 Lucas if he could live his life over
41:26 again would have created four or five
41:27 and six in the 80s with all those actors
41:30 alive instead of stopping he probably
41:33 needed a break but I bet 20th Century
41:37 Fox is kicking themselves every day for
41:40 not taking it on and look at what
41:42 they're trying to do now with the new
41:43 ones they can't do it there isn't a
41:48 single Star Wars sequel prequel that can
41:52 get you back to Star Wars I think rogue
41:54 one was the closest one why because they
41:57 started a brand new story with brand new
41:59 characters as some little you know how
42:02 did they get the the plans for the Death
42:04 Star you know there's a lot of criticism
42:07 about that film until they started
42:09 seeing the other films and they finally
42:11 are going back to rogue one is saying
42:13 it's got some ridiculous scenes in it
42:16 but the overwhelming majority of the
42:18 film puts you in the star
42:21 world takes you places you've never been
42:23 and it's nice the story is good it
42:27 betrays all the power of various
42:30 vehicles in new ways so if you're doing
42:34 a movie today obviously the stream of
42:37 consciousness as long as you're loyal to
42:39 the reality that we're in and you major
42:41 your suspension of disbelief mechanisms
42:44 to get anything to happen in your script
42:46 right if you're writing things that are
42:48 totally possible you don't need to bend
42:50 the rules that much to get things to
42:52 occur it's your job to make things
42:55 believable but mind-blowing if that's
42:58 what the kind of script you're trying to
43:00 do and again most scripts don't really
43:03 have that problem current day scripts
43:07 write with black mirror they take a
43:10 little piece of technology they advance
43:12 it forward and they make sure that that
43:14 little piece of technology is going to
43:16 create incredible conflict between
43:18 characters and then they beautifully
43:20 isolate what that conflict would be and
43:23 they develop characters that are for it
43:25 to put characters there against it and
43:28 characters that are affected by it
43:29 positively and negatively and so at the
43:32 end you have these beautiful little
43:34 one-hour shows the west-world is
43:37 probably one of the most recent
43:39 masterpieces season one especially
43:41 that's been put on film tremendous you
43:46 know world they created they get the
43:49 sophisticated world they get the Western
43:50 world again humans you get androids and
43:54 and then they put this super deep story
43:58 with Ed Harrison and about trying to
43:59 find the center of the maze you don't
44:02 even know what the maze is until the end
44:04 of the last show episode ten season one
44:09 you find out what the maze is phenomenal
44:13 took me three or four times watching
44:15 this show to really understand what the
44:17 hell was going on because times started
44:19 jumping around so much at the end I
44:20 start getting lost first time I watched
44:22 it course I'm doing other things at the
44:24 same time so how far back in time let's
44:27 just say from today would you have to go
44:31 to start worrying about consciousness
44:35 hmm it depends on history for one today
44:40 things are extremely dynamic three years
44:44 ago in America things were way different
44:46 depending on what kind of story you're
44:48 telling but ten years ago you almost
44:52 guaranteed things were different we had
44:55 an epic moment in reality in 2001 that
44:59 basically stole consciousness away from
45:04 at least Americans 100% I think the rest
45:07 of the world was fairly negative
45:08 negatively affected at least in first
45:10 world nations it is my hope that there
45:14 are third world countries that don't
45:15 frankly give a damn and they aren't
45:17 affected by it that way they don't lose
45:19 their world whatever that world is but
45:23 we used to go to an airport without
45:25 getting you know scanned and frisked and
45:28 all this other stuff we didn't have the
45:31 narrative of negativity such that you
45:34 don't herself random boogeyman around
45:36 every corner trying to trying to kill us
45:38 we didn't have that as where does the
45:41 90s were most of us thought okay the 90s
45:43 are going through this thing is the
45:45 super rebellious dude add privileged
45:48 white kids are walking around like
45:49 they're broke what was me I'm so ugly
45:53 alone was essentially the the mantra of
45:56 the 90s and so most of us thought I'll
46:00 just blow over we'll get back to
46:02 wouldn't you'd rather be in a nice world
46:04 like I was in the eighties when I moved
46:06 to California in 87 I've said this once
46:09 before many moons ago ie
46:12 I was stunned I was here right you dream
46:15 about being in California if you're not
46:16 from here and cut in America at least I
46:18 had things to do I wasn't just here like
46:20 a palm trees and Disneyland I had you
46:23 know programming career a writing career
46:26 I wanted to get into it was it was I had
46:30 a million dreams be an artist whatever
46:32 and you can do anything you want in Los
46:33 Angeles I mean it's it's here but I used
46:36 to go down to Rodeo Drive with friends
46:39 and just walk the art galleries I used
46:43 to go to the late-night performances of
46:45 the Hollywood Bowl for
46:47 because at one particular time at night
46:49 you can go in for free and watch
46:50 classical music it's beautiful used to
46:53 go to Venice Beach all the time in
46:56 seeing the chainsaw juggling man that
46:59 one-man band Michael Cole you're
47:01 performing Michael Coulier who wanted
47:06 McMahon's whatever I big contest that
47:10 was 100 grand hundred fifty grand or
47:12 whatever was he won and you know no none
47:14 of us were surprised he won if you saw
47:16 him on Venice Beach the guy was his own
47:19 level of consciousness but he derived it
47:21 from the good intentions of the 80s and
47:24 he came right off the streets man he he
47:26 dominates considered the Godfather of
47:28 Venice Beach then the 90s Venice Beach
47:31 turned into a horrible drug infested
47:33 gang violent area it was bad and I was
47:38 in the barrier at the time so now he
47:40 came back to visit Venice a little later
47:42 it was a little toughened up a little
47:44 bit different it's still fun Steven
47:48 Spielberg was able to put the 80s in a
47:50 bottle like nobody else that I know of
47:52 by filming in the era of the film
47:54 incorrectly he filmed et and poltergeist
47:57 which I think released in 82 right
48:01 around the same time in the same
48:02 neighborhoods and Simi Valley or
48:05 something was used but if you want to
48:08 see how the world was for average kids I
48:12 think the poltergeists beginning were I
48:14 think it starts off with a guy on a
48:17 bicycle a grown adult on a girl's bike
48:20 or something like that some banana seat
48:23 bike and he's got this beer with him
48:26 it's either two six-packs or a 12-pack I
48:29 don't need to Kate I don't know if they
48:30 had 12 packs back then but they had he's
48:32 dropping beers trying to ride his bike
48:35 and these little kids have a
48:36 remote-control car which they raced in
48:37 front of his tires to knock him over and
48:40 he's just trying to get the beers to the
48:43 house because the game is on me even
48:46 though I lived in Massachusetts at the
48:48 time and then quickly moved back to
48:50 Kansas around that time frame which is a
48:52 completely different world you know
48:54 Southern California and the Midwest was
48:56 completely over Massachusetts completely
48:58 different than in both those places
49:00 the attitude of that first opening scene
49:02 and sort of how the adults were fighting
49:04 over remote controls changing each
49:07 other's TVs and he goes look around
49:09 trying to watch the games and my kid
49:10 wants to watch this TV show they're
49:12 trying to change the channel and they're
49:13 fighting over back and forth that was
49:17 the name of the game
49:17 that's just how we how we communicated
49:21 now here's sort of the undertow message
49:25 of this whole episode which is this
49:27 I think consciousness and America has
49:30 been very similar in overall family
49:33 level consciousness for almost 20 years
49:36 now and I think we took several steps
49:42 backwards in several areas and some
49:45 steps forward but most backwards I'm
49:47 very glad that Los Angeles doesn't have
49:48 the gang violence that it used to have
49:50 these guys all got older and wanted to
49:53 have kids and the cops wanted to do the
49:55 same thing and so they ended up calming
49:59 down
50:01 like I said I talked to that LAPD guy he
50:04 was retiring the following year with his
50:06 best buddy next to him who worked his
50:08 first 10 years with the other dude and I
50:10 asked him I said isn't the world Nelly a
50:12 lot better he goes oh yeah man way
50:14 better he goes now I pull over a guy
50:15 every once in a while and I'll find out
50:17 I look inside the window and he's one of
50:19 the old gang bangers and we just
50:22 reminisce about the fact that we
50:24 survived and he goes I don't give him a
50:26 ticket he just goes home we're so so
50:28 glad that both of us are alive and they
50:30 were not running that old game anymore
50:33 the other thing that Hollywood doesn't
50:35 allow most the time which I hope returns
50:38 directors are trying to return to this
50:40 but I don't think that they're focusing
50:44 on the consciousness being established
50:46 while they're trying to do it and that
50:49 is the art of establishing shots giving
50:52 the camera some time just to sit and
50:55 ingest the world and adjusted on these
50:58 levels that we're talking about the
51:00 music the architecture the clothing how
51:05 people tell a joke how people deal with
51:08 conflicts or what have you know those
51:10 are a little sophisticated for
51:11 establishing shot
51:13 but you watch old movies for in the past
51:15 and oh my god you'll have scenes to go
51:17 on for minutes four or five minutes
51:21 nothing is being spoken they're just
51:23 moving the camera around slowly allowing
51:26 people to exist showing just there's no
51:29 real dialogue that's pointed at you if
51:32 there's dialogue it's just sort of like
51:33 chatter in the background to let you
51:35 know this is how it was in this
51:39 particular era think about all the
51:41 movies you see today
51:43 big giant action scenes at the very
51:49 beginning everything's got to be crazy
51:51 for a minute one minute because what
51:53 they want to have is you know on paper
51:56 they want to read something exciting
51:57 from the very first paragraph but I
52:01 wrote the film kou :
52:02 which is about an Irish God like a Jesus
52:06 2,500 years before Christ
52:08 I wrote it you know there are some
52:10 exciting things at the beginning because
52:11 the war begins at the beginning so
52:13 there's actually a very incredible scene
52:15 or at the beginning where a family gets
52:18 slaughtered minding their own business
52:20 because the horde is coming and a little
52:23 boy escaped and got on horseback and
52:26 rode to the king and said look they're
52:28 coming you know the Kings like who's
52:31 coming you know and he says death but
52:34 there's a little boy in the script for
52:36 about I don't know five pages because
52:43 I'm letting the kid grow up the this
52:44 this God decides to hat send his son
52:46 down to save Ireland and so the kid
52:50 needs to be born is used to be a virgin
52:52 birth we have to establish this the kid
52:54 I wanted to establish the fact that the
52:55 kid was loved by the village and so I
52:57 let him have like a few little scenes
53:00 where he's he's being hugged and kissed
53:04 but he has these little fevers that he
53:06 has because he's not quite right because
53:08 he's half god and half human and he's in
53:11 a tumultuous world so it pains him to be
53:14 in that world and I heard this little
53:16 girl that ends up being his girlfriend
53:18 go over to him and and well he's kind of
53:21 passed out he has no idea she's in the
53:23 room and she's touching him and kisses
53:25 him on the floor
53:25 and it seems like the fever subsides and
53:28 they end up becoming lovers later on but
53:31 the only major critique I got from Chris
53:34 Hemsworth or wrote afore was wow there
53:37 doesn't seem to be that many lines for
53:39 me it was like five pages but he's been
53:43 trained I'm Thor
53:45 I'm Ali's I'm Captain Kirk I immediately
53:48 get on cameraman I immediately sucked
53:50 down every pixel for me me me me me I
53:53 mean I have that opinion today he may
53:55 understand that build-up is very
53:57 important but it's like if if your sex
54:01 life were to go like an average
54:03 Hollywood movie the second you shook a
54:07 woman's hand you'd have an orgasm right
54:10 who's that Samberg song jizz in your
54:12 pants would just be constant orgasms
54:15 constantly you just don't have any
54:17 foreplay there's no getting to know
54:18 anybody this is Hollywood kid we got to
54:20 keep things moving it's like but really
54:22 because when this industry was built for
54:26 80 years there was no problem with
54:29 establishing shots there was no problem
54:31 with building up until something
54:32 happened poltergeists think about
54:34 poltergeists
54:35 well you establish the neighborhood
54:38 first we learned who the families are
54:40 who the parents who the kids would
54:42 what's the attitude of the dad when the
54:44 dad comes out to fight over the remote
54:45 control with the neighbor used to learn
54:49 about the neighbor you get to learn
54:51 about how they try to deal with
54:52 selfishness and they don't do too well
54:54 so they have this immaturity about them
54:56 each one has a good case guy wants to
54:59 entertain his kids yeah was entertained
55:00 a bunch of his buddies then it's one day
55:04 of the family functioning together
55:06 before anything goes wrong because if a
55:10 ghost shows up in the first scene or a
55:11 flicker of light or something phenomenal
55:13 happens in the first second of the phone
55:16 okay you got to keep outdoing the
55:19 previous scene you're gonna run out of
55:22 gap power really quickly we've lost our
55:26 way when you write a book well hell it's
55:30 really simple
55:33 I was sitting with two other people
55:34 today and we're talking about the
55:36 difference between the consciousness of
55:38 film and the consciousness of a book and
55:40 I said to them yeah you're totally right
55:42 and we you know this is how I write so
55:44 don't worry about it but let's keep
55:46 talking about it let's refresh all of
55:47 our definitions and get on the same page
55:50 with what this is but I said I've been
55:53 sitting with you guys for two or three
55:55 hours now and I haven't read either one
55:57 of your minds yet but if this was a book
55:59 I would know exactly what you're
56:01 thinking
56:01 because that's what a book can do now
56:03 people like that a little bit in a book
56:06 but when you're doing a film or
56:08 television it's all visual it's all
56:10 visual if it didn't happen on camera it
56:13 never happened the other element is do
56:16 human beings on an average day
56:17 understand humanity and what makes us
56:21 who we are the number one faux pas today
56:25 in actors is they don't act with their
56:27 face they act with their face for the
56:29 second that their line is coming out of
56:31 their mouth and the second their line is
56:33 done they turn into like Generic bob you
56:36 know or they're they're not reflecting
56:40 what's going on in the room you know my
56:42 huge critique that I've said before
56:44 about the solo film this is someone
56:47 trying to play an early Harrison Ford
56:50 playing han Solo
56:52 now despite the fact that the actor that
56:54 they chose really doesn't look much like
56:56 Harrison Ford unless you filming from
56:57 the side they had two other options that
57:00 were phenomenal which I don't know why
57:02 they didn't take it but this actor
57:05 smiled through the entire movie okay how
57:12 about we do this we take Star Wars
57:15 Empire Strikes Back and Return of the
57:17 Jedi I put it on a cutting cutting board
57:21 inside final cut or whatever I'm we're
57:23 just gonna cut every scene that Han Solo
57:25 was in there's not a single moment on
57:28 this new version of the film we're gonna
57:30 create that doesn't have Han Solo scenes
57:31 and then I locked that actor in a box
57:34 after he does his first line smiling on
57:37 camera just so he understands his
57:39 mistake I take all the air out of the
57:42 box by giving a little scuba
57:45 or you can he can breathe there was
57:46 someone I said okay every time Han Solo
57:50 smiles you can take a breath you ready
57:54 for this here we go he's gonna die he's
57:58 gonna die in I don't 3 to 5 minutes
58:01 because Han Solo doesn't smile often he
58:05 smiles when he is manipulating he is
58:07 smiling when he wants something he
58:09 person for brilliantly designed the
58:11 character such that he is a stoic dude
58:15 if he's bragging he smiles the actor
58:20 missed the whole boat and so many actors
58:23 do nowadays because the directors don't
58:25 have any balls to say hey stop smiling I
58:30 know you just got into a really amazing
58:33 film franchise but would you stop
58:35 smiling Carrie Fisher came back and she
58:38 realized she kept the old skills going
58:41 Mark Hamill
58:43 he came back he was very grumpy but he
58:45 understood you know walk around smile
58:47 and he's like yeah I'm on a movie as
58:49 much as this is great I got a job to do
58:51 my character is not smiling take
58:54 everybody and Solo who smiles oh my god
58:58 it's just constant the whole thing is a
59:00 big oh my god we're in a movie we're in
59:03 a movie we're in a movie so you can
59:05 write some great stuff that has a lot of
59:07 great consciousness frequency but if the
59:09 director doesn't have any balls to
59:12 control his actors or her actors your
59:15 stuffs gonna get just dissolved if
59:19 that's what you're going for so everyone
59:22 has to participate perfectly in creating
59:25 this consciousness that is your film too
59:29 much now we get a overhanded hamed
59:33 acting to people trying to be profound
59:37 too much take the new blade runner' 2049
59:41 there is a replacement for turkle's
59:44 character which is dr. Tyrell as dr.
59:46 Tyrell was killed in the first phone
59:48 many years ago Terkel was able to pull
59:54 out of Tyrell the most subtle
59:58 brilliance out of his character out of
60:02 the action that he was portraying
60:05 his intelligence was implied it was
60:08 amazing he didn't tell anyone in the
60:11 movie that he invented the Nexus mind
60:16 the new movie oh my god it was Ivan
60:20 world's I've got millions I'm so smart
60:23 and I'm being very profound and do you
60:26 like my beard like my beard do you see
60:29 this water effect on the wall water
60:31 effect on the wall if I'm not doing very
60:33 good at this scene sucks focus on the
60:35 water on the wall modern filmmaking
60:40 what's beautiful about what's going on
60:43 now with film is that when you talk to
60:46 it's kind of a bad news good news thing
60:48 the bad news is if you talk to the old
60:51 pros who did amazing things in previous
60:54 decades when the 24 20th century excuse
60:57 me they will tell you that Hollywood is
61:01 dead that it is dead dead dead why
61:04 because they've tried to pitch great
61:05 scripts and they're just not being
61:08 understood and then sometimes you know
61:10 bad scripts get pitched too but if a
61:14 great script came through I was in a
61:16 meeting once and we had to listen to
61:19 this intern tell us how to make a movie
61:21 who had no film degree no writing
61:23 education whatsoever but she knew all
61:26 about how to make film we got out of the
61:29 meeting and I got in the parking lot
61:31 with my buddy who wrote the film and he
61:34 said you know this industry is so
61:37 screwed up he says you see that kid in
61:40 there that's what's wrong with Hollywood
61:42 right we later found out that the
61:44 producer of the the president of the
61:47 studio that little division was sleeping
61:49 with the girls so that's why she got in
61:50 there but he said if I brought Star Wars
61:54 in there right now they'd say I like the
61:55 script but what is this for scrap get
61:57 rid of this for scrap out of there and I
62:01 was like yeah you you wouldn't have been
62:03 able to convince me of that line eight
62:06 hours ago but today right now having
62:08 just been in that meeting you're
62:10 absolutely right
62:11 so the bad news is is that Hollywood is
62:14 failing miserably yeah there's some
62:17 movies that are absolutely phenomenal
62:19 and you don't even know how they happen
62:20 anymore like who if God if I was running
62:23 a studio I'd look at TV and I look at
62:25 Westwood and I go oh my god who's making
62:28 that okay Christopher Nolan and your
62:31 whole writing team you got to write me a
62:32 movie because we're gonna make this a
62:34 movie movie you know I knew sell tickets
62:38 I'm dying I'm borrowing money left and
62:40 right we're a billion and a half and
62:42 debt by borrowing money but the good
62:45 news is they will fill and if they don't
62:50 change their ways and if they don't
62:52 change their ways we're gonna get
62:55 continued crap but the cool thing is is
62:58 someone is going to put together the way
63:01 that we used to make films it also has
63:04 to do with the way the studio's are
63:05 organized internally of course they need
63:07 a great create their own staff and bring
63:09 them back in-house so that a Sony
63:11 picture so any MGM picture feels way
63:14 different than a universal picture that
63:16 a you a picture
63:17 whoever out there is making films Disney
63:21 films yeah they fill now like the Marvel
63:25 world has a feeling
63:26 it doesn't even matter for creating a
63:28 television show they have a Marvel
63:30 television feeling consciousness that
63:33 wraps all their stuff up you can hate it
63:35 or love it or whatever but they're
63:36 accurate to their franchise I'm not a
63:39 big game of Thrones fan but I couldn't
63:41 possibly deny those writers the fact
63:45 that they were true to their super clean
63:47 medieval clothing constantly right there
63:50 world it pleases their fans and but what
63:54 do they have some fans Westworld for me
63:57 hit every single ball out of the park
63:59 you could just throw it you could
64:01 blindfold these writers and they would
64:02 have just knocked out the park deadwood
64:04 the same way Carnivale absolute home run
64:06 the whole thing when you can watch a
64:10 series three to five times again and get
64:14 more and more out of it you're looking
64:17 at masterful writing you know Deadwood
64:20 the writing is intense
64:22 I mean it's Shakespearean writing a
64:23 Shakespearean act
64:26 phenomenal these these gyms happen
64:28 because these all these usually it's one
64:31 core writer from the past sneaks into
64:34 the future and is able to get something
64:36 greenlit but unfortunately they get old
64:40 and they can't continue doing it so
64:43 there's a lot of room out there is the
64:45 good news for great writers and it may
64:48 be that you're putting a script on the
64:50 shelf every four months let's say you're
64:52 a professional writer able to crank
64:53 something out in four months and four to
64:55 six whatever so you able to create maybe
64:57 three two to three movies a year and
64:59 Hollywood isn't ready for you just yet
65:01 you just keep them on the Shelf if you
65:04 want to do something with them pull them
65:06 off polish them up put them back on the
65:08 shelf whatever it is the proverbial
65:10 shelf the digital shelf these days but
65:14 eventually the tires will turn and your
65:17 stuff can get sold and it will sell like
65:21 you know candy bars at a willy wonka
65:25 factory but imagine you're such a great
65:29 writer and I know that there are people
65:31 out there that will argue this and I'll
65:33 say and a Hollywood spends a billion
65:36 dollars a year looking for great scripts
65:37 and they simply can't find them mmm
65:41 maybe that's true in a lot of cases
65:42 maybe it's not true if agencies are the
65:47 barrier between your stuff getting to a
65:49 studio well geez there's all kinds of
65:51 just mechanical elements that compete
65:53 with your stuff ever getting read
65:55 because other stuff's coming in it's
65:57 first-come first-serve you're on a pile
65:58 of 100 scripts and you just got to wait
66:02 your turn and hope that when your
66:05 scripts read this is what Studios might
66:06 want to make sometimes you have to pine
66:10 for things but I want to make sure that
66:12 you understand that if you're trying to
66:14 create a consciousness in a script there
66:17 are some great examples like I said you
66:19 can go back to old films that just
66:21 happen to be filmed in their particular
66:23 era and as you sit there and you watch
66:26 these things
66:27 ask yourself
66:29 why does poltergeist feel like
66:31 poltergeist and not like it is today
66:34 well all those attributes that you write
66:36 down all of your little answers take
66:39 notes
66:39 watch a movie and take notes there were
66:42 you know landmark films and if you feel
66:46 like oh well that's just old farty stuff
66:48 mm-hm
66:49 you probably don't get it but if you go
66:51 oh I see yeah I see oh yeah man that's
66:54 totally different we don't act like that
66:55 anymore do we
66:56 these people seem so goofy well imagine
67:00 that you were coming up with a really
67:02 great story that should probably exist
67:04 in those older time frames those older
67:06 decades
67:07 what there's your list there's your hit
67:09 list of all the things that you have to
67:11 do to create that consciousness in your
67:13 script obviously if you lived in the era
67:16 and the time that the drama is occurring
67:18 you're pre-qualified if you're not
67:21 pre-qualified you got to go find those
67:23 people and have those conversations what
67:26 was it like tell me and they may fail
67:31 the first attempt to tell you but go
67:32 ahead and to ask him again no no okay
67:34 but wait a minute what was what makes a
67:37 person different back in those days it's
67:41 funny when you talk to older people you
67:43 sense that older consciousness their era
67:46 you know you talked to a grandmother
67:48 who's say in her 60s or higher they will
67:53 have and you're in your 20s or 30s or
67:55 what have you there's just a different
67:57 way you talk to them you don't bring
67:59 them all the slang and stuff that you
68:01 say with your friends because you know
68:03 they won't understand what you're
68:04 talking about there's there's your
68:06 consciousness there's your culture the
68:10 substrate of what you're trying to write
68:12 but as much as people will say naively
68:15 that constraints are a bad thing in
68:18 writing constraints even if you don't
68:21 completely understand them at the very
68:23 beginning if you just keep thinking
68:27 about it and thinking about it thinking
68:29 about it there'll be this cracking
68:32 moment where you're going oh god yeah
68:34 that's fantastic
68:36 because of that that there's this and
68:38 under that and there's less for you to
68:39 choose from it's like going from a
68:41 normal Rubik's Cube
68:42 - a Rubik's Cube with like you know like
68:45 the normal rubik's cube is your goal
68:47 very simple to understand it's
68:49 complicated but you can solve the thing
68:51 to a rubik's cube with like a hundred
68:52 sides and it's you know as big as a
68:54 medicine ball and you're like whoa
68:56 hahaha I'm just gonna tape my whole
68:57 lifetime to solve this thing if I'm
68:59 lucky that's the world without
69:01 constraints
69:02 you won't constraints cuz it'll force
69:05 your hand it'll constrain your mind
69:08 anyway I want to put this together
69:10 before I lost my train of consciousness
69:15 because it's a real thing I often think
69:22 that you know it's not that I because I
69:25 write this way I write consciousness
69:27 scripts that's what I do
69:28 it doesn't mean I'm complete accurate at
69:31 getting out what I'm trying to get out
69:33 but the basics are always covered I hope
69:37 this was valuable it's just a little NX
69:40 on the skill of writing and again I I
69:43 was told today that there's a whole book
69:44 about it and it's a classic book about
69:46 it I have never heard anyone bring it up
69:47 to me so I'm very glad that they did
69:50 today make sure this something I
69:52 consciously think about but if you
69:55 haven't thought that through then there
69:56 you go you have some tools now that you
69:59 can add to give yourself a little bit
70:00 more dimension if you have a fairly
70:02 decent story but it doesn't have a
70:03 character it doesn't have a style maybe
70:06 going back at that we don't sit off to
70:08 the side but your script off to the side
70:10 you should always take a break from your
70:12 script you know because you'll get there
70:14 take a week off you know it sounds crazy
70:16 we got a deadline obviously don't do
70:18 that but he pushed it off for a week
70:19 think about it and then in that week
70:23 just write down more things about the
70:26 environment and the world and what makes
70:28 it what it is and then check your script
70:32 to make sure that that stuff's in there
70:35 at the right time when it would really
70:36 accentuate when you're establishing your
70:38 script at the very first five pages make
70:41 sure you're caught you know you're
70:43 constantly putting in these elements to
70:45 make sure one understands you may not
70:47 need to continually pound it over the
70:49 entire course of the script because
70:51 people will eventually get it and
70:52 they'll start being invested in your
70:54 characters
70:55 more than your story but everyone has to
70:58 understand that once the script is
70:59 delivered so you might put some forcible
71:02 or forceful language in your script
71:05 about this is the way it is and it's not
71:08 another way so that everyone reading
71:11 goes oh okay alright yeah that is the
71:13 way it is I understand it'll help you
71:15 out in the end it'll show your maturity
71:18 in writing I think that's all I got on
71:21 that one if you have them into deep
71:23 thoughts radio.com please go I'm gonna
71:25 make a short bumper today there's -
71:27 video - audio - social media - ways to
71:31 donate to the page and a season one link
71:33 you will not find season one on this
71:35 channel but it exists on a different
71:37 channel just go to the website and
71:38 you'll find it until next time take care
71:40 of yourself in someone else and I'll see
