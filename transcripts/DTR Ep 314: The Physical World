00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen we're gonna shoot another
00:39 night episode as I pulled down this
00:40 punch punch Cuban here I've been toying
00:44 with an idea that it's grown on me a
00:45 little bit it's trivial in nature to
00:48 anyone who's into the supernatural
00:49 it's a trivial notion a trivial thought
00:53 but I think it warrants a little bit of
00:56 revisiting because we might be able to
00:58 add something to it through a little
00:59 one-hour you know stint in this and the
01:04 notion has to do with the difference
01:06 between the way we take in senses as a
01:08 human being and the way that the
01:09 machinery in the world takes in senses
01:11 as we have designed them because what do
01:16 we do in this world we're always trying
01:18 to figure out what reality we're in at
01:20 least those of us who watch this show
01:23 okay so it's only as accurate as we
01:28 perceive it to be if there are five cent
01:31 system and it's always accurate as we
01:33 designed it to be in the mechanics that
01:36 we can discover to sense things right
01:39 obviously as microphones picking up my
01:41 audio those cameras picking out my video
01:44 if you had a smellivision there be so
01:47 much better there's a lot of you out
01:49 there that actually have experiences
01:51 with metaphysical supernatural things
01:54 you've seen a ghost you've seen
01:56 something that came to you I have a
02:00 couple experiences in my lifetime which
02:01 I've repeated several times and
02:03 consequently at night episodes so I
02:05 thought season four it should get a good
02:07 dose here but there's gonna be a little
02:08 bit of a twist on this and for those of
02:11 you have seen every single episode
02:12 you're gonna laugh because you're know
02:14 exactly what I'm going to be talking
02:15 about just briefly I'm not going to get
02:16 major detail so those of you who are new
02:19 to the show
02:20 brace yourself if you're into the
02:22 completely clinical pragmatic world
02:24 where you like the force and Star Wars
02:26 to be completely explained I had a
02:29 situation where I went to Disneyland and
02:32 I had Walt Disney walk up to me in front
02:34 of the park in front of the bank which
02:36 was over on the right side of the
02:37 entrance at the time and he told me
02:39 where to find a guy named Bob girl you
02:41 guys have heard this a million times you
02:42 can hear all the episodes for those of
02:44 you who are new bob was hired by Walt
02:46 1954
02:47 to do propulsion systems and to document
02:50 the creation of Disneyland I just met
02:53 Bob two weeks earlier at a Christmas
02:55 party and Bob was standing over by a
02:57 ride that he had redesigned from his
02:59 original ride actually sorry he didn't
03:02 redesign it but he did the original
03:03 submarine ride the propulsion system he
03:05 did a bunch of rides but he was standing
03:08 in front of it waiting to write it's
03:10 because he was in he's the oldest
03:11 surviving Imagineer as I understand it
03:13 and I walked straight to him because
03:16 Disney put a little pin in my mind and
03:18 with my girlfriend were hungry we're
03:20 supposed to be going to eat ride two
03:22 rides and get out of there and I took
03:23 him straight to an area of the park that
03:25 I never go had this show existed when it
03:28 happened I would have gone to Disney
03:29 security told them the story and had
03:31 them run back the tape and then show you
03:33 me walking from the bank directly to the
03:36 submarine ride which is now Finding Nemo
03:39 no diversions didn't look in any rides
03:42 didn't hit any dead ends and turn around
03:44 I went straight to the dude and he was
03:47 there and he was held up for fifty
03:48 minutes because the ride was broken had
03:50 the ride worked properly he would have
03:53 ridden it and walked off long before I
03:55 got there interesting right but now if I
03:59 roll back the tape the mechanical device
04:02 that senses photon friction and try to
04:06 see Walt what I see him I don't know
04:09 there are videos online of supposedly
04:12 being a humanoid walking out of the
04:15 haunted house and crossing through New
04:17 Orleans walking across the water towards
04:19 the steamboat and disappearing over
04:21 there a close friend of mine worked
04:25 there for seven years said there Walt's
04:27 all over the place he talks to you he
04:29 was on the steamboat managing the ride
04:31 during the parade and he said he heard
04:34 he and his friend heard Walt say you
04:36 better get away from that that engine
04:38 the boilers about to blow and they both
04:40 looked at each other and said did you
04:41 hear that and they said yeah and he said
04:43 what do you think he goes we got to get
04:44 out of here sure enough they walked ten
04:46 feet and the thing blew up the boat was
04:49 out of commission for six months ten
04:51 years after meeting Bob I called him up
04:53 and told him the story I said you know
04:55 I'm not even the slightest bit surprised
04:56 that stuff's been happening for years
04:58 Walt lives there
05:00 mmm interesting that's my story the only
05:04 other thing that happened to me is one
05:06 of my one of my grandmother's died that
05:08 morning she came to me in in my kind of
05:11 Twilight waking up phase I saw her in my
05:14 mind's eye hovering over the bed and she
05:17 said I just want you to know I'm on the
05:19 other side and I'm fine two o'clock that
05:22 day my mom called me and told me that
05:23 she passed I sort of said to my mom yeah
05:26 I know but my mom isn't into that sort
05:29 of thing so just kind of wanted one ear
05:30 out the other
05:31 I should have made a big deal about it
05:34 in that way she would have remembered it
05:35 so what if we can't track what we see in
05:39 the metaphysical world with our cameras
05:41 and our devices maybe we never can
05:45 because the sense the sensory system is
05:49 an intangible part of our being our soul
05:52 our third eye the audits on the inside
05:55 that doesn't reflect anything in this
05:59 world that's in the material world it's
06:03 the eye it's the spiritual either you
06:04 can see spiritual things how would that
06:06 change the world for all of us how would
06:12 we begin to prove it this is where the
06:15 rub comes in there really interesting
06:17 rub what is proof in this world and how
06:20 do you prove it I say I saw Walt Disney
06:24 all right you didn't see him how can I
06:27 prove it to you if I had the tapes of me
06:29 walking directly to Bob Kerr then you
06:32 might have 50% of what you need a
06:35 skeptic would always remain a skeptic
06:37 not a bad thing but they that's their
06:40 job they have to say well I don't know
06:43 maybe you sensed him in the park your
06:46 brain system in the park then your brain
06:50 created this apparition of Walt to get
06:54 you to go between these two points in
06:56 your head my brain completely imagined
06:58 this guy and I I have read books on this
07:01 guy that are SuperDuper thick several of
07:04 them
07:05 I've watched at one point I binge
07:07 watched his whole televised history like
07:11 every time he ever showed up on
07:12 television every
07:13 YouTube video I could find I watched and
07:15 watched and watched all of his little
07:17 introductions of brides his opening of
07:20 the park of Disneyland is introductions
07:23 of new movies everything interviews all
07:25 that stuff never dreamed about the guy
07:27 not once I dreamed about prints a
07:30 million times I don't dream about Walt
07:32 so what if or I should say this what
07:35 should we do about trying to prove
07:39 something that by its very nature is
07:41 outside of the realm of what human
07:43 beings consider proof in 2018 in the
07:47 21st century perhaps my story works on
07:51 people that have experienced it right
07:52 when I told Bob ger about this he you
07:56 know he was kind of you know one of
07:58 these situations he's a very famous
08:00 person and we share a famous friend this
08:04 has been 10 years he was 75 years old
08:07 when this happened and he's 85 when I
08:09 told him and so he was kind of in just a
08:13 mildly suspicious sort of annoyed
08:17 emotion when I got him on the phone and
08:20 when I told him how he knew me obviously
08:22 it immediately melted off very quickly
08:23 he's a sweetheart man and then when I
08:26 started telling him this really quickly
08:28 I got to the point very quickly and then
08:31 he just sorted it was like so
08:33 matter-of-fact about it now coming from
08:36 a kid he was in his 20s who worked
08:38 security I'm sorry working on security
08:41 but he worked in the the parks operation
08:43 for seven years that person is young and
08:45 probably would love to hear a ghost
08:48 story it's not that you can't maintain
08:51 such a desire as you get older but to
08:54 have Bob go from sort of a okay who are
08:57 you what am i listening to you for too
09:00 huh you know what that doesn't even
09:03 surprise me and he wouldn't told me two
09:06 or three stories of sort of magical
09:08 things that have occurred to him not
09:11 only in his life in general but
09:12 especially around the Disney Park and
09:14 related to Disney events he said he
09:17 pulled into the Disney parking lot once
09:19 and he was supposed to meet some people
09:23 at the park and you know Disneyland
09:25 parking lots were gigantic thing
09:27 so they don't exist anymore they're all
09:28 parking garages now but there used to be
09:30 giant parking lots and you would look
09:32 you could you know turn your head
09:33 completely around and see that someone's
09:35 there someone's not there's a car park
09:37 there's not a car parked
09:38 he said he parked his car an empty
09:41 parking lot no sooner did he get out of
09:42 the car that he had a car and two guys
09:47 just right on him who were supposed to
09:49 meet him there and he said there was no
09:52 one in the car no one in the park I
09:54 turned around looked behind me there's
09:55 someone behind me and he was yelling a
09:57 lot younger than than 85 when this
09:59 occurred to him it's interesting but
10:03 what do we do as human beings if we
10:05 wanted to develop a science around
10:07 something that could sort of free our
10:08 mind and give us perspective of where we
10:10 are in this universe if we can't prove
10:13 it and what does that mean can't prove
10:16 what is that what does the repercussion
10:18 to mankind if you can't prove something
10:20 well the biggest problem is it's very
10:23 difficult to share it with other people
10:26 especially people that are very
10:28 discerning
10:28 about making claims of such a kind now
10:32 if any of you've dabbled in in sharing
10:35 your ghost story or spiritual experience
10:37 whatever it is something in your mind's
10:39 eye something you think was an
10:40 apparition that you saw a voice you
10:42 heard in your head touch on your body
10:44 from someone you think might have passed
10:45 and you find someone who absolutely has
10:48 had all those experiences and they jump
10:49 on board really fast like oh really well
10:52 me - and me - and me too it doesn't mean
10:56 that they're not just like you it
10:57 doesn't mean that they do haven't had
10:59 these exact same experiences in fact
11:01 that's kind of rejuvenating in your
11:05 spirit when you can hear someone who's
11:06 had like minded things however there is
11:09 something very special with someone who
11:12 has been hiding a single experience and
11:14 just kind of saying really because I had
11:19 an experience one or maybe two whatever
11:24 and I haven't told a soul and I I've
11:29 been thinking about it for 20 years ten
11:30 years whatever I've analyzed the day I
11:33 didn't drink anything I don't take drugs
11:35 I wasn't onion medicine I was healthy I
11:38 wasn't in any distress
11:40 fact I was loved in life and this crazy
11:43 thing happened to me one of my fantasies
11:45 about this world is that we can start
11:47 creating some Sciences and these do
11:49 exist I'm kind of being facetious about
11:51 this but more of a mainstream research
11:55 attitude towards some of this more
11:57 metaphysical data because we're sitting
12:01 here
12:01 comparing footnotes would that should be
12:05 PhD thesis on these subjects and I think
12:10 that through dialogue we start to unlock
12:11 possible logical paths that we can use
12:14 to start this dialogue to start
12:18 comparing notes as well as heighten our
12:21 senses to see more in the meantime right
12:27 what if you listen to an episode and I
12:30 triggered something in your head maybe
12:31 it's nothing that I said to do but it's
12:34 something I reminded you about your idea
12:36 of something to do and you started that
12:38 regiment every day and then you start to
12:42 open your mind and see more and you go
12:44 see something but instead of seeing it
12:49 in some serendipitous way that happens
12:51 to you when you least expected you see
12:53 it in a way that is very lucid and
12:56 matter-of-fact it's like having a lucid
12:58 dream when you know it's happening and
13:00 you're like oh my god this this is
13:02 happening right now like waltz right in
13:04 front of me what do I do you know Walt
13:06 walked by my left side he walked up to
13:08 me with a little cigarette and saying he
13:10 had a brown pants on I can't remember I
13:15 almost think he just had a white shirt
13:17 on he didn't have a jacket on at one
13:19 point I thought he had a jacket on but
13:21 the more I think about it in my head on
13:22 think he did but he he just used his
13:24 cigarette hand his right hand to go is
13:27 over there and he walked by me to the
13:29 left and the weird thing was I didn't
13:31 track him to the left to see if he still
13:34 existed over there to see if he could
13:36 have turned around like a movie you know
13:37 you turn you look at the guy he's
13:39 leaving the room and he's maybe stops he
13:41 turns around he goes you know and you
13:44 know be careful on this ride don't eat
13:48 that food it's like enjoy this thing but
13:50 Papa a nice job on that thing yesterday
13:52 or something
13:53 you know you could have said something
13:54 else but I didn't track it because I was
13:56 so like whoa what the hell and it was so
13:59 quick three or four seconds but how do
14:03 we metabolize vision just to obsess on
14:05 this for one second you know how it
14:08 works your eyeballs take in like as much
14:10 of electricity gets mapped back to your
14:11 visual cortex which think it's all
14:13 sorted out you have two different angles
14:15 of viewing on something and our brains
14:18 have beautifully created this sort of
14:21 fictional facsimile of reality inside
14:24 our brain such that I know that
14:26 something's further away then something
14:28 that's closed up based on how these two
14:30 images are compared
14:32 but there's another eye inside your
14:34 brain that our ancestors of this world
14:37 seem to be utterly obsessed with and I
14:39 mean obsessed with and it's your third
14:42 eye it's the spiritual eye that's right
14:45 inside your head and it doesn't need to
14:48 be outside of your head because it
14:50 doesn't care about your skull it's just
14:54 there and it's like everything that is
14:55 spiritual can penetrate your skull and
14:58 be seen by your third eye there's a lot
15:01 of belief that the glands in your body I
15:04 talk about this every once in a while
15:05 your chakra glands your pineal gland
15:08 inside your mind is a gland that seems
15:14 to be a key instrument inside your mind
15:18 that gives you cognitive abilities your
15:21 ability to see what's really going on in
15:23 the world in a very conceptual way pain
15:26 and suffering is very recognizable when
15:29 your pineal gland works right when it
15:32 doesn't work right
15:33 you're very docile you're very droney
15:35 very zombie ish your your channel to
15:39 empathy starts to shut off because you
15:41 don't have any that's where fluoride
15:44 comes in you do what you're told if you
15:48 happen to gain any level of resistance
15:52 it's usually to resist those who can see
15:54 you shouldn't see that what you're
15:57 seeing is wrong just conform just
16:00 conform but now how does a research
16:04 experiment work usually someone
16:07 right some form of protocol a
16:09 methodology a list of things that you do
16:11 just like a list of how to bake
16:12 grandma's cake you hand out the protocol
16:16 to the world and you conduct the
16:19 experiment you follow the the list of
16:23 instructions perfectly and if you do it
16:26 right and if the protocol is written
16:27 properly you have the same exact
16:30 experience
16:31 - environmental conditions that the
16:35 other team had well how do we recreate
16:39 something as outrageous as seeing a
16:40 ghost isn't that a very proprietary
16:43 thing in time but they'll tell you that
16:47 there are locations on planet earth that
16:50 are haunted by spirits haunted probably
16:54 being something that is I would imagine
16:59 frowned upon by those who are actually
17:01 tapping into this world can you imagine
17:03 just being a spirit that wants to
17:05 communicate with the living and every
17:07 single time you do it somebody screams
17:09 somebody freaks out and it's they call
17:11 it a haunted house and you're like damn
17:12 I'm not haunting a house it's just like
17:14 beetlejuice after they calm down they
17:17 just start talking to the girl right
17:20 nobody do they're not trying to scare
17:21 the parents anymore it's just what it is
17:23 and of course after the parents kind of
17:25 take off wherever they take off the
17:27 chick owns the house and she hangs out
17:29 with the ghosts right now reality this
17:32 thing we've chosen to agree upon that
17:34 allows you to watch a YouTube video this
17:36 is something that we are exposed to a
17:39 lot the circumstances are very evident
17:44 very objective because hey we can both
17:49 go to the Eiffel Tower and touch it and
17:50 go my god this thing really exists look
17:52 at that thing oh my god it's huge right
17:54 but if I said okay I want you to buy a
17:56 season pass to Disneyland I'm gonna
17:58 introduce you to all the surviving
18:00 Imagineers and bob guard now let's walk
18:02 around the park and Bob's gonna hide in
18:04 there somewhere and let's see if we can
18:05 get Walt to tell us where he is let's
18:07 play peek-a-boo with with Walter Marco
18:10 Polo some sort right you automatically
18:14 would laugh right he's not gonna come
18:17 out for that reason it's not a test he
18:20 did that a love
18:21 his heart I don't know why he did it
18:23 actually he did it for some reason that
18:25 was his reason not my reason that I need
18:28 to see Bob yeah did we exchange the cure
18:31 to cancer No
18:33 we had about a five minute conversation
18:35 about him mountain biking that day I
18:38 made jokes that he was 75 years old that
18:41 I was a lot younger and I would be
18:44 terrified to do what he did that day
18:46 right which is mountain bike all over
18:48 California up in the hills I think too
18:52 is we share our experiences we're
18:53 sharing sort of the top layer of the
18:57 experience and we're not breaking it
18:58 down in a scientific manner again there
19:00 are college universities with you know
19:03 metaphysical supernatural little
19:05 departments that do things sort of like
19:06 Ghostbusters and probably not as popular
19:10 today as they were back in the 70s when
19:11 everyone was dropping acid and seeing a
19:13 hell of a lot more than universe than
19:14 anyone else did but they're out there
19:17 right especially funded by government
19:20 programs but unless we take our
19:23 experiences and get rid of the ghost
19:25 story elation of this special thing
19:28 happening to us and start breaking down
19:30 the physicality of it the timing of it
19:33 how long did you see the guy what what
19:35 did you exactly see this is something to
19:38 someone else saw is it inside your
19:39 mind's eye how does it compare to all
19:41 the other minds I daily imaginations
19:44 that you might have when you're sitting
19:46 there daydreaming about some fantasy
19:49 that you'd like to have in this world
19:51 how much different is it than that in my
19:55 experience there was there have been no
19:58 other experiences in my life that are
20:00 like the Disney experience none my
20:04 grandmother that I saw I think I have my
20:06 eyes closed I think I had just kind of
20:09 roll over it's a very bright morning and
20:12 it was just like I had just kind of
20:14 rolled over and closing my eyes and it
20:15 was like she was right there it wouldn't
20:18 have been a big deal have my mother not
20:20 called me a couple hours later to tell
20:22 me she had passed and the fact that she
20:25 said I'm on the other side and I'm okay
20:28 it was very cool
20:30 she knew her and I were very very close
20:32 right
20:34 there's a special bond between a
20:36 grandparent and a grandchild if you
20:38 allow it to happen and they typically
20:41 can get closer to you than they can get
20:42 to their own children who are busy in
20:45 their you know rebellious phase and
20:48 trying to prove to mom that they know
20:49 more than you think ITA's right sort of
20:51 thing as a grandchild you're just like
20:53 hey I'm so happy to see you what'd you
20:55 do today you know but now what if we
20:58 started making designations let's say we
21:02 use the phrase proved reality well I I
21:06 live improved reality what does that
21:09 mean that means that mechanical means
21:11 are the means by which we deem something
21:14 to have actually occurred or not
21:16 occurred but now what if we said
21:20 spiritual reality faith reality observed
21:24 reality something different something
21:28 with a little bit of metaphysical nature
21:30 to it and I'm sure that there's books on
21:32 this and there's proper words for all
21:34 the things I'm saying there was an
21:36 experiment by a gentleman that lived in
21:38 Haverhill Massachusetts because names
21:41 McDonald or something I lived in
21:42 Haverhill Massachusetts which is crazy
21:44 it's called the 21 gram theory and it's
21:48 been debunked and pissed on by a bunch
21:50 of people and the theory goes like this
21:53 for those of you know it you're gonna be
21:55 right on board but there was a doctor
21:58 who had this theory that a soul had
22:00 weight and had physical tangible mass of
22:05 some sort within this tangible proved
22:07 reality and so what he ended up doing
22:10 was measuring people's weight down to
22:13 the fraction of a gram
22:15 during death and on one particular
22:18 occasion a gentleman lost 21.3 grams the
22:23 second after he died and it's obviously
22:27 it the time is very specific if you let
22:31 anyone sit after they've died there's a
22:33 million excuses as to why that person
22:35 would have lost weight right later on a
22:40 doctor did a bunch of experiments on
22:43 dogs because dogs are easy to kill I
22:47 guess
22:47 and he killed a bunch of dogs and he was
22:51 noticing a loss in weight right after
22:54 the dogs passed away he blames it on
22:57 sweat glands that fire right at death
23:00 which is like that sounds like he
23:04 thought you know he's like I totally
23:06 debunked this other dudes 21.3 gram
23:08 thing and he was saying it was sweat
23:10 glands that sounds like it would take a
23:12 little while you know that the epidermis
23:14 sweat the sweat still on the epidermis
23:16 is still part of your overall measured
23:18 weight unless you towel down the dog and
23:20 go okay I picked up 21 grams of weight
23:22 you know off this perspiration of a dog
23:27 now I don't know if that was true the 21
23:30 gram thing ever really occurred or if
23:31 this guy was creating a theory because
23:34 he created a hypothesis that this was
23:36 the case and then he did experiments and
23:37 proved it correct so sometimes just like
23:41 dinosaurs where they postulate something
23:43 to exist found a tooth fake the dinosaur
23:45 and all sudden for the rest of eternity
23:47 that fake dinosaurs the way that that
23:49 dinosaur looks and that tooth belongs to
23:51 that fake dinosaur they created this one
23:54 over 40 years in dinosaur II you know
23:56 paleontology right but I think it's
23:59 interesting that someone tried to take
24:00 the spiritual realm your soul and give
24:03 it a tangible measurement that if
24:05 there's any flaw to the theory it would
24:07 be that that is the these are you know
24:09 apples and oranges the two things don't
24:11 actually exist in the same realm of
24:13 measurement if the soul were to have any
24:17 mass I would just simply theorize that
24:19 the energy that consumes well the energy
24:23 that is consumed to create a soul if
24:25 that's the case and I do not believe
24:26 that's the case it would be an ether
24:28 abased blocking all right ethers trying
24:31 to pass through the brain or the body
24:33 and the soul energies and they're
24:35 blocking the ether from passing through
24:37 your body which then creates a pushdown
24:40 collision and then your body has more
24:42 weight in a second that this soldier
24:44 aims out of your mortal coil and flies
24:46 off into the distance
24:48 okay the meat that more ether goes
24:50 through your body thus lightening the
24:52 load and you are lighter that's how I
24:57 would theorize it to occur if that was
24:59 indeed the case
25:00 we look at the entire idea of a soul and
25:03 I covered this in my soul episode let's
25:06 say you believed in a soul I believe in
25:08 a soul and not a Christian soul Islamic
25:12 soul or a Jewish soul just a soul some
25:16 sort of collection of we'll call it
25:18 energy okay I would call it soul energy
25:21 or spirit energy that is your unique
25:25 distinct identity in this universe it is
25:29 what makes you who you are versus
25:31 someone else
25:31 I think Hindus have put together a
25:34 pretty good case that attaches to all
25:35 the glands down your chakra down your
25:38 spine seems like a good place to attach
25:40 right attached into my toe that's a
25:44 little bit weird right obviously all my
25:46 cognitive thoughts and my version of
25:48 reality is loaded up inside my skull I
25:50 literally believe that I I mean I feel
25:53 myself living behind my head looking out
25:56 of this Malkovich apparatus I call my
25:59 body but now where would the soul attach
26:02 to the body that's there like the
26:05 million-dollar question is it merely
26:08 that it rides shotgun in space and time
26:10 it's not really attached to the body but
26:13 it has the ability to to send out a
26:17 radio wave to the cells in our double
26:20 helix on our protein patterns to tell it
26:24 what to do it's broadcasting a wireless
26:28 signal perhaps it seems to be pretty
26:32 attached to our body doesn't it because
26:33 you can get hit by a car
26:35 and not die or let's actually take that
26:39 out you being a drag race car that goes
26:41 from zero to 300 miles an hour within 10
26:44 feet there's something outrageous like
26:46 that and you don't lose your soul it's
26:48 not back there with the lights it's
26:51 continuing to go with the car could a
26:55 human body be moved so quickly through
26:57 space and time that you would leave your
26:59 soul behind I don't know doesn't seem
27:04 like gravity pushes on your soul so
27:07 maybe there's zero force on your soul so
27:09 there's no big deal you're just there
27:11 maybe moving through space and time
27:13 there's a complete illusion and it's
27:14 you'd never really move at all just the
27:17 stuff around you moves how many of you
27:21 have a degree in college took a bunch of
27:25 courses and these kind of conversations
27:28 absolutely positively never occurred one
27:31 time except when you were high as a kite
27:33 with your your dorm mates right your
27:37 fraternities and your sororities if
27:40 you're maybe if you're in a good night
27:41 one right it's some really good deep
27:43 conversations but outside of that to
27:46 society you ever talk about these kind
27:47 of things know who well there's two
27:50 reasons why the lowbrow reason why is
27:53 that it's embarrassing to think like
27:55 this right what are you thinking about
27:57 that kind of stuff forward that's silly
27:59 stuff don't you worry about your bills
28:01 and all your obligations and all the
28:03 negativity in the world isn't that what
28:05 you're focused on but they're probably
28:08 the more fundamental reason why we don't
28:10 have those conversations is we have
28:11 absolutely no vocabulary at all any time
28:15 someone who takes it in deep college or
28:18 they do get into metaphysical stuff they
28:19 start using words that are not as
28:21 accessible scientific words the Dan
28:25 Akroyd vocabulary to this whole problem
28:29 right you need any time you watch the
28:32 Ghostbusters episodes it's really he
28:34 talks about ectoplasmer and all this
28:36 other kind of stuff it's just brilliant
28:37 it's funny and hilarious but that is
28:40 sometimes the sort of dialogue you run
28:43 into when you get into the supernatural
28:45 well that cuts off the conversation
28:47 doesn't it
28:48 mr. big vocabulary is more worried about
28:51 his or her perceived IQ then really
28:56 getting down to the nitty-gritty
28:57 conversation there's a lot of homeless
28:59 people in the world that talked to
29:01 themselves right and we look at them and
29:03 we pity them talked about this a couple
29:05 of times but don't you ever wonder what
29:09 he talking to he's sitting outside with
29:12 no social interaction the medicine the
29:15 precursor to being able to see something
29:20 you didn't see before because you just
29:22 keep looking and looking and looking and
29:24 you're not moving we pre occupy
29:26 ourselves so the modern
29:28 don't we you get up you get out of bed
29:30 you get your shower you put all the
29:31 stuff on you get some breakfast go to
29:33 work your work work work you come home
29:34 take care of the kids get some more food
29:36 maybe go out to a nightclub maybe you go
29:38 get a dinner maybe you make sweet love
29:41 and then you go to bed and repeats over
29:43 and over if you're lucky but if you
29:45 didn't have a job but if you didn't have
29:47 any kids what if you barely could find
29:50 another soul that would talk to you and
29:52 you're just sitting there thinking I'm
29:55 thinking and looking would the mind get
29:59 so bored it would play tricks on it
30:01 itself that's what they always say right
30:03 cabin-fever people go crazy because they
30:07 start to manifest something there's been
30:09 Star Trek episode it's brilliant Star
30:11 Trek episodes about cabin fever or
30:14 someone has to put the whole crew to
30:16 sleep and there's a couple people
30:17 they're gonna stay awake for the whole
30:19 event I think one was enterprise where
30:23 the whole crew had to go to sleep but
30:27 Tuvok or no T'Pol the Vulcan chick she
30:32 was able to stay awake maybe was seven
30:35 of nine I can't remember a slew seven or
30:37 nine anyway it was someone who shouldn't
30:38 see me something shouldn't suffer from
30:40 cabin fever but they ended up
30:42 manifesting and creating characters that
30:44 were awake that weren't awake they were
30:46 still asleep by the way just as a kind
30:50 of report on something I had mentioned
30:55 in several episodes back can you
30:57 remember which one but this book that I
31:00 read that said that if you stay up
31:01 really really late like 36 hours plus
31:06 your left brain goes to sleep on its
31:10 normal cycle and your right brain takes
31:12 over the entire mind and I've been doing
31:15 so much traveling lately hence the delay
31:17 in the episodes that I was up and I
31:22 probably had like two hours of sleep to
31:24 go on my trip and then I went to the
31:26 location I'm going to and then I sucked
31:28 in this kind of it's a nice hotel but it
31:31 had some noise issues so that kept me up
31:34 all frickin night and the next day I was
31:38 sitting there starting to think of like
31:40 comedy things
31:41 gonna write I collect how many ideas for
31:45 film and I was just on a roll my
31:49 creative mind was going crazy and I was
31:52 sitting there going holy crap I'm in
31:53 that sweet zone I'm in that sweet zone
31:55 where my creativity is off the chain cuz
31:58 old lefty has gone to sleep mister
32:00 pragmatic bill pairs snoring in the next
32:03 room the reason I mentioned that is well
32:06 what part of your brain would probably
32:08 be more apt to do the most research and
32:11 a metaphysical world probably the right
32:14 brain right it's the creative one it's
32:17 the abstract one it welcomes abstract
32:19 data abstract time flow it doesn't care
32:23 it's like hey relax man don't worry
32:25 about all the rules let's just see what
32:28 we have in this dream of ours right then
32:31 there's another question the other
32:33 question is if the pineal gland is the
32:36 true touch point for the third eye as
32:39 the Egyptians believed big time right if
32:43 that is the case and there's plenty of
32:44 other cultures to believe the same thing
32:46 I love the Egyptian side of things what
32:49 part of the brain would process that
32:51 input probably the right brain probably
32:56 the right brain I'm willing to bet the
32:59 left brain gets a copy of the data as
33:01 well but the left brain starts comparing
33:03 it to accounting and says oh this
33:05 doesn't make this doesn't fall the rules
33:06 we know what tangible proof reality is
33:09 the hell is this [ __ ] coming in about a
33:11 ghost house don't exist and embarrass
33:15 yourself and the right brain is like hey
33:17 dude I know what to dress up for during
33:20 Mardi Gras next year now some of you may
33:23 recall or be yelling at the screen
33:26 saying but dude cameras have caught tons
33:29 of stuff and maybe you're right and
33:34 maybe you've been had by some hoaxes I
33:36 don't know the most common one I see out
33:40 there's two but one is more common than
33:42 the other is people who have passed on
33:46 showing up in photographs so they'll
33:48 take a Christmas photograph the year
33:51 after a child passes away in the family
33:53 or a grandparent or something or
33:55 someone and they will look at the the
33:58 film that they bought recently back in
34:00 the old thirty five-millimeter days and
34:02 I think it's potentially being claimed
34:04 in the digital room be much more
34:05 impressive in the digital realm but then
34:07 again things can be superimposed the
34:09 only way we can prove or have at least a
34:12 little bit of proof is to look back on
34:14 photographs of the person at the age
34:16 that they show up and the photograph
34:18 make sure no one has taken that
34:19 photograph in the past right but
34:22 obviously someone conducting and ho a
34:24 hoax would probably erase the original
34:26 right so there's that there is this idea
34:29 that they've caught spirits in
34:31 photographs there's a lot of little
34:35 videos around about you know so many of
34:37 them have been proven to be fake that
34:40 it's hard to give any of them validity
34:42 and it's a bummer that people fake this
34:44 stuff because then we don't know it's
34:46 like disinformation towards the idea
34:48 that maybe a camera could pick up some
34:51 apparition that is actually forming true
34:53 light in this world maybe plasma energy
34:55 or whatever right now I don't know I
34:58 cannot remember the name for this next
35:00 example some of you're gonna know its
35:01 name but there is a situation when you
35:04 take it doesn't really happen as much
35:06 anymore but the old cellphones and the
35:09 old digital cameras back in the day when
35:10 you take a photograph during a a night
35:13 with precipitation in the air some foggy
35:17 night some night that it's actually
35:19 raining but you're not in the rain they
35:23 would get these round dots in
35:25 photographs and it really looks like
35:28 water on the lens and the water has a
35:31 certain thickness and and diffusion and
35:36 so light bounces right through it and
35:38 refracts and you typically get because
35:40 it's a contact lens it's actually it's
35:43 it's focusing all the light like a radar
35:45 directly into the receiver in the camera
35:48 and so you get these bright spots on
35:49 there and you know they're a little
35:50 freckle II and that kind of thing
35:51 because the water again has different
35:53 levels of density as it creates a
35:54 raindrop big thing on the lens with the
35:57 cellphone camera it happens a lot
35:59 because we hold them up we put them down
36:01 we hold them up you might even splatter
36:03 some of our drink on it we might open up
36:05 some soda water now
36:06 to it and all the soda bubbles are
36:07 hitting the lens when you don't know it
36:09 and you take a photograph and I used to
36:11 have a friend of mine who you know she
36:14 would have one or two of these in her
36:15 photographs and she would always think
36:17 it was her brother who had passed okay
36:20 it warmed her heart so I'll let her have
36:22 that reality who maybe she's right I
36:25 don't know there were the shows on TV
36:27 like it was a John Edwards show right
36:29 there's a few of them but they getting
36:32 sort of this Town Square thing where
36:34 they call on spirits who have passed to
36:37 go through the medium of John Edwards to
36:40 then talk to their relatives I've talked
36:42 about this in the past it's been a
36:44 couple cases where it looked like some
36:46 pretty hard dudes were converted now
36:49 I've had friends that have gone to the
36:50 recording in that show they said the
36:52 show's recorded for like 12 hours
36:55 straight and there's a lot of misses and
36:57 so they cut together all the wins and
37:00 they make it look like the guy doesn't
37:02 have any mistakes whatsoever it's a lot
37:05 more mistakes than there is hits so you
37:07 have this cold reading gypsy reading
37:09 notion that well if you guess enough
37:10 you're going to come up with some stuff
37:12 when the guy hit back in the day it was
37:14 pretty damn convincing because the stuff
37:16 was like morbidly specific in a lot of
37:19 cases sometimes it was just very sad
37:22 okay but the idea is if we were to try
37:29 and parse this sort of reality and see
37:31 if there's anything there that's
37:32 probably the actual format we would want
37:35 to create the room the classroom the
37:39 Research Center would have to be people
37:41 that are probably not the guy who saw
37:45 Bigfoot in Close Encounters of the Third
37:47 Kind but people who are sort of you know
37:50 they're there too there are two parts
37:53 out of it they don't want to believe it
37:54 but they've had this one experience and
37:56 so they're like okay
37:57 I would never believe this in a million
37:59 years but this happened to me so I'm
38:01 interested tell me it's more like
38:03 Richard Dreyfuss and Close Encounters
38:05 the third guy he's like I would never
38:06 believe in UFOs but goddamn it I saw one
38:08 have you seen the side of my face it's
38:10 tan you know and so I don't know how you
38:13 set that up without attracting all the
38:16 people that have been
38:18 hundreds of these things perhaps the
38:20 ones that have seen a ton we simply
38:23 divide them up into groups and we say if
38:25 you've seen one you go in this group
38:26 you've seen them your whole life you go
38:29 in that group if you're uncertain you go
38:33 in this third group till you find out
38:35 what group you're in but now who
38:37 controls the experiment is everyone
38:39 involved subjectively involved probably
38:43 not we want to have a control group that
38:46 actually observes the group that isn't
38:48 making these claims and they're playing
38:49 devil's advocate maybe not directly to
38:51 the people to take this this the wind
38:54 out of their sails are to make them feel
38:55 ridiculed for admitting things right but
38:59 in through some glass window or you know
39:01 whatever they're embedded in the group
39:03 and they keep quiet or they have a
39:06 fictitious situation or not everyone's
39:11 forced to speak right those who want to
39:13 go up to the mic and give their you give
39:15 their testimony they do but we need to
39:18 have a discipline by which we break it
39:20 down
39:20 where were you how old were you have you
39:23 seen any movies like that have you any
39:26 books like that before this occurred
39:28 what are your favorite movies did anyone
39:31 your family say this was going to occur
39:33 to you did anyone tell you in their life
39:34 that this is going to happen to you what
39:36 happened to them did you ever feel truly
39:39 jealous that it hadn't happened to you
39:41 and so you were looking for that moment
39:43 when it was going to occur to you see
39:46 how that works you start parsing the
39:49 situation to the point where you can
39:50 maybe get down to the metaphysics of
39:52 what might be driving someone to see
39:55 this sort of stuff and when you come up
39:58 with a beautiful case where they're
40:01 passing the polygraph test
40:02 they haven't had any previous experience
40:04 they didn't really enjoy what they saw
40:06 you've checked up their medical records
40:09 their psychiatric history and there's
40:10 just as level as a playing field right
40:13 what's a word analogy
40:16 they are your candidates they are the
40:20 ones that you really want to start
40:22 leaning on to figure out what might have
40:23 occurred once we have a bunch of results
40:27 then we start to see if there's any
40:28 similarities between the occurrences
40:31 perhaps there's different species of
40:32 occurrences so people see apparitional
40:35 ghosts that may walk around you know I
40:38 guess I've had one other experience I've
40:40 mentioned on the show that some of you
40:41 may be true autists you're like yeah but
40:44 you said you had this other experience
40:45 what about that for those of you are new
40:48 here so here goes again this house right
40:52 here hasn't had this problem in a really
40:54 long time but there was a time when both
40:58 my girlfriend and I who because we had
41:01 different schedules I wouldn't wake her
41:02 up after she went to bed I sleep in the
41:04 guest bedroom we would feel things
41:08 pushing on the bed most the time like a
41:12 like a cat sort of over by the head and
41:16 you you feel the pillow go down the
41:19 neighboring pillow you'd feel the
41:20 mattress go down just ever so slightly
41:22 like if like a adult cat walking towards
41:26 your head it's really strange I'm
41:29 allergic to get so I wouldn't I don't
41:32 have any you know super I don't sit
41:34 around dreaming about them so it's just
41:37 a weird thing for me and a cat so
41:39 strange she used to have a cappuccino
41:41 cat in 20 years all right
41:44 maybe even longer but then there was a
41:46 second version of it that was more
41:49 profound and it was as if someone was
41:52 sitting on the bed this was pretty
41:55 intense
41:55 like like a weight of probably a hundred
41:59 pound person which is a small person
42:03 right but I would be last time I felt
42:06 that I had come home and laid in bed and
42:10 it was sort of a warm summer night the
42:14 room was warm and so you know you leave
42:16 your body half exposed because you're
42:17 it's too hard to put too hot to put the
42:19 sheets on you and so my butt was sort of
42:22 it's probably like four inches onto the
42:24 bed and I kid you not it felt like
42:29 someone was sitting on the mattress just
42:32 behind my butt and it was going down and
42:36 my mind just was like absolutely
42:38 freaking out someone was in the room and
42:41 sat down next to me and me it startled
42:44 me
42:45 and I just that barely ever happens in
42:46 my entire lifetime right so here's
42:49 what's weird so that happened to me and
42:52 my girlfriend actually moved out into
42:55 her own place at one point and she said
42:58 it was still occurring at her new place
43:00 the cat thing just weird and then we
43:06 have a mutual acquaintance that lived in
43:09 Paris for a year or two at least lived
43:13 in this one place she had bought this
43:15 penthouse or I know his condo over there
43:18 and she was warned that the place was
43:20 haunted and of course she's from America
43:22 Shelley she was from New York or
43:24 something and she was just blowing it
43:27 off the whole time and she said when she
43:30 came into her where she was unpacking on
43:34 one of the first days she came into the
43:36 bedroom and looked down at the mattress
43:38 and according to her she saw two butt
43:42 cheeks look feminine to her sitting on
43:45 the mattress like broad daylight
43:47 indentation on the mattress absolutely
43:50 positively freak this chick out and she
43:54 had the very analytical mind she has a
43:56 very analytical mind she's not a person
43:58 who's ever seen anything in her life it
44:01 was very startling to her but she was
44:03 like tough and she's professional so
44:05 she's blowing it off she's like I'm not
44:07 gonna let this get to me that I don't
44:08 know what the hell that was and it
44:10 disappeared I think right in front of
44:12 her face and that was weird so after a
44:15 year of living there this these kind of
44:19 disturbances and especially the mattress
44:21 pushing thing was a big thing that
44:22 occurred and this is her new this is her
44:25 bed that she brought to this location
44:27 it's on some furnished apartment right
44:29 so after about a year she sold the place
44:32 to this gentleman and then about half a
44:38 year later or so as the story goes she
44:40 met the guy at a party and she's like
44:43 you're the guy that bought the house for
44:45 me he goes no I don't live there anymore
44:47 and they had a conversation that I'm
44:51 gonna paraphrase because it's been a
44:53 while since I've heard this but
44:55 essentially the dudes looked at her and
44:57 said
44:58 you know that you knew that [ __ ]
45:00 place was haunted when you sold them to
45:01 me didn't you and she was like I didn't
45:05 want to say because I thought it was
45:06 just me going crazy he's like oh yeah
45:08 because I got tired of all that stuff
45:11 going on and I think that the key word
45:14 between them as they ended the
45:16 conversation was the mattress thing yeah
45:20 I'm done with that freaked him out he
45:24 was not a strong willed man to stay in
45:26 there a year like she was right very
45:28 interesting so you have two people who
45:32 were very countered to these sorts of
45:34 experiences you could tell they weren't
45:36 people that were like oh yeah and I saw
45:38 tons of ghosts before I moved there and
45:39 they just follow me around I'm just I'm
45:41 just a haunted person right it's these
45:44 little stories from these people that
45:47 really gains a lot of credibility with
45:49 me because they're they're sort of
45:52 counterculture to the metaphysical
45:55 supernatural world and yet something was
45:57 so consistent in this location in Paris
46:01 that two people two professional people
46:04 who had so much on their mind that
46:06 seeing this kind of stuff was was not
46:09 going to be a meditation thing right
46:13 though I sat there and meditated in the
46:15 lotus position on my bed you know and
46:19 then I woke up and saw it there it
46:21 wasn't like that at all
46:23 so on one level any of you out there
46:25 that have had that sort of experience
46:27 but you're the anti culture person to
46:31 actually have seen this multiple times
46:35 or you've only had one or two
46:36 experiences I want to hear from you guys
46:38 big time in the comment section right
46:41 but the other thing I'm interested in is
46:44 if I've kicked off any theories in your
46:45 mind for how we could isolate the
46:48 unprovable to each other please say so
46:52 in the comments as well now the other
46:54 interesting thing is that we have pets
46:56 that have been filmed several times it's
47:01 sort of like the pet the dog in
47:03 poltergeist from 1982 where the dog is
47:08 seeing something in the room it's
47:09 in the wall over the master bedroom bed
47:12 and barking at it now that's a fictional
47:15 movie of course but there's all these
47:16 videos that were it looks like animals
47:18 are seeing something that the humans
47:20 aren't seeing now in some cases
47:21 obviously could be an insect that we're
47:23 not seeing or whatever no if you give
47:26 your cat catnip or something like that
47:28 then of course they're gonna be trippin
47:29 balls and that doesn't count but it
47:33 looks like a lot of animals see things
47:35 that you know we don't see what would be
47:40 the difference between an animal and a
47:41 human being in regards to seeing things
47:45 well they haven't been indoctrinated
47:49 have they may be domesticated animals a
47:52 little bit but no one's saying and we
47:56 don't speak English to animals and they
47:59 completely understand all the words that
48:01 we say of course they learn little
48:02 command phrases go get that come back
48:04 here did you do that you know I mean
48:06 they hear your tone of voice and they
48:07 can read your soul I think but a dog and
48:10 a cat and a deer and an antelope and all
48:13 these things you know maybe they can see
48:17 more maybe some animals can see a lot
48:20 and some see very little don't know but
48:25 I think that's another interesting
48:26 Avenue there as I mentioned before on
48:29 other episodes as you go back in time
48:31 why is it the man is so spiritual the
48:35 day of the dead in South America the
48:39 temples and Japanese homes that worship
48:42 those who have passed I keep thinking
48:46 it's not just a fictitious thing that is
48:49 created by Japanese people to simply
48:53 have something to soothe their own soul
48:54 it seems to me that prior to losing that
48:57 vision of being able to see the
48:59 afterlife maybe they could see it back
49:02 in the past and now they can't see it
49:04 anymore but the tradition is there and
49:06 the faith and of it genetically is still
49:09 in the soul right the goal here is to
49:13 open up a frontier a brand new frontier
49:16 for the human mind I try to open as many
49:19 as I can on this particular show because
49:21 after you've done a lot in life
49:23 or you've gotten to a certain age in
49:24 life life becomes a pattern you know it
49:27 doesn't matter where you are in the
49:28 world what you did for a living how many
49:31 family members you have friends yeah but
49:32 it becomes a pattern and we're always
49:36 searching for new avenues where it is
49:39 sort of infinite for exploration you
49:43 know I haven't had any I haven't had a
49:45 lot of you come in recently I did have
49:47 one probably last six months but there's
49:49 the common question about what do you
49:51 think about the afterlife and it's
49:55 usually one of these things that that no
49:56 one pays attention to until they lose
49:58 someone and then it's right there in
50:00 their face their question of what the
50:03 afterlife might be the imperative to
50:07 decide whether or not exists usually
50:09 launches itself into the human mind once
50:11 someone passes away I need to make a
50:13 decision where do I think this person
50:15 went do I think I really lost them
50:17 forever
50:18 or I do I think I'm gonna see them again
50:19 at some point in the future hmm well now
50:24 let me give you a fictional scenario
50:25 that we would probably all delight in if
50:28 it actually occurred you're in college
50:32 you're between the age of 18 and 28 and
50:37 you lose a friend or relative of some
50:40 sort but in your cool new College in the
50:43 near future there's a whole wing a whole
50:47 degree that you can get that turns into
50:49 a payable job researching this about the
50:53 metaphysical afterlife it's just a
50:56 matter of enrolling in the classes and
50:59 now you get in there and there's a
51:02 discipline you start learning techniques
51:05 that other people have pioneered just
51:07 before you got there maybe it's only a
51:09 20 year class 20 year old class the 20
51:11 year old discipline sure it reaches back
51:15 as far as recorded history to
51:17 cannibalise every single theory of the
51:19 afterlife ones that have been turned
51:22 into religions ones that have been just
51:25 belief systems over the years they've
51:29 already correlated and and organized
51:33 into groups
51:35 various experiences for various types of
51:37 deaths and various types of interactions
51:40 but you bring your whole bag of tricks
51:43 and there's always something in your bag
51:45 most likely that no one else is recorded
51:49 so you're add your data to the database
51:51 it goes worldwide it gets translated
51:54 into every single language so everyone
51:56 else can see what you experienced and
51:57 then man goes from fearing death as an
52:01 imperative pseudo-intellectual exercise
52:04 and self-realization and it goes into
52:09 this comfort zone of well you know what
52:12 we have we have enough evidence to prove
52:14 that there's an afterlife we just simply
52:16 don't know exactly what it is where it
52:18 is and how it works but at least we're
52:21 making progress we're having first of
52:23 all the conversation second of all we
52:26 have a vocabulary that we can use that
52:28 normal people can understand okay it's
52:31 not Latin words or a bunch of crazy crap
52:33 and so you can dialogue about it maybe
52:37 you go in and you get freaked out you
52:39 get so freaked out that you need to take
52:42 a break you pull back it's too much too
52:44 soon so but you know you did hear a few
52:47 things it gave you a framework to think
52:48 about it and see you reintroduce
52:51 yourself into the conversation as soon
52:52 as you can there's at least one listener
52:55 out there that lost her father I don't
52:58 know if she listens anymore but we had a
53:01 telephone call once we had a few few
53:04 phone calls actually and there was a
53:07 situation where she truly believed in
53:10 her spirit of spirits and her heart of
53:12 hearts that her father went to an
53:15 afterlife and and still participated in
53:18 her life in some intuition way you know
53:21 in a wave of love all the above right
53:23 but she was sort of scared to have the
53:26 conversation it seemed to me on the
53:28 telephone until we met and then I said
53:31 well hey I think that's completely real
53:34 and let me give you some examples of why
53:36 I think it's real and how it actually
53:38 occurs to us and I shared my opinion of
53:41 my experiences in this and I felt this
53:45 what I what I think I recognized as a
53:48 huge
53:49 epiphany of relief that was okay for her
53:53 to have this conversation with someone
53:55 no one was gonna judge her
53:57 matter of fact quite the opposite she
53:59 was gonna have a productive dialogue
54:01 about oh my god
54:03 I think you're right I think my father
54:05 who died too soon
54:06 he died much earlier than he should have
54:08 of course he's still hanging out with me
54:10 he wasn't finished being my father and
54:13 so I need guidance from time to time and
54:16 now my gut instinct is very specific as
54:19 before it may have been a little more
54:21 figurative but now it's very specific
54:24 the Chinese like I always say they
54:26 always say what's your gut tell you
54:27 you're thinking about this thing what's
54:29 your gut tell you maybe that's a cosmic
54:32 wave of intuition from those who have
54:34 lived who know you really well and go
54:36 well I know he or she would want this to
54:39 happen in their life so even though
54:40 they're very excited about that
54:42 experience that's going to lead down a
54:43 path that I don't think they want to go
54:45 down just based on everything that I've
54:47 seen them desire in this world and
54:49 especially the things that I've seen
54:50 them criticize in this world things that
54:52 they never want to experience again
54:54 that most people would agree that no one
54:57 should experience those things again you
54:59 know some people don't want to
54:59 experience pain but it's exactly what
55:02 they need you know it's like they play a
55:05 guitar and it hurts their hands and they
55:07 get bored but you do know they really
55:09 want to be a guitar players so you keep
55:11 pushing them the gut instinct is go go
55:13 go go go if it's hard that just means
55:15 that's where you need to practice keep
55:17 going
55:17 you know something like that we worry
55:20 about things like population control in
55:22 this planet because in our world we have
55:24 a physical limitation of the geography
55:25 that we can inhabit safely right how
55:29 much how many resources can we harvest
55:32 to feed everyone right now those who
55:35 produce shitty food always want to tell
55:36 you that they had to do it because
55:37 otherwise everyone would starve to death
55:39 [ __ ] okay that's just a [ __ ] lie
55:42 so they can sell you a GMO gut rotting
55:44 stuff so you have to drink tons of
55:46 probiotics to repair your belly right
55:49 all lies but now imagine we had so many
55:53 billion people on this planet to
55:56 physically occupy the planet
55:58 but then we had maybe a near infinite
56:04 supply of people that have lived and
56:06 died either on this planet there are
56:09 other planets perhaps they never took
56:11 form in the physical
56:13 they've always been spiritual they like
56:15 the spiritual side but now we have
56:17 access to their wisdom their creativity
56:20 the arts of the world would explode
56:22 wouldn't they how many great musical
56:25 pieces would come out once the spirits
56:28 remind us that you don't have to [ __ ]
56:29 auto-tune the human voice dear the most
56:31 beautiful sound that could be made in
56:33 this planet right the human voice is the
56:36 most beautiful thing to run it through a
56:38 mechanical device to screw with it it's
56:40 sort of an insult to our entire genetic
56:42 pattern isn't it
56:43 we are controlled by bankers that want
56:45 us to use oil based money alright that's
56:48 a problem that needs to be fixed
56:50 we have food that gives us cancer we
56:52 have probably electronics that gives us
56:54 cancer all this other [ __ ] stress
56:55 whatever it is and the gods out there go
56:59 or the spirits God's to us they simply
57:04 say ok that stuff stop doing that right
57:08 and if you want to really get rid of
57:09 this problem do this do that beer at
57:12 this time push the red button comb your
57:14 hair
57:15 snort your nose whatever it needs to and
57:18 ever needs to happen happens and things
57:22 start resolving themselves they're not
57:24 living your life for you right you still
57:26 have to do all the hard work what if
57:28 they said you got to climb Mount Everest
57:30 some 400-pound person's got to climb
57:32 Mount Everest and all the problems are
57:34 gonna go away someone's telling them
57:36 that because the whole world's getting
57:37 good information for a bunch of
57:39 different sources they're like you know
57:40 I guess I got to lose 300 pounds 250
57:44 pounds so that I can make the trek I've
57:46 got to increase the efficiency of my
57:49 lungs I've got to workout and a gym so I
57:52 can handle it I got to practice at base
57:54 camps and also there's stuff because I'm
57:55 gonna get to the top of that mountain
57:57 this could be an analogy of course and
57:59 solve my problem which begs a another
58:03 topic that could be an episode all by
58:05 itself but let me end with this one of
58:09 the big questions about the afterlife
58:10 and all of this sensor
58:13 conversation about the metaphysical
58:16 world really comes down to one sort of
58:21 question which is what do you hope to
58:22 gain from all this new knowledge I guess
58:25 I would ask myself the question right
58:27 part of it would be truth with a capital
58:29 T right everybody wants that you know do
58:34 I want to know what's gonna happen in my
58:36 future
58:36 not really I like that to be a mystery
58:39 but you know what's the big lie that I'm
58:41 living what have I been told it's not
58:44 true that's kind of information I'd like
58:46 to know but now what if God showed up
58:50 and said stop doing that
58:55 you know I'm not telling you because
58:57 it's a rule and I'm gonna punish you for
58:59 doing it yeah it's up to you man you
59:01 want to know what hell as hell is doing
59:03 that over and over and destroying your
59:04 life can you see how it destroys your
59:06 life maybe it's an alcoholic maybe it's
59:08 a drug addicted person maybe it's
59:11 someone with any addiction of any kind
59:13 porn gambling anything they're like but
59:18 I want to and God says well I'm gonna
59:21 leave it up to you because I made a
59:23 universe of choice but I'm telling you
59:25 that's the thing that is robbing you of
59:27 all the destiny that you wish you would
59:29 have when you were a little kid and so
59:32 you think about it I met God
59:35 I met the real God okay and he or she it
59:38 told me this is the nemesis to my future
59:42 to my happiness and I know I'm not happy
59:46 would you suddenly stop because God said
59:51 so I mean maybe if God said okay let me
59:54 let me give you a peak it you know hell
59:56 and brimstone okay see this here see
59:58 this is hell see the person's being
60:00 tortured constantly that's what you're
60:01 gonna go if you keep doing this the old
60:03 Christian methodology maybe you would do
60:08 it for that arbitrary reason but then
60:09 you would be doing it for not for
60:11 yourself in terms of happiness you'd do
60:13 it to avoid hell some horrible place
60:18 it's not the right reason you want to do
60:22 it because you want yourself to live the
60:25 best life that you can
60:26 live right in all the cases of
60:29 everything I've ever experienced and
60:31 there's another experience I won't even
60:33 go through which is a hallway experience
60:34 you can hear in other episodes I was
60:37 happy I was very content and very happy
60:41 sometimes I was making a tremendous
60:43 amount of money and that was happy
60:45 probably because of that and the luxury
60:47 that that provided but there was other
60:48 times I was broke as a joke and happy
60:50 and these things happen to me when I saw
60:54 a waltz I was very very successful with
60:58 my video game company it was booming
61:00 making tremendous amounts of money for
61:02 everybody so that was the precursor to
61:05 that experience maybe that loosened me
61:07 up maybe when we're in some turmoil we
61:10 lock up and we don't see things I don't
61:12 know this is part of our protocol that
61:16 we'd have to figure out to figure out
61:19 what's true and what's false were you
61:21 under distress were you happy how much
61:26 money were you making at the time we're
61:28 in a successful relationship etc etc
61:32 it's food for thought right it makes you
61:36 think doesn't it my utter fantasy for
61:40 the near future five to ten years from
61:42 now is that we cleaned up the world back
61:44 to the 70s not the Cold War 70s but then
61:48 the cool disco you know Grandmaster
61:52 Flash 70s and then the 80s you know a
61:54 new version of it complete a new version
61:56 but a peaceful world where the problems
62:00 that we have we understand we know we
62:02 need to do to fix them we understand the
62:05 difference between things that are just
62:06 the human condition and things that are
62:08 imposed on us by others who believe that
62:10 they are higher than us we extinguish
62:12 the species of human beings that are
62:15 greedy who managed to get control over
62:17 us we we literally re throw societies
62:21 such that that can't happen again it
62:23 sticks out like a sore thumb
62:24 the black sheep is the the banker not
62:30 that we want to be sheep but you know
62:32 what I mean I want to see universities
62:34 reborn completely reborn from the bottom
62:37 up
62:39 I want to see a university that is
62:41 qualified to take a loan from the
62:43 government and give it to a student to
62:45 pay with interest I want to see them
62:48 prove that whatever they're taking your
62:51 money for is employable it's okay if you
62:54 get a degree that's unemployable but at
62:56 least when you signed up for that degree
62:57 you know it was unemployable maybe the
62:59 challenge is to make money off a degree
63:01 that's been deemed absolutely
63:02 unemployable but I want to see the
63:06 physical scientists science Sciences of
63:08 the world but into more theoretical
63:11 sciences where it's okay not to know
63:13 what exactly the solution because you're
63:16 going for it I want to see the
63:18 metaphysical world be explored I want to
63:21 see us understand that the human body is
63:22 probably a symbiotic thing that is way
63:25 beyond just bacteria inside the human
63:27 body
63:28 there are spiritual realities I want to
63:32 see history reinterpreted as a literal
63:35 definition of the times that these
63:37 people lived in when you see all the
63:39 Pharaohs of Egypt worshipping you know
63:43 animal headed human beings at a time
63:47 when they could render anything that
63:48 they wanted to with art they could paint
63:50 anything they could sculpt anything and
63:52 they chose to render cartoons to us
63:56 maybe those things were real maybe
63:59 that's what the creators of the world
64:01 look like this world
64:03 maybe not God the one definitive
64:05 intelligence of the universe but the
64:08 species it's over us that made this
64:09 place maybe there's a horse you know
64:12 maybe there is an Anubis it's just a
64:15 different shaped head that's all I want
64:18 to see any type of intellectual
64:20 exploration that is serious be tolerated
64:24 as serious be funded researched books
64:29 written on it I mean imagine going to a
64:31 bookstore in the world that I am
64:33 describing and not only do you have your
64:36 fictional sections that have all the the
64:38 heartthrob novels and the you know Lord
64:41 of the Rings kind of fantasy stuff from
64:43 brilliant minds but we have instead of
64:46 having two little columns in your
64:48 bookstore that's the New Age stuff it's
64:50 a
64:51 I've debt and scoff dad there's a whole
64:53 half of the store there's all
64:55 theoretical sciences and exploration of
64:58 what it is to be human and it's the most
65:01 popular section new books coming out all
65:04 the time
65:05 we're dragging these things home and
65:07 plowing through them and passing them
65:09 off to our friends and plow into the
65:11 next book and we're just having our
65:14 minds expanded by each other now
65:16 obviously there's an internet version of
65:17 that there's a digital version of that
65:18 however you publish it I don't care
65:21 YouTube videos have become absolutely
65:24 fascinating to all of us who marathon
65:26 through them because you have wild ass
65:30 theories like no forest on Flat Earth
65:33 Hey
65:34 as you know I covered that I think it's
65:37 bunk but I'm so glad the dude went
65:39 through the theory it's a great way to
65:42 for me to extinguish that theory in my
65:45 mind but also expand my mind ago yeah
65:48 that is interesting you know maybe all
65:50 this petrified wood was old silicon
65:52 trees you know what if all of reality
65:55 was nothing but a metaphor everything
65:59 why does numerology work for some people
66:01 because it is the sort of mathematical
66:04 metaphor and link between realities who
66:09 knows right I think that sells
66:11 fascinating not my cup of tea but
66:14 whatever as long as it makes people
66:17 think they're going to expand their mind
66:19 and find other things that are probably
66:21 more tangible in whatever metaphysical
66:24 or physical way that makes them a more
66:27 interesting person and eventually 20 30
66:30 years down the line they stumble on to
66:31 the next era of human development in a
66:35 way that everyone can recall are sorry
66:39 reproduce the experiment and we all see
66:42 the results are like oh my god you
66:43 realize if you do this this this while
66:45 Disney walks out of your television cool
66:48 right I think you feel me
66:50 if you have them into deep thoughts
66:52 radio.com please kill there's video
66:54 audio a locked Facebook group and a
66:56 patreon page for those of you who
66:57 support me on page you're out and super
66:58 appreciate it most of the videos on
67:01 YouTube are monetized I do
67:03 attempt to run any pre-roll ads so if
67:05 there is a video out there with the
67:06 pre-roll ad it is merely something has
67:09 been turned on on my behalf that I'm
67:11 unaware of I just run little banner ads
67:13 the average income per month is 16
67:16 dollars from from YouTube so I'm pretty
67:21 sure the YouTube channel is shadow
67:24 banned because of the topics I'm just
67:27 thankful that they leave me alone after
67:28 that one of the things you can do to
67:31 test if I'm shadow banned is to get on a
67:33 computer that's absolutely never seen
67:35 deep thoughts no one's ever been to a
67:37 video of ours and then look up moon hoax
67:40 which has quite a few hits but look up
67:43 things if you search on deep thoughts
67:45 you'll probably find it but it's really
67:46 the keywords that are the most powerful
67:51 ones so for instance if you see if you
67:53 search on moon hoax for instance and you
67:55 see a video that only has a thousand
67:58 views but you scroll four or five pages
68:00 down and you don't see the one that I
68:02 did that's got 15,000 views that's a
68:04 pretty good sign that one of more
68:06 interest is not topping one of less
68:08 interest of course there is release
68:10 dates that get involved in that too when
68:12 you search you should find the most
68:13 relevant to your search terms first and
68:15 less relevant down below anyway
68:19 something to check something to report
68:21 back on the LOC Facebook group or in the
68:23 comments section anyhow that's it for
68:26 tonight take care of yourself and
68:27 someone else and I'll see in the next
68:28 deep thoughts over now
