00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 good evening ladies and gentlemen
00:36 welcome back to deep thoughts you know I
00:41 don't say it as often as other YouTube
00:43 channel owners but I do appreciate you
00:46 very much it's sort of a crazy thing to
00:50 have this organic moment my life for the
00:53 show comes out of the the entire
00:57 endeavor right sorry I'm running out of
01:00 fuel here it's gonna have a little
01:02 private moment between the two of us
01:04 here no you know shows like this they
01:07 don't exist without listeners period
01:10 I just don't well I think it's kind of
01:13 funny is if you get the show the funny
01:17 part is is that those who don't get it
01:20 you know they see a dude sitting in the
01:21 backyard smoking cigars and black and
01:26 white which is so not techie right even
01:30 though it takes tech to make it happen
01:32 and when you get it's all about thinking
01:34 and sharing ideas and having your brain
01:38 massaged by a mental masseuse that there
01:44 is no real bias when it really comes
01:46 down to it I have my opinions you have
01:48 your opinions but in the end it's just a
01:51 big deep thought that we're both having
01:53 and those that just walk by and go
01:58 what's this guy doing it sitting in his
02:00 backyard just sucks
02:03 and they move on it's beautiful
02:08 we weed out by design right and for
02:12 those of you who watch the show I know
02:16 that you guys look in the background
02:17 right and I noticed my little power
02:24 strip here by little power block in the
02:26 back here my plug-in strip is right
02:28 there it's not a strip it's like the two
02:29 outlets I use the white one power is the
02:32 camera and this orange one again it's in
02:35 black and white so enjoy that power is a
02:38 computer and I have sprinkler heads that
02:41 are very close to it so I kept getting a
02:43 short and the the power outlet so
02:47 I wrapped it up in a little sandwich bag
02:51 and now I no longer have that issue boy
02:53 this is how things turn into white-trash
02:55 things right and why trash well it's
03:00 it's near the subject we're gonna talk
03:02 about my trash is obviously an
03:07 unfortunate anomaly that occurs near
03:10 where we're going to talk about I had
03:15 mentioned over and over and over small
03:18 town I'm from a small town that's why I
03:20 have the perspective that I have I did a
03:25 episode that I actually really like it's
03:27 about playground wisdom which is a
03:32 little bit like this one to be similar
03:36 but this is gonna be about growing up in
03:39 a small town versus spending time in the
03:42 city and what are the benefits of the
03:45 two what are the drawbacks of the two
03:49 because this is huge
03:52 coming from the Midwest and moving to
03:55 the coastal region of California I was
03:59 constantly presented with people saying
04:04 oh you know you're a good guy cuz you're
04:07 from the Midwest you tell the truth
04:09 because your friend the Midwest and I'm
04:12 sitting there going why does that what
04:14 does it have to do with anything doesn't
04:16 everyone want to tell the truth doesn't
04:18 everyone want to be a good person and
04:20 the truth is no depends on what
04:25 environment you grow up in as to whether
04:26 or not that even works at all so I you
04:31 know technically I was born in Europe
04:33 and I don't remember any of that crap so
04:35 by the time my memory really started
04:38 truly manufacturing linear time I was in
04:43 Kansas grew up in a teeny town and named
04:48 after a pilot a land surveyor octave
04:52 Chanute in the mid 1800s my town had
04:56 three names
04:58 she noot Tioga and new Chicago
05:03 can't even imagine if we were gonna call
05:05 ourselves new Chicago would probably
05:06 changed the landscape of it but they
05:10 settled on Chanute because he again
05:12 surveyed the land by air that determined
05:16 where they were gonna build this
05:17 Township now I don't know exactly how he
05:19 did that because flights hadn't been
05:21 discovered yet okay now again my
05:24 hometown they say that he actually
05:25 discovered it before the Wright brothers
05:27 but it's the way that the Wright
05:28 brothers discovered that gives them the
05:30 special alkylate he definitely mentored
05:33 them so a township is a six mile square
05:38 that's what a township is and so that's
05:42 what my town is it was a town ship
05:45 called town for short it's based on the
05:49 Santa Fe Railroad came through the
05:52 Midwest now the Santa Fe Railroad runs
05:54 everywhere but we have a we had a fairly
05:57 small train station that then was double
06:00 wydad it's all made of brick it's
06:02 gorgeous
06:03 and it still runs through there but it
06:07 doesn't as far as I know there's not a
06:09 lot of stopping anymore they used to
06:11 have you know Depot's in town where
06:15 they'd stop and reverse and wind up I
06:17 don't know if they do that anymore the
06:19 buildings that were associated with that
06:20 have long fallen down the train station
06:25 is now a safari museum and I believe a
06:27 library but my whole life I have felt
06:30 this beautiful benefit of having grown
06:32 up in a home in a little tiny town and
06:34 then the benefits and alkyl aids of
06:36 growing going to the big city after
06:38 having gone to a small town but it's
06:40 been tough for me perhaps through the
06:44 sheer lack of analyzing the situation
06:46 and the facts to figure out why why was
06:51 it better in a small town you know now I
06:54 have said a thousand things in the 350
06:57 episodes that I've recorded about why
06:59 but we're going to get before the
07:03 advanced concepts we're going to talk
07:05 about the basic concepts of why
07:06 hometowns are great now I want you to
07:09 keep in the back of your mind and again
07:12 if you're European I apologize or you're
07:14 not American we have the electoral
07:16 college
07:17 year I'm sure there's some form of that
07:19 everywhere in the planet but there's
07:22 this push to get rid of the electoral
07:24 college and what that allows what that
07:29 would allow to have happen is that your
07:32 your elitists right the place where you
07:36 get concentrated paedophilia
07:37 concentrated kidnapping and rape and
07:40 crime would be the mindset of human
07:43 beings that would dominate the vote to
07:46 give America its cultural roots and
07:50 sustainability the beautiful thing about
07:53 the electoral college is that it allows
07:56 obviously less densely populated mid
07:58 Midwest regions to contribute something
08:02 that is coveted and amazing because they
08:05 live a much more balanced life in the
08:08 Midwest they're slower they don't
08:10 prioritize money and they're just all
08:13 about the human condition right you know
08:16 more people in the Midwest you interact
08:17 more in the Midwest in the big city and
08:19 know less people and therefore you can
08:21 become perverted and perverse and
08:22 strange right that is the wood Midwest
08:27 have it's weirdos of course of course
08:29 but be careful what you you know seeing
08:32 movies versus what is real so many times
08:37 I hear people talk about you know not
08:40 quite the deplorable statement cuz no
08:42 one likes that statement but you know
08:43 back up and ask backwards bla bla bla
08:46 I saw deliverance I saw carnival I saw
08:49 various series on TVs that portrayed all
08:51 these people like bumpkins to play the
08:54 Dueling Banjos as a birthday song that's
08:57 not the case okay yes you can find weird
09:01 places like that but that's rare okay
09:06 but the main thing about the electoral
09:10 college is to preserve the sensibilities
09:12 that aren't so hastily renewed and you
09:16 know burned out of existence that the
09:18 west coast does and the east coast does
09:20 the west coast and east coast have a
09:22 cultural burden and that they're
09:24 supposed to invent the next thing the
09:26 next music the next fashion the next
09:28 everything
09:30 and because they're renewing very
09:33 quickly the problem is they can renew
09:35 badly now they'll get themselves out
09:38 within ten years even if they make a bad
09:40 mistake it pick a bad form of music but
09:42 they go balls in with all of their money
09:44 and it's going to be there for 10 years
09:46 the Midwest hangs on to the best of the
09:51 best and only changes if there needs to
09:54 be a change meaning it doesn't work
09:56 anymore so then they change you know
09:58 it's not broke don't fix it kind of
10:01 thing right that's their idea but I'm
10:04 gonna go back to birth okay let's
10:07 pretend I was born there got there about
10:09 two and a half three years old I
10:11 remember my first memory I remember
10:12 being three in the snow now what is the
10:18 average psyche of a kid a little kid boy
10:22 girl doesn't matter they only think
10:27 reality is as big as the room that
10:29 they're in when you take them outside a
10:32 child has an amazing experience where
10:34 they feel finite get a lot begger a
10:39 child could look at the stars and have
10:41 no clue what infinity is until a child
10:44 learns how to count and really goes off
10:49 on our whim tries to count as high as
10:50 they possibly can do they realize what
10:52 infinity might even conceptually be and
10:57 because of this natural growth pattern
11:00 where a child will think that if it
11:02 rains outside it rains everywhere we
11:04 talked to Grandma
11:05 a thousand miles away hi grandma it's
11:08 raining what do you think about that and
11:09 grandma's like any rain in here what do
11:11 you mean it's not raining here and they
11:12 learned this concept of two different
11:14 locations I was lucky that both my
11:17 grandparents plus all their aunts and
11:19 uncles lived in the same town my parents
11:22 lived in the same town my high school
11:27 you know my father my mother my aunt's
11:30 my uncles and my grandmother went to the
11:32 same high school I went to awesome
11:35 swimming pool but I went and became a
11:38 lifeguard at the swimming pool well my
11:39 whole family had been lifeguards that
11:42 okay but the beautiful thing about a
11:45 Township is that one a six mile square
11:49 is fairly easy to memorize and very
11:53 seldom in the midwest region where I am
11:56 from does the full six miles get fully
11:59 occupied there's at least a good 20 to
12:02 30 percent that is filled or a big
12:05 college or someone just has a warehouse
12:08 on a big plot of land someone was just
12:11 completely undeveloped it's got a
12:13 highway going through it or something
12:14 and so imagine you are trying to gain
12:18 paradigm and faculties to take in life
12:22 and live it you're a child you're
12:25 vulnerable but you feel comfortable in
12:28 your bedroom with all of your toys
12:29 because a child could memorize where the
12:31 bed is where all the toys are and then
12:34 they you have to memorize the outer
12:36 hallway in the front room in the kitchen
12:37 and then then they starts venturing into
12:40 the front yard the backyard and that
12:44 could be kind of daunting at first kind
12:45 of scary at first right then you feel
12:48 comfortable as you get older and
12:50 dominate your brain your brain's ability
12:53 to hold more capacity at the same time
12:55 conscious thought increases so the first
13:01 beautiful thing about a small town is
13:04 this sort of a miniature City why do
13:10 people like Disneyland
13:12 downtown because it's a miniature like
13:15 1/7
13:17 sorry no 7/9 or 5/7 Vegas 5/7 scale town
13:22 based on the Missouri town that Walt
13:26 Disney's from it feels like you can
13:31 control it it feels like it's warming
13:33 you know plus by the time you are born
13:37 into these towns typically unless you
13:39 know you were part of the settlers in
13:41 the 1800s every single business is owned
13:45 and the fact they started that the
13:48 resources of life were all taken care of
13:50 there's a grocery store a drug store
13:52 clothing store a shoe store
13:55 etc etc the car repair place a couple
13:57 different restaurants not a hell of a
13:59 lot but there it is everything that a
14:01 town needs to sustain its existence is
14:04 usually embedded into a town until
14:06 Walmart shows up and [ __ ] everything up
14:08 but whatever so the nice thing is is
14:11 that if you look at most the folks that
14:13 suffer from childhood ailments of mental
14:17 abuse which again could be something
14:20 severe could be something very mild
14:22 you know father or mother wasn't you
14:26 know the child could never do anything
14:28 to make the parent happy those are
14:31 little ones that leave you constantly
14:34 trying to overcompensate your whole life
14:35 to kind of kind of become an annoying
14:38 human being when that happens right to
14:39 other people but now let's just say that
14:42 as a small town because you realized
14:47 that in a small town you have a small
14:48 population my town's heyday was 12,500 I
14:52 think I lived through that era the in
14:54 the 70s and 80s I think now it's about
14:59 10,000 a little less you realize that
15:03 you know a tremendous amount of the town
15:07 and there's two ways you know that you
15:09 know someone you have an acquaintance
15:10 that you see drive by on your wave you
15:12 go to school with kids and you meet the
15:14 whole classroom you play after school
15:17 and safe neighborhoods because all the
15:20 parents are working together to watch
15:21 the kids I was worried about a perv
15:23 right all the dads work together
15:26 somewhere downtown somewhere in the
15:28 industrial park outside of town
15:30 and so there's this beautiful sense of
15:32 relaxation there might be
15:35 competitiveness in the town but there's
15:37 no fear in the town you don't have
15:39 murderers you don't have crime they
15:41 didn't lock doors of houses or cars
15:44 until probably the late 80s in my
15:48 hometown and even then a lot of people
15:50 still don't do it to this day
15:52 when I grew up there drugs were very
15:57 mild in the very sparse drinking sure
16:00 plenty of drink holes in town but that's
16:02 sort of the mainstay that came out of
16:03 you know a hundred years of previous
16:06 history right
16:08 but a child grows up centered and when
16:12 you grow up centered okay and there's
16:15 always a kid in town had a bad trip and
16:17 they had a bad group of parents or what
16:19 have you and they're the exception it's
16:21 unfortunate that it happens doesn't
16:23 matter how rich you are how poor you are
16:25 in a small town you could have a bad
16:27 batch of parents who maybe the parents
16:29 pull their head out eventually but
16:30 during the time they had those kids they
16:32 were screwing them up right I know a
16:36 mall I know all these different folks
16:37 and my parents weren't perfect either
16:40 but imagine that you didn't have any
16:42 outside stress on you from your
16:45 environment you didn't have to worry
16:47 about gunshots at night terrorists or
16:49 drugs or muggers or perverts or anything
16:53 so then you get a lot of freedom freedom
16:59 to explore your environment for your
17:01 freedom to explore yourself freedom to
17:04 explore friendships and relationships
17:06 with other people without the stress of
17:09 peril I can't stress this enough that
17:14 that is what gives someone a center core
17:17 in their being that they will carry the
17:20 rest of their lives even if something
17:24 bad happens to them 10 20 years later
17:25 they still have their core to reflect on
17:28 to say well this only happened to me
17:31 because I'm in this different location
17:33 it only happened to me because I have
17:34 these bad friends of mine but there's
17:36 bad relationship I got into I can always
17:39 go home and and live with people that
17:43 don't do this to each other right
17:45 whether or not be true or not usually
17:47 find some places similar it also feeds
17:50 into overall confidence it's always
17:54 strange to me that when I come to the
17:56 big city and I was it was he happened to
18:00 me of the day I was in some restaurant
18:02 he goes our chick-fil-a had me in there
18:05 a long time and I wanted to taste it boy
18:07 it was delicious oh my god but I went in
18:10 there and there's a kid in there who's
18:11 probably 6 foot 3 great genetics you can
18:16 see him he's just he's built like a
18:17 warrior
18:18 and he had his girlfriend there I think
18:20 and he's young he's probably between 18
18:27 and 20 somewhere in there but he was the
18:29 meekest kid I'd ever seen I mean he
18:32 carried himself like he had just like
18:36 someone's gonna beat him up in the next
18:38 second it was really strange and I'm
18:41 looking at him going geez you have the
18:43 genetics to be a [ __ ] gladiator why
18:45 are you walking around like a [ __ ] it's
18:47 weird
18:49 something happened to that kid I don't
18:51 know what it was this was way beyond
18:53 being gracious and confident this was
18:58 insecurity in my hometown kids that size
19:03 are typically very very confident the
19:07 women are confident the boys are
19:09 confident the girls are confident
19:10 everyone is encouraged to be the very
19:13 best they could possibly be now is there
19:17 gossip and politics and all kind of
19:19 stuff I mean I mean not politics as in
19:21 national politics but that you know
19:23 who's better than Who and all that kind
19:25 of stuff yeah there's always a little
19:26 smidgen of that right there's also
19:29 something called nostalgia it starts to
19:32 form in a small town the level of
19:34 familiarity in a town is interesting I'm
19:39 gonna give you kind of a weird analogy
19:40 but a friend of mine does a lot of
19:42 woodworking and he's always teaching me
19:44 new things about it and he said that the
19:46 Japanese have a ritual once a year where
19:49 carpenters will will create things I
19:51 don't think it's just wood but what is
19:53 definitely one of them they'll make
19:55 little boxes little jewelry boxes and
19:57 things and they they have this big arena
20:00 or something where they bring all these
20:02 boxes and lay them out and they have
20:06 like 10,000 people go through and touch
20:07 them with their hands to patina the wood
20:11 to smooth it out you know like you go to
20:13 Disneyland you touch a few the
20:14 guardrails they've been there for 50 60
20:16 years and it's just like wow this is
20:18 like Walt Disney touched this thing you
20:21 know same thing on these boxes and it
20:24 makes it have this special value to the
20:27 mind and I'm not sure exactly what the
20:29 deal is if part of our soul comes up on
20:31 these things and
20:31 that's why something that's older has
20:33 that feeling but it happens in a small
20:37 town businesses the the faces you know
20:43 the storefronts on these businesses
20:44 depending on if they've been renewed or
20:46 if they've just been rien habited by a
20:48 different business they have that patina
20:51 that history that lineage and thus the
20:55 respect of their existence we had a
20:57 little tiny breakfast cafe called the
21:00 busy bee cafe which is right next to the
21:02 railroad tracks if any of you jump into
21:04 Google Maps it's fully photographed
21:09 because we have a Google map
21:12 [Music]
21:13 headquarters right downtown I've said
21:15 this a couple times but when the PC
21:17 version of Google Maps was ported or
21:19 Google Earth excuse me was ported to the
21:21 Macintosh a kid named David Webb because
21:24 his name ported it and set the
21:26 coordinate directly on shinnou Kansas if
21:29 you launched on a Mac supposedly that's
21:30 what happened I've never had that
21:32 actually happen on my Google Earth but
21:35 whatever so Google came and sponsored
21:38 this big mosaic that's on the center of
21:40 Main and Lincoln but if you go over to
21:43 the railroad tracks a little bit west
21:45 about a block you'll see this busy bee
21:47 cafe which is now no longer in use as
21:50 far as I know but it used to be a place
21:52 where you would go and eat breakfast and
21:54 I remember being taken there in high
21:56 school and this is where nostalgia comes
21:59 in and how does it start
22:00 how does nostalgia start in the mine I'm
22:02 gonna do an episode probably bout
22:03 nostalgia this year but the big deal was
22:06 that you know my father would take me in
22:09 there he'd say you know what this place
22:11 has been here since I was a little kid I
22:14 eat her as a child
22:15 your grandfather's ate here when they
22:17 were young men everybody came here
22:19 everyone who's ever been in Chanute and
22:21 lived here has eaten breakfast here and
22:24 it's a teeny tiny little submarine bar
22:27 you know like a like a cafe and so at
22:32 that point you start looking around and
22:33 it's not exactly I don't remember being
22:35 the cleanest place on earth but it was a
22:37 heirloom to the town now it was one of
22:41 the older locations but if you just
22:43 subtract a year off it's off it
22:45 age and start introducing the next line
22:48 of buildings and businesses then you
22:53 have a bunch of these it is very special
22:57 to live in a place and you Europeans you
22:59 notice Jesus you got buildings that are
23:02 like 800 years old and you rent them and
23:04 live in them right it's amazing that's
23:06 one thing I love about overseas but for
23:12 America an old town is starts about 1850
23:16 and up that's pretty much an old town
23:17 you go to the east coast you're talking
23:19 about 1600s you know seventeen hundred's
23:24 so what ends up happening is you start
23:27 to trust the locations inside your town
23:30 as a child as a teenager well this is
23:34 busy bee Cafe man this is where my
23:35 grandparents eat I can trust the food I
23:37 can trust the people it's comforting
23:40 it's cool and then you start looking
23:44 around the town you start realizing oh
23:46 my god you know these storefronts and
23:49 these roads and these buildings some of
23:52 them have been there over a hundred
23:54 years by the time I was you know
23:56 cognitive in the 70s and 80s 120 hundred
24:00 and 30 years old buildings as a child
24:03 you'll start looking at it going geez
24:05 the craftsmanship that we had back in
24:07 those days is amazing as you live and
24:10 buy and rent homes you know you probably
24:13 have a one in three chance of getting
24:15 into a home that's a hundred years old
24:19 amazing so there's an environmental
24:23 thing that's what that's all about the
24:25 psychological environmental comfort zone
24:27 of the location of a small town by the
24:33 way before I even get any further if you
24:36 grew up in a small town and this is
24:38 rekindling your own nostalgia for your
24:41 own town shirt where you grew up and
24:43 just tell us a little bit about your
24:44 town the cool parts that made you who
24:47 you are today you know but then there's
24:51 the social element of it all now there's
24:55 a saying that became very cliche which
25:00 is it takes a village to raise a kid and
25:02 Hillary Clinton of all people I think
25:04 what she didn't she write that book they
25:05 had the same name or something right
25:06 it's true it's a thousand percent true
25:11 what is wrong with the world today a lot
25:16 of things are wrong in this world today
25:17 but I will tell you that one of the core
25:19 things core things driven by other core
25:23 things but one of the core things that
25:25 we can talk about in this world is
25:26 called
25:27 accountability when you're in a
25:31 fast-paced world there's very little
25:33 accountability let's say you drove down
25:36 the 405 in Los Angeles and you flipped
25:39 off ten people with your finger but you
25:42 picked people that you you know I got
25:44 old grandma and old grandpa someone
25:46 looks Meeks and they're gonna get chased
25:48 down and shot they likelihood of you
25:51 ever seeing that person again
25:52 mathematically is zero I mean it is if
25:58 you rounded up the five decimal places
26:00 after the decimal point you were five
26:02 zeros after the decimal point you
26:04 wouldn't still be at zero so you can be
26:07 an [ __ ] in a big town and yeah
26:10 because there is no accountability in a
26:13 small town boy you couldn't pick anybody
26:18 to flip off without getting your ass you
26:22 know in trouble reputationally speaking
26:25 maybe even physically depending on what
26:27 you do and so there's this interesting
26:32 trade-off I can be well thought of in
26:38 town I can get any girl that likes me to
26:43 date me I can get any job in town as
26:47 long as I do one thing remain
26:50 accountable to my fellow town ship
26:54 citizens because if I do anything bad
26:59 it's gonna spread like a virus did you
27:01 hear what he did boy you know how
27:04 stories get more sensationalized as they
27:07 get retold so could you imagine doing
27:10 you know flipping the bird to somebody
27:12 and by the time the destroy gets back to
27:15 you you you know pounded them in the
27:18 face with your fists you know but here's
27:20 the interesting thing I'm making a weird
27:22 example flipping somebody off but that
27:26 doesn't happen in a small town unless
27:28 you're friends right you know in high
27:31 school was when these things of buddies
27:33 would flip each other off all the time I
27:34 don't know why we did that it doesn't
27:36 sound that funny to me at all anymore
27:37 but we did but you didn't want to do it
27:41 in a way that an old lady would see you
27:42 do it didn't cuss in front of old people
27:46 or anyone else that would tell your
27:48 parents that you did such a thing you
27:50 wouldn't do it for the sake of getting
27:52 in trouble with your parent but you also
27:54 wouldn't do it simply because you didn't
27:56 want anyone to think that you were that
27:57 flexible with your discipline as a human
28:01 being that you can go from speaking
28:03 clean for your grandmother and totally
28:06 filthy for your best friend now I can
28:08 only speak for myself in this particular
28:10 regard the one might ask but isn't that
28:14 very restrictive
28:15 isn't that a crappy way to live that you
28:17 can't be everything that you want to be
28:19 the minute you want to be it I'm going
28:22 to give you two answers one no it's not
28:26 at all restrictive you have no problem
28:29 with the amount of benefits you get by
28:32 behaving and being accountable to your
28:34 Township so unbelievably outweighs what
28:40 you would get if you were a jerk here
28:43 and there but it's easy it's totally
28:46 easy especially when you meet as a boy I
28:50 mean you know I met women that were
28:52 girls I should say that were just the
28:55 most pristine wonderful innocent you
28:59 know still feisty and interesting you
29:01 know now like goody two-shoes
29:02 necessarily but great girls that you
29:06 could date and it was a privilege and an
29:08 honor to be in their presence and theirs
29:12 if you're the slightest bit empathetic
29:14 about the situation then you are wanting
29:16 to be equally fantastic for them just a
29:20 natural thing at the same time in a
29:22 small town with all your grandparents
29:24 there if you have decent relationships
29:26 with your grandparents especially the
29:28 opposite sex grandparent typically
29:31 grandma's always get the get the win but
29:34 you want to be a good son grandson for
29:38 your family members you want them to be
29:39 able to rely on you carrying the family
29:42 name and the surname in itself has a
29:45 value in a small town whereas the
29:47 surname in a big town jeez I have not
29:50 met someone in a big city since I've
29:51 been in California over 30 years I
29:53 haven't met anyone who gives a [ __ ]
29:55 about their surname I'm sure that's not
29:57 the truth about their surnames but I
30:00 don't hear it and I'm gonna tell you if
30:03 there's an arbitrary thing that you can
30:05 pick it's your surname who are you are
30:11 you at Johnson are you alo are you what
30:15 are you well that's who you are
30:17 and even if your parents aren't somebody
30:20 that you think upheld that surname value
30:23 you can be the first generation to bring
30:24 it back in awhile but I guarantee you
30:26 over 100 years ago hundred fifty years
30:28 ago your surname with your family
30:30 members meant everything how many times
30:33 you hear about the Irish quoting their
30:36 surnames and saying you know I was a no
30:37 Riley I was an O'Brien and they're proud
30:39 I was a Scottish Bruce they're proud why
30:45 is it that the elite of the world that
30:46 run the world are proud of their
30:48 surnames it's a mechanism by which they
30:52 disciplined themselves to gain such
30:54 power but they gained it for control and
30:58 negativity why don't we do it for the
31:03 common law and prosperity the other
31:06 thing you get from a small town is its
31:09 natural constraints on you very few
31:12 small towns have millionaires now
31:16 technically there are millionaires in
31:20 small towns called farmers yes they live
31:24 a little bit above some folks but they
31:27 have a hard life okay they get up at the
31:31 crack of dawn they're out working before
31:33 most city kids or even remotely
31:37 getting up to go to school just like the
31:40 Marines they've done more before you
31:41 woke up then you'll do the rest of your
31:43 day it's true
31:44 now their combines their farm their land
31:47 their feed their whatever cost millions
31:50 and millions of dollars per year so
31:54 technically speaking farmers are
31:55 millionaires because they have to play
31:57 with that kind of money but they also
31:59 have huge risks if there's a huge frost
32:03 that comes through they could lose an
32:04 entire crop for an entire year and have
32:06 to live off their savings
32:08 after spending all that time manicuring
32:11 the land flood could destroy everything
32:13 especially like a soybean crop which is
32:15 a very shallow crop right I've seen it
32:18 happen a number of times and I felt the
32:20 pain of the farmer you without
32:22 understanding the true financial loss as
32:23 a young man but in the city there are
32:28 families that do a little bit better
32:30 than other families there's a lot of
32:31 that keeping up appearances stuff the
32:33 Jones me thing well they got an IROC
32:35 lining and I rock right yeah that
32:37 happens but most of the civilization
32:42 inside of a small town as heavy
32:45 constraints on their finances what does
32:48 that do well city person might say oh my
32:51 god I would never live in a small town
32:52 you ever been to a small town no what's
32:54 it like oh it's a dirty one thing why is
32:57 it dirty well you know half there
32:58 quarter the citizens live outside of the
33:00 city limits so they're driving on dirt
33:01 roads they tracked that [ __ ] into town
33:03 it's just it's just got dirt flying
33:06 everywhere anyway right so why would you
33:09 do that we know what it snows this the
33:11 snow gets dirty right so it's like it's
33:13 tough it's not as clean as as a cement
33:16 zoo like a city what happens is is that
33:21 the citizens have to find ways to be
33:23 happy with what they have ask anybody
33:27 who's wealthy today if they enjoy their
33:30 wealth the my experience those who enjoy
33:34 their wealth the most weren't wealthy
33:36 when they were young they know the
33:39 difference between not having resources
33:40 and having resources those that are rich
33:44 from the very very beginning usually
33:46 imitate small-town living like I've got
33:50 a couple
33:51 people in LA who are my mentors in
33:53 various industries I know that they're
33:55 sitting on top of powder kegs of money
33:57 they've always had money their friends
34:01 in school were the heirs of the giant
34:03 corporations here in America but they
34:07 live in 1,400 square foot homes albeit
34:13 they're nice areas but inside it's just
34:15 a normal fricking house they drive cars
34:19 that are 25 years old if not 30 years
34:23 old they don't believe in buying new
34:26 stuff so they're living like my Township
34:28 even though they have the ability to
34:30 roll as hard as they want right once you
34:35 learn to be happy with very little
34:37 there's very that very little that will
34:40 make you unhappy now the only thing
34:43 that's actually started to penetrate
34:45 this and I'm gonna get into a little bit
34:47 of the transformation of these towns but
34:49 I don't intend this on any negative note
34:50 so let me just make a quick comment here
34:52 back when I was a kid the amount of
34:55 amenities and electronics and appliances
34:57 that one purchased for their home was
35:00 still fairly reasonable in terms of
35:01 price a TV a stereo for your house a car
35:06 and you know I don't know that's a
35:10 particular type of blender whatever
35:12 right overall if you wanted one maybe
35:15 you had to save up a couple months maybe
35:16 six months if you run at a fancier one
35:19 but the rules changed a little bit now
35:21 where products actually have been
35:23 injected into society the latest iPhone
35:26 max right iPhone 10 max is $1,500
35:32 right now it's $1,500 for me sitting in
35:36 Huntington Beach California and it's
35:37 $1,500 for my hometown folks and should
35:44 new Kansas who's gonna pay for that a
35:47 lot easier me or them obviously me
35:51 because I make a lot more money than
35:52 anyone in my hometown on average right
35:56 so if the kids want to own iPhones in my
35:59 hometown the burden on them is
36:02 saying to get these things paid for
36:04 because they have all the other expenses
36:06 as well a car and there's a little bit
36:10 of markup probably for California
36:12 emissions and if the other thing but a
36:13 car and when I left my hometown in 87
36:18 the car I wanted was like a Monte Carlo
36:21 SS that's what I wanted I think it was
36:23 about 16,000 dollars or something like
36:26 that he could go up as high as 18 well I
36:29 got to California and it was the exact
36:30 same price all right
36:33 well I made a hell of a lot more money
36:35 in California they ever made it in my
36:37 little hometown so I could afford the
36:40 car in California but I couldn't afford
36:42 the car in my hometown but let's back up
36:45 one second did I really need that car no
36:50 I didn't need that car at all what am i
36:53 doing I'm driving around to town that's
36:55 six miles square when I was an early
36:58 teenager I had a Honda moped it was
37:02 pretty awesome
37:02 it's one of the more tricked out looking
37:04 ones and I'd ride the piss out thing all
37:08 around town but I could do the whole
37:10 square that's why I did a five-mile
37:12 square inside of a six mile square and
37:15 just over and over and over listening to
37:17 music stopping by friends houses
37:19 whatever crashed it a couple times I was
37:23 happy my first car was a Dodge Charger
37:28 special edition 1976 eggshell white if
37:32 you wonder how it looks like it ain't
37:33 the General Lee folks it's like your
37:35 mom's Cordoba
37:36 I got it round got to work
37:42 but what brought me happiness was the
37:45 interaction with my friends interaction
37:47 with my family interaction with my
37:48 girlfriend that's what made me happy
37:51 going to a movie together and sharing
37:53 our opinions about the film going to a
37:55 picnic you know as young we go to dances
37:59 and that kind of thing right you didn't
38:04 have a bunch of money but no one else
38:05 did either so was a level playing field
38:09 we didn't have an ice cream Chuck though
38:11 it's a that and what was interesting was
38:14 we had a guy in town who bought a
38:17 Ferrari he was sort of an outer I know
38:21 if he grew up in my hometown and moved
38:22 there or sorry moved in from out of town
38:24 if we grew up there you had this really
38:27 weird Ferrari convertible had a really
38:32 short front with this rear engine thing
38:33 and just odd looking but he drove around
38:36 town and it was kind of special to see
38:38 this guy drive that Ferrari around town
38:40 really bizarre right with someone about
38:43 a new Corvette the new Corvettes in 84
38:45 was amazing to see one well in the big
38:49 city I can tell you the only thing that
38:50 really turns in my head is like a
38:53 Lamborghini Aventador with the special
38:55 horsepower package on it you know that's
38:57 the part that turns my head it takes a
39:00 lot to turn my head here in California a
39:03 chrome covered Aston Martin you know
39:06 that's just an anomaly for the ice to
39:09 see so the subtleties of being impressed
39:12 were more plentiful in a small town than
39:15 they are in the big big city right now
39:18 one of the things that I got wrong as a
39:20 kid I've mentioned this a couple times
39:22 were on the subject I thought all the
39:25 city kids had all the opportunity some
39:28 of that's correct some of that's not
39:29 correct but I thought that they were
39:31 smarter and that when I would get to the
39:35 the coast I thought man I'm gonna be
39:37 dumb compared to these kids and when I
39:41 got out here it was quite the opposite
39:44 experience because I was isolated in the
39:49 middle of nowhere 100 miles from any
39:51 major city roughly like Joplin is the
39:53 only one it's
39:54 slightly closer at about seventy miles
39:58 or so and because I didn't have any
40:01 brothers or sisters that also helped me
40:02 out a little bit
40:03 got a couple cousins but I wasn't like
40:05 any we weren't spending every day
40:06 together anything like that I would
40:09 hunker down in all my studies you know
40:13 just self educating like crazy reading
40:17 the encyclopedia I don't the world
40:19 encyclopedia getting into program and
40:21 getting into drawing and painting and
40:24 music everything
40:27 it's about Tom Akina California I had a
40:30 college-level education in programming I
40:33 had a college level at least level of
40:36 illustration and drawing both digital
40:39 and analog and I was just dangerous in
40:42 the music area hadn't started writing
40:45 yet but I also had a work ethic and so
40:50 when I came to the coast
40:51 I was dominating fast SuperDuper fast
40:54 and I was shocked I almost couldn't
40:57 believe how easy it was obviously you
41:02 get this in the major cities as well
41:03 because you do have kids that nerd out
41:05 at home and that's where you get a lot
41:08 of the folks that control the planet in
41:09 terms of creating products and refining
41:12 things it's very cool but when I look at
41:14 the work ethic thing it's very
41:16 interesting now work ethic comes out of
41:18 the cultural demands of your environment
41:21 right if your environment says kids
41:23 behave and kids think employment is a
41:26 privilege if that's what the culture
41:28 thinks and that's what the culture does
41:30 they're nice and courteous in California
41:34 it's a hit and miss situation you go to
41:36 an in-and-out burger I don't know what
41:38 interview piece of paper they have but
41:40 they find the the most incredibly awake
41:47 good kids they're all races they're all
41:51 Creed's they just pluck them right out
41:53 of the world oh there's a really good
41:55 kid right there boom BAM you're gonna
41:57 make hamburgers in the Midwest
41:59 it's almost every kid because every kid
42:03 is afraid that they won't be able to pay
42:06 for things
42:08 jobs aren't as plentiful in the Midwest
42:11 you have a few restaurants a few
42:14 businesses you can work at and so you're
42:17 lucky to get a job that might sound a
42:21 little restrictive but the nice thing is
42:23 is that one you can usually stay in
42:26 careers for the rest of your life if you
42:27 want to in the Midwest you can move in
42:29 from being a burger flipper to being the
42:31 manager and then you can become some
42:33 regional manager I mean you can keep
42:34 moving up no matter what you're doing
42:36 but I think it goes just a little bit
42:39 deeper than that for our Township
42:41 there's something called pride and it is
42:45 how well do you do your job at general
42:47 because is the definition in a small
42:50 town that will eventually link back to
42:52 your surname the more I think about my
42:56 history of listening to various
42:58 critiques be a positive or negative
43:00 about various people in the hometown
43:03 that I grew up in the amount of times
43:06 that it was linked back to a person's
43:09 name and honestly it was like we have a
43:16 couple companies in our town Young's
43:18 welding just like being young it's the
43:21 last name Young's welding is known for
43:23 being a an ace company that if you need
43:27 anything built welded together some
43:30 machinery created they are just famous
43:32 in my hometown for being super high
43:35 quality there are some families in my
43:39 hometown which I don't even know if
43:40 still exist that will go uh turley
43:43 nameless and I don't really have any
43:44 close association with them at all but
43:47 there were some families that seemed to
43:51 just raise bad kids and they're always
43:55 in trouble they're always in and out of
44:00 jail some of them I know one family that
44:03 was responsible for killing three people
44:07 and it all happened in a one year like
44:10 that one year span it was one sibling
44:14 and then another sibling I think one
44:16 person killed two people they only
44:18 killed one person or maybe they only
44:19 killed one apiece but they
44:21 absolutely mainly they did it in front
44:23 of the families as all being drunk and
44:25 on drugs and driving their cars into
44:28 people in front of everyone all was an
44:31 extremely public situation and so that
44:36 family just gets scarred which for one
44:39 of the kids who had nothing to do with
44:41 those two events he's kind of screwed
44:43 because he's like oh my god now I have
44:45 to prove I'm not one of the other kids
44:49 in my family but I know that kid too and
44:51 he had his own version of it he was own
44:54 version of being a pain in the ass
44:56 the father was sort of a piece of [ __ ]
45:00 who was always one of these guys that
45:03 tried to cheat everyone out of
45:04 everything he taught his kids you don't
45:07 need to follow rules rules of a sucker's
45:09 right but instead of being smart about
45:11 it they just had the worst judgement on
45:15 earth I think the family actually moved
45:17 out of town before the last kid
45:20 graduated I believe and so what's
45:23 interesting about is the town can turn
45:26 on selective warnings and concerns and
45:32 cautions so if one of those kids showed
45:36 up at a bar showed up at some public
45:40 event the town can just start to go okay
45:42 they're here so let's be careful let's
45:46 watch them let's see if they drink too
45:47 much and get in a car we'll call the
45:49 cops get them at least off the street
45:51 but most of us aren't those people most
45:55 of us have no history of that behavior
45:56 and so there's no caution it also helps
46:01 you figure out who the hell you're gonna
46:02 invite if a bank is gonna give a loan to
46:05 somebody for a business they'll just go
46:08 oh your family has been here for 80 to a
46:13 hundred years you have been a
46:15 cornerstone of this community I know
46:17 your grandfather and your
46:19 great-grandfather they're all wonderful
46:21 people boom you get the loan I trust you
46:25 I trusted if you have a problem paying
46:27 the loan that your family will kick in
46:30 and help you get through bad times
46:33 right maybe even will kick in and give
46:36 you reprieve on your payments if the
46:39 whole town is suffering right how many
46:41 times you be driven down a highway at
46:43 night and someone's stranded on the side
46:46 of the road you can see they have a flat
46:49 tire perhaps they're carrying a gas can
46:51 up the highway and you can't imagine
46:55 pulling over to help them or all you can
46:57 do is perhaps imagine but you can't
47:00 stomach the risk of maybe getting beat
47:04 up or mugged or something by someone in
47:07 some feral state of concern in the big
47:09 city happens all the time folks in a
47:13 small town it's different in a small
47:17 town you look over there you go that's
47:20 Fred Johnson let's well it looks like
47:22 he's got a tire thing so you pull over
47:24 you know you roll down your window
47:25 because it's like 30 miles an hour
47:27 everywhere in town you can look in your
47:28 rear-view mirror and see if anyone's
47:30 going to come up on you in the next 60
47:31 seconds to five minutes hey Fred you're
47:34 doing okay yeah dammit I got us you know
47:36 got a flat tire you got a spare yeah is
47:38 it is it aired up yep I mean anything
47:40 for me no I'm good
47:41 you sure okay you got my cell number
47:45 yeah all right you give me a call if you
47:47 have any problems all right thanks a lot
47:49 boom you're on your way the person needs
47:51 help needs a gas can fill it up well
47:54 they're not during the middle of town
47:56 there's no gas station and when you feel
47:57 me right hop in
47:59 lock yourself up hop in we'll get you
48:01 taken care of boom that can happen in a
48:04 small town easy some of you live in
48:08 these towns and you're looking at me
48:09 like ya was your big mystification about
48:12 this it's because in the big city in a
48:14 like that right this is the reason why
48:17 getting rid of the electoral college in
48:20 America is absolutely [ __ ] insane
48:24 because people with morals and
48:27 responsibility and accountability are
48:29 those people in those communities and
48:32 they need equal representation in a
48:34 major country because they're going to
48:37 keep you centered you know we're Simi
48:42 Valley was the porn capital of
48:44 California
48:46 you won't find that in the Midwest that
48:48 easy oh you know there's those guys that
48:51 try it
48:52 those guys that do it but by god they
48:54 are hiding they're hiding that activity
48:56 like crazy right now the one commonality
48:59 that's starting to take root and it's a
49:04 constant battle with Midwest small towns
49:06 I just got another update from
49:09 acquaintances of mine in my home town is
49:12 drugs now people in small towns can't
49:16 really afford heroin they can't afford
49:18 cocaine you know people do it but
49:21 they're living on the edge of their
49:23 financial capabilities but things like
49:26 meth have attempted several times to
49:32 take root in my hometown because it's
49:37 cheap your average peasant can make it
49:40 right it's a multi-pronged problem in
49:44 that when we used to have well when we
49:52 didn't have Walmart we didn't have
49:55 fast-food chains in our hometown and
49:58 everyone provided those services to the
50:00 citizens now the citizens actually pat
50:03 themselves on the back that they were
50:04 lucky enough to get the Walmart lucky
50:07 enough to get these big franchises in
50:09 they're not realizing the entire time
50:11 that all the money is going outside the
50:12 town I'm not coming back in sure people
50:16 get paychecks but when is anyone you
50:19 know ran outside of the Walmart paycheck
50:21 and said oh my god I won the lottery so
50:25 it has taken a prosperous town that was
50:28 a 12,500 and Counting going up at at one
50:32 point I think it fell below nine
50:33 thousand people when I went back from my
50:38 I think my second high school reunion my
50:42 20th I had my old friends and I was like
50:45 hey what's up how does the house light
50:47 how's it going and they just looked dead
50:50 and their reasoning for that but you
50:54 know that's sort of melancholy McCobb
50:56 personality was that they were having a
50:57 problem finding work
50:58 they're not dumb people very educated
51:01 had had jobs but these organizations
51:05 came in and destroyed their grocery
51:07 stores destroyed their businesses that
51:09 have been there for 80 years so why do
51:13 drugs get into small towns well well
51:18 we'll overlook Charlotte is Ruby's the
51:20 dumbing down of America reason why which
51:23 is to utterly destroy the town the
51:26 biggest agenda that she revealed were
51:29 the corporations that were coming in to
51:31 take over all of our businesses that was
51:33 an agenda hatched in the early 70s but
51:36 you're either need money or you need to
51:39 be happy
51:41 depending on how much you adopt the have
51:47 to be rich culture of America you have
51:50 to have stuff you have to have that
51:51 iPhone max so you're not going to be
51:52 happy you have to have the 80 inch 4k
51:55 HDR television it goes 3d to the degree
51:59 you adopt those standards you're never
52:02 gonna have enough money unless you're
52:04 one of the few in our hometown to have
52:06 your own business and you're able to
52:07 really push through a lot of cash right
52:09 that's pretty rare that's pretty rare so
52:15 if you who are down and out you could
52:17 move in sorry you could you could start
52:20 dealing in meth or some other drug I
52:23 don't think we dizzily is legal yet in
52:26 Kansas so you would have to still
52:28 smuggle that in whatever anyone wants
52:31 you get it in there newbie sell it and
52:33 you put your little up charge on it and
52:36 there you go you made some money for the
52:40 buyers they're probably down and out and
52:43 man I just need a little hit I needed a
52:44 little something to give me a boost
52:46 because I can't find a job job I have I
52:49 don't like me and this place used to be
52:50 great now it's not great anymore so
52:53 that's the way it's sneaking in it's a
52:55 sad thing because the fabric of these
52:59 people still exists the goodness in them
53:01 still exists the work ethic still exists
53:04 the camaraderie and respect and
53:07 accountability still exists but it
53:10 brings to mind a little statement to JFK
53:12 which is ask not what your country can
53:14 do for you ask what you can do for your
53:17 country
53:18 that's a sensibility that I think is
53:21 waning in the Midwest people willing to
53:24 take responsibility for what is either
53:26 helped their town or injured their town
53:30 I think it would be utterly fascinating
53:33 if everyone in our hometown said you
53:35 know what regardless of the expense that
53:37 I'm going to go to we can all work
53:39 together to kabal cheaper products we're
53:42 not going to shop at Walmart anymore
53:44 we're just gonna let it go down the
53:46 tubes and then as and we're also going
53:50 to start new stores to sell the things
53:53 that they sell and yeah we know it's
53:55 cheaper at Walmart we also know it's
53:57 lesser products products that are built
54:00 to fall apart shoes and only allowed to
54:02 last six months before they explode food
54:06 that is unhealthy for you because it's
54:08 all GMO we're gonna harvest our own
54:11 stuff
54:12 GMO we're gonna get rid of that too my
54:15 whole town is full of GMO crops now one
54:19 of the main reasons why they can't see
54:21 the deception is because they don't
54:22 think in deception they don't deceive
54:25 each other to survive so when the
54:28 corporation's come in with a complete
54:30 deception model of prosperity a the
54:34 toilet paper is a lot cheaper Walmart
54:36 why would you buy it down at the food
54:39 mart it's cause more down there why
54:41 would you do that
54:41 oh I don't know okay yeah yes I should
54:44 buy for cheaper not realizing they're
54:46 putting a grocery store out of business
54:48 downtown one of the grocery stores
54:52 turning to a feed store for farmers one
54:55 of the grocery stores turned into a
54:57 nightclub one of them is just derelict
55:01 and empty I think one turn into a liquor
55:03 store liquor being another drug right
55:08 it's only a couple original grocery
55:10 stores I think that it still exists when
55:12 I was a kid I don't know if what I'm
55:14 about to mention is a huge problem for
55:16 my hometown but I've seen little
55:17 Inklings of it in conversation during
55:19 visits which is the I'm going to give
55:23 you the analogy of the old Twilight Zone
55:25 where there's a community of people
55:27 having a birthday party for one of the
55:29 doctors he's got a wife and a son and
55:32 they're giving him a bunch of crap about
55:34 having built a bomb shelter below his
55:36 house how they all had to put up with
55:38 the sound of him doing this construction
55:40 how silly he was for building this and
55:42 then his son runs in the room and says
55:45 dad they're saying something on the
55:47 television or on the radio I think it
55:48 was a television but they turned it on
55:51 news a radio and it says that bombs are
55:55 coming in from Russia and that the
55:57 nuclear war has begun and everyone
56:00 rushes home and then they all realize oh
56:05 my god we need to be in the shelter
56:06 because we're not going to survive a
56:07 nuclear attack now the old guy is
56:11 grabbing water grabbing all the stuff
56:14 going down inside his his shelter is
56:16 only built for three people he closes
56:19 the door everyone's begging to go in one
56:22 family has a as a child he says we
56:27 should go in there because we have a
56:28 little kid and then the person goes what
56:30 makes your kid more valuable than mine
56:32 just because it's younger so there's all
56:34 this fighting then there's racism that
56:37 starts all this kind of proprietary
56:41 elitism starts to occur in the
56:43 conversation and eventually they tear
56:46 open the door
56:47 destroy the shelter itself so another
56:52 all at risk they're all gonna die and
56:54 then it comes on the radio that it was
56:56 all a false alarm and they have to look
56:59 at each other and go oh my god I said
57:01 all those horrible things about you as
57:03 long as little towns incur small
57:06 problems they won't get to that level
57:10 but if they incur giant recessions or
57:14 god forbid a depression and again it
57:17 doesn't have to be something that's
57:19 national right both coasts could be
57:21 booming the whole time prosperity is
57:24 green but as long as Walmart's are
57:26 opened up in there every little town
57:27 it's that sucking sound it's a NAFTA
57:30 sucking sounds blowing all the money on
57:32 the town and sending it to Europe or
57:33 India or China where the products are me
57:36 we have to protect trust me we have to
57:40 protect our little towns we have to
57:43 protect them like the gyroscope that
57:45 holds you know something steady the
57:49 centrifuge of a giant skyscraper that
57:51 holds it steady when the wind is hitting
57:53 it right the coasts are the chaotic
57:58 cultural development zones where
58:01 mistakes are going to be made and great
58:03 things are going to be made all at the
58:04 same time but they're sort of what have
58:08 you done for me lately cultures I live
58:10 in this culture I've lived in it for
58:11 over thirty years they get off on bad
58:14 trends and a lot of folks can see the
58:18 bad trend right away and go man this is
58:20 a horrible idea we need to stop this or
58:23 we need not to give them our money give
58:24 this thing our money and it balances
58:26 back out in a small town they don't
58:29 often engage in such a thing so instead
58:34 of seeing rural communities as sort of
58:37 Hollywood bumpkin things and believe me
58:40 believe me they Hollywood knows that the
58:43 Midwest is a threat to their perversion
58:46 and so why do they greenlight scripts
58:50 that cast the Midwest is a bunch of
58:52 bumpkins a bunch of idiots because
58:55 that's the benefit they get to get to
58:57 keep their chaos the perversion nothing
59:00 worse than a person who's made so much
59:02 money that no matter what happens to the
59:03 economy they're always going to be rich
59:07 their perversion is always protected you
59:10 can live in the exact same zone you
59:14 don't have such freedoms the economy
59:16 crashes you lose everything they don't
59:20 you do but they're painting reality
59:23 through fictional television fictional
59:25 film all that stuff right I think this
59:28 last presidential election in America
59:30 the Midwest finally realized well you
59:35 city folk have gone a little out of
59:37 [ __ ] control the Midwest cities have
59:41 crime out the ass you know Los Angeles
59:46 is largely gained a lot of control over
59:48 its shootings and all of its gang baby
59:50 we went hardcore he took it to 11 by
59:52 1996 le was a bloodbath the amount of
59:56 deaths every single night was just
59:59 commonplace drive-bys I mean you were
60:03 lucky if only one happened in a night he
60:06 got so chaotic that the the West Coast
60:09 said I think we're gonna pull back here
60:11 I don't want to die for some stupid
60:13 reason we need to understand society a
60:16 lot better than we do small towns no
60:20 matter where they are typically have a
60:23 level of camaraderie that again is
60:26 self-correcting if you think about it
60:29 like the human body for instance you
60:33 don't want your autonomic system that
60:35 takes care of your heartbeat and your
60:37 brain waves and your nervous system to
60:39 ever be screwed with do you
60:41 that should work perfect constantly now
60:45 you might drink some alcohol to mess
60:46 with it a little bit and have some fun
60:47 drop some LSD you would do it every
60:50 single day probably unless you have a
60:52 chronic sickness so it's the outside of
60:56 your body that will go on the roller
60:57 coaster it wants to do all kinds of
61:00 crazy chaotic stuff but you want your
61:02 insides to work great I think we can
61:06 view the coastal regions as sort of the
61:08 external epidermis on the American it's
61:12 only perspective I can give you culture
61:14 but the sinner the heart the brain the
61:18 nervous system is all of that Midwest
61:20 energy it's all that Midwest sensibility
61:23 and accountability and beauty and
61:25 simplicity tell me where you live
61:28 whether you live in a big city that you
61:32 know rocks hard or whatever you guys do
61:35 or you live in a little tiny town that
61:39 has gone through these various cycles
61:41 what's cool about every single town
61:44 meaning a little town is that if you
61:48 stop by on your car and you pull over
61:50 and you're kind and you're courteous
61:52 they might look at you a little funny
61:54 the smaller the town is because they
61:56 really do fear outsiders they don't want
61:59 your [ __ ] in their town they've got
62:00 balance they've got synergy they don't
62:02 want your chaotic
62:04 your perversion so they'll check you out
62:07 for a little while ask you a few
62:08 questions to see is this guy gonna rob
62:11 the bank is he gonna impregnate all the
62:14 daughters you know you're gonna spread a
62:15 venereal disease because he's part of
62:17 that clan you know it'll be careful with
62:20 you but once you get inside the hard
62:23 shell of the egg its soft in the middle
62:27 and they'll start telling you everything
62:30 about their hometown and there's always
62:31 some conceptual moment that made the
62:33 town exist how did this town come about
62:36 my town came about because of the
62:37 railroad once the railroad became a
62:40 ubiquitous part of the town's flow
62:42 freight going through passengers going
62:44 through well then the town itself could
62:46 build its own culture around that well
62:48 that's taken care of the railroad that
62:49 brings in all this cash has this thing
62:52 well we need a downtown we need all the
62:54 amenities of life we need a dry cleaners
62:56 a restaurant oriented unto death that's
62:59 why I think people jump in our v's and
63:01 cross America even if you're from Europe
63:03 I don't know where to go in Europe
63:06 Europe has been there for so freakin
63:07 long that there's no to my knowledge
63:10 there's no little towns in Europe that
63:12 haven't existed for a thousand to 2,000
63:14 years right so it's a it's a little
63:17 tougher but they have the same element
63:19 every little town every big town in
63:21 Europe has an amazing story an amazing
63:24 story
63:25 well the simplicity of Americans in the
63:28 Midwest is sort of an heirloom of beauty
63:32 when you get a really good nicely
63:34 balanced town I think my hometown is one
63:36 of those towns that's why people from
63:38 California and around the world tend to
63:41 move to my hometown once they figure out
63:43 exists then they come and they do a
63:44 little vacation there and they realize
63:46 jeez it took me two or three days to
63:49 slow down my tempo or 30 miles an hour
63:53 everywhere seemed like a decent you know
63:56 miles per hour to drive but they relaxed
64:00 and they destress and they sleep at
64:02 night they'll still go to the big city
64:05 and enjoy their friends and all the
64:07 amenities of New York and LA or whatever
64:10 that wherever they're from but the what
64:12 was the basis of the movie beetlejuice
64:14 was that
64:15 this really intense East Coast family
64:18 moved to this sort of kind of well lived
64:22 in sort of BER BIA I don't know where
64:25 that was actually set their goal was to
64:28 bring some of their amenities to their
64:30 home and live that was their thing turn
64:33 the town into a sanctuary or rich people
64:36 could come and just relax right I'm
64:39 telling you it happens every single day
64:41 California is a tough place to live in
64:43 depending on what stage of life you're
64:45 in the amount of friends I have that say
64:48 they're gonna get out of this state is
64:50 getting more and more and more most of
64:54 these kids grew up here I think it's
64:56 interesting the pattern of LA has sort
65:00 of worn off I guess so it's not this
65:02 coveted thing anymore I talked to people
65:06 in my hometown and some people
65:08 absolutely love it and will live their
65:09 rest their lives and some folks some
65:11 folks are just like I want to get the
65:12 hell out of here the drugs are getting
65:14 out of control I don't exactly know what
65:16 that means at this point about 10-15
65:20 years ago I saw the problem and then it
65:23 seemed to go away and I guess for at
65:25 least one person's perspective it's back
65:26 with force so we'll see
65:28 bring I hope this was valuable if you
65:32 spent stuck in a big city especially if
65:35 you're in the big city and you're
65:36 pulling your hair out you have kids and
65:38 you're really fearful for how they're
65:40 raised maybe look into a small town
65:43 maybe it's close to your big city so you
65:46 can make a little commute maybe you just
65:48 uproot everything and you go to a place
65:51 and you find yourself a little job you
65:54 enjoy the peaceful nature of not
65:57 worrying about whether or not you're
65:59 gonna get robbed blind honestly if
66:01 you're from a big city and you move to a
66:03 small town the cool thing is is that
66:05 your instincts and your your sensory
66:09 input is going to be so much more hyper
66:11 than theirs that you could see danger a
66:15 mile away but don't be surprised if you
66:18 don't sense any right when you live
66:21 there five ten years and you haven't
66:23 heard about a single house getting
66:24 burglarized that wasn't like the
66:26 neighbor's kid
66:28 crawled over and stolen his you know the
66:30 neighbors wrench or lawnmower or
66:32 whatever you know a bicycle might get
66:34 stolen
66:35 whoop-dee-doo right we're you gonna ride
66:38 a bicycle in a town that you stole it in
66:40 all right you can't you have to take it
66:42 to the town over guess I'm gonna
66:44 recognize the bike let me know your
66:46 stories let's share a little bit of
66:49 communion this probably won't get that
66:50 many views but for those of you finished
66:52 it I think you'll sense the value in it
66:54 anyhow if you have been to deep thoughts
