00:30 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:32 deep thoughts
00:32 so the subject of 5g is getting hotter
00:37 and hotter and hotter I did a bunch of
00:39 research to really capture what is going
00:43 on here and I'm gonna pull from my
00:48 favorite channels on YouTube for some of
00:51 this and then we're gonna review things
00:53 but so I did an episode which as soon as
00:56 this one airs I think it's in third
00:58 season called 5g dangers I'm going to
01:02 retire that episode and replace it with
01:04 this one so there you go there'll be a
01:05 little hole in a and the normal episode
01:08 flow here's the good news
01:10 pretty much everything I told you is a
01:14 hundred percent accurate about 5g what
01:18 I'm going to tell you today are the
01:19 details underneath those dangers and
01:22 point you in some places you can go to
01:25 research stuff for yourself before we
01:28 get into the technical breakdown a 5g
01:30 let's just review the climate of the
01:33 idea of 5g just for a couple minutes
01:35 here so if I G is being pushed in every
01:41 globalist country on planet Earth and
01:43 China is probably number one in the
01:47 world of pushing 5g on their people and
01:51 once you hear its potential to control
01:56 human beings let alone the health risks
01:59 okay it all makes sense to you every
02:03 European Union country is going to get a
02:05 ton of it but even in the old United
02:08 States the USA our current president is
02:13 pushing it and technically speaking we
02:17 probably don't need it now everything
02:21 I've ever told you has been echoed in
02:24 the most credible resources that I have
02:26 bumped into because I kind of want to
02:30 update it I kind of want update myself
02:31 on what's going on here but the
02:34 cellphone is a single best and I told
02:36 you this five years ago
02:38 the cell phone is the single best
02:40 surveillance system ever developed in
02:44 world history it's on the outside of the
02:47 body you carry it around
02:48 which means all the subdermal you know
02:51 chipping the human being is totally
02:53 unnecessary
02:54 they don't need to push that ever which
02:56 is why it's disappeared the subdermal
02:59 systems are much more difficult to
03:01 communicate with outside systems it
03:03 causes cancer exactly where it's
03:05 inserted because of electromagnetic
03:07 fields even though it's you know
03:09 milliamps I guarantee you the scientists
03:12 in Europe to put one in his body he
03:14 doesn't have in his body anymore
03:15 guarantee it now 5g in your house means
03:20 five gigahertz 5g in cell phone means
03:25 fifth generation so completely different
03:29 concepts you can survive 5g in your home
03:34 much more safely than you can survive 4G
03:38 or 5g but there are more distinctions
03:43 about this the 2g and 3G lacked the
03:49 frequency capability and amplitude to go
03:53 into your flesh and penetrate your skull
03:55 before G and 5g walks right into your
03:59 brain
04:00 5g is developed at three different
04:02 levels lobe and medium pan and heibon
04:09 currently the implementations around the
04:11 world are mainly aimed at mid band
04:14 because low band is going to be
04:17 generally a tiny upgrade from 4G and of
04:20 course as they're selling you this big
04:22 upgrade they need it to be a big pop in
04:26 download capabilities right high
04:30 bandwidth 5g is very rare at this point
04:33 and they're still developing and they're
04:35 still working on it
04:36 but it's going to be way way higher than
04:42 the previous technologies the lobe and
04:47 medium band and high band are
04:50 orders of 10 typically in capability
04:53 spectrum of broadcasting signal to your
04:56 house remember when I told you that 5g
05:00 was a centimeter in my previous video if
05:03 you saw it turns out that's just medium
05:06 band that high band is a millimeter well
05:11 it's an order of 10 metric system so
05:15 your low band 5g is 10 centimeters so
05:20 why do we want this you know well why do
05:23 we carry around surveillance devices
05:25 cameras on both sides many cell phones
05:29 like the iPhone models you can't even
05:31 open them up to turn them off they're
05:33 always on and as long as their assistant
05:35 infinitesimal amount of power in them
05:37 things can happen on your phone that are
05:40 way beyond your permission envelope the
05:45 cell phone manufacturers are in cahoots
05:47 with the software developers as well as
05:51 the carriers themselves that provide the
05:53 signal when Mark Zuckerberg goes into
05:56 the Senate hearing about his technology
05:58 and has to admit that even after you
06:00 uninstall Facebook the listening looped
06:04 of Colonel software is still on your
06:06 phone I believe he also admitted that
06:10 they do listen to the microphone even
06:13 when the apps not running to harvest
06:15 keywords to make sure when you do launch
06:17 the phone and go back into Facebook they
06:21 can give you advertising that matches
06:22 your conversation oh my gosh I just
06:25 talked about needing a new TV and booth
06:28 there's a little ad for a TV isn't that
06:30 amazing and that's what people were
06:33 worried about initially but they don't
06:35 really take it the next step which is to
06:37 say what if they're trying to track all
06:40 kinds of other metrics whether or not
06:42 you're awake you know certain keywords
06:45 you say the Federal Reserve say 911 you
06:48 say false flag you say crisis actor all
06:50 those things will be harvested up to
06:54 make you an enemy of a corrupt state
06:58 given the the ever lasting flaw of our
07:03 genetic capabilities
07:04 this point to be anything but a computer
07:07 meaning we have greed we have lusts but
07:10 we have you know think about the human
07:14 body for one second without any cell
07:16 phone technology on it if you are you
07:20 know when the luck of the draw you're
07:21 born healthy and then you get you stay
07:26 healthy up to a point and then as you
07:28 just more and more processed foods and
07:31 you're exposed to all kinds of
07:32 electromagnetic radiation you got dirty
07:36 planes in the sky dropping clouds you
07:41 get more and more sick toxically then
07:44 about 40 you start noticing the
07:47 faculties of your body start to fall
07:49 apart maybe through toxins maybe just
07:53 you lose your eyesight a little bit as
07:55 you get into your 40s you start getting
07:57 inks and pains or whatever it might be
07:58 and then any congenital problems meaning
08:01 birth defects that take a long time to
08:04 happen like a heart problem or some
08:07 other issue it's going to eventually
08:09 manifest over 50 60 years and it will
08:12 start to be maybe one of your causes of
08:14 death if you don't change your habits
08:16 and take into account what would
08:18 counteract that congenital problem okay
08:23 that's what that cell phones that's our
08:26 life right now
08:27 now maybe you're like hey I live in the
08:30 Ozarks I live in a real rural community
08:34 where cell phone reception scorable I
08:36 eat all organic food that I grow I have
08:38 a greenhouse over it so it doesn't get
08:40 aluminum oxide barium oxide and
08:42 strontium out of these planes I've got a
08:45 copper Faraday cage inside my house so I
08:47 don't get any outside waves that I don't
08:49 want so then you're only facing your
08:53 natural deterioration over time stress
08:56 is also an issue so you have to keep
08:58 that out of your life as well which
08:59 means you have to be mentally balanced
09:01 you can have no stress for two reasons
09:04 ignorance is bliss Stressless life which
09:08 if you can pull it off pull it off you
09:09 would be watching the show if that was
09:11 your makeup or you're like us where you
09:14 believe the truth with the capital t no
09:16 matter how harsh
09:17 how crazy it might be you're gonna
09:19 listen to all stories make your
09:21 deductions and still fall asleep and you
09:25 might sleep a little deeper because just
09:28 having the truth was a relief in the
09:29 first place
09:30 okay so let's dive into some technology
09:33 here in 1967 the DoD conducted
09:38 experiment I think under the guise of
09:41 the project bazaar which has been partly
09:44 Declassified where they studied the
09:48 effects of micro microwaves
09:52 you know these ultra high frequencies
09:54 against the human body and they were
09:57 able to isolate 1967 four different
10:00 states of mental change ranging from
10:03 being super docile to feeling drunk and
10:08 I'm gonna link in the description below
10:10 a great video that has where I got a lot
10:13 of this information so I'm gonna give
10:14 the guys who cry I can't remember how to
10:15 say his name it's just really crazy
10:17 Channel but the guy is a good source
10:21 brilliant dude so it's been 53 years
10:24 since that experiment was conducted so
10:28 what did the inside of a television look
10:30 like in 1967
10:32 I'll have big tubes in it big giant
10:36 capacitors look like little m-80s we
10:40 weren't down to an integrated circuit
10:42 level we certainly didn't have
10:44 miniaturized circuitry and now we do all
10:50 righty
10:52 what was the corruption level of the
10:54 United States government 1967 it's a
10:57 decade where they killed four people in
11:00 five years John F Kennedy Malcolm X
11:04 Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy
11:06 and those are just the big ones so it
11:10 was pretty damn corrupts back in 1967
11:13 would you say that we are less corrupt
11:15 today or more corrupt today oh I don't
11:18 even have to stress the answer you know
11:21 the answer okay I use a an app on my
11:27 android which is actually very powerful
11:29 I believe is called brain fm
11:31 brain dot F M and this is going to help
11:34 you understand the 5g technology so bear
11:37 with me for a second what's really cool
11:39 about this app and it was brought to me
11:41 by a friend of mine up in the northern
11:44 North Bay San Francisco area really San
11:47 Jose area very accomplished dude he said
11:51 he uses app to calm down because he's
11:52 very he's very ADHD a DD and this is
11:57 what he'll tell you to your face and he
12:00 said he started using this and he goes
12:02 well you know it plays music into your
12:04 ear based on what State of Mind you want
12:06 to be in and I said okay well that's
12:09 how's it work and you know because I've
12:11 got that you know I've got all kinds of
12:13 different things that are promised to be
12:14 me go to bed or whatever have a better
12:17 nap or something because this one's
12:18 completely different what this one does
12:21 and this is not a this is actually a
12:24 fine technologies for your brain because
12:26 it's using your natural hearing
12:28 frequencies and not some super
12:31 penetrating frequency you get a nice set
12:32 of headphones okay and what it does is
12:35 it plays two frequencies to different
12:39 frequencies in each ear with music kind
12:42 of centered in the middle of your head
12:44 and what they found out was that in
12:46 order to create a state change in the
12:48 mind they create a harmonic between two
12:51 different frequencies and it's that
12:54 harmonic that creates the change inside
12:59 your head
13:01 very interesting well the DoD
13:05 came up with a name for their technology
13:08 because they also to figured out a
13:11 harmonic state change technology with
13:15 their broadcasting waves of the human
13:18 brain
13:19 it's called harmonic sympathy you can
13:23 look it up because they've written about
13:24 it and it's part of this I'll put a firm
13:27 project bizarre now remember I told you
13:30 that 5g has got a lobe and a medium band
13:34 and hybin apparently when you read about
13:39 harmonics sympathy you
13:44 would recognize that the bandwidths at
13:47 which low and high operate can start
13:51 creating this weapon they created back
13:53 in 1967 accepted a much more efficient
13:56 rate but did you know that once you buy
14:01 a 5g telephone this is what I just
14:04 learned makes complete and utter sense
14:07 even though your phone runs on milliamps
14:10 because all the components in the phone
14:12 are so teeny tiny they don't need much
14:13 in the way of amperage to move the
14:17 electrons to create the logic in the
14:18 circuit with a 5g phone held up to your
14:23 head or within proximity of the poles
14:25 that come out of the phone they can also
14:29 create this harmonic sympathy out of
14:33 your phone without the receiver on the
14:35 other end participating in the situation
14:38 now I think most of you know by now but
14:41 if you don't in case this is the first
14:44 time you've ever seen this show and you
14:45 certainly didn't catch the other show
14:47 cell phone technology creeds tumors in
14:50 the human body and it creates tumors
14:52 wherever you store it routinely in your
14:56 body so ladies if you think it's real
14:58 cool to store your cell phone and your
15:00 sports bra while you're running down the
15:01 street cig listen to your favorite song
15:03 you were going to get cancerous cells
15:05 inside your breast exactly where the
15:08 phone is my kid who went to college for
15:12 chemistry she thought you know maybe
15:15 your dad's crazy so she ended up doing a
15:17 report on this she found the actual MRIs
15:24 of the human body in the shape of cell
15:27 phones and women's breasts and became a
15:30 believer instantaneously with the two
15:33 other places that you get cell phone
15:38 cancer is over the ear of the
15:42 predominant ear you used to take a phone
15:44 call and the salivary gland in your jaw
15:46 on the predominant side of your head
15:49 that you take a phone call I can't name
15:52 the the actress for just sensitivity
15:55 reasons but there's a ultra famous ledge
15:58 Andheri very respectable actress in
16:00 Hollywood whose niece came down with a
16:05 batch of tumors I think over her left
16:09 ear and they were benign thank God so
16:12 they did a little surgery and get them
16:14 out of the head
16:14 thank God the skull was protecting the
16:17 rest of the body from it really
16:19 metastasizing going around the body but
16:22 after the surgery which was very quick
16:26 comparatively speaking
16:28 she was sitting up in bed and the family
16:30 was in the room during the recovery
16:31 process coming off her painkillers and
16:34 anesthesia and all that and they finally
16:36 said you know well what we want to know
16:38 is how did she get this she's so young
16:41 apparently I think she was in her 20s
16:43 and the doctor just looked at her and
16:47 said well make a phone call she was what
16:53 he goes make a phone call right now and
16:55 so she picks up her phone and does one
16:57 of these he goes that's exactly how you
16:59 got it and they said well how does that
17:02 work and he says well the power supply
17:05 inside the phone that creates the
17:06 magnetic pole around the phone in order
17:08 to create an antenna instead of virtual
17:11 antenna goes around the phone the cell
17:15 phone tower interrupts that pole to
17:18 create an on-off null state for the data
17:21 stream he said that stuff is going into
17:24 your skull especially when you hold it
17:26 really close to your head now if you got
17:28 a headset and you keep it away from your
17:29 body you're gonna do much better but
17:33 anytime you've got that phone on your
17:35 body even if you have a headset the
17:37 phone next to your body is still doing
17:38 its job the further you're away from the
17:41 cellular tower at any moment especially
17:44 if you have like one bar which you know
17:45 what happens all the time all day long
17:47 the pole around the phone can be four
17:50 times the size of the phone and a lot of
17:54 people misunderstand what four times
17:56 means when you have 1080p television you
18:00 go to a 2k television that's for 1080p
18:02 z' when you go from 1080p to 4k okay
18:08 well it's four times four it's sixteen
18:10 1080p phones
18:11 so when I say it's four times the amount
18:15 it's a big giant pole around your phone
18:18 if you think that's tinfoil hat well
18:20 there was a guy that actually created an
18:23 app in the App Store before Steve Jobs
18:25 died I think around 2010 and he got his
18:30 app thrown out of the store because his
18:31 app simulated by looking at the voltage
18:34 drop in the phone aka the amount of
18:36 power being consumed by the circuitry in
18:39 the phone he drew a picture around a
18:42 virtual phone on the screen to show you
18:43 how big the pole was at england point in
18:45 time so that you could be more safe with
18:47 the phone he got rejected he petitioned
18:51 the steep jumps said hey man what's
18:54 going on all I'm doing is informing them
18:56 about how the phone works not accusing
18:58 anyone of anything and Steve Jobs
19:01 replied not interested probably one of
19:04 the most nefarious aboveboard things
19:06 that the Belov Steve Jobs ever got
19:10 involved in salivary gland cancer well I
19:14 don't know if Ebert used a cell phone
19:16 much but that gentleman from Siskel and
19:19 Ebert the movie review show from the 70s
19:21 and 80s he died without a lower jaw
19:24 because he had salivary cancer that ate
19:26 up his face underneath the bone level
19:30 Adam y'all y'all from Beastie Boys died
19:35 of salivary cancer right here in his
19:38 lower left jaw yeah not conclusive but
19:44 I'm sure that being wealthy you would
19:47 have a phone the second that everybody
19:50 could have one and because he's a mover
19:52 and a shaker in the music industry I'm
19:54 sure people were ringing him off the
19:56 hook and they never told us that this
19:58 stuff was dangerous just like cigarettes
20:00 being prescribed by doctors back in the
20:03 50s
20:04 over the last century so once the high
20:09 frequency 5g is implemented which
20:12 apparently if they have installed let's
20:16 say these transmitters all around your
20:18 neighborhood and let's remember at a
20:21 medium bandwidth of 5g you get down to a
20:24 centimeter which
20:25 what my last episode was all about the
20:28 problem is it doesn't go through walls
20:30 very easily
20:31 it's like FM radio versus AM radio for
20:34 those of you who remember listening to
20:35 those bandwidths you could drive in a
20:38 tunnel with a Amon and he would still it
20:40 look crusty but you can still hear the
20:42 radio you drive into the town with FM
20:45 and it goes away because it's a tighter
20:48 band it can't wiggle its way into the
20:51 tone so 5g has a massive connectivity
20:55 issue and their solution to this problem
20:59 which is going to be fascinating for a
21:01 lot of homes that have you know an air
21:05 conditioning heating system between you
21:07 and the transmitter or a water heater
21:10 between you and the transmitter in your
21:11 neighborhood that's why they need 130
21:14 feet down hitting you from the other
21:16 angle on average the average human being
21:20 in this world living in a metropolitan
21:22 area in your bed will be hit by anywhere
21:28 from three to ten of these things per
21:31 second probably by nanosecond right keep
21:35 that in mind as you realize you have no
21:37 choice
21:37 these polluting systems are being put in
21:41 your neighborhood they're poisoning your
21:43 body and we're gonna get into some
21:44 biological issues here so they're
21:47 polluting your body and you have no
21:48 choice now if I told you that your tap
21:50 water wasn't good enough to drink or you
21:52 decided that whatever's in your tap
21:54 water you don't want to consume you can
21:55 have alternatives even if you look at
21:59 and you realize planes don't normally
22:02 leave trails in the sky that lasts all
22:03 day and turn into clouds and you decide
22:05 to stay in you'd be in most a year but
22:08 at least you could wear a filter or
22:11 something over your mouth if you really
22:12 want to be paranoid about it all right
22:15 but there is nothing you can do about
22:18 cellphone towers disturbing human body
22:20 and as a 4G we've got biological
22:23 problems that are manifesting like crazy
22:27 so they're gonna dump these 5 G's about
22:32 every 50 to 100 feet and down your
22:35 street it depends it depends on how your
22:38 streets
22:39 figured how houses are configured
22:41 whether their way up or way down there
22:44 and have different strategies for the
22:46 you know penetration of your home with
22:49 these things there'll be a medium and
22:51 low band initially but they were
22:54 brilliant they designed them to be
22:55 upgraded very easily with a little
22:59 printed circuit board replacement and
23:02 they'll get high band right away pennies
23:05 on the dollar high band is gonna go from
23:09 20 gigahertz all the way up to hundred
23:12 gigahertz you get is a billion remember
23:16 the world's natural Hertz is about nine
23:19 just nine denying number nine okay
23:23 during electrical storm like I said
23:25 recently thirty not even a hundred and
23:30 these towers are currently barfing out
23:33 billions the 5g network at your house
23:36 which stands for gigahertz is at five
23:39 billion Hertz okay do some math right
23:45 wonder why you can't sleep whenever
23:47 you're real nervous or have anxiety well
23:51 just do some math right some people are
23:54 more sensitive than others depending on
23:58 where you put your router in your house
24:00 you could drive yourself nuts if you're
24:02 like man I want that router right next
24:04 to my bed at night because I want the
24:05 fastest bandwidth and you know what's
24:08 funny is in my home when I first moved
24:12 here they dropped the router in my
24:18 bedroom it's like they go for your
24:21 bedroom as if there's no other choice
24:23 and what's stupid is the wire drops on
24:27 the other side of the house and
24:28 piggybacks this other wire on in my
24:30 house so they have then they dragged it
24:34 across the edge of my house all the way
24:36 back to the back room and punched a hole
24:38 in the wall and put it there so several
24:41 years ago when I had it replaced I said
24:43 no no no I don't want his [ __ ] to
24:45 take him down there I said drop it right
24:47 through the roof in there the guy
24:50 wouldn't do it he punched a hole into
24:52 the attic and took the
24:53 all the way down to the other side of
24:54 the house and dropped it behind my TV
24:56 now the wire itself doesn't cause a
24:58 problem it's just power just signal and
25:01 soul shielded you don't worry about it
25:03 but it makes me wonder if there they
25:07 just have this thing just put it in the
25:09 bedroom why well it works better in the
25:10 bedroom it doesn't it's just it'll work
25:12 better on you in the bedroom
25:14 so once High is implemented which will
25:17 probably be two to five years from now
25:20 again today is the day to act on this
25:23 today is the day to go I don't want this
25:24 [ __ ] on my neighborhood sorry neighbor
25:26 you can't download a 4k movie in 8
25:29 seconds which is what high will do for
25:31 you
25:32 medium just multiply that times 4
25:36 imagine that super duper high definition
25:39 4k movie which a lot of DVDs only have
25:44 2k blu-rays I should say ok so you get
25:50 down that whole thing and what is it 40
25:53 gigabits or something like that that's a
25:56 mega fast man so someone who feels like
26:00 they need the technology to get the
26:04 movie real fast they're gonna petition
26:06 for it and sadly that'll be the 51% with
26:11 the modulation of the high and the low
26:12 together of the 5g antenna creates this
26:16 harmonic sympathy spectrum ah
26:21 this is what I've been telling you guys
26:22 forever they can give you these obtuse
26:27 emotions the one that they really love
26:31 is they can zombify you right as this
26:33 other guy says they make you docile
26:36 complicit you can't fight back imagine
26:41 that imagine that Donald Trump is going
26:45 to make sure 5 G's all over the nation
26:48 at medium to low he's gonna drop out of
26:52 office let's say he stops at office in
26:54 2020 for whoever gives in there next is
26:57 getting told by the industry's oh my god
26:59 this is gonna drive trillions of dollars
27:01 of revenue in GDP but you're gonna drive
27:04 up the economy drive up the stock market
27:07 as soon as we flip these babies over too
27:09 high then what have they been trying to
27:12 do I'm just gonna take you down a
27:13 scenario real quick before we get into
27:16 the biological threats of the venn
27:19 making you docile right it boils the
27:23 mitochondria in your cell if it gets
27:25 really intense on your body the clear
27:28 part in your cell right they have been
27:33 wanting to take away our guns for ever
27:35 ever and ever but what stops them well a
27:40 billion guns in the United States of
27:42 America is keeping the entire world safe
27:45 now there's a billion guns and other
27:48 locations but they're all under
27:49 tyrannical leaders kings crown princes
27:55 warlords and jungles and and drug lords
27:58 and other things so those don't count
28:00 because they belong to nefarious people
28:04 but you know you've heard me lament or
28:08 wax poetic about you know what I would
28:11 do if someone tries to take my guns and
28:13 come talk to any American on planet
28:15 Earth so would happen if the police try
28:16 to take your guns the military try to
28:18 take your guns you're like well now
28:21 people and I have is gonna be expended
28:23 and then when I guess it's over they'll
28:25 probably kill me and take my guns or
28:27 they loose got a bunch of you know
28:30 militias ready to go that happens blah
28:32 blah blah blah blah okay so let's fast
28:36 forward five years trumps gone no matter
28:39 what Trump's gone and everybody has
28:43 these you know these notions that
28:44 everyone's gonna be pure as the winter
28:47 snow after he leaves cuz he's gonna
28:50 clean out the swamp and all that kind of
28:52 stuff
28:52 remember nefarious people never stop
28:54 pushing ever ever ever if I told the
28:58 deep state I said look okay in five
28:59 years storm but just just just totally
29:02 relax just don't take a poop or five
29:04 years okay in five years you're gonna be
29:07 able to take over the entire world
29:09 very good can you make the economy come
29:11 back and you give her the stupid virus
29:13 going around they would nod their head
29:16 in two seconds yeah
29:18 okay all right I got it yeah we will
29:21 watch the stock market tomorrow morning
29:23 we'll put a couple trillion dollars in
29:25 there and we'll bounce it back and we'll
29:27 tell everyone to relax to all those
29:29 corporations that we control to buy buy
29:31 buy
29:32 tell banks to give us 0% loans hell we
29:35 forgive everyone's credit cards blah
29:37 blah blah all right high bandwidth
29:42 Internet is everywhere they know that
29:45 people are going to be probably prone
29:49 culturally to fight the government deep
29:52 south Montana
29:54 Texas Utah every place they think
29:59 there's a little supercell of people
30:01 Orange County California but it's gonna
30:03 have a ton of these things cuz it's not
30:06 it's not do you have a gun in your house
30:08 it's how many do you have you know and
30:11 the day that you want to pull this off
30:12 no they'll create some event something
30:16 they just broadcast it at your house and
30:18 they can do it strategically okay hit
30:22 the 1200 block of Huntington Beach okay
30:25 and okay your ride you're good to go
30:27 okay and they start knocking on the
30:29 doors
30:29 everybody's incapable of answering the
30:33 door
30:33 that's how wiped out they are mentally
30:36 they're studying on their sofa it's
30:38 almost like a Twilight Zone where
30:39 someone pushed the little stopwatch
30:41 everybody stopped they don't kick in the
30:45 doors necessarily maybe they would why
30:47 create the mess just little master key
30:51 locks just open everything up walking
30:53 you know that they've registered their
30:55 gun but even if they haven't you got a
30:57 little metal detectors whatever the
30:59 process is all right next block turn off
31:04 that when I was like whoa what's going
31:05 on you know and poof your guns are gone
31:08 you know langree all you want it's you
31:11 got to drive your car into people that's
31:13 how powerful this whole thing is now
31:16 that's just assuming that the only
31:19 emotions they can give us are those
31:21 those basic ones all right but if they
31:26 want you to be chaotic and fearful if
31:30 you ever seen the movie
31:32 Jacob's Ladder was about the fact that
31:33 the United States government tested a
31:36 drug on soldiers in Vietnam to make them
31:39 killing machines and unfortunately right
31:43 after the I think it was weed did they
31:45 smoke that was laced with this stuff
31:47 they killed each other I read the book
31:50 about the screenplay written by the guy
31:53 wrote the screenplay and he insinuated
31:56 heavily that was based on a real event
31:57 maybe some of you know about that I
31:59 don't so mind control is well within the
32:04 5 g territory now the other thing that's
32:08 um a concern because I've heard the 5 G
32:14 as the extinction event which is
32:17 obviously right in line with agenda 2030
32:19 I guess agenda 21 or it's as it's been
32:23 renamed agenda 2030 is about a world
32:25 that has 97 percent of the world erased
32:28 off the face of the planet dead okay so
32:34 what if as a part of this high-bandwidth
32:38 or even the hi bet with low bandwidth
32:42 modulation they're able to send a kill
32:44 signal everybody who gets hit by this
32:48 dies whoever manages to be in a basement
32:52 at the time when I just pick you off no
32:54 problem BLAP BLAP you did okay next they
32:59 could have Boston dynamic robots do all
33:02 the cleanup and all they do is they
33:04 outfit a robot with a nice sensor
33:07 spectrum array on the head which is a
33:09 you can see one of those in episode 2 of
33:12 Westworld season 3 it basically just
33:15 looks at homes and see see patterns
33:17 moving around you know what if they did
33:20 the kill switch at 8:00 p.m. I would
33:23 probably do it at 2:00 a.m.
33:24 by 2:00 a.m. pal okay so
33:28 96% of the neighborhood dies and then
33:33 they send the robots in in an hour or
33:35 two and why do that because human bodies
33:38 will be cold after they're dead
33:44 so then they look around at human size
33:46 heat patterns inside homes moving around
33:49 it's not a washing machine or an oven or
33:52 a dryer on because that's got a certain
33:54 shape so the robot just cancels that out
33:57 through pattern recognition they're just
33:59 basically I it knows okay keep that door
34:02 down
34:03 shoot or just shoot because maybe you
34:05 have a 60 caliber rifle or even more it
34:07 goes right to the house and you're dead
34:10 once they see the figure fall next house
34:14 clean out now that might sound extreme
34:18 but then again are these people casual
34:23 deep Staters do they do casual things
34:26 okay how many school massacres do you
34:28 have to see how many mall massacres do
34:30 you have to see to understand that these
34:32 people play for keeps
34:33 how many 911s df2 see how many
34:36 coronaviruses to see so current 4G
34:40 technology has been documented as being
34:41 a health threat to human beings like in
34:47 France a year ago a year and a half ago
34:52 said that they were pulling all cell
34:54 phone towers out from around schools
34:56 because they realized since they were
34:58 installed children had aptitude problems
35:02 their scores went down a lot of reports
35:05 of sort of a DD ADHD behavior and so
35:10 they were supposed to be pulling them
35:11 all out of the areas and then going all
35:14 wired Ethernet for any computer lab or
35:19 anything that needed connectivity the
35:20 office spaces or whatever okay
35:24 now ever since technology like this came
35:27 out scientists I believe in the two
35:31 reports were in Australia a couple
35:34 different cell phone manufacturers
35:36 actually had some reports that got out
35:38 in Europe I think it was Nokia's group
35:41 released a report as well but they had
35:43 figured out that this was fully capable
35:46 okay of eventually creating mind control
35:50 technology inside the cell phone manual
35:55 that's I guess a software manual inside
35:57 of our tell
35:57 phones which none of us have ever seen
35:59 it must be down inside the you know
36:02 settings information and there's
36:04 probably 50 layers deep to get to it
36:07 they have said to you in the manual keep
36:10 the phone at least three-quarters of an
36:12 inch away from your head which is about
36:14 two and a half centimeters okay nobody
36:18 does it nobody even knows that warnings
36:20 in there I have a very close friend of
36:23 mine who lost his wife to breast cancer
36:25 and she just happened to jog with one
36:28 exactly over her left breast where she
36:32 got the first diagnosis and the doctor
36:37 said oh it's nothing didn't get a biopsy
36:41 on it and then year later she got the
36:45 cancer diagnosis and I think three or
36:49 four years later she died in her house
36:52 way before her time but now I've said
36:56 this thing very recently so many times
36:59 that the the average listener of the
37:02 show will be bored of hearing it again I
37:05 would say that if you haven't repeated
37:07 it to someone else then you need to hear
37:09 it again
37:10 but the Journal of American medicine has
37:12 published the connection between
37:15 diabetes and cellphone 4G it has to do
37:20 with the metabolism shouldn't say
37:23 metabolism it has to do with the
37:25 marriage of insulin with sugar molecules
37:28 in your body
37:29 so very quickly diabetes is obviously a
37:33 situation where you don't manufacture
37:35 enough insulin to process sugar but a
37:38 lot of times you just go what is that
37:40 right well yours truly and my game
37:43 company we had a client for four years
37:45 called diabetes games and we had to make
37:47 video games that taught diabetes
37:50 patients about their conditions and also
37:52 stuff so I got a really amazing
37:54 long-term crash course because I had to
37:56 make games around the mechanics of
37:58 diabetes they no longer are in business
38:00 unfortunately sugar cannot enter a human
38:04 cell by itself the human cell thinks
38:07 it's a foreign entity and will not allow
38:08 it in but it
38:11 it likes insulin insulin has the key you
38:14 know the password to the speakeasy right
38:16 and so insulins job is to surround a
38:22 sugar molecule and smuggle it into the
38:25 cell so that could be used as energy
38:28 it's a beautiful process that works most
38:30 the time okay a 4G tower currently has
38:38 the capability of penetrating your body
38:40 when you're eating sugar and it will
38:44 because it's a vibrating frequency
38:46 already goes up and down like a sine
38:47 cosine wave it can infiltrate your body
38:51 and as the insulin is releasing into
38:54 your bloodstream to capture the sugar to
38:57 push it into your cells it misses the
39:01 sugar molecule it's marriage process of
39:06 like hey I'm Lea let me wrap around you
39:07 it doesn't happen again I always tell
39:09 you it's like someone shaking your elbow
39:11 when you're trying to eat food you spell
39:13 all the food out of your off your fork
39:15 or spoon right same exact concept so
39:19 diabetes is on the rise in the in the
39:22 modern world because of 4G technology
39:25 but where's the you know five o'clock
39:28 news on this it is utterly and
39:31 completely suppressed and why because
39:34 the intelligence agencies around the
39:36 world make sweet love to 4G technology
39:39 every day they think that lucky stars
39:42 we're all carrying around our
39:43 surveillance devices with us I mean
39:46 think about it cell phones really
39:48 improved your life that much I would say
39:50 on average you angst every minute that
39:55 you laugh right so you have 50% of your
39:59 time this is if you're lucky if you
40:02 don't have a Twitter account you spend
40:04 50% of time laughing at a meme and 50%
40:06 of time arguing about something online
40:08 or having inks that you haven't proven
40:10 to the world that your life is actually
40:12 way better than it really is
40:13 all those syrupy crappy pure sugar ways
40:19 of communicating with the world
40:21 the less friends you have my life the
40:23 more virtual friends you want online now
40:26 sometimes it can you know definitely
40:27 yield some beautiful things trust me I
40:29 understand but at the expense of your
40:33 longevity it's sort of set now the other
40:41 one is just electromagnetic fields in
40:43 general if it wasn't on planet Earth in
40:47 1800 the Year 1800 that precedes
40:51 Telegraph telegram technology right if
40:55 it didn't exist in 1800 it should not
40:58 exist today in terms of anything that
41:00 you're exposed to that you do not have
41:02 the ability to immediately stop there we
41:05 had other problems back in 1800 but some
41:09 of that's just us growing up and
41:10 realizing that you know bacterias and
41:14 viruses and all that other kind of stuff
41:16 just being relaxed about you know we're
41:18 getting good at sanitation and that sort
41:20 of thing but today we just swim in it
41:24 don't we
41:24 it's amazing we're still alive to this
41:27 day with as much crap that's going on
41:29 but you know if you go up against the
41:33 power industry you say look I think
41:34 those high tension towers behind my
41:37 house is responsible for me having
41:39 leukemia who you gonna sue you know walk
41:43 in Joe the Plumber and sue PG&E
41:46 Edison they'll stop you like a little
41:50 fly they'll buy that judge a jury or
41:54 whatever the hell they want if you can
41:56 even get the case heard so right now
41:59 Europe against juggernauts
42:01 and you're gonna lose but leukemia birth
42:05 defects hypertension all kinds of stuff
42:08 can be the results of getting utterly
42:11 enamored by this wave technology in 2020
42:16 as of right now which is think March
42:19 28th at this point we have seen the
42:24 power and intent and extent of which the
42:27 deep state will go I think everyone in
42:31 their country whatever whatever country
42:33 you live in even if you even if you're
42:35 mildly
42:35 wake to the nefarious factions that seem
42:38 to launch something on a particular day
42:40 and the whole world tanks about it or
42:42 what have you the news across the world
42:47 says the same exact words you know so a
42:51 news reporter in the BBC India New York
42:55 LA Sydney Japan will all say the same
43:00 words in their respective languages
43:02 because they've all been given it from a
43:04 central location that should show you
43:07 that there's a cabal to control your
43:10 perception of reality right the deep
43:13 stage chills that are currently trying
43:15 to exploit this corona thing and I hate
43:20 to put the krona thing in here but it'll
43:21 be a piece of history that we're all
43:22 gonna know so it's not a deal breaker
43:25 for an episode staying in here forever
43:27 but what have we seen we have been told
43:31 on you know one side of their mouth
43:33 everyone's dying in the whole world's
43:35 gonna you know lose like 50% of
43:37 population so change change change get
43:40 inside your house lock yourself in
43:42 tyranny tyranny tyranny and then the
43:45 other side of mouth are like we have
43:47 governors in the United States of
43:49 America that have refused patients the
43:53 ability to get the malaria drug that
43:55 literally kicks this thing's ass why
43:58 because they want it to spread they want
44:00 people to get sick they don't want to
44:02 have their state go off the statistics
44:04 of we got more bodies with Korona toe
44:07 tags on them they have a goal and the
44:12 United States Senate in the last seven
44:14 days they try to smuggle in complete
44:16 agenda21 deep state green New Deal's
44:20 and amnesty for you know thirteen
44:23 million illegal people in this country
44:25 because they're trying to throw a vote
44:26 they want mail-in vote capabilities so
44:32 they can throw the vote they are pushing
44:35 hardcore right now hardcore you have to
44:39 understand that every single one of us
44:41 especially those of us making nice
44:44 dissenting episodes on YouTube but every
44:46 single one of you they comments anywhere
44:49 that you know you can comment in two
44:51 different ways on something right
44:54 electronically you can get into some I
44:56 don't know the comments underneath an
44:58 article for instance you can be in a
45:00 forum somewhere or you can simply send
45:02 an email from one person to another your
45:06 mother your brother your sister you
45:08 could be texting is this really real I
45:10 think it's a hoax I remember mine you
45:12 can go back and forth if this world
45:17 switches over to a deep state-run
45:20 organization all this stuff is gonna be
45:23 harvested and it'll just be one person
45:26 after another being disappeared
45:29 just like they do in so many countries
45:31 around the world that stuff happens
45:33 every single day you know they track all
45:36 these statistics about how many people
45:39 died ignore Malou versus regular food
45:41 versus alcoholism heart disease drug use
45:46 or whatever rate the one statistic you
45:49 don't see very often is how many people
45:50 vanish off the surface of the earth due
45:52 to political dissent going to some North
45:56 Korean prison the Philippines you can
45:59 disappear a bunch of countries in Africa
46:01 you can disappear and the people will
46:03 tell you now you might think okay here's
46:10 what we need to do we're gonna form a
46:13 big giant petition unlocking great
46:15 anytime I see a petition online I'll
46:17 warn you it's a harvest mechanism for
46:20 dissent I sign that petition against
46:23 this I signed this petition against that
46:24 all you did was you gave the government
46:27 and these corporations your name and now
46:31 your target by those folks for the rest
46:34 of your life
46:37 remember that Facebook sold all of your
46:39 information and when I say all of your
46:43 information I mean every private chat
46:45 you've ever had with someone we know for
46:48 a fact that spouses are cheating on
46:51 their spouses because they'll send
46:56 inappropriate pictures of themselves
46:58 they'll be chatting with someone and now
47:01 I love you and blah blah blah but the
47:02 you know I'm sorry I feel like such a
47:04 whoring and I feel like such a dick I'm
47:05 cheating on my wife or whatever right
47:07 all those photographs all those private
47:10 text messages and everything you've ever
47:12 posted on Facebook was sold to Cambridge
47:14 analytics and guess what they can sell
47:19 it to whoever they want to and it's some
47:23 future point you could have some weird
47:25 guy knock on your door send you an email
47:28 say it's just like a black mayor episode
47:31 they can show you a picture that you
47:33 sent somebody and say okay if you don't
47:35 give me $100,000 in cash by tomorrow
47:39 this is going to your wife this is going
47:42 to your husband
47:43 it's going to your boss all because Mark
47:48 Zuckerberg sold everybody out unreal
47:51 right so this is the climate that we
47:55 live in harmonics sympathy it's a real
48:00 thing it was really explored it was
48:03 really weaponized and you know that's
48:07 another guy said you know waterboarding
48:12 exists right so you can weaponize water
48:15 you know you can drown somebody you can
48:17 do whatever you want with technology but
48:19 this stuff because when it becomes
48:20 absolutely a decision to use it in a
48:25 different way
48:26 you're already bathed that in these
48:28 frequencies right so they can use it in
48:31 a different way and you're all of a
48:33 sudden paralyzed in your house you're
48:35 dead what we don't know okay because who
48:43 would do the clinical studies on this I
48:44 mean you'd have to use it on animals of
48:46 some sort but it's not even fair to the
48:49 animals right but you know that you as
48:52 an adult you have a fully formed skull
48:55 it's hard it's bone tissue right and so
49:01 it has a little bit of resilience now
49:03 again for G and 5g you can penetrate
49:05 your skull right now low medium or high
49:08 they all goes inside your head but what
49:11 if you had a baby what if you had a baby
49:16 well we know that the bone tissue and a
49:17 child is pretty spongy especially in the
49:21 skull region as the three plates are
49:22 coming together that's why they have a
49:24 little soft spot on the top of their
49:25 heads right it just gotta be one of the
49:28 freakiest things ever okay
49:31 how does cancer work I mean it's full
49:34 cycle there's a few things I always
49:37 remind people about it's like cancer
49:39 leaves no receipt behind so you could be
49:42 eating some toxic food aspartame
49:45 margarine all kinds of other substitute
49:48 stuff because you're trying to be
49:49 healthy and everywhere every time you
49:51 walk away from organic foods you're
49:53 getting more and more sick it's just the
49:56 way it is you know it's one of these
50:00 things of like people who order Diet
50:02 Coke and be just gags me every time I
50:04 hear someone coke and we'll go over it's
50:06 like some 17-year old girl who's
50:08 perfectly fit and it's like just eat
50:11 sugar would you if you really need a
50:13 soda right now just do the sugar gets a
50:15 guess what you put on 10 pounds you can
50:17 go on to die and get rid of ten pounds
50:19 but you get a baseball-sized tumor right
50:23 next to your heart or inside your brain
50:25 [ __ ] man I don't need a marble sighs
50:27 [ __ ] man yelling you like that I don't
50:31 know between a marble and a BB size
50:33 tumor pushing on a few glands inside
50:36 your brain and you're gonna become some
50:37 stone-cold killer
50:39 let alone the lethal nature of it
50:42 killing you in the end so you can lose
50:45 fat but it's it's much more difficult to
50:48 lose the cancer because of all the
50:50 stress that's on your body so a big
50:53 class-action class-action lawsuit some
50:58 petition against this sort of technology
51:00 the only way and with the president that
51:03 says that we should have it and believe
51:05 me if we switch presidents it's only
51:06 gonna get worse it's gonna start going
51:08 high-band and it'll be a weapon for sure
51:10 okay so it's coming the White House
51:14 likes it I hope believe me the
51:16 intelligence agencies love it the DoD
51:19 loves it and every equivalent of those
51:21 organizations in your countries love it
51:24 you're talking about handing over the
51:26 keys to your brain
51:28 Wow I'm going to throw you some
51:35 possibilities just to illustrate how bad
51:39 this can go I talked about them zombify
51:41 on you and stealing your guns well
51:43 that's the endgame that's the [ __ ]
51:45 in-game
51:45 well it's America can't come and dig you
51:48 out of a tyrannical tiptoe problem it's
51:52 over it's totally over it became
51:55 apparent in some around the Snowden
51:59 defection timeframe remember Snowden
52:02 thinks the CIA is good and the NSA is
52:05 bad it's because the CIA was extremely
52:09 corrupted and wanted to knock out their
52:12 only opponent who's the bigger bigger
52:14 guy on the block which is the NSA and so
52:17 they sent him out to defame the NSA now
52:20 we also had a [ __ ] up FISA Court that
52:22 was allowing spying on a presidential
52:25 candidate illegally through this fake
52:27 dossier and all that stuff so that's
52:28 just heinous illegal be treasonous to
52:31 behavior but it became apparent around
52:34 the time that Snowden was talking about
52:36 the surveillance software that exists
52:39 that agents were documented let's just
52:44 say as using the spy software to look
52:49 into your homes to look into your
52:52 photographs to look in on be perusing
52:55 your telephone any television that had a
52:57 video camera on it any computer that had
53:00 a video camera on it your cell phone
53:02 which has one front back rate they would
53:05 walk into celebrity telephones and steal
53:07 other photos and then distribute them
53:09 just to kind of say look what I can do
53:11 and isn't this guy or this girl usually
53:15 always girls you know she deserves sort
53:18 of thing right but you had guys that
53:20 were addicted in the intelligence
53:24 consulting agencies to looking at other
53:27 people's stuff illegally all right so
53:32 now you give them the keys these
53:34 consulting firms right it's just like
53:35 you and I working for some place we've
53:38 got a nothing life so we have full-blown
53:40 we pass all the security clearances we
53:42 way up way up and then they give us the
53:44 keys to everyone's brains because that's
53:47 what the software allows so you're
53:51 thinking okay some crazy dude at the at
53:55 the right hour he can find out if
53:58 everyone's asleep or a week and if if he
54:01 finds a little neighborhood where
54:02 everyone's asleep no one even noticed
54:04 notices this happens he just sends out
54:07 the signal to paralyze them it goes into
54:10 their house takes advantage of them and
54:13 leaves I may put ski masks on who knows
54:17 who cares maybe they don't even have the
54:18 ability to remember what happened to
54:20 them time disappears but we have some
54:23 aches and pains when you wake up in the
54:24 morning this is why you could never ever
54:29 ever buy into this [ __ ]
54:31 especially that Kennedy said in his 61
54:34 speech where he talked about a secret
54:35 society he said to us right there that
54:40 they are going to say that they need to
54:43 do something for the sake of national
54:45 security which is the oldest trick in
54:47 the book again Picard called it out one
54:50 of the Star Trek's in the early 90s this
54:53 is oh yes you're gonna say that you need
54:55 national security provisions install
54:58 technology install surveillance stall
55:00 control mechanisms and tyranny grows
55:03 until it becomes the only game in town
55:06 now I've been talking about North Korea
55:10 a lot because I've been doing a lot of
55:11 like North Korean documentaries
55:13 eventually every one of us will go
55:16 through that little phase but since I'm
55:17 at home most the time now because of the
55:19 the the climate we're in because no
55:22 businesses are open to do anything else
55:24 with if you get to the point where you
55:27 start seeing some of these documentaries
55:29 where they ask people questions about
55:32 the outside world
55:35 okay they don't think of the outside
55:37 world really exists they know China
55:39 exists and South Korea because their
55:41 border countries outside of that they
55:44 think that they're the number one
55:46 strength in the world they have to they
55:50 get awakened every day at 6:00 a.m.
55:55 two speakers that play this really
55:58 bizarre track I guess was recorded
56:03 almost 50 years ago it wakes everyone up
56:06 in the morning and there's radios in
56:09 people's homes that you can't shut off
56:12 you can only turn them down and all day
56:15 long on those radios is propaganda they
56:19 are forced to believe that the Kim
56:21 family is essentially a supernatural
56:26 family with supernatural capabilities
56:30 kim ill sung the grandfather that become
56:36 jung woon if you read his documentation
56:39 about the guy they said that he was like
56:42 teleporting around the world in North
56:45 Korea fighting the Americans that's how
56:48 he he single-handedly beat the Americans
56:50 personally wasn't his troops they just
56:53 provide a little bit of backup but he
56:55 was teleporting around and beating the
56:58 Americans that's what they're forced to
57:01 believe and yet they can't get meals
57:05 every single day one of the kids had
57:07 defected to South Korea he said you know
57:09 I I kind of like all the stuff that's
57:11 around me but he goes all I care about
57:13 eating three times a day because that's
57:15 the only thing I think about this kid
57:18 was tortured his mother was killed in
57:20 front of him his uncle was killed in
57:22 front of him like in front of him has a
57:25 little boy he got to see this traumatic
57:27 stuff and he was tortured beyond your
57:28 wildest dreams man
57:30 and he's like pulls up his shirt he's
57:32 gotta go his back is all burned he's got
57:35 all kinds of stab wounds and all kinds
57:37 of stuff and the guy makes Freddy
57:39 Krueger look like you know mother Teresa
57:42 terms of bodily injury so it's
57:45 interesting is is that if you bring
57:48 these cautions to your friends and
57:49 family they will one not believe in the
57:52 technology to that it can do anything
57:55 wrong
57:56 to that your government would never do
57:58 anything wrong because it hasn't
58:00 happened yet right they don't know
58:03 anything about agenda 21 which again in
58:05 America it's a conspiracy in Europe it
58:08 is
58:09 didn't meet about every year with giant
58:11 summits every decade but I can almost
58:13 assure you now the meetings are getting
58:15 really intense who would have ever
58:19 thought that Bill Gates and the John
58:21 Hopkins Foundation would have done a
58:23 three-week multimillion-dollar
58:24 simulation of the corona virus killing
58:26 65 million people in the world three
58:30 weeks before the corona virus was
58:33 acknowledged by China I mean where are
58:36 the cops
58:37 where are the arrests you know I mean
58:42 think about it if I'm trying to give you
58:47 an analogy that it's just if you do a
58:51 little little town analogy but let me
58:53 give you a big one some think tank in
58:57 New York City simulates okay August 2001
59:03 of a terrorist attack where planes are
59:07 thrown at the World Trade Centers one
59:09 hits the Pentagon one you know the
59:12 fourth one goes I don't know where maybe
59:15 the White House or something but every
59:17 single thing that happens on 9/11 they
59:19 absolutely simulate in the month
59:22 preceding 9/11 and then they publish a
59:24 bunch of YouTube videos of the
59:27 simulation and then that thing happens a
59:32 month later you mean to tell me if this
59:37 country was at nefarious to the [ __ ]
59:39 bone that the CIA the FBI the New York
59:43 PD wouldn't go in to find every single
59:47 one of the people that ran the
59:49 simulation the month before it
59:50 accurately predicts what's happens the
59:52 month after now thank God we're not
59:55 gonna lose 65 million people at least we
59:57 don't think so but brace yourself you
60:00 know again one of the worst scenarios
60:02 and I'm starting to see indicators where
60:05 potential candidates for president are
60:08 making predictions that something bad is
60:12 gonna happen and like some other virus
60:14 is going to get loose and take a bunch
60:17 of people out as if what they want to be
60:19 able to do in November say
60:22 your current president tried to get the
60:25 country back on track too soon I knew
60:28 because the deep state told me so that
60:31 they're gonna drop this big one so I did
60:32 a big pre I told you so a bunch of
60:35 tweets or whatever and now I get to
60:38 stand up for your election and take it
60:42 away from the current dude because this
60:45 was all orchestrated in the first place
60:48 now what could you do this all relates
60:52 to the climate that we're in that backs
60:56 up the concerns about 5g being used in a
61:01 nefarious way all right
61:03 but again supposedly just using high
61:07 band by itself even though it's got its
61:09 biological problems with diabetes and
61:12 stuff which might be even worse I mean
61:14 all of us can be diabetic in a day once
61:16 they turn these high banned high
61:18 frequency ones on medium can do it to
61:20 all 5g can do it to you okay just you
61:23 know can make you diabetic very quickly
61:26 your age and your body and all this
61:29 stuff is factored in a course how much
61:31 you eat sugar in the first place that
61:32 issue but most things in your body
61:34 metabolizes into sugar carbohydrates or
61:36 sugar complex sugar sugar sugar fat
61:39 never becomes a sugar but it harbors
61:42 sugar in your system but let's go back
61:45 to our analogy they simulate 911 a month
61:48 before it occurs then 911 a curse okay
61:52 so now you have a cause-and-effect model
61:54 I mean you should move in right away I
61:58 mean in August they should go this is
62:00 going on for three weeks you paid
62:01 millions and millions of dollars to fake
62:03 you know news feeds and radio broadcasts
62:07 and presidential updates the only kind
62:09 of you're faking it all because you're
62:10 simulating it just being a lot of money
62:11 orders right I mean I've been an example
62:16 about this a long time ago which is
62:17 important to remember as well especially
62:21 when they tried to blow off like a
62:22 Bilderberg meeting or something like
62:24 that back in the day when the most
62:26 powerful rich people in the world all
62:29 meet in one place to do something I
62:31 guarantee you
62:32 it's not to taste the strudel all right
62:36 Bill Gates does not just willy-nilly go
62:38 anywhere in the world for any reason the
62:40 dude's got agendas he doesn't just go I
62:44 like to buck into random preschools and
62:46 make sure kids are using computers he
62:49 doesn't give a [ __ ] about that Steve
62:51 Jobs was the only guy that ever had a
62:52 record like that nobody cares
62:55 he would go to a school district meaning
62:58 maybe if it's a big giant district it's
63:01 worth you know a billion dollars was a
63:03 computer and software sales maybe maybe
63:06 he cares about that right now okay so
63:09 911 finishes up its finished now the
63:12 Intelligence Agency goes oh my God look
63:14 at this simulation because we're good or
63:16 a good government agency and they go and
63:19 arrest every single one of the people at
63:22 the simulation they hold them in
63:24 separate cells maybe even separate
63:26 locations and they start an
63:29 interrogation they start the charges
63:32 they start potential sentencing letting
63:35 them know you're gonna spend life in
63:37 prison and matter of fact two or three
63:38 of you might be put to death how you
63:41 want to roll this man you got kids right
63:43 yeah mmm well guess what their life's
63:45 gonna be like because all your money's
63:46 gone man
63:47 your kid's gonna be out in the [ __ ]
63:48 Street there's all your money's gonna be
63:51 used to pay for the cleanup of this mess
63:53 and so what kind of questions would you
63:56 ask well whose number to work for right
64:01 who do you work for what's going on and
64:04 then without even asking them anything
64:06 you you file a true-blue FISA Court
64:10 application for NSA data and you get it
64:14 all every single communication they've
64:17 ever done every video chat they've ever
64:19 done everything and you've stitched
64:25 together as much as you possibly can and
64:27 if you need more information to put
64:29 these people away then you go for your
64:30 interrogation which is time-consuming
64:32 and cost a lot of money but you want to
64:36 always arrest the person above that
64:38 person right who do you work for when
64:41 you bust a drug dealer they don't give a
64:44 crap about the customers that come and
64:46 buy the drugs from that
64:46 person and maybe it'll scoop them up for
64:48 whatever reason fill up the for-profit
64:51 prisons that we have all over the world
64:52 but they want the kingpin and then they
64:55 want that guy's kingpin and they want
64:56 the drug lord at the very top that's how
65:00 it works and so you move up the chain
65:02 alright or were the arrests for event
65:05 201 I mean you can at least detain
65:08 someone for questioning
65:09 no charges detain you for questioning
65:12 why did you just happen to simulate this
65:15 virus that's supposedly going around the
65:17 world and that's the fabric of the
65:20 universe right now in 2020
65:24 it's unequivocally deep state so yeah
65:30 when some of us see the Paris protests
65:34 even though they're not necessarily
65:35 going for agenda 21 problems maybe they
65:38 are maybe they aren't at least there is
65:40 the sign that humanity still exists we
65:45 love freedom we love freedom it's just
65:49 part of humanity doesn't mean you don't
65:52 work together with other people but you
65:55 do want your own space at some point
65:57 even if you live with four or five other
65:58 people your little room be a little
66:00 session in the bathroom it's your little
66:02 moment of freedom you walk out to go to
66:04 work in the morning no one's following
66:05 you you like your freedom get in your
66:08 car and you can drive wherever you want
66:09 yeah I think I'm gonna get a hamburger
66:10 today know what a hot dog today I don't
66:12 want anything today
66:14 it's your choice you're free so back to
66:18 the 5g surveillance what did China also
66:23 debut last year which is today I believe
66:27 mandatory 2020 was the year that turns
66:30 on mandatory the Social Credit System
66:33 what is that I have a whole episode on
66:37 it if you're interested it's in this
66:38 season I believe it's based off a black
66:41 mirror for God's sakes because they knew
66:44 what was coming
66:45 those writers knew that this technology
66:46 was coming this is where you rat on your
66:49 neighbors and of course there's some
66:52 jerks out there that probably should get
66:54 some you know Scarlet Letter treatment
66:56 where it's like this person is always
66:58 lying this person steals this person
67:00 cheats you know whatever and whatever
67:03 way cheating might happen so maybe but
67:07 now imagine that your neighborhood is
67:09 actually pretty cool everyone's pretty
67:11 chill
67:12 all right well someone's walking around
67:14 taking all these you know statistics in
67:17 which are gonna be completely automated
67:18 within six months to a year no problem
67:22 you don't need people walking around
67:23 asking questions if someone's been a
67:24 baddie but let's say don't let me let me
67:29 share something with you about North
67:30 Korea one of the things that happens in
67:33 North Korea is that every single day
67:37 that you go to school go to work there's
67:40 this ritual which is part of the Kim
67:42 family philosophy that you are not to be
67:45 as perfect as the Kim family so in order
67:49 to prove that they have these rituals
67:52 every single day at least in the more
67:55 modern Pyongyang areas but it supposedly
67:58 it's all in the rural areas as well
67:59 where you have to get up every single
68:00 day and say what you did wrong in the
68:04 last 24 hours
68:06 it's so bad that these no one seems to
68:11 agree to turn it off that's the thing
68:13 there's always some person in the room
68:15 going well if you know you guys don't do
68:17 it I'm gonna tell on you then I'll get a
68:18 bunch of rewards and you guys get much
68:20 penalties one of which is going to these
68:22 concentration camps for a fixed amount
68:24 of time if not forever so one of the
68:30 little secret things they do to get
68:31 through this little thing is that
68:32 they'll pair up outside the meeting and
68:36 someone will say okay so here's what you
68:39 say you did that I'll say you did that
68:41 or all accuse you of that you accuse me
68:44 of this we'll both say we're sorry and
68:46 then the day can begin and they make
68:50 sure it's not something that's going to
68:51 come with any penalties because they
68:53 know how the system works they know
68:56 people disappear there so the Internet
68:59 of Things which is the sort of
69:00 underlying platform lie of why you need
69:04 5g because they need more register you
69:06 know more IP addresses and blah blah
69:08 blah
69:09 you don't need 5g to do that but they
69:13 want to know when your televisions on
69:14 when your computers on they want to know
69:16 everything your devices are doing if you
69:18 change the channel they want to know if
69:19 you look up this website they want to
69:21 know if you type the dirty word they
69:22 want to know you're on the dark web well
69:24 they're gonna know everything you're
69:25 doing everything you do before it gets
69:27 encrypted on some flimsy VPN it was
69:30 really funny they just released a report
69:32 from Apple that the previous operating
69:35 system that was on every iPhone and iPad
69:38 was breaking every single VPN that you
69:41 tried to use haha I got friends I think
69:46 they're real secure a VPN is keep
69:48 telling them you're smoking dope man but
69:52 when you're in a social credit system
69:53 and your neighborhoods cool no one's
69:56 breaking any rules well there's an off
69:58 chance you won't have one [ __ ] in
70:00 your neighborhood but now what if
70:02 somebody learns that if you turn someone
70:05 in for a crime there's a reward maybe
70:09 it's just you get more social credits
70:11 that's more accessed bullet trains and
70:14 finer meals and privileges right if your
70:17 rent goes down who knows how they can
70:19 ascent avise you all right well this has
70:22 happened several times in history the
70:24 nine hundred year three three-part
70:26 Inquisition was a big debut of this
70:29 formula people were so worried that they
70:34 were gonna get told on during the
70:35 Inquisition which basically meant you
70:37 didn't believe that Jesus Christ was
70:39 your Savior because he was really real
70:40 so they had to spend a thousand years
70:42 counting it literally into your head
70:45 using mercenary troops for the Pope the
70:49 people would tell on people if they
70:51 suspected that they were gonna get told
70:54 on first so imagine you got Bob and Jill
70:57 great Bob it's just kind of a weird guy
71:00 doesn't seem to be very happy but he
71:05 he's actually Minds his own business
71:07 he's just one of those kind of guy he's
71:09 kind of a grumpy cantankerous guy
71:10 doesn't hurt anyone doesn't steal works
71:12 hard does his thing maybe doesn't like
71:15 his own face the Joe interprets that
71:20 wrong in says Oh mechanic guy's looking
71:22 at me funny again
71:23 he's gonna tell him he's gonna tell on
71:25 me because I'm doing this one thing that
71:27 no one knows but he's gonna tell on me
71:29 so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tell
71:30 on him first and then Joe will get take
71:33 it away I mean that sorry Bob gets taken
71:36 away great get out my name's messed up
71:40 so gets taken away okay no Joe thinks
71:45 he's totally cool until the next
71:46 neighbour moves in and that person wants
71:49 privileges so they telling Joe and he
71:51 gets taken away right so Social Credit
71:53 System is gonna collapse because the
71:56 only way you're gonna get more credits
71:58 is to tell on someone at one point
71:59 because all your low-hanging dissidents
72:02 they're gonna get scooped up and killed
72:04 organ harvested or gone then the good
72:09 people will start getting schizophrenic
72:12 and paranoid and they're gonna start
72:14 just telling each other like crazy it'll
72:15 get to the point the system can't even
72:16 operate the guards will be tired of
72:19 beating people senseless they want any
72:21 more energy to crack another skull maybe
72:25 they start creating a meat grinder like
72:26 Pink Floyd the wall so you got 5g which
72:31 has the full spectrum capability of mind
72:34 control as long as your president is
72:37 someone you trust and who actually has
72:39 control over the government which no
72:40 president does okay and the idea is that
72:44 you could have people tap into this
72:46 technology I think I told you guys many
72:50 years ago that I sat in my lounge with
72:53 two guys that were in town to be trained
72:55 on sort of upgrading the computer
72:59 systems that control trains and Subway's
73:02 and they sat there two total nerds man
73:05 it's great we were kindred souls man but
73:08 the dudes I said well you know how how
73:11 vulnerable is the current system and
73:14 they said oh it's wide open that's said
73:18 okay okay well what's that mean I'm an
73:20 engineer tell me he goes well because
73:22 there's a control boxes all along a
73:25 particular railroad and he goes you can
73:28 just open the box put a lap up to laptop
73:30 right into one of the plugs you have the
73:33 right cable he said they're all USB
73:36 and he goes you can just start
73:38 controlling the tracks telling a train
73:41 that it can go when it can't go you know
73:43 it's gonna have a head-on collision with
73:44 another track and so he goes there's a
73:47 huge push right now to get everything
73:48 encrypted such that no one can do that
73:51 but he said it's gonna take decades to
73:54 do this without the military
73:57 participating well someone quickly
73:59 developing the technology because he
74:01 can't have the train stopped during an
74:03 upgrade it's gonna have to be very quick
74:04 you stop for a day to do a hundred miles
74:08 worth of track well how many millions of
74:10 miles of track do you think we have on
74:12 this planet it's a lot maybe not a
74:14 million but it's tens of thousands of
74:16 miles for sure all right
74:19 so they put these high bandwidth 5g
74:22 transmitters in your neighborhood and
74:25 our current thinking has been well only
74:26 the military would use it or you know
74:28 some secret society might use it and
74:31 you're right but the bigger problem is
74:35 yeah
74:37 Herbie the nerd walks right into the
74:40 system maybe he used to work for the
74:43 communications companies and he's gets
74:45 and some software he's not supposed to
74:47 have that he duped off the laptop and he
74:51 wants to steal your stuff in your house
74:53 he wants to rape your wife or your
74:55 husband whatever and he can do it maybe
74:59 even he wants to be a sycophant Joker
75:01 character and he just zaps a whole
75:04 neighborhood and kills him just to
75:07 create some chaos is to see the world
75:08 burn then 1 1 is it ever gonna get
75:14 printed in the news that's what happened
75:17 well you might hear someone so died in
75:20 their home woman was raped but you may
75:24 not ever hear a whole neighborhood
75:26 perish last night a whole neighborhood
75:29 got robbed last night
75:30 maybe maybe hear that story the 5g will
75:34 never be allowed in the story and you
75:37 know let me just put a little uh why
75:40 outside use two analogies here
75:44 when I started talking about aspartame I
75:47 asked you guys what if I brought you in
75:50 my kitchen and I had a container of
75:53 Drano and your favorite beverage your
75:58 favorite beverage not mine but yours and
76:01 I pour I make you watch me watch this
76:04 watch this I get a glass your favorite
76:05 glass and I pour a little bit of Drano
76:08 in the bottom and then I pour your
76:10 favorite beverage in and I hand you the
76:12 last night here drink this and you're
76:14 like no well why not your favorite drink
76:17 in your favorite glass because they
76:20 asked Drano in it you [ __ ] that's right
76:24 that's like drinking diet coke except it
76:27 works a lot slower gives you cancer over
76:30 time by the time they open up your
76:32 cancer-ridden body place formaldehyde
76:34 and metabolized methyl ester which is
76:37 rubbing alcohol you think you can sue
76:39 Coca Cola ha go try that one out and
76:43 you'll have an epiphany so if somebody
76:47 gave you a raincoat as a bunch of
76:51 electronics in it and there's a little
76:53 label inside the code that says make
76:56 sure that no drops of water go on the
76:58 inside of the coat otherwise you could
77:00 die well how many of you gonna wear that
77:05 raincoat none of you gonna wear that
77:07 raincoat if you have a sound mind why
77:10 because the very platform of the coat
77:14 itself could kill you very easily all
77:18 right so we're allowing an invisible
77:22 technology you won't even see these
77:25 routers man I mean you when you finally
77:28 figure out what they look like on your
77:29 street lights you'll finally notice that
77:30 lump that lump that lump the mirror was
77:34 talking about the idea that you know
77:36 birds will perch on these poles and if
77:39 it was just blatantly gonna kill you
77:42 then those birds would be dead and this
77:45 would be a problem they could they
77:47 couldn't put up just a pure lethal
77:48 technology up on a pole so we no pigeons
77:51 at the bottom of every pole or crows or
77:53 whatever that would be very evident
77:57 and so this high-low technology creating
78:03 this harmonic sympathy situation which
78:06 could be construed probably or
78:09 configured excuse me to be a lethal
78:11 signal Hey the birds are fine nah maybe
78:16 if we do the kill switch you have a
78:17 bunch of birds if they just happen to be
78:18 up there at night which they don't
78:20 typically go up there night right maybe
78:22 some birds on the bottom but there's
78:23 more dead bodies in homes anyway so what
78:25 do we care is it gonna be a clean up
78:26 operation as it is a friend of mine that
78:31 I know very well told me that his
78:33 buddies who are big investors in
78:35 communications companies have
78:36 essentially whisper damn he said they
78:39 said yeah the 5 G's the extinction event
78:42 and he said they thought they were
78:44 joking and then no one laughed and he's
78:46 like okay I don't even really want to
78:47 ask you the questions after that so
78:52 hopefully you have more information now
78:54 to review 5g is three bandwidths low
78:59 medium and high in the immediate future
79:02 low and medium are going out apparently
79:05 low and medium working together cannot
79:07 create this harmonic sympathy situation
79:11 but the high and the low could utter ly
79:14 destroy you as a human being
79:17 maybe not terminally stop your heart but
79:20 definitely could zombify you for
79:22 whatever they have up their sleeve DUIs
79:26 right imagine that it hit you with a
79:29 drunken state one and your rolls on
79:31 crashing your car they're not gonna come
79:33 and give you a DUI test they're just
79:34 gonna scrape you off the sidewalk and
79:36 consider it mission mission accomplished
79:39 straight remember the cell phone company
79:42 spend no money on clinical testing at
79:45 all there's none in their budget well
79:49 it's because humanity doesn't perceive
79:51 it as a threat as soon as you put a drug
79:54 in your mouth you perceive that as a
79:56 threat because you're putting it into
79:57 your biology and immediately you're
79:59 going to see whether or not it's going
80:01 to be cyanide or vitamin C okay we need
80:06 to upgrade our brains to understand that
80:09 any technology on
80:10 planet Earth whether it be your
80:12 television your telephone cell phone
80:14 towers your refrigerator whatever it is
80:18 it needs to be certified to be safe for
80:22 the human body if it emits anything and
80:25 just you know again like I told you your
80:29 cell phone with a 5g chipset in it can
80:34 create this harmonic frequency as long
80:36 as it can talk the upper and lower
80:37 bandwidth right inside your bedroom it's
80:40 not the tower doing it it's your phone
80:41 doing it with the internet of all things
80:44 how do you think that all these things
80:47 are going to communicate with the 5g
80:49 tower every single thing you own is
80:52 gonna have a 5g chipset everything so
80:58 the kill switch that could come from the
81:00 tower or the tower could never do it
81:03 maybe it's just every appliance in your
81:05 house kills you one day or makes you
81:08 docile whatever it does and we and
81:14 here's the other thing that's just nuts
81:15 right we have been sitting in an
81:17 environment since 9/11 which is 20 19
81:21 years ago and they've been telling us
81:24 that you know Russian hackers Chinese
81:28 hackers other hackers can get into
81:30 government systems they could shut down
81:32 power plants water plants whatever
81:35 anything is controlled by a computer
81:37 crash a train subway whatever you've
81:40 been told that you've even been shown
81:42 propaganda videos of this actually
81:44 occurring all orchestrated by people
81:47 trying to create fear okay someone hacks
81:52 into a system and make something go
81:55 wrong every single device in your house
81:59 has a 5g chip system in it I mean he'll
82:02 my TV talks to the internet doesn't
82:04 yours but now everything your toaster
82:08 your refrigerator everything is talking
82:11 to the internet of all things okay so if
82:15 we've done this technology they can do
82:18 this hi-low modulation then an outside
82:23 country
82:25 could hack into a neighborhood and do
82:28 all the things they just told you and
82:30 they're not even in your country so it
82:36 you know it's like storing propane tanks
82:42 in every single corner of your house if
82:46 they get you hot they explode you
82:49 wouldn't do that keep those things out
82:52 back by the by the grill right you don't
82:55 bring that [ __ ] inside the house I could
82:57 explode and kill you okay well we have
83:00 some standards in this world we've been
83:02 falling for a long time but surrendering
83:05 your household to 5g is coming and keep
83:11 they're going to make it a Jones me
83:13 thing and keeping up appearances thing
83:15 your neighbor who's an idiot is gonna
83:18 walk right into this and I may again
83:20 brag about everything my TVs 5g buy
83:23 refrigerators don't you have a 5g this
83:25 and 5g that and what if you're married
83:27 to someone then won't listen to any of
83:29 this information but you did and so your
83:32 spouse is like honey we got to have this
83:34 I'm gonna have that day I wanna be he
83:36 bought the jet ski I you know I had to
83:38 buy the better jiske you know the camper
83:39 and I had to buy the camper consumerism
83:42 algorithms drive this into your home if
83:46 you're susceptible and weak-minded so
83:50 one of the things you might start doing
83:52 if you're concerned about this and start
83:54 to brief your family members on the hard
83:56 core facts of this whole thing harmonics
84:00 sympathy is something you can look up
84:02 project bizarre suppose you can look it
84:04 up but this is a this is absolute
84:09 real-life facts about the technology
84:12 those of you who have ever considered
84:15 the super expensive process of putting a
84:17 Faraday cage in your house I mean that
84:20 would be very very expensive but quite
84:23 frankly it would stop this from
84:25 occurring if you're gonna be building a
84:27 house that's where I fight if I had the
84:29 money to build a new house I would embed
84:31 in every single wall
84:34 a copper mesh with cinderblock interiors
84:39 with sand in there and I pour maybe if I
84:43 could just put concrete right out right
84:45 inside the cinderblock and I build the
84:47 stucco on the outside or wherever the
84:48 hell I'm gonna drywall my house with on
84:50 the inside and I got a buddy of mine
84:53 with a house like this he doesn't have a
84:54 Faraday in his house but boy I told you
84:56 once before his house is bulletproof to
84:58 RF waves unbelievable so you might do
85:02 something like that it won't really stop
85:04 you riding on the plane driven by a
85:08 bunch of morons right into the ground so
85:11 you have this bulletproof house when
85:12 your neighbors are dead your neighbors
85:14 are all weird the robots coming the
85:15 military's coming the police are coming
85:18 yeah that's why we want to keep our
85:22 especially police officers and our
85:25 military SuperDuper educated about all
85:28 things all things that matter because
85:32 they swore an oath to protect the
85:34 Constitution United States in America
85:36 but they have to be the highest IQ
85:40 people we can find because the higher
85:43 your IQ the more you recognize the value
85:47 of freedom and sovereignty of being
85:53 people and not a person in America we've
85:56 had a huge cultural update to what is
85:59 actually possible and some of you will
86:02 not be on board with what I'm saying
86:03 bear with me please when Hillary Clinton
86:08 was running for president we had you
86:11 know lawyers and you know amazing
86:15 brilliant people coming into the smoke
86:17 lounge and they would either be one way
86:20 or the other but it was pretty much 80%
86:21 was saying well she's gonna win why they
86:24 go they said they would say look I hate
86:26 her guts but she's gonna win and say why
86:27 he goes well because the system is fixed
86:30 they're gonna throw the vote it's just
86:33 gonna happen you're just gonna have to
86:35 brace for it and so we're sitting there
86:37 room going but wait what if this time
86:39 around that doesn't happen and a better
86:43 person at least gets in there someone
86:45 who fulfills their promises at least you
86:47 know like as promised
86:48 but at least he fulfills them right and
86:49 of course the undeniable occurred and
86:53 what's really interesting is the folks
86:55 that really threw down have now come
86:57 back to the lounge it's really funny
86:58 maybe it's just serendipitous and so
87:02 what that did was again you don't have
87:04 to like Trump to get on board with this
87:06 analogy the idea is you saw all sort of
87:09 the impossible occur who would have ever
87:13 thought Hong Kong would have ever
87:14 protested with over a million people on
87:16 the street I would have never thought
87:19 that was possible even the protestors in
87:21 Iran very surprised to see that of
87:24 course they're probably all dying in
87:25 coronavirus right now the Paris
87:28 protesters it sounds like I couldn't
87:30 believe that Paris protesters would
87:32 occur but at the magnitude that they're
87:34 occurring it's phenomenal
87:36 utterly phenomenal again I'm not
87:39 completely familiar with every single
87:41 protests platform what they're looking
87:43 for what the demands are so I can you
87:45 know generally say I totally support
87:47 them or anything like that but it shows
87:49 that they're squeezing them out but
87:52 maybe they look at the algorithm like
87:53 this they may simply say well yeah who
87:56 cares I don't know what do you mean who
87:58 cares they're protesting aren't you
88:00 worried well how many people are
88:02 protesting and I say okay well you know
88:05 one person represents probably a lot
88:07 more people that aren't they're too
88:08 afraid to protest oh yeah whatever
88:11 multiply it apart where you want the
88:14 overwhelming majority of this world is
88:16 docile broke as a joke probably
88:20 two-thirds of this world are in a state
88:22 of poverty to an extent that they're
88:25 malnutritioned so badly that they can't
88:28 be concerned about 5g and burying
88:31 concepts like that even though that
88:33 might be their very demise so yeah we're
88:38 fighting only 1/3 of the world and you
88:40 what do you scraping out of the
88:41 one-third that you think are good you
88:43 know the people that understand freedom
88:44 maybe 5% if I really double your
88:47 estimates it's nothing you can wipe that
88:50 off the map if anything I'll hire the
88:52 two-thirds give them a ham sandwich for
88:55 a week and they'll take over the other
88:57 third that you're talking about
89:00 hence the invasion of Europe ends the
89:02 invasion of America ends the invasion of
89:05 Australia plenty of people who don't
89:09 have an IQ to recognize that they're
89:11 worshipping their own demise
89:13 but sadly a ton of people but I can tell
89:18 you that an idea is extremely powerful
89:21 so let's say this video gets watched a
89:24 thousand times in one week you guys get
89:28 on board and you pass the information
89:29 around it one of you tells to people and
89:32 you stress how important it is to repeat
89:35 the information I think it's pretty easy
89:36 to say so which is why I've kept this
89:39 really generic 5gs three bands two bands
89:43 are going out right away within two to
89:45 five years the third band will come in
89:47 which is high high and low work together
89:49 to create altered states of thoughts in
89:51 human being it was confirmed 1967 by the
89:54 DoD and project bizarre okay
89:58 you got it you did it write it down I'll
90:00 send you text it you needed us and your
90:02 chat whatever you need and it starts to
90:05 spread if you think they can handle it
90:08 let him know about agenda 21 go to Rosa
90:11 Cory's YouTube channel and get informed
90:14 pass that around
90:16 I mean again you know she I don't know
90:19 if she would hate me saying this or not
90:21 but she is the last demographic on
90:23 planet earth or whatever support the
90:24 President of the United States who's a
90:26 Republican she's a libertarian lesbian
90:30 who lives in Sonoma County California
90:33 least she used to I assume she still
90:36 lives there but that's just two
90:37 demographics that would not like dump
90:39 drunk typically and she's like this
90:42 dudes the only one fighting the Cabal
90:44 and maybe his administration but he
90:48 supports five G out of pure ignorance
90:51 there are stupid rumors out there that
90:55 were passed around about a year and a
90:57 half ago and I want to dismiss this
91:00 completely completely but somehow okay
91:06 the military and the United States of
91:08 America
91:08 rebates the 5g package
91:11 such that it will be no harm to human
91:14 beings oh really did you reveal the
91:18 human body the human genome so that
91:20 there's no diabetes there's no leukemia
91:22 and there's no other things ADHD ad D
91:24 brain issues no that's a bold-faced lie
91:29 to smuggle this crap in so be very
91:32 careful we do not need a platform that
91:36 can control mankind being installed
91:38 globally may be too late because we've
91:42 been too complicit or too passive
91:46 towards corruption I don't know how many
91:49 people you would have to arrest or what
91:50 kind of laws you'd have to pass to
91:52 protect us from this kind of stuff you
91:56 know forcing a communications company to
91:58 go through a clinical trial might be the
92:00 first step as an executive order then a
92:03 law or vice versa or whatever but it
92:08 needs to occur so anyway get out there
92:11 and pass that information around because
92:12 that's a bulletproof stuff that you
92:14 don't to be a tinfoil hat person to
92:16 enjoy I will put a link in the
92:18 description below of the guy that will
92:20 reinforce this for you he's an extremely
92:24 brilliant guy major Tesla enthusiast
92:28 never met him myself
92:30 but he's respected by some of the most
92:32 brilliant people I know so go take a
92:34 look and then start looking up stuff
92:36 prove it to yourself and then get to it
92:40 past these videos around 2 min I mean
92:43 I'm making this video primarily one
92:46 because I wanted update my own
92:47 brainpower but if I were to get my phone
92:50 out right now and scroll through the
92:52 amount of text messages of people asking
92:54 me of 5 G's bad I probably have at least
92:56 6 in the last two weeks so now I'm gonna
93:00 start passing them this video instead if
93:03 you have not been to deep thoughts
93:05 radio.com please go I could say all the
93:07 links are in the description below but
93:08 they're not the feeds for video are
93:12 youtube [ __ ] shoot and rarity on
93:16 whatever righty on
93:19 if you like podcasts all up there I'm
93:21 all caught up I've been coming up for
93:23 quite a while with the podcast I'm gonna
93:24 refine my pipeline a little bit so they
93:26 shouldn't be delayed as badly as they
93:27 have been in the past social media is a
93:29 lock Facebook group I am on Twitter but
93:33 we also have mines calm and gab calm
93:35 both those last two our First Amendment
93:37 protected copies of Facebook I like
93:40 mine's a little bit better than gab but
93:42 both them are pretty pretty decent
93:44 there's a couple of ways to donate to
93:46 the channel which is PayPal and patreon
93:49 patreon get you in the credits forever
93:50 20% discount on the store and you get
93:53 the episodes usually before everybody
93:55 else unless they're like special reports
93:56 which I feel need to go out immediately

94:02 public feed if you have old links to
94:04 season one they still work but that's
94:07 off on a different Channel all
