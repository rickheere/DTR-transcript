00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen tonight's one of those nights
00:34 where I feel like recording I'm not
00:36 exactly sure what to cover I do keep a
00:40 giant list of subjects but you know if
00:43 those were easy I would have already
00:44 recorded them sometimes I find the best
00:47 success that I have is relative to just
00:52 calming my mind and mulling over the
00:57 day's experience or the week's
00:59 experience and then just looking at any
01:04 emotion that I've had predominantly
01:07 throughout the week that is unresolved
01:09 because one of the things I tried to do
01:11 in the show you know is get at the
01:14 things that we're all thinking about but
01:16 no one's talking about and then reflect
01:19 on it and think about it I'm gonna give
01:23 you a little Jim out of my own life just
01:25 in case any of you are dealing with this
01:27 or have dealt with this other
01:28 successfully or unsuccessfully well the
01:32 wait for any of you who are able to
01:35 listen to what I'm saying and then
01:37 you're like oh I totally conquered that
01:38 I really need you to report in I need
01:42 your information other people need your
01:43 information so this might be a really
01:46 interesting little topic here this is a
01:50 very personal one for me to share with
01:53 you I think a lot of you will probably
01:57 have deduced if you're a longtime
01:59 listener that the regiment that I have
02:03 to keep personally in my life to do the
02:05 things that I do including this show are
02:08 fairly intense I had an episode way back
02:12 in season one I could see it's episode
02:14 14 that is called being intense and that
02:22 episode actually forged itself out of a
02:25 relationship I was in four years ago
02:28 which was a great relationship but this
02:30 person who I was dating was like god
02:32 damn like why do you have to be so
02:34 intense all the time
02:35 and what's funny about it is I don't see
02:39 myself as intense what I see myself
02:42 doing is discussing issues that interest
02:45 me and they're not trivial topics
02:48 because trivial things for me as
02:52 probably are the same for you it just
02:56 gets to be small talk you know it gets
02:58 to be what you would talk about at the
02:59 watercooler
03:00 it's talking about all the weather is a
03:02 particular way and there's nothing wrong
03:06 with having those conversations but they
03:09 have very limited lifespans right you
03:12 know how many times can you go on a loop
03:13 about something before you need to peel
03:15 off and change the subject and I don't
03:20 know about you man but I'm trying to get
03:21 all of the good stuff well I'm here it's
03:26 an interesting thing
03:27 I mean what's fascinating about it is
03:31 when I I talk to my friends and I say
03:34 well do you remember something you did
03:38 in say 2009 oh yeah yeah just moving
03:42 into this place I just got that card you
03:43 see out there did this okay I got this
03:45 belt buckle whatever it is and I say
03:47 well how how long ago does that seem to
03:49 you it all seems like yesterday okay so
03:54 time is moving and the older you get the
03:56 more it speeds up and I'm gonna give you
04:04 a little secret on how the brain works
04:07 because the brain erases patterns the
04:11 brain erases cliches how many times have
04:15 you driven to work and then you get to
04:17 work and you're like I can't remember
04:18 any part of that drive you ever drive to
04:23 work and or drive someplace through
04:25 residential and you think you did I run
04:27 a red light I couldn't run a red light
04:28 you know maybe we're late at night when
04:30 there's no cars helping you queue your
04:32 brain to look everyone else's stop I'm
04:34 gonna stop but it's really tonight and
04:36 you just go all the way home and you're
04:38 like oh my god I remember that and I
04:41 kind of do but I don't
04:43 it's because your brain is bored to
04:46 death and it erases
04:49 big giant chunks of your life because
04:51 it's like we don't need this we don't
04:54 need another memory of driving from
04:55 point A to point B when you do it every
04:57 single day why does time speed up when
05:03 you get older I think potentially it's
05:07 because your mind is erasing useless
05:08 patterns I watch television at this time
05:12 of day I get up I brush my teeth I do
05:14 this I do that I talk about the same
05:17 boring [ __ ] every single day and so your
05:20 life is being erased because you've
05:22 turned it into a trivial machine a
05:24 trivial pattern if you want to really
05:30 feel life change it change it I don't
05:37 mean run off and divorce your partner
05:39 and leave your kids behind I mean crazy
05:42 like that do something with those people
05:45 that you never done before explain this
05:49 phenomenon to them but I've done these
05:52 episodes about you know excellence
05:59 you know perfecting things and and
06:01 really putting in the Polish making
06:04 something really special if you're a
06:07 carpenter I'm gonna tell you as soon as
06:09 you get done with whatever the hell you
06:11 built for as much time as it took you to
06:14 build it spend twice as much doing
06:15 something else to it to polish it and
06:17 make it even better polish it varnish it
06:21 and broader the thing with carvings and
06:24 amazing things whatever it is if you
06:27 cook a meal well maybe presentation is
06:31 everything this time around maybe
06:32 instead of throwing it all on the table
06:34 at once it going have at it guys you
06:37 bring it out in a five-course meal
06:39 simply because there's five things to
06:41 eat whatever it is change it up improve
06:46 it experiment and watch how your
06:49 genetics literally activate mutant genes
06:53 for you to accomplish amazing things so
06:58 what this episode is gonna be about and
07:00 I'm not exactly sure what to call it
07:02 is when you make your life balanced with
07:07 this perfection mechanism with this
07:11 perhaps what you might entitle as this
07:15 intense nature you know what if you were
07:19 to be a person who's never exercised
07:22 you've never run in your life and then
07:25 some for some reason you either gain
07:27 interest in doing that sort of thing or
07:29 for whatever reason life changes then
07:30 you have to do that thing to survive you
07:34 know how it goes for the first several
07:37 days maybe a couple of weeks you think
07:39 you're gonna die and all sudden your
07:42 body just clicks and the mutant gene
07:45 activates and you're okay
07:46 I guarantee every kid that goes through
07:48 basic training is puking their guts out
07:51 at some point and thinking what have I
07:53 done
07:54 this is crazy I can't do this and then a
07:57 week or two or three in man they're just
07:59 like oh my god
08:01 I've got this I can run several miles a
08:05 day I can do a thousand push-ups or
08:09 whatever it is as I share my life with
08:13 others it's interesting if I share my
08:16 life with say people at a smoke lounge
08:20 it's easy I show up when I'm ready I
08:23 spent as much time there as I want and
08:26 then I go back home if I want to share
08:30 my life with someone on a more personal
08:32 level then it gets a little tougher
08:35 because the way I work is 24 hours all
08:40 the time now does that I go to should I
08:43 go to smoke Landrieu's I relax I do
08:44 bring my computer from time to time the
08:47 amount of screen writing I've done at a
08:48 smoke lounge is pretty impressive I've
08:52 written a lot of this patio as well but
08:56 there's certain things that you just do
08:57 all the time because your brain is
08:59 always churning I have a dictaphone by
09:02 talking to it all the time for my screen
09:04 writing for my project updates sometimes
09:07 I just need to work something out but
09:10 I've realized that there are some
09:15 interesting
09:15 knees with this regiment now have close
09:22 relationships with people that
09:24 understand this and they have the same
09:26 lifestyle and so we can spend days
09:29 together and we're in our own little
09:32 circles even though we're spending time
09:33 together and so it works out we we spend
09:40 time together such that we have the
09:42 human presence of each other and when we
09:44 break for food we integrate food with
09:47 entertainment as we eat we watch
09:49 something on Netflix HBO whatever then
09:53 we spend some personal time together
09:55 then we go back to our lives but anytime
09:58 you take your your dollar bill which is
10:00 your day your hundred cents that you're
10:03 going to spend on your day you're
10:05 ecosystem and you're spending that money
10:08 on your productivity and your social
10:12 input and your entertainment it's
10:16 interesting how we spend our dollars
10:17 differently now when you move in with
10:20 someone and you share a personal life
10:22 you end up harmonizing over time how you
10:26 spend your money and you're gonna spend
10:29 some of your money on on your partner's
10:31 interests and they're gonna spend some
10:33 money on your interest and they're not
10:35 always what you would do with your money
10:37 but that's what love is all about but
10:40 I've been through enough experiences in
10:41 my life and this part of this theme is
10:45 sort of covered in the friendship
10:46 episode and that's a funny episode
10:49 because no one really wants to watch
10:51 that they think it's some tenacious d
10:53 song but what it's about is there's
10:57 different levels of friendship and I
10:58 think it is extremely important for you
11:00 to realize the difference between a
11:01 friend an acquaintance a best friend and
11:05 know that your parents are none of those
11:08 your parents are far more special if you
11:14 have a relationship with them right some
11:16 of you don't and and you'll have you'll
11:19 have a different person that your parent
11:20 you know your step parent or your
11:22 grandparent or just some person you know
11:25 who behaves like your parent so I'm
11:27 talking about that person it's
11:29 a person in your life it's a parental
11:31 guardian in a and a beautiful guide in
11:34 life but they're more special then all
11:38 your friends and your besties and all
11:40 that stuff that's a very heavy trend to
11:43 say that your parent is your best friend
11:44 and I know people that that's definitely
11:47 the case but in my book as taught by a
11:51 very good friend of mine who's a
11:52 brilliant screenwriter and famous
11:55 director he was telling me about again
11:58 I've mentioned this once before he had a
12:01 conversation with his child and at one
12:06 point he made it a point to tell his
12:09 child I'm not your best friend man I'm
12:11 not your friend I'm your father
12:15 and that's way more special than any of
12:18 those people you know why because those
12:20 people are gonna come and they're gonna
12:21 go and you're gonna have things you can
12:24 do to them to lose your friendship and
12:27 lose your love between each other and
12:28 you and I I will always love you no
12:32 matter what I will always be here for
12:35 you no matter what and that's what makes
12:37 me your father obviously the same is
12:41 true about the mother when you pop out
12:44 of that room and you go into your
12:45 personal relationships there's this
12:49 whole thing about frequencies that we
12:51 talk about all the time and what I find
12:55 very very interesting is whether or not
12:57 one can maintain a circle of influence
13:04 when you're completely different then
13:08 that influence now getting friends are
13:11 beautiful because friends you spend your
13:13 time together and then you go back to
13:15 your realm and typically speaking you
13:18 spend more time in your realm than in
13:21 your friends realm and that's why
13:22 friends are wonderful you can have guys
13:24 that and gals that you know that you
13:26 marvel over what they do with their life
13:28 because you won't do that with your life
13:30 either they're more productive than you
13:32 they're less productive than you they're
13:33 crazy fun wild people maybe some people
13:37 are self-destructive and monie growing
13:40 but you get to kind of visit that get
13:42 love it and take off sometimes you visit
13:45 people to get inspiration and then you
13:48 go off and try to do something without
13:49 inspiration in a personal relationship
13:54 circle it can be very challenging to
13:58 determine whether or not that's possible
14:00 for those of you who are in your 20s
14:03 well you have a lot of time left to mold
14:05 your opinions about what you want you
14:08 get in your 30s well you're starting to
14:11 figure out what makes you tick hopefully
14:14 and your choices are very specific I
14:17 like this this is why I do this I gain a
14:21 beautiful emotion from this when you're
14:25 in your 40s now you've most definitely
14:30 made decisions about why you like
14:32 yourself and it probably if you lived a
14:36 normal life again I'd eat those of you
14:39 are in your 50s 60s and above who listen
14:42 to this show please share whether or not
14:44 there's a delta for 50 60 70 or is it 40
14:47 you know you're pretty much saddest you
14:49 know satisfied with who you are and you
14:50 keep that to your death I don't know I
14:53 feel like I'm pretty dynamic so I don't
14:55 know if I'm a good use case personally
14:58 but there's nothing like finding balance
15:00 with yourself and being happy with
15:02 yourself and then you fall in love with
15:05 someone that's different than you like
15:08 maybe really different than you and so
15:12 now you're kind of going do I compromise
15:14 myself for this other person maybe
15:16 they're compromising for me and usually
15:18 if you're a good person you know or
15:21 you're a smart person you know you can't
15:23 change other people you don't want to go
15:24 that route because it just doesn't work
15:25 I don't care how old you are changing
15:28 someone else is really rough I can't
15:30 come from you it's got to come from them
15:32 they have to be influenced by you and
15:34 they make the decision themselves and
15:37 then because they're not you they're
15:40 going to probably need some assistance
15:44 if they really wanted to copy you and
15:45 you don't want some single white female
15:46 situation right person is absolutely
15:49 mocking you dressing like you being like
15:51 you and they don't really understand the
15:53 fundamental platform as to
15:56 that might be good or bad if I had
16:00 stayed in the Midwest I probably would
16:02 not have been able to make this episode
16:06 because I would have adopted the average
16:09 mean of my hometown which is a wonderful
16:11 frequency to live in trust me no
16:14 criticism whatsoever but since I came to
16:17 the entertainment capital of the world
16:18 Los Angeles I think that's a safe thing
16:23 to say and I chose to participate in
16:26 this world you start to see or I started
16:30 to see the difference between working
16:34 for corporate America average Joe stuff
16:39 to working in videogame companies where
16:42 we are cranking out magic every 18 to 36
16:46 months we are supposed to impress the
16:49 most unimpressionable minds with the
16:53 most amazing thing plus we're trying to
16:54 impress ourselves so everyone's working
16:57 around the clock to try and figure out
16:59 how to make a machine do something it's
17:00 not meant to do and it's every element
17:04 of that game it's it's the story it's
17:08 the video game image and the art the
17:10 sound the voiceover everything the
17:13 graphics all of it later in life I got
17:17 into the film business through various
17:20 means and you know I you know I have not
17:22 been on you know like Avatar productions
17:26 or anything massive like that my
17:28 participation has been in the writing
17:31 realm the film incubation realm the
17:35 industrial design realm working with Syd
17:37 Mead and watching what he's done serving
17:41 these people serving with these people
17:42 you know doing my own thing and so you
17:46 see the burden of filmmaking I've had
17:51 you know the privilege of sitting next
17:52 to giants and watching them just crank
17:55 out what an amazing thing after another
17:57 I mean you know being in Syd Meads realm
18:00 for 20 years you know going to his house
18:03 and him saying oh I just worked on
18:04 Elysium I just worked on you know this
18:06 film now I fell in this film and
18:11 it's my plate just hits a home run every
18:14 single time even tomorrow in which he
18:17 designed the look of tomorrow and no one
18:20 contests that the thing doesn't look
18:21 amazing he just didn't like the story
18:24 the music business getting extremely
18:28 close to that and seeing how these
18:31 amazing multi-platinum album you know
18:34 band members work together don't work
18:37 together poor folks that have had their
18:39 lead singers commit suicide and they're
18:42 trying to keep the band going 20 years
18:44 later gut wrenching stuff seeing the
18:48 prices that they paid hearing all the
18:50 stories of the things that are never
18:52 going to be written down on paper ever
18:55 getting into screenwriting I'll tell you
18:57 what forever
19:00 well I shouldn't say this because I
19:02 don't think this is the case
19:03 screenwriting is a really hard thing for
19:05 your family and friends to understand as
19:09 much as people want to read things
19:10 because they think it's going to be
19:12 great they just don't have the patience
19:14 it's a weird format to read in some
19:17 people love it very few people love it
19:20 it's a tough business and there are tons
19:24 of people that will tell you who have
19:25 been in it it's almost like they went
19:27 into a spook house that was too gory too
19:31 scary and they came out and they just
19:34 have white they've just white and
19:36 they're just staring 60,000 feet in the
19:39 distance and they're saying don't go in
19:41 there whatever you do don't go in there
19:42 and these aren't trivial people coming
19:46 out with those cautions and so I've had
19:49 to whether through brilliant people
19:52 telling me I don't think you want to get
19:54 in this business you know I don't think
19:56 you want to do this and I've got to
20:00 listen and respect their opinions and
20:03 then keep going when you house stories
20:07 in you that need to be told because no
20:09 one's ever told those stories before and
20:12 they are groundbreaking to the mind you
20:16 got to do it forget everybody else you
20:20 know Mozart was a hundred years after
20:23 Bach I mean it what if people what if
20:24 didn't have his crazy dad pushing him
20:26 into music but he still wanted to get
20:27 him music and people like now get into
20:29 classical music man it's it's been
20:31 around for 100 years we would have lost
20:35 out on the emotional evolution of
20:37 classical music I'm giving you the
20:40 examples because I'm setting up a
20:42 platform to jump off on the purpose of
20:47 this episode let me give you this one
20:50 last example before we start getting
20:52 into the actual formal discussion of it
20:54 all if you were going to say you live a
21:00 fairly normal life yeah nine-to-five job
21:03 it's a great job you love it making good
21:06 money you're single but you whatever
21:11 reason you're in this circle of
21:13 celebrities doesn't have to be any
21:16 particular type of celebrity but you
21:19 fall in love with someone that is mega
21:23 famous mega successful and maybe not
21:26 famous like you know okay again like
21:29 some household name but famous for what
21:32 they do and you get to know him and
21:35 you're like wow this person really
21:36 cranks out the stuff male or female
21:38 doesn't matter maybe it's a female
21:40 singer and she's she writes her own
21:42 music and writes her own lyrics but even
21:45 if she doesn't do that she's working
21:46 around the clock she's got tours
21:47 constantly being incubated everything
21:51 choreographers the teacher you know
21:53 teacher and her dancers how to do it and
21:55 just goes on and on and on stage design
21:58 costumes I gotta change your look gotta
22:00 change your sound keep it up with the
22:03 trends maybe it's a famous filmmaker
22:06 someone who's been tasked with directing
22:09 the next Star Wars or something you know
22:10 and it's just it's just massive pressure
22:13 but you're falling in love with this
22:15 person and they seem to be fall in love
22:17 with you now I'm assuming that most
22:21 people listening to the sound of my
22:23 voice will say I would expect that my
22:28 life is going to have to change to
22:31 maintain their life because what they do
22:35 is visibly and obviously
22:38 intense it doesn't mean they don't laugh
22:42 every single day all day long maybe
22:45 that's what they do maybe they're
22:46 comedians maybe they write comedy maybe
22:48 they direct comedies or whatever it is
22:50 so it's not like it's intense and a
22:52 negative humdrum kind of way if you want
22:56 to get in that personal circle for me
22:59 personally if I ever met someone who was
23:02 like that I would be dating some woman
23:06 who's super duper engaged she could be a
23:08 businesswoman some sort of super hot
23:12 Martha Stewart right okay I know that
23:17 what I am doing does not require as well
23:19 maybe in my life but if I was in a more
23:21 traditional lifestyle I would know that
23:26 their lifestyles more intense than mine
23:27 and I'm gonna have to surrender first
23:31 you know I'm integrating my life with
23:33 theirs they're not integrating theirs
23:36 with mine as much because they can't
23:38 afford to if they were to take out a
23:41 certain chunk of time that they normally
23:43 spend doing something else they're gonna
23:46 lose their game and and one great
23:49 example was Johnny Carson he did a show
23:55 five nights a week recorded it during
23:59 the day eridan in the evening but this
24:01 guy has to develop a show he has a ton
24:05 of famous people coming in they have
24:07 plenty of other press appearances and
24:09 promos they're doing so it's rough and
24:12 then they pre-scripted all those
24:14 interviews generally this is what this
24:17 person is gonna be talking about if they
24:18 had a comedian on like George Carlin or
24:22 something George's got a bit that's
24:24 worked out and he tells Johnny asked me
24:28 this ask me that asked me this and I'm
24:30 gonna list lead into the next joke and
24:31 he'll have a blast
24:33 maybe Johnny doesn't even know what the
24:35 guy's gonna say but he realizes you know
24:37 I heard heard you been in California you
24:39 know it was you're gonna need the music
24:40 parks and then BOOM George jumps into
24:42 his amusement park thing they're so
24:44 heavily scripted today it just hurts the
24:46 soul to watch this stuff I used to think
24:49 it was all just completely
24:52 adlib haha well Johnny's life was was
24:57 not a mystery
24:58 it was a tough it was he was a tough man
25:01 to marry tough man to spend his time
25:04 time with because he was constantly busy
25:08 by the time the weekend comes around he
25:11 just wants to chill man
25:12 was got in his boat catch a little Sun
25:16 sure he'd leave and go on vacation and
25:19 someone would guess toast for him but
25:20 you know the his ability to calm down
25:22 was probably really tough Jay Leno
25:25 talked about it as well Jay was smart
25:28 Jay got out before he lost his entire
25:30 life to the show nice having a blast
25:34 usually in a family back in my childhood
25:40 there was sort of this pre balanced
25:43 expected to happen the father would get
25:47 up and go earn those single income
25:49 household salary that the house needed
25:52 the mother you would usually have
25:55 children and so she would have her day
25:57 job which was the most important job at
26:00 the entire family which is raising the
26:02 children to hopefully be nice human
26:05 beings now you go back 20 years before I
26:09 was born and the fathers were very stoic
26:12 often and very not emotional and so they
26:16 were sort of the odd man out people
26:19 always had weird loose relationships
26:21 with their fathers and very close
26:23 relationships with their mothers and
26:25 it's just almost unanimous with my own
26:29 family and the stories I've heard about
26:31 you know how close were you to Grandpa
26:33 close to dad and it was always well
26:37 grandpa was kind of always just working
26:40 and doing his thing you come home tired
26:41 and he would watch this TV show and go
26:43 to bed but mom all kinds of stories have
26:46 we did crafts she took me to the park
26:48 and dad
26:50 but now a woman is forced to work and
26:54 again I got nothing nothing wrong with
26:57 that when I was a kid every woman work
26:58 to it just cut out about ten years to
27:00 have whatever kids they were gonna have
27:03 most families in my hometown I think had
27:05 at least two every once while they'd
27:09 knock out a third and there was the
27:12 anomaly with the family to have eight
27:14 but those were pretty rare and there was
27:16 usually a farm involved they had tasks
27:20 that need to be done by the entire
27:21 family what I want to get out here in
27:24 this episode is if you are one of these
27:26 intense people with a really intense job
27:30 and your spouse is not involved with
27:34 your job which happens and that's
27:38 amazing I've got a fairly close friend
27:42 of mine whose wife is a magician with
27:45 him and I won't name any names but we
27:49 have another member of the deep thoughts
27:51 family who has the exact same situation
27:53 I think that's just beyond cool when you
27:58 can be an ice skater and your wife as
27:59 you're ice skating partner I mean that's
28:01 just awesome and imagine being a
28:02 magician with your wife and hopefully
28:05 you're really successful I mean doesn't
28:08 get any better than that maybe there's
28:10 some drawbacks with that I'm Lorna
28:11 unaware of but my other buddy I know
28:15 really well I shot a pilot with him he
28:20 his facebook posts are just the world I
28:22 want to live in you know it's great but
28:25 if you're one of us mortal men who are
28:27 women who have that intense nature and
28:31 you're trying to find a partner and
28:33 you're running up against this this
28:37 episodes for us how do you integrate how
28:41 important is it to to be careful with
28:47 who you lead on because you need to
28:49 check stuff out now when I was in my 20s
28:55 I I want to say I do apologize for
28:59 talking about my life so much because
29:02 for me it almost makes me want to throw
29:05 up when I start getting into that type
29:07 type of conversation because it's it
29:11 seems grandiose and it seems boast II
29:13 and I'm not trying to go there at all in
29:18 one way this show is therapy for me to
29:20 be able to even talk about that sort of
29:22 thing because when I'm by myself or
29:24 sorry when I'm not on the show and I'm
29:25 with my friends it only comes up if
29:28 someone needs an example of something
29:29 you know my twenties were awesome I mean
29:32 I did all kinds of wild [ __ ] and but I
29:36 remember telling my friends cuz they
29:37 would come up to me and I dated almost
29:40 solid through my 20s somebody the people
29:44 had asked me like was it going as you
29:45 love life going or whatever and I'd say
29:49 have you found any they say if you found
29:50 anyone interesting and I would say well
29:54 sorta I said my problem is is they
29:57 always find me interesting and I don't
29:58 necessarily find them interesting
30:00 and it's that weird phenomenon because
30:03 when they would come to my house there
30:06 was always like it was like a studio of
30:08 a bunch of stuff you know it was like
30:09 okay those are my paintings over there
30:12 that I'm working on I'm about to sell
30:13 out one day and I here's my music studio
30:15 here's all the music I'm working on
30:16 here's what I do at work this is my
30:19 software company here and it was just
30:22 like it was sort of like a little Willy
30:24 walk is factoring inside and so who's
30:27 not in there 20 he's gonna be impressed
30:29 with someone in their 20s now I thought
30:30 I was fairly normal for living my life
30:33 to the fullest and then when I finally
30:35 started seeing the reactions on people's
30:37 faces I was like why is that so intense
30:41 like I remember bringing over my buddy
30:43 and his girlfriend he was a musician of
30:46 sorts
30:47 he brought of his girlfriend and because
30:50 he wanted to start making music with me
30:51 and so I said well let me show you what
30:54 I'm working on and I played a few
30:56 heavy-duty club tracks I was writing at
30:58 the time all these wild samples in it
31:00 and I just hit stop on the playhead and
31:03 this girl goes and I don't even see how
31:07 you people can do that something like
31:10 that I was like what are you talking
31:12 about she goes we just you're one of
31:14 those people that can make that kind
31:16 music and as I don't only know while he
31:18 pay to see people like that and I'm like
31:20 oh weird I'm just a normal guy that
31:26 makes music that's all it all it is but
31:29 in my brain I'm thinking okay I got to
31:30 acknowledge this person for their
31:33 epiphany or their feeling they're having
31:35 I don't want to disagree with them or
31:38 piss on their parade or whatever and so
31:42 it started dawning on me slowly through
31:44 reactions of other people this must be
31:47 what's going on with my girlfriend's as
31:48 well or my potential girlfriends and
31:51 that was never a scammer you know I
31:53 wasn't like there's some guys that would
31:54 build up a bag of tricks and then use it
32:00 to sleep with people right you know I'm
32:01 gonna impress you I'm gonna show you the
32:02 one two three thing and then you're
32:04 gonna be all you're gonna be jello in my
32:06 hands and then boom we're gonna get in
32:09 the sack and then I'm not cheating me
32:10 see you later sort of thing I was never
32:12 that guy but as they get older I'm
32:16 finding out that it matters everything
32:19 matters and for me I'm very fortunate
32:22 I'm very comfortable with myself I'm
32:25 very cool so I feel cool with myself you
32:29 know working on my projects and that
32:31 sort of thing but I'm like anyone you
32:33 know
32:34 I dig sharing my life with someone it's
32:37 my favorite thing to do I love
32:40 entertaining on one level so when I wish
32:44 someone I'm like I created this thing
32:45 I'm gonna read you my latest film and I
32:48 wrote this one first versus those other
32:50 15 ones I've got treatments for because
32:52 I thought you would dig this and
32:54 sometimes that really works out great my
32:56 last film is done really well that way
32:59 when I used to do music I write songs
33:02 about the girls I was dating and they
33:04 loved it and I loved it too it was like
33:06 hey this is never gonna hit the airwaves
33:08 I'm never gonna push it that intense but
33:11 you've got this little gym you can
33:15 listen to whatever in the fridge ship
33:18 episode I talked about the very specific
33:20 nature of the frequencies of other
33:23 people that you have around you and that
33:25 there's this weird phenomenon then your
33:26 20s where you're all sort of fine
33:29 your path and some of us find our path
33:32 very astutely and you know maybe you
33:36 don't keep it to rest your life but at
33:38 least you sort of know again the theme
33:40 of your life I'm gonna be an entertainer
33:41 with our right film or make a video game
33:45 or in a book or make a website or a
33:47 youtube show whatever it is I love the
33:50 interaction between people now the show
33:52 this show is not hopefully it's
33:54 entertainment on on one level but
33:56 hopefully goes way deeper than that but
33:59 when you hit your 30s everyone starts to
34:01 make decisions about what they're gonna
34:03 do with their life in terms of
34:04 companionship so people get married
34:06 people have kids and those are big
34:09 decisions and they're huge commitments
34:12 and you lose that that track you have
34:15 with your buddies where you know you're
34:17 going to clubs or your role-playing or
34:20 whatever you're doing where you just
34:21 could spend 12 hours with your buddies
34:24 like what am i when I was in my 20s
34:27 especially before my daughter was born
34:29 we would go into Electronic Arts we
34:32 worked and play a game for 14 hours as I
34:34 mentioned recently you can't do that
34:37 anymore when you got a wife and kids
34:39 unless you're hurt unless you're able to
34:42 convince your wife that she gets into
34:43 the 14 hours off the next day you're
34:45 trading so then when you cross over that
34:49 threshold of partnership and having
34:52 children
34:53 then you resync with your friends who
34:55 made the same decision okay you want to
34:58 go to Disneyland with the kids
34:59 yeah let's do that man sorry or not it's
35:01 too expensive let's go to Knott's Berry
35:03 Farm instead okay okay about an RV you
35:06 know if you got an RV we could both go
35:07 out in the desert together beautiful
35:10 thing about my neighborhood I think it's
35:12 sort of shitty and it's good at all at
35:14 the same time we've got at least three
35:16 families that all decided to buy RVs
35:19 together and then they bought their
35:21 trailers and their motorcycles and jet
35:23 skis and they plan their trips together
35:26 it's probably like I don't know 10
35:27 people and then there's people on the
35:29 street who don't have those that piece
35:32 of equipment or whatever but they fall
35:34 in their cars and then they they all
35:36 share the amenities and maybe they bring
35:38 the food or something I'm not quite sure
35:40 I haven't gone out with them but I think
35:42 that's awesome
35:43 they've resync tin their 30s 40s and
35:46 early 50s but that's in a more macro
35:50 level maybe one of the ways I can
35:53 actually bring this episode to you is to
35:55 suggest if you are younger or you're
36:00 about to jump off that diving board of
36:02 of a rather intense endeavor you're
36:07 going to pick a career or a pastime or
36:10 whatever it's gonna require that you
36:13 really hunker down we need to manage
36:17 that with our partners very openly I
36:22 love technology I love it I love
36:25 building things I like electronics I
36:28 like the code a love code and so I'm
36:33 always interested in pushing the
36:35 envelope with whatever's out there but
36:37 that means I have to constantly learn
36:39 what's out there for instance I'll give
36:43 you a real world example
36:44 this is a little geek thing for you
36:46 there's a 3d product out there that's
36:48 free that's phenomenal
36:49 it's called blender 3d you'll Henry
36:51 mention it every once in a while the
36:53 current version is 2.7 well they are
36:57 feverishly working on 2.8 and 2.8 is a
37:00 complete paradigm upgrade to this
37:03 product it is for what I what I get out
37:07 of the betas it looks phenomenal and so
37:10 I'm excited I think blender 3d 2.8 and
37:14 above is going to take over several
37:17 rolls that have been exclusively held by
37:19 products like 3d studio max and Maya and
37:23 so I personally have this goal to get in
37:27 because I'm really good with 2.7 and I
37:29 want to be even better at 2.8 the 2.8
37:33 has amazing features that we all can use
37:37 so I'm already planning my projects I've
37:39 contacted some friends of mine who are
37:41 designers for interior design and I've
37:44 said look you know how you got those
37:46 things and Sketchup or CAD they look
37:48 like [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah well I want you
37:50 to export that into a file format that I
37:52 can you know OB obj file and I want to
37:56 import that in and light it
37:57 for you and surface it for you because
37:58 I'll give it to you for free but I want
38:01 to be an expert at this because I could
38:03 make you know five grand every two weeks
38:06 off this process there's a little
38:08 business for you in case you're
38:09 interested free product you can make ten
38:12 grand a month
38:13 just get good at it with art there's a
38:18 lot of design out there but of most most
38:21 print designers sort of just look at the
38:23 PlayBook on the internet and go oh yeah
38:25 I know how to do that and they just copy
38:27 but then there's people like me that'll
38:29 go in there and I've got all this
38:30 information architecture background I've
38:33 graduated from Edward Tufte ease class
38:35 twice I just know how to move
38:38 information in a way that you can
38:40 assimilate it much quicker but it's in a
38:44 most to it to a print artist then went
38:47 to school with all the rules
38:48 it's a typical of how their brain works
38:51 but the user gets it and goes oh my god
38:53 this was so easy oh yeah
38:56 that's because some of us think
38:58 differently they were trained by Sid
39:00 meat that's why we think differently so
39:03 in order to have a life where you are
39:06 going to get the most out of it you're
39:08 literally squeezing that chamois and
39:10 then you're folding it in half and
39:11 you're squeezing it again and again and
39:13 again every drop of waters falling out
39:15 of this thing such that when you unfold
39:17 it it's like almost dry that's the life
39:21 I'm trying to live that's life I do live
39:23 but then you have to manage the circles
39:27 of influence that you allow into your
39:29 life you need someone like I said
39:31 several times in previous episodes it's
39:32 not the kind of food you eat that makes
39:34 you compatible with someone it's not
39:36 necessarily how you believe in God that
39:38 makes you compatible with someone it's
39:40 what is your purpose in life what are
39:44 the themes that you wake up most
39:47 inspired to engage in that is who you
39:50 are and that is who they are and you
39:52 need to make sure that the two of you
39:54 can at least agree on several different
39:59 themes you know it's not a mystery when
40:03 people say that depressing people will
40:06 always drag you down they'll never drag
40:08 you up
40:08 and so if you're with someone who's
40:10 chronically depressed for whatever
40:12 reason you can give it your best shot
40:14 but once you've tried all the bags
40:16 tricks in your bag and they've just
40:18 fully committed to being depressed it's
40:21 time to cut them loose let them live on
40:24 their own figure it out
40:26 decide whether or not they want to make
40:28 a change that might make their life
40:30 better but don't be surprised if nothing
40:32 changes and they just live that life of
40:35 complete suffering and it will say I
40:38 mean I want to make a point here because
40:39 I don't think I've ever said it clearly
40:42 there are some families and some
40:45 cultures that raise their children
40:46 inside of envelopes of suffering back
40:50 stories about their heritage that makes
40:52 it all suffering and suffering and
40:55 suffering that is probably one of the
41:00 greatest crimes and one of the biggest
41:03 IQ tests of a particular society to do
41:08 to their children there is absolutely no
41:11 benefit to that whatsoever to feel
41:13 punished and I think that that is
41:17 something that's being cleared up a
41:19 little bit in our era sometimes it's a
41:21 racial thing sometimes it's just a time
41:24 and place thing you're in the wrong
41:26 place you know I was never raised with
41:30 that situation so I was able to see the
41:34 brightness of the world constantly and
41:36 not constant look for the negativity you
41:37 as much as I might talk about a
41:39 conspiracy that that frustrates me
41:43 you're never going to create light if
41:45 you've been built from darkness
41:48 you're never gonna own your own mind if
41:51 your mind has always been you know
41:54 chain-link to some horrible event that
41:57 you didn't experience at all my
42:00 grandmother grew up in the depression
42:01 and she talked about the depression from
42:04 time to time but she never ever brought
42:06 the family down as a matter of doing it
42:09 she tried to establish the fact that we
42:11 live in a better world but to make sure
42:13 we appreciated it because there was a
42:16 time when food and money and survival
42:18 was extremely tough and she made huge
42:20 sacrifices
42:22 for a whole you know 15 years as a
42:24 result of it and then a world war
42:27 started them you know towards the last
42:29 five years if you are on the verge of
42:33 doing something amazing or if you have
42:36 finally figured out a machine for your
42:40 life you get up you eat certain meals
42:42 you go to certain places you don't drink
42:46 too much you don't do drugs too much
42:47 because that interferes with your
42:49 ability to accomplish your goal or
42:53 whatever it is I dated someone and went
42:57 to concerts about five times a week and
43:01 as much as that's amazing and I got to
43:04 meet the artists behind the backstage
43:06 and you know those are memories that
43:08 I'll never regret whatsoever the problem
43:12 was is that I was constantly in the
43:14 audience when I'm a person that's always
43:16 on stage and so my dreams were being
43:19 paused because I was dating someone that
43:22 didn't have any or at least whatever
43:24 they had it could be done in the
43:26 nine-to-five timeframe which is fine you
43:29 know there's nothing wrong with these
43:31 people whatsoever at all it's just when
43:34 you choose to be the other side of the
43:37 game it can be daunting and you know
43:40 I've got friends of mine that are you
43:41 know very famous musicians and they had
43:45 the benefit of being super famous from
43:48 say maybe eighteen to thirty five
43:51 probably eighteen to thirty is the main
43:54 thrust of their career but you know
43:56 there's plenty of fans that want to hear
43:58 musicians play but they have a natural
44:01 cycle of retirement where they don't
44:03 have to go on world tours for you know
44:06 ten months out of the year I mean I feel
44:08 sorry for bands like Aerosmith and
44:12 Rolling Stones where I mean I know that
44:15 they probably don't agree with me
44:17 personally but to be to have a situation
44:21 where you've got to go on these
44:22 incredible grueling tours simply to have
44:25 the best the thing that you love the
44:27 most in life occur is intense memory
44:30 Michael Jackson said if I could just
44:32 live on stage I would live on stage
44:35 because that is where I am in my element
44:37 that's where I feel the most love in my
44:39 life
44:40 da da da da da so even a super-duper
44:43 famous musician has an end a super
44:46 famous athlete has an end and maybe they
44:49 go off to be a news announcer or
44:51 whatever and they have that second tier
44:53 of their life maybe they come a painter
44:54 or something but here's what's
44:57 interesting and and sort of fascinating
45:01 I think for the average person if I
45:04 personally choose to maintain
45:07 screenwriting personally as my love of
45:11 life until the day I die I will
45:14 potentially live a more intense life
45:16 than my good buddy who's got 5 platinum
45:20 albums and he's pretty much retired at
45:22 this point because my endeavor will not
45:27 end until I die I'll die at a keyboard
45:29 somewhere or a dictation device that
45:32 some of some kind that's why I liked
45:36 these 20 years I've had was Syd Mead
45:38 because he's always creating something
45:41 he can't stop creating things a guy like
45:46 da Vinci doesn't have an end he just
45:49 keeps going and why because it's his
45:51 nature and that's something you need to
45:54 recognize it's it's a full lifespan
45:57 dedication and you know who knows what
46:00 I'm personally gonna do with it I'm
46:01 gonna write so many films get them so
46:04 many of them made or whatever sell them
46:06 at least and then I feel comfortable I
46:09 can retire I've got enough money in the
46:10 bank or whatever the case might be
46:12 maybe I fall in love with sitting in
46:17 sitting on the beach in Hawaii maybe
46:19 that's what I fall in love with
46:20 Huntington Beach it's a beautiful place
46:22 here let me tell you but as you plan
46:25 your life and as you take people into
46:26 your life these are things that you have
46:29 to to know about yourself as you're
46:32 spending that dollar of the economy of
46:34 your day do you have time for other
46:37 people and if you do how much time and
46:40 when do you have that time there's 24
46:42 hours in a day which is how we subdivide
46:44 a week 60
46:47 it's an hour you feel me so as crazy as
46:51 it might sound you might be able to pull
46:54 off sort of a makeshift methodology of
46:57 managing your week in your day and your
46:59 month in your year and all that stuff
47:02 but eventually it might catch up with
47:04 you
47:04 I always find it catches up with me if I
47:07 don't plan it and they get out of
47:11 balance if you're a creator what'll end
47:15 up happening is you will feel like your
47:17 children are being suffocated they're
47:23 being jailed and you must keep going
47:26 prince was a great example that guy he
47:29 always said he thought of his songs as
47:31 his children which I thought was sort of
47:34 a kind of a weird metaphor but as I grew
47:38 up and did my own things I was like yeah
47:40 I know what you're talking about dude
47:42 and what it does to you is as you
47:46 traverse life and especially if you're
47:48 someone like myself where you have a
47:50 huge list a list that is way too large
47:53 of things that you're intimately
47:54 interested in experiencing discovering
47:57 one of the toughest things you can do in
48:00 your life is say you know what I really
48:03 wanted to do that but I have conceded I
48:06 never will or at least right now it's
48:10 not going to happen maybe it happens in
48:12 the future but for instance like me and
48:16 music I had to put it aside at one point
48:20 I don't know if I I told the story a
48:22 long time ago but I you know I had a
48:24 studio that I built like every kid in
48:27 the 90s and I was making money off of it
48:29 and just I just wrote every single day I
48:33 possibly could and you know I have just
48:35 you know I lost a bunch of it when OS 9
48:38 erased my harddrive with about 500 songs
48:43 on it now if I could even get to the
48:46 songs that I've got on a zip drive which
48:48 has a password for some damn reason I
48:49 couldn't remember the password was and I
48:51 only had like four passwords in my life
48:53 but the product that I wrote the music
48:55 in has been made for 25 years so there's
48:58 no way to get
49:00 to the soundtracks at this point I've
49:03 got a bunch of cassettes all over my
49:04 house but I had to give it up and I gave
49:07 it up right after I took my studio to
49:09 the next level I had taken my studio to
49:12 God it was probably like a fifty
49:15 thousand dollar studio when he really
49:17 totaled up all the instruments at their
49:19 full retail value was never worth that
49:20 at the resell value but I had blown up
49:24 my studio and then EA had this gigantic
49:27 problem on their hands
49:28 AOL lied to EA and this huge gaming
49:32 network we built was built for 20
49:34 million users but only had maybe two and
49:38 so and they messed up the whole protocol
49:40 building games and so it was just a
49:42 cluster at the end and they laid off
49:45 4,000 people and so in the end I found
49:49 myself unemployed I had a pretty good
49:52 chunk of cash in the bank but I wasn't
49:54 paying attention to music because music
49:55 is something you do when you don't have
49:57 life breathing down your neck going you
50:00 better get a job brother
50:01 because you're used to making money and
50:02 now we're in this recession so it's a
50:07 problem Plus as a musician who is
50:11 selling your music to usually kids are
50:14 the ones that are obsessed and living
50:16 inside albums for all the old-timers
50:19 your age they're living in the big rock
50:21 stars that already finished up their
50:23 careers and so they're listening to Pink
50:25 Floyd or Led Zeppelin or Motley Crue or
50:28 whatever they're not listening to your
50:30 new stuff now if you've got to do what
50:33 you got to do it if you got to do it's
50:35 gonna fall out of you so make your music
50:37 and you'll you'll find an audience and I
50:39 you know with SoundCloud and iTunes of
50:42 being very accessible to sell music in a
50:43 hundred other places you really can't
50:46 just make a nice little album and put it
50:47 out there so it's always kind of a
50:49 luring but then you have to look at the
50:51 eco system of your life and say well is
50:55 there something else bigger and better
50:56 that I can do with my skills right now
50:58 that can reach more people and that's
51:02 where for me screenwriting is it it is a
51:06 beautiful world where you have a canvas
51:09 and a methodology where you can tell
51:12 stories to move
51:13 and you could target kids and you could
51:16 target adults and you can target both of
51:18 them you can mix up the genres you can
51:20 do a horror movie or a love movie you
51:24 know romance and rom-com or something
51:28 like that anything you can think of you
51:32 can do well that's kind of nice the
51:34 music has the same freedom except that
51:38 music there is gonna be a producer that
51:40 goes man we don't want to lose money and
51:42 if we're gonna promote you you better
51:45 make music that's sort of popular right
51:48 now with a beautiful thing about Netflix
51:50 and Amazon Prime and HBO and all the
51:53 other film studios and television
51:55 networks they know the game right now is
51:58 throw it at the wall and see if it
52:00 sticks so it's a free domain but back to
52:05 the subject integrating people in your
52:08 life when they're just good normal
52:11 people now they say opposites attract
52:15 okay I agree up to a level now some
52:21 people are great listeners and some
52:23 people are big talkers guess who I'm
52:25 more compatible with so for years I've
52:29 known that if I'm gonna date somebody
52:30 it's get intimate with someone they need
52:32 to be a really good listener because I
52:34 talk incessantly I try to make it
52:37 interesting of course I'm always trying
52:40 to split an atom of human existence and
52:43 if you think I'm bad on the show talking
52:45 for an hour two hours about one thing it
52:48 happens in real life too now I don't
52:50 just sit around chatterboxxy as a matter
52:51 of fact sometimes I can just be as quiet
52:53 as a church mouse well the person I'm
52:55 with just yammering on and I mean in a
52:57 good way just talk talk talk and and I
52:59 feel like listening I'm like oh yeah you
53:01 you take the mic you're the scientist I
53:03 just need to listen to somebody else
53:05 you got another about yourself if
53:10 relationships are having issues you know
53:13 I don't hear this personally because the
53:16 relationship issues I hear the
53:17 traditional cliche relationship issues
53:20 but usually motivation between two
53:22 people is one of the biggest themes that
53:25 breaks down relationships
53:27 he or she is lazy I am always working
53:31 because they're lazy I take on too many
53:33 tasks in the household if you have
53:35 children one person is the predominant
53:37 parent and when you need help as a
53:40 parent they're not there because they're
53:41 lazy now maybe they have a reason for
53:43 being lazy that you can all rationalize
53:45 maybe the person is working generating
53:47 all the money and so you're taking the
53:49 other role that's balanced but sometimes
53:53 you're both working full jobs and then
53:55 one person just comes home and they're
53:57 more exhausted maybe the other person's
53:59 job is a job they hate it's got a lot of
54:02 physical or sorry mental trauma and it
54:04 may be a physical trauma and so they are
54:06 physically and mentally exhausted when
54:08 they come home and what's the fix there
54:11 well it depends if they're in the job
54:14 they hate then they need to change that
54:16 job it may not be overnight go see all
54:19 my other episodes on that kind of stuff
54:21 but maybe they're George Lucas or
54:24 somebody gigantic that's like oh my god
54:26 you have no idea the burden I'm going on
54:28 let me imagine when that guy said he was
54:30 gonna make the next three Star Wars 1 2
54:33 & 3 yeah we had 20 years to write the
54:37 scripts on it of course huge pressure
54:41 huge pressure when they wanted to reboot
54:44 the Star Wars after Disney bought it
54:45 imagine the pressure on every single
54:47 person's soul to satisfy those customers
54:52 having seen especially the first three
54:54 episodes get absolutely you know ripped
55:00 apart because everyone has their
55:02 expectations of what those shows are
55:04 gonna have in them how the characters
55:06 are going to develop who's gonna be
55:07 playing the roles of the characters we
55:10 imagine you get the role of obi-wan
55:13 Kenobi this guy's a legend and you're
55:17 gonna play that character and you're
55:18 you're you are constrained by the dialog
55:21 that's been written for you so you might
55:22 even have a better way of expressing
55:24 yourself as that character but you're
55:26 not allowed to so sometimes people are
55:29 exhausted for good reasons and sometimes
55:31 that's a good reason it's no mystery to
55:35 older people that when you marry early
55:37 you run into a lot of these things
55:39 because you haven't fully formed yet
55:41 oddly though when I was a kid my whole
55:44 hometown was made out of people that
55:45 were married on average by the age of 20
55:48 to 22 was considered kind of late
55:50 between 18 and 20 almost every couple
55:53 that was over 40 years old had been
55:55 married in their teens 18 or 19 and they
56:02 managed to live their entire life's
56:04 together happily
56:05 they managed to succeed they had lots of
56:08 money in the bank American Dream worked
56:11 you did what you were told and it worked
56:13 that doesn't work anymore right because
56:16 we've allowed ourselves to be taken over
56:18 then of course and this doesn't happen
56:21 for me because I've got a solid
56:22 background and going after my dreams and
56:24 making them occur so when I meet people
56:26 that you know never met before and they
56:29 want to be in my life if I say I'm gonna
56:32 do something outrageous they look at my
56:35 background and they like okay well
56:38 you're one of those people that do those
56:39 things you're always doing those things
56:41 so I trust you but I wouldn't trust
56:43 other people who have never done it
56:45 before or it would be tougher for me to
56:47 trust other people so if this is the
56:51 first time you're gonna jump off and do
56:53 something radical with your life quote
56:56 unquote understand that people might not
57:00 have previous efforts or previous
57:04 history with you to trust that that
57:06 would be the case a lot of times people
57:08 try everything and they fail and that
57:11 they create this false history that
57:13 doesn't equal their future or you older
57:15 presidents Tony Robbins always says your
57:17 past doesn't equal your present very
57:19 important it is important that someone
57:22 believes in you if they're gonna be in
57:23 in your life I've dated people it's
57:27 funny I've dated people that have barely
57:30 heard me sing and they got me into a
57:34 wedding of a bunch of rockers who have
57:37 again tons of platinum albums and I was
57:40 one of many singers that got to the
57:42 stage and saying I sang two songs and
57:44 for her it was like you can do this man
57:47 you can do this you're one of those
57:49 people I've seen you singing I saw you
57:51 make people in the room really happy and
57:53 I I've seen
57:54 first the new man so get up there and do
57:55 it and I did it I did it live at the
57:57 live band it wasn't karaoke man and it
58:00 worked and I I will always thank this
58:05 person for thrusting me into that
58:07 because now I know I can do it but I've
58:10 known other people who were intimate
58:12 that was intimate with you know I had
58:14 relationships with for many years who
58:16 saw me unequivocally going to rooms full
58:19 of 50 people I cranked out a song and s
58:22 karaoke but I'll blow the room away and
58:25 still have to hear this you know it's
58:30 sort of cynical well that's too scary
58:32 okey or whatever just you know pissing
58:34 on the parade on the way home and I'm
58:36 like you didn't sing maybe you should go
58:39 up and try it and then when the whole
58:40 room yells and screams you'll feel like
58:44 you've got something and as long as you
58:47 are honest with yourself and your
58:48 surround yourself with tons of talent
58:49 and you're not a person who BS as
58:52 yourself you'll know whether or not you
58:54 have karaoke skills or whether you have
58:55 real life skills you know oddly enough
59:01 the person that believed in me had a
59:04 whole super-mega history with music
59:06 knows every single famous person in
59:09 music that is has ever been anyone let's
59:14 put that way and she believed in me and
59:15 it was amazing the other person knows no
59:18 one knows nothing about writing music
59:22 and have the audacity to be cynical it's
59:26 weird and that's why you have to pick
59:29 the people in your life very carefully
59:31 and the closer you bring them into your
59:34 circle the more you have to be careful
59:36 with who you're bringing into your
59:37 circle and that's why I think you have
59:40 to be very careful as well with trivial
59:43 reasons why you like people you know we
59:46 don't like to talk about it so I'm going
59:49 to talk about it this is this is sort of
59:52 tough for me to say to you guys you know
59:56 any one point in history there's certain
59:59 looks that are considered good looking
60:01 and certain looks that are not
60:03 considered good looking I've been very
60:06 fortunate in my life
60:08 to fall into the society thing some
60:12 good-looking side of the equation and
60:17 there is an amazing thing that you find
60:20 out about life that I think that people
60:24 who find themselves on the unattractive
60:25 realm and it's sad that anybody believes
60:29 that it's BS everyone has a beauty to
60:33 them that's amazing it's it's really
60:35 true and confidence and who you are is
60:38 above all your rating when it comes to
60:44 whether or not you're attractive or not
60:46 know that about yourself I've seen
60:49 beautiful people they think that they're
60:50 ugly and ugly people think that they're
60:52 beautiful and it's like both of you are
60:54 beautiful just chill out you know but in
60:59 my life because of my looks I've been
61:01 able to usually date anyone that I meet
61:04 I'm able to get into that realm and at
61:07 least have a shot again maybe I'm not
61:10 interested them and they're interested
61:11 me but I'm the one that started it so I
61:13 try to finish it in a really gentlemanly
61:15 manner try not to get too close too
61:17 quick sort of people don't get
61:18 heartbroken and that kind of thing
61:19 because I get my heart broken to believe
61:21 me about it just stomped out like a bad
61:24 Sirit and that was good for me but what
61:28 ends up happening if you're awake is it
61:32 you find out that it doesn't matter what
61:36 someone looks like on the outside at all
61:38 it really doesn't when they speak it is
61:43 when you find the glory of God shining
61:46 through a human being and I say very
61:48 specifically like that because I'm
61:50 always telling you that you're special
61:51 and God wouldn't waste his time on you
61:53 if you weren't
61:55 why does God do you another trivial
61:57 being in the universe huh
61:59 now does that mean every fish in the sea
62:02 is special I don't know maybe maybe they
62:05 play a role in the greater ecosystem
62:08 that is the sea who knows I've known
62:11 some people that were amazingly
62:14 attractive that were hideous human
62:16 beings doesn't mean they aren't special
62:20 it just means that whatever
62:22 they made they chose to sort of side on
62:27 the side of selfishness and and
62:32 shallowness and they judged other people
62:35 in ways that no one should be judged
62:38 they miss the beauty of the world that
62:42 they lived in because they were too busy
62:44 being cynical and karma karma bites them
62:48 in the ass if you want to have an area
62:50 of life that karma absolutely works
62:52 almost instantaneously it's the acidic
62:55 ly beautiful human human being and then
62:59 there's people that have the weirdest
63:01 strangest looks you know according to
63:03 all the the doctrine of what is
63:05 beautiful and what is not and they're
63:08 surrounded by beautiful people
63:09 constantly because they are so
63:11 interesting and so amazing there's a
63:14 there's a I don't believe there's any
63:16 physical images of Socrates but Socrates
63:19 was known for being I'm just repeating
63:22 what people said from his time they said
63:24 he was one of the most unattractive men
63:26 ever isn't that fascinating because his
63:30 contribution to philosophy and
63:34 consciousness is the cornerstone of
63:37 almost every Greek philosopher after his
63:39 time and that phenomenal and he had huge
63:45 groups of students that would just come
63:47 and sit with him as he would discuss
63:51 things he's probably the og deep
63:53 thoughts dude when you're able to be
63:56 with anyone that you have interest in
63:59 you get to evaluate humanity at a much
64:03 faster pace and you don't get swept away
64:08 by things that are shallow like beauty
64:13 and you're like you know it there's an
64:15 old saying I'm gonna make it nicer and
64:18 it's saying I don't know it's about
64:21 twenty years old my lifespan but if
64:24 they're saying that no matter how
64:26 beautiful a person is there's always
64:27 someone who's tired of going to bed with
64:29 them I don't think that's completely
64:32 true but if that's all they have I
64:35 Guerin
64:35 to you it's true the bimbo the you know
64:41 that's always game aimed at women but
64:44 there's men bimbos too right I mean
64:45 whatever you call a guy that got the
64:47 same thing he's just just good-looking
64:49 but he's just got a head full of rocks
64:51 and so there's limits to that now maybe
64:55 there are sweetheart and that's why you
64:57 love them because they're just really
64:58 nice they're always there for your
65:00 taking their shirt off their back for
65:01 you helping you do whatever you need to
65:03 do
65:03 those are good people I'm not saying
65:06 anyone's a bad person but again as you
65:09 form your life and you're introducing
65:13 human variables into your life it's like
65:16 an equation where you have all those
65:17 letters plus - you know / and all this
65:19 other stuff it's a plus B dimes the over
65:22 X or whatever all these people are in
65:25 your life and as you have children they
65:27 become part of your equation that will
65:29 never go away hopefully if you are
65:32 around genuine people trust me and I say
65:37 this because when I went to Portland
65:41 Oregon once to see my buddy get married
65:43 I ran into some people that made it a
65:47 point to take a crap on beautiful people
65:50 and you know I thought it was very
65:53 interesting Marilyn Manson who I'm not I
65:56 think I would love to have a
65:57 conversation with that guy cuz I think
65:58 he's extremely intelligent he said some
66:01 extremely intelligent things and during
66:02 interviews and that fascinates me he's
66:06 obviously a guy I think he's got his
66:09 definitely his good looks you know he's
66:11 in that kind of interesting European
66:13 realm of look but he always treats
66:15 himself like he's not good-looking yeah
66:18 he talks about how he was a kid he was
66:19 all beat up and you know made fun of I
66:21 can believe that occurring I guess but
66:24 he made that song called the beautiful
66:26 people one of my favorite songs he ever
66:27 made and it shook me for a second
66:30 because I was thinking oh my god you're
66:33 right there's this there's this
66:35 perceived haves and have-nots of the
66:37 beautiful people and everybody else but
66:38 I went to Portland Oregon and there was
66:41 just the subliminal subtext of what
66:44 people were talking about hating on you
66:47 know other people when I was in the Bay
66:49 or
66:49 they hated on Los Angeles people like
66:51 you couldn't believe and it was one of
66:57 those equations I mentioned every once
66:58 in a while that Steve Jobs taught us all
67:00 these people don't have to lose for you
67:03 to win you're in your own realm and if
67:06 you have amazing people around you the
67:11 the beauty of your face or whatever your
67:13 body it all kind of dissolves being in
67:16 the video game business I would run into
67:19 predominantly guys who were extremely
67:21 introverted
67:22 they didn't Rexxar sighs they poorly and
67:26 they were talented because they were
67:28 introverts and they managed to manifest
67:30 their skills because of that appearance
67:32 that they had and they got off on things
67:34 that people didn't get off on who were
67:36 pretty people and I've had this thing my
67:40 entire life when I would go into if I go
67:43 into like a I don't do this anymore but
67:46 in the nineties there was role-playing
67:48 conventions that would come through town
67:49 the Bay Area tons of them I was it'd be
67:51 like Dungeons & Dragons conventions and
67:55 other conventions and you would go in
67:56 and I would always be you know really
68:01 trendy looking and blah blah blah right
68:03 you know and when I would walk in the
68:06 room I would notice that these kids
68:08 would get defensive and then as soon as
68:11 I treated them like normal human beings
68:15 and instead of being one of these
68:16 beautiful people that the Manson's
68:18 talking about were they're uppity and
68:19 and angry at you know or whatever
68:22 treating people less than themselves or
68:24 whatever I sat down with him and I would
68:26 start talking about my role-playing
68:28 experience and it was as deep if not
68:30 deeper than their own and I was one of
68:32 them and they were like oh my god he's
68:35 the cool guy who treats us like were
68:37 normal but people that look like that
68:39 guy typically are [ __ ] and they make
68:43 fun of us it's like ah if you ever see
68:45 the movie yet Not Another Teen Movie my
68:47 god it's it's rated R very r brace
68:51 yourself okay if you have a tender heart
68:53 don't watch it but if you love all those
68:56 80 movies eighties movies that we saw
68:57 the guy who's Captain America is one of
68:59 the leading actors in it
69:01 they're introducing all the kids to the
69:03 high school at the very beginning of the
69:05 movie and those guys like we don't at
69:07 this high school we don't have any
69:08 clicks either everybody's equal whatever
69:11 and then he goes okay jocks you go over
69:13 there nerds you go with hair girls you
69:15 hot chicks you come with me
69:16 he measly splits everybody into cliques
69:18 thus making a joke
69:21 being a computer whiz kid when I was
69:24 young I would go to the computer class
69:26 and all the geeks would just sort of
69:30 like push me away until I got the
69:33 highest score in the class and I would
69:34 treat them like normal human beings
69:36 I mentioned that whole thing because a
69:41 lot of you were like that anyway but
69:45 it's this inclusive algorithm that is
69:47 real not this faux stuff we have coming
69:50 out of certain political parties you
69:53 don't make a bunch of hate groups to
69:55 create tolerance in the world if you're
69:58 trying to build the circle of your life
70:00 with quality human beings I try to keep
70:04 it open constantly I don't date women
70:08 because they're beautiful I didn't
70:11 because at least on the outside I'm
70:12 Dania because they're beautiful on the
70:14 inside and that's the that's where I've
70:18 been the most successful
70:19 now sometimes they're beautiful as well
70:21 and you win both sides of the game there
70:23 are the physical beauties where you want
70:25 it whatever turns you want but you got
70:28 to get down into the deepness of who
70:30 people are if you're gonna hang on to
70:32 your dreams at the same exact time they
70:35 must understand your dreams and they
70:37 must see your success as their own
70:40 success and I really wanted to this
70:43 episode for this particular reason I'm
70:47 talking about how to succeed all the
70:49 time on your own how to go get your
70:50 dreams but I haven't talked about that
70:55 integration thing it's real important
70:58 and the friendship episode I talked
70:59 about it because it's the friendship
71:01 episodes really for you when you're
71:02 younger you're in your 20s and you're
71:05 trying to figure out okay how do I do
71:06 this how do I make sure I surround
71:08 myself with the best people that aren't
71:10 going to mess with my dreams but you
71:13 will find people because I'm always
71:14 telling you
71:15 that you're just basically an older
71:18 little kid those algorithms keep going
71:21 your whole life that what's interesting
71:23 is this is sort of sort of a morbid
71:29 reality when you get older let's say
71:32 you're 22 years old and you're double
71:36 out drinking buddies you're besties on
71:39 the girls side and your drink and drink
71:43 and drink and you're getting drunk
71:44 you're puking and you just kind of laugh
71:46 it off and you're thinking well we're
71:48 doing this because we're young and then
71:51 you cross over in your 40s and you
71:55 notice most people have calmed down out
71:56 of that they understand their livers
71:58 gonna explode eventually it's hard to
72:00 have a job and kids and drive home if
72:03 you're drunk couple duis and your whole
72:07 family life is gonna change let me tell
72:09 you one DUI in California and your life
72:13 will change about fifteen thousand
72:15 dollars in fines year suspended on your
72:18 license now when you go apply for jobs
72:21 that'll come up on your background check
72:23 your family and friends know and they
72:25 sort of know all right you know there's
72:30 a part of your childhood that needs to
72:32 go away it has to go away otherwise
72:36 you're gonna consume yourself to death
72:37 and very few people in this world want
72:41 anyone to die that stuff let me tell you
72:43 so everyone's usually rooting for you
72:45 they'll help you and that's just one
72:48 example one of the this came up today in
72:52 conversation it's another way to look at
72:55 your personal relationships let me give
72:57 you this little analogy and I'll shut up
72:59 if you're forming a business and you're
73:03 gonna take on a partner partnerships are
73:08 probably the most difficult marriage you
73:12 could possibly get into and if anyone is
73:17 telling you anything different they are
73:19 not very knowledgeable in the subject
73:21 matter I wrote a class once online I
73:24 don't even know where it is today but I
73:27 wrote about
73:28 I was like six or seven articles on it
73:31 but two of them were on partnerships and
73:33 I really it was after I came out of a
73:35 really bad partnership situation and it
73:39 wasn't bad in terms of other people's
73:42 really horrible stuff for people in
73:43 bezel money and destroy the company and
73:46 that kind of stuff it wasn't horrible
73:47 like that but it just definitely
73:49 contributed to the demise of my company
73:51 three or four years before it should
73:52 have my back my company should still
73:54 exist but what I tell people is if
73:57 someone was a drinker and they were your
73:59 partner and you go out with them I'm
74:01 sorry they're not your partner yet but
74:02 you're considering that they're
74:04 potentially a good partner you're gonna
74:07 need to dig into that drinking to find
74:08 out if they really have it under control
74:11 find out what they do what their
74:12 pastimes ask people do you ever seen
74:14 this guy drunk you know once I stun you
74:17 ever seen him drunk you ever seen him
74:18 drunk you need to know because there may
74:20 be a closeted alcoholic or maybe there a
74:22 budding alcoholic if they have a
74:25 marriage you need to know how solid that
74:28 marriage is your wife get alone won't we
74:32 go out and do like several dinners why
74:34 don't you have me over for a picnic I'll
74:35 have you over for a picnic let's go on a
74:36 vacation together for like ten days
74:39 because I need to see you get along with
74:42 your partner for ten days you even screw
74:45 something up during the during the be
74:48 good movie wouldn't it screw up
74:50 something during the vacation just to
74:51 see if if they're gonna break by the way
74:56 here's a digression what I saw was a
75:01 party crashers when I saw hangover two
75:05 and at the very beginning of that movie
75:07 there was this guys getting married to
75:09 this asian girl so the American guys in
75:12 Asia and they're in this elevator and
75:15 the doc the guy dies in the elevator and
75:18 then their whole life goes to [ __ ] The
75:20 Hangover to thing they're going to this
75:21 horrible thing I immediately thought of
75:26 what I thought I knew where the film was
75:28 going at the end and my ending is so
75:30 much better than their ending and it
75:32 goes like this
75:33 all of the just watch hangover 2 again
75:36 when you get to that first scene imagine
75:40 if
75:41 instead of it being what it turned out
75:42 to be which is everything was real at
75:44 the very end the bride's father had
75:49 created this complete facade to test the
75:53 groom to see what kind of man he was
75:55 because he didn't like the groom and so
75:58 the guy is really not dead in the
76:00 elevator it's all a big setup the whole
76:02 thing has been completely set up and at
76:04 the end he looks at the program and he
76:06 goes you passed the test
76:08 now you could marry my daughter that
76:10 would have been a better ending to that
76:11 movie
76:12 just ask me I'll write a better movie so
76:16 I give you the business analogy for this
76:17 one reason as you bring people into your
76:19 life you need to get into who they are
76:23 find out where their stress levels are
76:25 what breaks them what makes them what
76:28 makes them happy what makes them sad if
76:30 you're not a very sensitive person they
76:33 can't be a very sensitive person either
76:34 it just doesn't work I don't know how to
76:38 super overly sensitive people get along
76:40 it wouldn't hate to see that that might
76:42 be a great Christopher Guest movie I
76:44 think you feel me I mean I wanted to get
76:48 at this sort of adult-themed
76:51 conversation I just put out the mr.
76:56 Rogers episode three days ago it's doing
76:59 way better than I ever imagined it would
77:00 do which is great I felt definitely his
77:03 presence was on this patio when I was
77:07 recording it so maybe that's who I
77:08 should give the credit to when I saw mr.
77:12 Rogers go off and try to talk to adults
77:14 and he was giving them he was asking
77:17 them very poignant questions and he was
77:19 trying to dig down to a deeper level and
77:21 again like I said in the episode he
77:23 realized that the hardened bias of
77:26 mankind was interfering with his ability
77:30 to communicate with them it was sad and
77:33 so I feel like you guys are the crowd
77:37 that he wanted to talk to your
77:40 intellectual you are open-minded you
77:43 know I I want to say how privileged I
77:49 feel that any of you subscribe any of
77:53 you watch the episodes as much
77:55 those diehard folks because you're not
77:57 trivial human beings you're not watching
77:59 this show because you're dumb you're
78:01 watchin this show for the exact opposite
78:03 reason and then I think some of you
78:05 watch the show as a as my mentor you're
78:09 watching this show sort of smiling and
78:12 some of the things I say well you're
78:15 gonna find out it's different than that
78:16 but ok for now I'm you know you do your
78:19 thing I'll leave a comment see if I
78:21 can't maybe get your mind to think a
78:23 little bit different but I understand
78:25 you're you're you're bullheaded dude and
78:28 you're gonna think what you think and
78:30 that's it but you're up there having had
78:33 many of these experiences you've solved
78:35 these problems and I appreciate your
78:39 your viewership trust me
78:41 you know I I do consume and you know I
78:45 go home I barely watch any YouTube
78:47 that's serious I'm watching funny stupid
78:49 stuff you know these cringe videos I
78:52 just like that watch stuff I don't have
78:53 to think it's great sort of that I'm
78:57 just doing that once I'm going to bed
78:58 then I fall asleep right when I got on
79:01 my smoke lounges you guys always here
79:03 I'm watching the most intense stuff the
79:08 entire time I'm there cuz the guy owns a
79:09 place he loves that stuff he watches 12
79:12 hours of that stuff a day I have it we
79:16 all have a joke the student seen every
79:17 video on YouTube twice will go dude have
79:21 you seen this video yeah I've already
79:22 seen it
79:23 no and we go in he shows us cool stuff
79:25 and when he shows me really cool
79:27 light-hearted stuff I put it on the
79:29 website you know so there are people
79:32 like Lionel nation I think the guy's an
79:35 absolute genius but he's always talking
79:37 about current affairs and very acidic
79:39 topics and it's not because he's acidic
79:41 he is trying to give us perspective and
79:43 intelligence on how to digest acidic
79:46 things like I said in just recently I'm
79:51 trying to avoid that kind of stuff and
79:52 I'm trying to go at the metaphysical
79:55 human experience that we're all dealing
79:57 with because there is no manual that's
79:59 being written by anybody I mean there's
80:02 plenty of self-help books and that kind
80:04 of stuff but on YouTube I just don't
80:07 find there to be
80:08 stuff like this show and so I feel like
80:10 we're filling a gap for now now this
80:12 again I could be wrong it could be
80:14 20,000 channels out there they get
80:16 really deep and better than me it's
80:19 therapeutic for me hopefully it's good
80:21 for you as well
80:22 hopefully you feel me in this episode
80:25 here comes the outro if you haven't been
80:28 to deep thoughts radio.com please go
80:30 there's audio and video in case you want
80:32 to switch feeds there's a lock Facebook
80:34 group a Twitter page a patreon page in
80:38 case you want to tip the show again for
80:41 all the all of you stick on the any one
80:44 of those forums I super appreciate it
80:46 hope I'm creating content that's
80:47 entertaining if there are issues that
80:50 are metaphysical like this that just
80:53 seemed to come up in your life and
80:55 you're like oh you know literally if you
80:57 if you live an entire day and you've
80:58 watched tons of these episodes and
81:00 you're like man I got this frickin
81:02 problem if you don't want to share it in
81:05 a public way that someone can see who
81:07 you are know that's a guy with that
81:09 thing just get on a Facebook private
81:12 message me there's even a private
81:13 message system there was at least on
81:15 YouTube I don't know if it still exists
81:16 I think they got rid of it but if that
81:19 still exists that exists but then
81:20 Facebook has its thing private message
81:22 my deep mind account let me know what's
81:25 going on all of your stuff is
81:26 confidential I mean geez for the people
81:28 that I mentioned and give credit for
81:30 shows I barely remember who it is I
81:33 don't even sweat it but I will do my
81:35 best to address any of those issues
81:36 through my own experience and even if I
81:39 haven't had the experience I'll try to
81:41 dig in my experience in my mind to
81:44 figure out how maybe I didn't experience
81:45 that and then we can go at it from there
81:47 but anyway take care of yourself and
81:50 someone else and I'll see you in the
81:51 next deep thoughts over now
