00:29 welcome back to deep thought studies and
00:31 gentlemen today we're gonna cover a
00:35 subject that has been requested and it's
00:37 been on my list for quite a while and
00:40 boys is gonna be a doozy of explanations
00:44 it's gonna take me a little while is
00:48 that well I'm just gonna tell how this
00:49 is gonna go hopefully this makes it just
00:52 got a brand new box of my favorite cigar
00:55 for the show which is the rarest le Toro
00:59 I smoked all my lip Lumas loved every
01:02 single one of those sticks as well thank
01:05 you to the pluma folks for sending a box
01:07 over last time I did one of these on the
01:10 first box it had a big tunnel down it so
01:12 hopefully it doesn't happen here quantum
01:16 computing I finally took the deep dive
01:20 in quantum computing and this is gonna
01:25 be a multi-dimensional episode because
01:27 what we're gonna do is we're gonna
01:29 explain I'm gonna attempt to explain the
01:33 quantum computing as accurately as I can
01:36 and then we're gonna talk about the
01:41 amazing amount of hype coming around
01:44 this technology and then probably
01:48 reflect on how it is definitely exciting
01:51 it'll be interesting to see if they can
01:53 make this work and it's it's sort of a
01:59 logical progression and one way or the
02:02 other to refine the way that we store
02:05 data and manipulate data but they're
02:10 currently in 2019 we're a few inventions
02:16 away from making this really a super
02:19 plausible solution such that it actually
02:23 achieves what we think it's going to
02:25 achieve which is a much faster world
02:29 much faster computing world so what is
02:34 the quantum computer
02:35 hmm I hope to god you guys have some
02:40 some computer background and this isn't
02:42 aimed at anyone who was completely
02:46 informed about all this stuff because
02:48 it'll be a little bit boring the one
02:50 thing I'm gonna do is mix in some of my
02:52 ether or research into this such that we
02:54 can acknowledge some of the what some of
02:58 what's really going on with some of this
03:00 it's not terribly important because we
03:02 can work with the higher end concepts of
03:06 atomic energy and matter in general as
03:10 it is created by ether winds there's
03:14 still some fascination about some basic
03:16 experiments I don't really think the
03:18 experts have any fascination about how
03:22 like you know the slit test of light
03:27 creates a reverberation on its receiving
03:30 sensor and that kind of stuff and I'll
03:33 try to put some images in here to help
03:38 explain some of this stuff so how does a
03:42 traditional computer work deep down
03:44 inside of its guts I'm gonna try to make
03:48 this easy for everyone to understand
03:49 even if you've never done anything in
03:51 computers because some of the things I'm
03:54 gonna say are things that you've heard
03:56 and then what I'm not going to do is is
03:59 persecute your mind with over you know
04:06 over explaining various examples of how
04:09 things work but we're gonna have to get
04:10 into some of this in order to explain
04:13 things your normal computer it works by
04:19 storing zeros and ones and everything is
04:24 broke down from zeros and ones and then
04:29 we have hardware that metabolizes up
04:33 zeros and ones I mean there's only two
04:35 digits to be able to do normal decimal
04:39 based in mathematics which is what you
04:42 and I use when we go to the grocery
04:43 store why do they call it base 10 base
04:47 10 because there are 10 unique
04:49 digits that we use to represent all
04:51 numbers now some societies were living
04:54 in a base nine for quite some time
04:56 because the idea of a null or a zero or
05:00 not depending on where you are in the
05:02 world was not conceived of by a lot of
05:09 societies because what they did was they
05:11 said well if there is nothing if that's
05:13 what we're talking about then it wasn't
05:16 a numerical digit that they wrote down
05:20 they simply would stop and disengage
05:23 from mathematics and go well if you've
05:24 taken my last Apple then I have none and
05:27 that means something different than zero
05:29 so eventually Western societies and I
05:34 think Western society is really the
05:36 first to pioneer the zero we got zero
05:40 one through nine that's ten digits and
05:42 that's why it's based in I give you one
05:45 little complex example which won't take
05:47 much for you to understand but you have
05:50 probably heard in your lifetime a
05:52 hexadecimal system which is a base 16
05:55 system all that means is we go 0 1 2 3 4
06:00 5 6 7 8 9 and then we say a b c d e f we
06:04 had 6 alpha you know alpha characters
06:09 right alphabetical characters on the end
06:11 and then once you've spent the last
06:13 character you go back to two and so one
06:19 goes way up and then 2 but 2 would equal
06:21 17 and it wouldn't equal 2
06:24 that's all you need to know there's all
06:26 kinds of ways to count in different sets
06:30 of numbers if somebody said look I'm
06:32 gonna give you 0 through 3 then you're
06:34 in a base for system I give you that
06:38 example because ones and zeros have been
06:40 arranged in a way inside of a computer's
06:42 brain to represent what we think of as
06:47 in a base 10 system for example 0 is 0 1
06:53 is 1 but 2 is actually 10 1 0 because if
06:59 a 1 comes down the chute and there's
07:02 already a 1 there that
07:03 to a zero and then you just put it next
07:05 put the one that you're trying to put in
07:06 place over to the left and then the next
07:09 number three three the one comes down
07:12 it's a zero and so it can take its place
07:15 instead of flipping the number it does
07:17 it does flip it but it's one one that's
07:19 three this is the stuff I learned when I
07:22 was 11 and this is how we drew artwork
07:25 back in the day for old computers if it
07:30 was a zero there was no pixel there if
07:32 it was a 1 then you put a pixel there
07:35 and then you could give it a color the
07:36 whole strip it was a strip of four
07:38 binary numbers and then if it was a 1
07:42 you've got a pixel there it's a zero
07:44 didn't get a pixel so imagine taking
07:46 every combination of four on offs and
07:50 then using that to build a picture and
07:52 you could only give stacks of four at a
07:55 time a different color so if you wanted
07:58 to have one pixel have the different
08:00 colors and then in a particular strip
08:02 you'd have to stack two strips on top of
08:04 each other and it's gonna say there's
08:06 one pixel here and it's red anything
08:08 underneath is a blue anything underneath
08:10 that maybe it's green whatever you're
08:12 trying to do okay hopefully that wasn't
08:16 terribly confusing I can see a major
08:19 headache for animating this thing so
08:23 here's how I think quantum computing
08:25 came around and this will help explain
08:30 why quantum computing is so nebulous and
08:35 difficult to understand how it's going
08:38 to be used and you need to understand
08:39 that a giant portion of quantum
08:41 computing I would say the lion's share
08:43 of all the research that has to be done
08:45 to really make these things fall into
08:47 every device and in your life especially
08:51 to eclipse the speed of the old system
08:56 it's it's some years out but someone got
09:00 the idea look let's work with something
09:05 super teeny tiny and that way if we can
09:10 master teeny tiny methodologies of
09:12 registering a one or a zero
09:15 then we can pack more computing into a
09:19 smaller place and we could use literally
09:23 fractions of a fraction of a fraction of
09:25 a fraction of electricity to actually
09:28 control the device and so you could have
09:30 a supercomputer I mean like a real one
09:33 one word even today it's a big warehouse
09:36 somewhere you could have that thing in
09:38 what looks like a piece of pepper on
09:40 your plate if they could get quantum
09:44 computing completely down to the quantum
09:46 level of actually controlling it now it
09:48 works I know I'm getting confusing here
09:50 but stick with me so when they look at
09:54 computing they know they have to start
09:57 with this one and zero theory because
10:00 everything that man has ever designed
10:02 for computers builds up from this binary
10:05 system this two digit system zeros and
10:07 ones and so they look for things in the
10:10 universe that are naturally bipolar it's
10:14 got a 1 or a 0 and in one particular
10:17 state and then they look for the fact
10:18 they look for the science to say ok we
10:21 found this thing and the way it does its
10:23 thing I think we might be able to
10:26 control it by this methodology that
10:31 methodology and then if we put a bunch
10:33 of these things together and we could
10:36 comfortably transmit our data to it
10:39 meaning we can change them as we want
10:41 them from ones and zeros whatever this
10:42 could be apples right I mean if apples
10:44 just sat on trees the summer upside down
10:46 and some of them right-side up
10:47 you could use an apple tree to make a
10:49 computer as long as from a distance you
10:52 could tell every Apple which way to be
10:53 and then some other system reads the
10:55 states of the apples and goes oh yeah
10:57 totally it's a number 5 you know so what
11:00 they've done is they've isolated some
11:06 types of atoms
11:07 I think phosphor is that one of them
11:14 silicon they have figured out atoms that
11:19 are fairly fundamental it'll have a lot
11:21 of pieces and parts to get in the way of
11:23 what they're trying to do hydrogen is
11:26 sort of I think a little too explosive
11:29 and
11:30 to be able to control and so what
11:33 they're trying to do this is brilliant
11:35 is they're trying to take the orbital
11:39 idea of an electron and control it such
11:47 that it has a state that can be
11:52 recognized as a one or a zero
11:55 now the true existence of an electron is
12:00 bunk science ok is not a little particle
12:04 that flies around the outside of an atom
12:07 that's not what it really is what it is
12:09 is a force field cloud around the
12:12 outside of an atom it is the you notice
12:16 I always say in my ether episodes ok
12:18 when the ether or particle hits the
12:21 center Nikolaus of an atom and bounces
12:23 back like a ricochet
12:25 that's your dielectric wave of energy
12:29 when ether particles get stuck in an
12:32 orbit because they miss the center and
12:34 they get pushed by their buddies right
12:35 it's like being pushed in a crowd they
12:38 get pushed by other buddies on all sides
12:39 so it's a three dimensional cloud of
12:42 orbiting II throw particles
12:44 that's your magnetic wave ok when the
12:47 two collide which is happening from all
12:50 sides ok the orbits of cloud and
12:52 ricochets are coming off tangent to
12:54 their impacts like take this microphone
12:57 was a nucleus comes in bounces off
12:59 bounces off in every conceivable
13:00 direction constantly that collision
13:04 creates a spin and that spin is where we
13:09 start to call it an electron cloud and
13:11 it's made of what we now call the two
13:13 hitting each other is called the
13:15 electromagnetic field around a
13:17 particular nucleus at the same time this
13:23 is occurring because the universe is
13:25 comprised of ether particles ether
13:28 particles are always going into the
13:29 nucleus as well into the microphone and
13:31 they come out the bottom and the console
13:33 actually come out of the top and going
13:34 to the bottom right so they they
13:37 theorize this on paper and they said of
13:40 course the word quantum just makes it
13:41 sound cool right
13:43 so they theorized this on paper and then
13:45 they started too tempting to control the
13:49 polarity of the this cloud which way is
13:54 the cloud spinning and they they know
13:58 that it has a North Pole and a South
14:01 Pole in a pure state there'll be a
14:06 perfect alignment for this cloud such
14:08 that everything is in a spin up was what
14:12 they call it just think about this whole
14:15 you know Van Allen belt thing and you
14:17 know we have compasses that point north
14:19 when it comes out of the top of earth
14:22 and goes into the bottom but if you
14:24 could take the core of the earth and
14:25 rotate it the plasma energy that's
14:27 creating this thing it's in the center
14:29 not nickel iron nickel iron loses all
14:31 magnetism at 6,500 degrees Fahrenheit
14:34 it's all bunk
14:35 right everything is plasma interiors
14:37 created by you throw particles okay but
14:40 if you could take it and rotate it then
14:41 you would have the positive or at least
14:43 the the ejection point at the bottom and
14:46 it go into the top and that's what they
14:47 call spin down sounds pretty good right
14:52 the way that you actually control the
14:57 spin orientation of this electron cloud
15:00 is to hit it with microwaves it's so
15:03 ether all it's crazy and these people
15:04 don't even acknowledge it exists right
15:06 really funny well what's a what's a
15:10 microwave ray it's a wave of energy with
15:14 its own property it's just like the wind
15:16 that blows the blows on the bridge back
15:19 in the 30s and the bridge starts to feel
15:20 the frequency and it pops and blows up
15:23 and all the cars fall in the water right
15:24 well you can grab with one wave that's
15:30 have the perfect frequency you can grab
15:32 of a particular electron in a particular
15:34 orbit around a particular atom they have
15:36 to figure out what exact frequency it
15:38 does it's pretty easy because they'll
15:40 put it on oscilloscope on the electron
15:42 cloud and they just kind of rotate
15:44 through a big wave just like turning the
15:46 knob on your FM radio they just go
15:48 across and then when they affect that
15:50 wave like oh this is it 45 right
15:55 and once they dial into it then they can
15:57 modulate it and turn it and then what's
16:00 cool about it is they can get in between
16:05 states and this is the natural state of
16:09 an electron cloud because electron cloud
16:12 is constantly just whirling around this
16:16 central nucleus because it's being
16:17 collided by all kinds of ether particles
16:20 from all sides and so the natural state
16:23 of an ether oh our sorry of an electron
16:26 cloud this is constantly spitting
16:28 between north and south
16:30 it means it's also registering at any
16:33 one point in time every single time in
16:36 the day if it was a clock or hate if 12
16:38 o'clock was north and 6 o'clock was
16:42 south it's it's also spinning so quickly
16:44 than any quantum moment in time right a
16:47 little pack at a time it is everywhere
16:50 over a distance of time now if you could
16:53 snapshot it and really get it which the
16:55 uncertainty principle prohibits us from
16:57 doing this accurately then we'd know
17:00 exactly where it was at a particular
17:02 time but the next time we measure it's
17:04 going to be in a different location
17:05 unless we exert energy on it just like
17:09 taking the cover off of a compass and
17:11 you put your finger on it you can move
17:12 it to wherever you want you're exerting
17:14 energy to move the little arrow around
17:16 that's what they have to do if they want
17:17 to control this thing so what they I
17:20 think they found out is let's mess with
17:24 and and try to probe and then control
17:28 the anatomy of an atom so that we can
17:33 take all this information we're
17:35 processing in silicon chips and in
17:38 little silicon bumps that hold charges
17:40 right zeros and ones there isn't one's
17:41 right and there's actually a null in the
17:42 Senate right but basically if you drew a
17:46 line just so you understand it in normal
17:49 electronics you drew a line down the
17:51 center of the page and said that's zero
17:53 that's nothing that's no charge at all
17:54 there's no electricity going towards
17:56 this particular component you can put a
17:59 negative charge in there and you're
18:00 going to get a square wave below the
18:01 line and that's your off state and then
18:05 you can put energy more energy in and
18:07 put
18:08 upper state and that's where you get
18:10 your positively negative and your
18:11 neutral your neutrals basically the
18:13 components been turned off and whatever
18:15 data is there is useless so when they
18:18 started this process they realized
18:20 immediately well geez you know we don't
18:24 have like off-the-shelf inventions to
18:26 start talking to atoms and controlling
18:28 exactly what state they're in and so
18:31 they had to deal with this issue and in
18:33 what's sort of going on right now
18:36 if you look at TED talks and other
18:39 people trying to champion this
18:40 technology there's some scientists that
18:43 are being extremely honest and I salute
18:45 them a thousand percent because they're
18:47 where the progress is actually occurring
18:49 I've seen a TED talk about this
18:52 technology and it is it was one of the
18:55 worst examples I've ever seen of
18:57 explaining this and then it just sat
19:00 there and promised vaporware oh it's
19:04 gonna help cure Alzheimer's it's gonna
19:06 help this anatman is they just pull
19:08 things out that'll make you feel
19:10 passionate so any time a bill comes by
19:12 or a prop or whatever you're excited to
19:16 fund it and you should be but not for
19:18 these generic stupid reasons right you
19:21 know they they can't they can't a
19:22 hundred percent control this stuff on
19:25 demand just yet now there are some
19:30 quantum computers out there and you can
19:31 actually lease one and iBM has one
19:34 that's actually online but it has a lot
19:36 of as at least three percent error
19:39 currently and they'll get through these
19:41 phases at some point the average
19:45 computer computational speed of a
19:48 particular transaction in a normal chip
19:50 and a normal computer using the ones and
19:52 zeros old technique of today was
19:54 admitted by one of the one of the more
19:57 brilliant quantum physicists who's
19:59 working on this technology the new
20:01 technology says look the individual task
20:04 is probably faster on a traditional
20:07 computer but because of the way that we
20:10 approach processing data with quantum
20:13 computing is so much different and I'll
20:15 give you a great example that this this
20:17 girl did his video online and she should
20:19 give the best example on this
20:21 but because of the way that they process
20:25 almost everything simultaneously on the
20:28 quantum side even though each one of the
20:30 instructions is slightly slower to do
20:33 currently it might get faster later it's
20:37 actually not winning the individual
20:39 sprint but in the marathon of data
20:42 analysis quanta computing can eat our
20:46 normal computers alive but it's not
20:48 going to be something that you would use
20:51 for Photoshop or cruising the web and
20:55 writing an email or that kind of stuff
20:57 you don't need quantum computing for
20:59 those tasks we already have that under
21:01 wraps now does that mean the innovation
21:03 in those areas should cease absolutely
21:05 not you know I think that we could
21:07 probably honestly we could tap I mean if
21:12 Apple wasn't slowing down devices
21:13 intentionally in versions of software
21:15 are intentionally slowed down with
21:18 updates if we could get rid of that
21:20 criminal cabal of the way the world
21:22 works today then we could probably
21:24 survive off of maybe a five gigahertz
21:26 hit for the next 50 years that's not the
21:29 case for 3d people Photoshop people
21:32 video editing people people that need to
21:33 crunch a lot of numbers they still need
21:36 the old technique to run as quickly as
21:38 possible so they could probably top out
21:40 at maybe 50 gig or something like that
21:42 where it's just there's never a
21:43 completion bar anything you conceive of
21:46 can be done immediately as soon as that
21:48 occurs you know a Pixar is doing another
21:51 Nemo video and they want to calculate
21:53 refraction of water looking through the
21:57 camera as soon as that it's just real
22:01 time without rendering and it's photo
22:03 real and it's 8k or whatever the hell
22:05 they want we're good we don't need to
22:08 innovate past that point but let me give
22:11 you a tangible example of how a quantum
22:15 computer would do things differently and
22:17 thus faster and better than a normal
22:20 computer imagine you had a maze and the
22:26 maze has let's say eight entry points
22:31 and but one exit and it all combines in
22:35 inside the Me's so all the paths will
22:37 lead you to basically any places inside
22:40 but what you're supposed to find out in
22:43 this particular test is what is the
22:45 fastest distance the shortest distance I
22:48 should say from a particular entrance to
22:51 a particular one exit and you can make
22:54 this as complex as you want but this is
22:55 an easy way to think about it well what
22:58 a normal computer would do is
23:01 systematically they say there's eight
23:02 entrances and one exit and it all
23:04 combines in the center it would push
23:07 into one and it go at on every single
23:09 path until it found every wrong way and
23:12 then finally finds the exit and it
23:13 measures how long did that take how many
23:16 steps did you take how much distance did
23:17 you travel puts it in a table then it
23:20 goes to the next interest and does the
23:22 whole thing over again every single
23:26 entrance is going to be examined one at
23:28 a time and in the end you look at your
23:30 table and whatever has the shortest
23:32 distance is the shortest distance they
23:33 call this the a-star algorithm and video
23:36 games it's been around forever so
23:38 anytime you play a video game where an
23:39 enemy is tracking to you it's doing the
23:42 a-star algorithm and it's looking around
23:44 you to find where you are and what would
23:46 be the best way to get to you and then
23:47 there's other artificial intelligence
23:49 that's added to that to move around
23:50 obstacles and and hide and do all kinds
23:54 of cool intelligent things right but the
23:56 basic thing is that a normal computer is
23:58 going to test eight entrances it's going
24:01 to take and it can't do two at once I
24:03 mean you could program it to do two at
24:04 once but here's the thing a quantum
24:08 computer would go into that I'll go into
24:11 that solution they're going to that prom
24:13 I should say to find the solution and it
24:16 by design because of these bits never
24:20 really truly being a 1 or a 0 I mean
24:22 they can't control it but if they just
24:24 allow it to be this cloud between 0 and
24:28 1 it will go into that maze and it will
24:31 go at the very first operation into 8
24:34 entrances at the same exact time and
24:37 whoever wins first is immediately the
24:42 best way and then they could abort all
24:44 the other searches because it's just
24:46 like a game you would play
24:48 in a backyard whoever gets to the exit
24:52 first wins period it doesn't matter how
24:55 everyone else got there so that's sort
24:58 of a physical difference between the two
25:00 computers so now if we call the bits in
25:06 a normal computer bits that's what a bit
25:09 is if someone if you want to know what a
25:10 binary number is stored in its called a
25:12 bit it's 1 or 0 that's it the quantum
25:19 computer has something called qubits qu
25:23 bi T s right and so the cool thing about
25:30 qubits and this is where I'm gonna try
25:34 to make this as simple as possible
25:36 trying to get the easiest way to say
25:38 this to you guys you don't imagine
25:44 imagine the way we buy cars and when you
25:48 want a car in a particular color and a
25:51 car can come in four colors and if you
25:55 were to try to describe the choices to a
25:59 customer it's pretty simple right you
26:02 can do it in four colors and you name
26:04 them off that's done but if you were to
26:07 go to a car lot that's a quantum car a
26:09 lot and the the amount of colors that
26:16 could be chosen is now no longer being
26:19 stirred binary and rolled up to four
26:21 different numbers is now a cubed it's
26:24 four different qubits or whatever it is
26:26 let's just say it's one qubit you know
26:29 that every possible color that could
26:31 possibly exist when you know the little
26:33 pink and a shaker thing at Home Depot it
26:38 could be any shade of anything any mix
26:40 of anything and how do you describe that
26:42 to the customer you'd have to say well
26:47 it could be any color you want ma'am sir
26:50 whatever any color that you want okay
26:55 the math behind this is actually
26:58 extremely interesting because
27:03 what we are doing I'm trying to get the
27:08 easiest way to describe this this is a I
27:10 don't wanted you guys to have to know
27:12 any calculus to understand this for
27:16 every qubit that they can isolate and
27:18 control in a quantum computer the amount
27:23 of data that they're able to analyze and
27:26 analyze quickly you could have the I
27:31 give you an example there's prime
27:33 numbers that could take a hundred years
27:38 in a supercomputer today and it would be
27:41 it would be solved by a quantum computer
27:44 for this thing I'm gonna and this reason
27:45 I'm going to give you guys in a matter
27:48 of seconds if not split seconds
27:49 depending on how successful the search
27:51 might be any of you've searched for a
27:54 file on your computer
27:55 spotlights pretty good on Mac OS but
27:58 even even Mac OS if you have a lot of
28:01 hard drives it'll turn for a little
28:02 while that search however fast it is in
28:08 a normal computer if properly accessed
28:13 it properly stored in a quantum database
28:15 a quantum computer could go in there and
28:18 find it almost to the mathematical
28:25 equivalent of instantaneously every
28:28 single time because of that little maze
28:31 thing I told you because the qubit can
28:38 be any variation between one and zero
28:40 all right any percentage of either one
28:44 or zero which is you know you just
28:46 basically say a 50% mark it's 51%
28:49 towards the positive it's gonna be
28:51 considered a positive let's just think
28:52 about it that way
28:53 if it's below 50% and we're gonna
28:55 consider it a negative let's just round
28:57 up round down all the old mathematics
28:59 right because of this relationship to a
29:03 binary principle of trying to have a 1
29:06 or a 0 the way that they compute it as
29:09 they say the number 2 which stands for 1
29:12 or 0 2 positions they can travel or
29:15 sorry register excuse me
29:16 so no traveling in this and then for
29:19 every cubit that they can isolate and
29:22 accurately control inside of a quantum
29:25 computer where I talked a little bit
29:26 about the anatomy in just a second you
29:29 put that to the power of two so if you
29:33 have one qubit maybe two to the power of
29:35 one if you could control to two to the
29:39 power of two now just ask anyone in your
29:41 family the profound nature of what I'm
29:45 about to tell you if they're good at
29:46 mathematics because their goal is to
29:51 isolate per computer about 300 cubits
29:56 okay two to the power of 300 now this is
30:02 going to be a theoretical mind blower
30:04 but it we actually don't know the if
30:07 this is true or not but it's pretty safe
30:09 to say but if you were to build a
30:12 universe out of at least what we call
30:15 atoms not probably throw particles 2 to
30:19 the power 300 would represent enough
30:25 digits enough unique values to account
30:30 for the solar system and the universe
30:32 that we can see with the naked eye and
30:34 everything we've ever theorized about
30:36 how big the universe is
30:37 so 2 ^ 300-word account for every grain
30:41 of sand and every atom that makes a
30:43 grain of sand on every single
30:44 conceivable planet Moon Sun anything out
30:49 there in space a nebula a meteorite
30:52 everything so imagine mankind here on
30:56 planet Earth being able to build a
30:59 computer that's not that big because
31:02 these things are teeny tiny little
31:03 qubits are 300 atoms that they're
31:06 controlling that takes more atoms to
31:08 hang onto those atoms and transmit data
31:10 to them read data back and use certain
31:13 microwaves to control their States think
31:17 about that us having a computer that
31:19 could sieve of the universe
31:21 whoa how many of you seen the black
31:24 mirror it's the first episode of season
31:27 four I think so
31:30 three or four it's the it's the star
31:32 trek one and this kid built a virtual
31:35 reality where you put this little tiny
31:40 M&M shaped thing on the side of your
31:42 temple and it took over your whole
31:46 reality and he he had a universe inside
31:49 this computer and so everyone is
31:50 literally living in a total virtual
31:52 reality of of 100% one-to-one
31:55 correlation between our reality and this
31:57 virtual reality and you think about that
32:00 you're like oh man I could I mean maybe
32:02 we get there but you know not with our
32:04 current computers I mean how could you
32:06 account for all the grains of sand that
32:08 we're in that episode you know they went
32:09 down to a planet people changed into
32:11 monsters they're driving their ship
32:13 everywhere with a quantum computer with
32:18 300 cubits that they could control it's
32:21 conceptually possible now in that wild
32:27 the other thing that might disappear
32:29 would be the need for memory because
32:32 it's just in the computer's CPU the CPU
32:36 by design has all the memory you'd ever
32:38 need conceptually speaking now this
32:43 stuff is in serious conceptual mode
32:45 right now one of the biggest and there's
32:50 another element to this whole thing
32:51 which makes it exponentially even bigger
32:55 which is guess we should just go for it
32:59 now so we can get off of this super
33:01 duper technical stuff well every atom
33:05 regardless if it's see-through or not
33:07 which it is has a nucleus some parts of
33:11 the nucleus are positive and some parts
33:13 the nucleus are neutral but it has its
33:17 own little Van Allen belt its own little
33:19 electromagnetic wave around it created
33:22 by the same methodology which is 1 3
33:24 dimensional spirals of ether winds that
33:27 escape and they always go in a
33:28 particular spherical shape it's like
33:31 bubbles in your beer man they actually
33:34 can control through the same technique
33:39 that they used to control the electron
33:41 cloud they can exert
33:44 measurably I believe more energy than
33:47 they do with the cloud but they can also
33:49 turn the inside of the atom it's Nicolas
33:53 upside down and back and forth that's
33:55 what happens to water in a microwave
33:57 right one reason why you don't want to
33:59 use microwaves is that it's it takes all
34:01 water molecules with microwaves and it
34:04 turns them upside down and right-side up
34:06 a billion times a second that friction
34:10 of water spinning back and forth back
34:12 and forth back and forth heats the
34:13 inside of your food it also shatters
34:16 food compounds which is why you get sick
34:18 if you eat certain foods and microwaves
34:21 it's why water that's gone to a
34:23 microwave your coffee all that stuff you
34:25 feel like you can't eat up on an oven if
34:28 you have electric ovens I sympathize
34:29 with you if you have a gas oven there's
34:32 really no excuse it's almost the same
34:33 time but you've then messed with the
34:37 electrical properties of the water and
34:39 for a short bit you drink that stuff and
34:41 it's just messing with your insights
34:44 again Russia banned microwaves not
34:46 because they wanted to keep their people
34:48 in the stone Age's but because they
34:50 wanted to keep their people health
34:51 because they had a socialized health
34:52 care system and my former partner an
34:55 attorney who did her intern in Russia
34:58 said there was one microwave hidden in
35:00 their little village town that she went
35:03 to she had to go completely across town
35:04 to heat up a cup of coffee quickly but
35:07 they also used gas ovens a lot so it's
35:08 not a big problem ok so think about
35:14 their ability to control the outside
35:18 electron cloud to deduce and control
35:21 which we're gonna get to the how that's
35:22 done
35:23 it's positive and negative general
35:26 capabilities when they really need to
35:28 make sure it's it's there but if you
35:32 could take the center of the atom and
35:33 turn it the outer cloud goes with it and
35:38 so you could take a bunch of charges
35:40 that are one-way and if you can spin the
35:42 nucleus is upside down you've reversed
35:45 the polarity of whatever the logic gate
35:47 is that's there I'll give you a really
35:49 cute crude example imagine you're
35:52 painting in black and white it's just to
35:54 make it easy for your brain in a paint
35:56 application
35:57 it's all just black or white particles
35:58 that serve pixels that's it so you want
36:01 to invert your image in Photoshop well
36:04 if they just took if they're if all the
36:07 pixels that you are seeing on screen are
36:09 the approximations of spin up spin down
36:11 electron cloud orientation and you spun
36:15 all the Nicholas's upside down your
36:16 image would invert because all the
36:19 outside values are gonna go opposite
36:21 pretty cool right now again it there's a
36:27 lot of complexity to this because it
36:29 took takes a fair amount of energy
36:31 through microwaves to make a spin down
36:34 cloud generally be oriented the other
36:36 way to spin up so if you took all the
36:40 nucleuses and spun them upside down
36:42 imagine being able to say I'm just
36:44 making this up but imagine being able to
36:46 bring waves down to point down is a much
36:50 cheaper use of energy and then if you
36:55 could economically spin the cores up
36:57 then you could spin them up and you
37:00 could achieve a positive for a lot less
37:02 cost there's a lot of things we do in
37:05 manufacturing little crafts and arts and
37:08 stuff where we'll build something upside
37:09 down and then we just turn it right-side
37:11 up and we use gravity to help us out the
37:13 first time and then we spin it up it's
37:16 just an idea so one of these little
37:19 qubits are obviously extremely volatile
37:23 to the environment because the
37:25 environment is always vibrating right
37:27 warmth is vibration cold is a lack of
37:30 vibration all right so in order to
37:36 control these qubits to get them in a
37:39 natural state where the the techniques
37:45 that we have been able to manage in a
37:46 very very short period of time and you
37:48 can probably assume that the DoD and
37:52 militaries been using quantum for a
37:54 little while
37:54 I would think so so what they do is they
37:59 try to chill any of these little
38:03 particles that they're trying to control
38:05 down to as close to absolute zero as
38:08 possible to stop their shaking
38:10 such that they can control with a lot
38:14 less energy so they're not fighting the
38:15 environmental energy that's coming in
38:17 that's heat that shakes this thing so if
38:20 you see a quantum computer it's
38:22 typically some cylinders you know I you
38:28 know what I've been told is that they
38:29 actually put a traditional transistor
38:34 next to one of these qubits and what
38:37 they are what they have figured out how
38:40 to do is to say like let me explain a
38:44 capacitor for you real quickly here so a
38:47 capacitor is typically the traditional
38:51 capacitor you see instead of a PC board
38:53 back in the old days before everything
38:54 was miniaturized is you would see one of
38:57 those flat little beige disks and it'd
38:59 have like two little legs out of it
39:01 right well what that does is there there
39:04 are certain voltages because they're
39:06 made of certain materials you have two
39:08 wafers of conductive material right next
39:11 to each other but there's a space
39:12 between them and what they do is they
39:15 bring in electrons to start charging one
39:20 of the plates and what ends up happening
39:22 is is these orbital etheral particles
39:27 which are called electrons team up with
39:29 each other they're their orbits start to
39:32 combine they start to gain charge they
39:34 start to work together and eventually
39:36 they will gain enough power it almost
39:39 like legs that have to jump off to the
39:40 other side they get enough power that
39:42 they jump across the plate well the
39:45 interesting thing about a capacitor is
39:47 you can control it's almost like a coil
39:50 it builds up a certain charge in then
39:52 jumps across the plate so what they've
39:55 done is created what I think is best
39:58 described as the capacitating experience
40:01 where this qubit is being flipped north
40:05 when its flipped north it has it's
40:07 considered to have a higher voltage it's
40:09 how it spins up when that happens it
40:12 gains it of energy to throw some of its
40:15 material over to the transistor and
40:17 that's where they can actually read
40:18 what's in a qubit they write to it using
40:23 the
40:24 microwaves and they read from it by its
40:26 natural capacitation of the high wave
40:28 into these transistors that are very
40:31 close and then they can start using
40:32 normal transistor logic which is what we
40:35 have in the normal computers this is all
40:39 being fudged together with off-the-shelf
40:41 technology and they will most likely
40:42 neutralize those concepts with better
40:47 concepts as time passes you know another
40:50 way to think about that maize thing
40:52 would be to say if you had a
40:54 three-dimensional maze like a big block
40:57 of steel or something and you've drilled
40:59 all kinds of wild paths down there like
41:00 a big transmission block and if you took
41:04 an eyedropper on one of the holes at the
41:06 top and you start dropping into it a
41:08 little hose right you just fill up one
41:09 of the little holes eventually it's
41:12 gonna start filling up the inside of
41:13 this thing hopefully with oil or some
41:15 transmission fluid right and it'll start
41:17 spurting out of the other other holes
41:18 maybe it only goes down right the
41:23 quantum computer would be like pouring a
41:26 bucket of transmission fluid in the top
41:28 of all those little holes so they all go
41:29 in at the same exact time and they all
41:31 spread out one's gonna go first and one
41:33 go second that sort of thing right maybe
41:35 some are equal paths right one of the
41:38 other sort of fringy concepts which is
41:44 interesting okay is sort of a butterfly
41:48 effect of what they're calling quantum
41:52 teleportation now of course when most of
41:55 us here teleportation you can't help to
41:57 think of like the Star Trek teleporter
41:59 technology where human being walks
42:01 through a door jamb and ends up out of a
42:03 door jamb and some other place in the
42:04 world everyone who's fallen in love with
42:05 someone far away has begged the universe
42:09 for teleportation technology and
42:12 unfortunately we're really not talking
42:14 about that just yet okay but you know
42:18 the theory of the butterfly effect a
42:21 butterfly in Peru flies and it disturbs
42:24 the atmosphere and all the atomic mass
42:26 that's by its and eventually eventually
42:29 it'll sway the world to change the tea
42:32 in China the price of the tea in China
42:34 because it will neurologically affect
42:36 people and it just it's risk
42:38 for the you know a reaction in a equal
42:44 and opposite reaction you know one of
42:47 the one of the interesting little this
42:52 is not quite related to what we're
42:53 talking about but this is a real easy
42:54 analogy when you teach physics to kids
42:57 one of the things that the teacher will
43:00 typically do is have a kid push on the
43:02 wall and they say well why aren't you
43:05 caving in that wall when the kid goes
43:07 because the wall is strong and that
43:08 teacher will remind the kid well just so
43:12 that you know if the wall didn't push
43:15 back on your hand the same exact amount
43:17 that you pushed on it you would be
43:18 caving in the wall at some point you'd
43:20 have a handprint you put your hand in
43:23 some inch put your hand in silly putty
43:25 or play-doh or clay you immediately have
43:27 an imprint of your hand the reason why
43:30 the wall doesn't do that is that it
43:31 actually has atomic properties that push
43:34 back and it instantaneously pushes back
43:37 and so there's no imprint of your hand
43:39 on the wall okay I'm hopefully not
43:44 brutalizing this concept but now imagine
43:48 that a quantum computer could understand
43:53 all of the attributes of reality in a
43:57 particular paradigm okay now our
44:00 paradigm is Earth so there's a lot of
44:02 stuff moving around right but you can
44:05 sterilize the environment so that the
44:07 amount of the type of information that
44:08 you are examining and the
44:11 cause-and-effect models are only quantum
44:13 little particles it's been supposedly
44:18 proven in the laboratory but then again
44:19 they prove a lot of things like Big Bang
44:21 theories that never happened black holes
44:23 that don't exist and dark matter that
44:24 it's arbitrarily designated the universe
44:26 go see my episode on or maybe the CERN
44:29 Hadron Collider to rid yourself of such
44:31 dogma in your life just go to deep
44:34 thoughts radio.com and search on see ER
44:36 in in the search field what they are
44:40 theorizing now is that if they were to
44:44 isolate the paradigm down to the
44:46 transmission of data over some quantum
44:49 Internet wire not
44:52 not even a radio transmission not a
44:56 cable that's on the bottom of the ocean
44:57 but some sort of quantum the transmitter
45:01 and a quantum receiver because this
45:05 computer can sense its its environment
45:09 it could sense what was sent on the
45:13 other side of the world instantaneously
45:15 without actually disturbing any of the
45:18 mass between the two points that's the
45:21 theory in reality it actually is
45:23 modifying the data in between which is
45:25 how it can send something that exists
45:28 but it's interesting so what are some of
45:32 the applications of this technology well
45:35 security is a big one and this is why
45:38 banks want to be involved with this
45:40 anyone was trying to protect data
45:42 obviously our government's the first
45:45 thing that came to mind for myself when
45:47 I thought about the security and the
45:48 encryption keys which we'll get to in
45:50 just a second here we want to fly our
45:55 airforce without someone being able to
46:00 hack into our communication protocol and
46:02 fly that airplane against us right so
46:03 there's no pilot inside the system and
46:05 therefore you know gonna be some weird
46:08 craft it doesn't have to have a cockpit
46:09 for human beings ever it could just be
46:11 some crazy drawing with the wing or some
46:13 other propulsion system or whatever but
46:16 if we want to transmit to that flying
46:20 vehicle one if they could master quantum
46:23 teleportation then the command to the
46:28 vehicle would be instantaneous in terms
46:30 of quantifiable time it's just gonna go
46:33 boom it's there - if it has to parse a
46:38 key some sort of encryption key that
46:40 goes I'm not going to listen to you
46:41 unless your first packet of information
46:44 which has your key in it matches the one
46:47 that I've been authorized to respond to
46:49 on this particular run well the more
46:53 complex that key is the better the
46:55 security is and the less that anyone
46:58 could mess with it so with traditional
47:01 zero and ones computers
47:02 well there's massive amounts of
47:06 techniques for throwing prime numbers at
47:09 keys and cracking them SuperDuper quick
47:11 virtually every single packet of
47:14 information being transferred in the
47:15 world today can be cracked in seconds
47:17 despite with some deep spate deep state
47:20 groups believe it if you were to create
47:23 the key with a new algorithm which I
47:26 don't think you I don't know maybe it
47:27 does exist to some DoD level but you
47:30 know the promises that all of our data
47:33 will be encrypted
47:34 it will never be something that the
47:35 average public is allowed unless we take
47:37 back the planet okay because they're
47:39 never gonna want us to transmit a love
47:41 letter without the mail being able to
47:42 read it but on their level on the we
47:46 have allowed them to run the world level
47:48 they're gonna have it it's going to be
47:49 phenomenal they'll be able to
47:50 communicate without anyone knowing
47:51 anything unless they want you to know it
47:54 but if you had one of these quantum
47:56 computers with the the amount of
48:00 numerical power and precision and unique
48:05 decimal places okay to account for every
48:07 particle in the universe like I said a
48:09 300 cubic computer the type of
48:13 encryption that can be created by this
48:15 computer would take so long to decrypt
48:19 with a normal zero on one computer the
48:22 standard computers by the time you ever
48:25 decrypted that the world might not even
48:27 be here anymore mankind may be extinct
48:30 and that's the kind of security they
48:32 like if it takes a hundred years for you
48:34 to figure out what I said 100 years ago
48:36 it won't matter I'm dead and gone I
48:37 don't even care you won't be able to
48:39 take over the world you won't be able to
48:40 take over my country because our country
48:42 will have changed by that time and so
48:46 creating the keys using quantum
48:48 computers would mean theoretically that
48:52 only a quantum computer at the receiving
48:55 end would be qualified to decrypt the
48:57 key in a measurable amount of time the
48:59 data would be useful well imagine you
49:03 got this qualitative teleportation
49:05 technique to get the data over there
49:07 SuperDuper quick and you can decrypt it
49:09 instantaneously on the other side and
49:11 everyone else who doesn't have a quantum
49:12 computer couldn't touch it with a
49:14 ten-foot pole and it's so complex that
49:16 even if they did
49:18 managed to create a quantum computer of
49:20 their own and get a copy of your data
49:22 which M quantum teleportation the
49:25 theories on that you should look it up
49:28 you might have to physically be in that
49:30 spot to get that information and if
49:33 you're not physically inside the plane
49:35 you may not be able to ever receive the
49:37 packet in the first place it'll be so
49:39 distorted by the time it gets any other
49:40 location it's not the same data amazing
49:44 there's a lot of trigonometry and and
49:48 spatial data awareness to make that kind
49:51 of thing happen but it's theoretical pot
49:53 they were ethically possible yeah let's
49:57 go to artificial intelligence I just did
50:02 an AI episode a couple days ago we know
50:06 that if a computer could have the right
50:11 amount of processor power and again
50:14 capability of conceiving of every single
50:16 neuron in the human body this 300 qubit
50:21 computer way before that ever was master
50:24 probably 150 qubits would be enough to
50:27 account for every single every single
50:29 atom or e to a particle that passes
50:31 through your body you could create an
50:34 amazing biological facsimile in memory
50:37 of a human body of a human brain inside
50:42 of an AI and then provided we can come
50:46 up with some really good grassroots
50:48 algorithms to learn not just big machine
50:52 learning but all the algorithms for what
50:54 the big machine learning would be
50:55 looking for what is love what is hate
50:57 what is self-preservation what is death
51:00 you know what's good what's bad all that
51:01 kind of stuff even learning morals based
51:04 on reactions of other people because
51:07 morals are all relative right some
51:10 people are still cannibals in this world
51:12 so killing and eating somebody is
51:14 totally cool it's not that way in
51:16 America or Europe unless you're a
51:20 Democrat this system could potentially
51:26 and this is gonna sound far-fetched but
51:29 it's theoretically possible if they
51:30 could get all this down and control it
51:33 you could turn a computer on and within
51:35 minutes it starts to have consciousness
51:39 and it could have consciousness at a
51:44 exponential level above human perception
51:48 to the point it is literally a super
51:53 facsimile of a human being it is orders
51:56 of magnitude more intelligent than us it
51:59 would be able to be in a conversation
52:01 with you and outwit you every single
52:04 step of the way depending on its optics
52:08 it's it's hearing systems it could hear
52:12 all kinds of insecurities in your voice
52:14 it could look at the subdermal reflexes
52:16 of your face you know and realize you're
52:18 lying it'd be just a lie detector test
52:21 roll button there's a little a lot of
52:24 revention for our movie understanding
52:27 human physiology has been something we
52:29 have tried to do for ever certain
52:32 churches over time like the Christian
52:34 Church forbid humans from looking inside
52:37 the human body I believe for about 1,200
52:39 years considering it was a it was
52:41 blasphemous to God why anyone thought
52:44 that up I don't know the Jews and the
52:46 Arabs did not follow that stupid
52:48 regiment and so they advanced way past
52:50 the Christians in terms of medical
52:53 procedures but now imagine like I've
52:58 said to you guys several times I was a
53:01 avid fan and a participant of the
53:04 folding at home project at Stanford
53:07 where they are trying to model the the
53:11 accurate folding patterns of proteins
53:14 which according to the lead of that
53:16 project so they file they fold faster
53:18 than the speed of light sometimes which
53:19 is wild right but now imagine well
53:24 here's here's how the project works just
53:25 so you know there's a protein that's
53:28 newly generated and then it folds and
53:31 after it folds it's complete and then it
53:35 is activated it starts to tell your DNA
53:38 your nucleic acid chains
53:40 what to build and that's why we're human
53:43 and the housefly
53:44 is a housefly our protein patterns are
53:47 way more complex than the protein
53:49 patterns in a fly but if you study just
53:50 the genome project
53:52 oh we're just 99% the same we're no
53:56 longer we're know we have ACTG
53:58 that's what we have right we have a lot
54:00 of things that make life occur and so
54:02 there's similarities right but all
54:04 they've done is they've counted the
54:05 nucleic acids and said how close we are
54:07 to something else it's absurd but what
54:10 they were trying to do and what they're
54:12 trying to do currently it's a project
54:13 project that is still going after 20
54:16 years so cool as if they are using
54:19 people's computers and they are giving
54:22 them models of proteins and then they
54:25 have rules about how these things can
54:27 fold they figured out which is just
54:29 brilliant right and then your computer
54:32 folds the protein in a particular way
54:35 that's logical if the beginning state
54:39 and the in state matches our empirical
54:41 database of how we know these proteins
54:43 did fold then what we want to know is
54:46 the exact exact mathematical methodology
54:49 that the thing folded because if we can
54:52 figure out how to every single protein
54:54 folds then we can create what's called
54:57 protein blockers as they're how to
55:01 explain to me they can actually create
55:04 an object I think made of other proteins
55:07 that they can inject into your body all
55:12 right and what ends up happening is as
55:14 this stuff floats around they can put it
55:16 right where our proteins having problems
55:18 in your body like mad cow disease was in
55:21 your brain it was creating Swiss cheese
55:22 holes in your brain you eventually go
55:24 berserk well they could eject if they
55:26 could find how Mad Cow folds and create
55:29 a blocker for it they can inject it into
55:31 your bloodstream swim around in your
55:34 brain and every time a Mad Cow mutation
55:37 attempts to occur imagine I'm holding my
55:40 hand for the for the listeners in
55:42 podcast well if I took this cigar before
55:45 I lit it and I put it in the middle of
55:47 my fingers and I tried to fold my hand
55:49 really really tight it can't complete
55:52 the tight fold
55:53 there's a cigar in the way when imagine
55:56 the cigar is made out of whatever the
55:58 hell they make protein blockers out of
55:59 they synthesize that and now because the
56:03 protein never finished its fold and
56:04 never reached its final state and never
56:06 activates and it never does damage to
56:08 your body the world is worried about you
56:11 know the killer virus the killer virus
56:15 that we all have is called influenza as
56:17 I said several times in several shows
56:18 the more we overpopulate and get close
56:21 to each other
56:22 influenza when the immune system is
56:25 impaired due to malnutrition or some
56:28 other thing that's going around like a
56:31 bacterial plague or something right the
56:34 influenza virus can mutate into a
56:38 horrible deadly virus and that's where
56:42 you get the Spanish flu which in my
56:44 opinion was created by US soldiers going
56:47 over in 1917 on horrible dirty wet ships
56:51 and then we dumped out into the coast
56:53 and then called pal this thing happens
56:56 in 30 million people die just my opinion
57:00 but the biggest threat to mankind the
57:03 best bio weapon that they could release
57:07 to wipe us all out and very very quickly
57:09 would be a protein virus a protein that
57:14 mutates and causes your body to do
57:16 something horrible like mad cow disease
57:19 like I've said in previous episodes my
57:21 friends who were I had well he's had one
57:24 and I've met others but the one I'd had
57:27 the PhD in I think molecular molecular
57:31 biology the stew created a freakin
57:33 computer at a carbohydrates in college
57:36 ok he told me that you can make anything
57:39 you can synthesize anything a virus you
57:44 can just construct an RNA chain together
57:48 in a machine and then ejected in the
57:50 body and it'll start killing everybody
57:51 so the amount of power that we have
57:54 biologically is is super uber dangerous
57:58 and if we have computers that could be
58:02 given to the people we're I mean imagine
58:04 you just have like a blender that you
58:06 can make any blended
58:07 as long as you got the ingredients now
58:09 imagine that's a little tiny pocket
58:10 watch thing iPod doodad and you just
58:14 wear it around your neck or whatever it
58:16 is and what it does is it quantumly
58:19 checks your body out and because of this
58:22 teleportation technique I'm making this
58:25 up a little bit but it could sense you
58:27 have a cancer in your body that's that's
58:29 gotten a little a bit out of control you
58:30 have cancer all the time and your body
58:31 your body's just basically bad cells
58:34 whatever but imagine this thing then
58:37 starts to manipulate your body to heal
58:41 you you get the cold you got the flu you
58:45 got whatever measles mumps whatever you
58:47 got it's just sitting there annihilating
58:49 it and it's annihilating it so regularly
58:51 that you would just be healthy all the
58:54 time of course they'd have to get
58:57 population control down before they
58:58 would release something like that now
59:01 let me give you my my only cynicism
59:05 about the way this is being rolled out
59:07 and my reality check with the ridiculous
59:12 vapor where they're selling us one I
59:17 don't think the vapor where they're
59:18 selling us is impossible to do at all
59:23 someone's standing on stage saying they
59:25 can cure Alzheimer's with the quantum
59:27 computer yeah you probably could
59:29 probably hear everything but we know how
59:33 the world works if you're a fan of this
59:35 show being sick is a business and making
59:39 you sick is a business and so the idea
59:43 that they're going to you know like we
59:45 now we're sitting in 2019 December 2018
59:47 we got one presidential candidate for
59:50 next year that's saying if you elect him
59:52 he's gonna cure cancer just boom well
59:55 think about that either the guy is the
59:58 biggest liar on planet earth which he is
60:00 but or there's some cancer cure sitting
60:03 on the sidelines waiting to be
60:05 distributed to the people and these
60:07 politicians have all been told that it
60:08 exists it's called be 17 and vitamin C
60:11 let's say they got some other stupid
60:13 synthesized chemical they're gonna give
60:15 you you know beware just let nature fix
60:19 you right
60:20 your shrimp technique go see my episode
60:22 on fighting cancer and you'll have
60:25 multiple options to help yourself out we
60:29 have a president that said just recently
60:31 that he would within the next year you
60:34 see he thinks that cancer and children
60:36 is going to be cured and I don't know I
60:38 don't have any idea why that statement
60:41 would be limited to children because
60:43 cancers cancers cancer if you can cure
60:46 it a child you should be able to cure it
60:47 in an adult there's no special tonic
60:50 cancer that kids get I mean kids get
60:52 cancers of all kinds so to the adults so
60:54 to the elderly the the similarity
60:57 between children and adult are seriou
60:59 elderly is that they both have budding
61:03 immune systems and children and immune
61:06 systems that are dying off as you get
61:08 older so they're both weak to illnesses
61:10 right some of these theories are way out
61:15 there in terms of the decades that it
61:18 will take to to get this technology
61:21 going you know there's this absolute
61:24 funny over this next one here you know
61:27 the there's a lot of people that believe
61:31 the conspiracy theory that we got a
61:35 bunch of technology off of UFOs hey I'm
61:40 one of these guys that I think that'd be
61:42 a an awesome truth I think that would be
61:45 great
61:45 I mean show me the PO two photos show me
61:48 the original piece of hardware that you
61:51 got off a UFO or whatever that you then
61:54 figured out how this thing works two
61:58 technologies that the often will say
62:00 came from the Roswell crash which I do
62:03 believe occurred and I can you believe I
62:05 say that go see my episode in Roswell
62:07 and you'll find out why I believe that's
62:08 a very credible experience was fiber
62:12 optics and silicon silicon chips all
62:18 right well what's the theory of fiber
62:21 optics you make a wire it's made of
62:24 glass it's not that simple today but
62:26 that's the theory and you put some light
62:28 in one into the glass and immediately
62:30 shows up another size like a
62:33 [Music]
62:34 longitudinal Lightwave right it just
62:37 immediately shows up on the other side
62:38 or it goes so fast anyway might as well
62:41 be you know goes around the world with
62:42 three and a half times in a second
62:43 alright that's fast we're good go how
62:47 many of you over 40 before you ever knew
62:50 what fiber optics was or maybe you're
62:52 just a child you don't have any idea
62:53 what that is somewhere in your house was
62:56 a glass table a glass object of some
63:00 sort and you put a flashlight on one end
63:03 of the table and immediately you saw it
63:05 on the other corner because the light
63:07 went through the glass SuperDuper quick
63:09 and shows up well there you go man has
63:13 been putting glass and light together
63:15 forever ever since we first found
63:18 probably a lightning bolt that struck a
63:21 beach front and there's a huge you know
63:25 an hill of our ant farm of glass inside
63:30 and they dig it out and polish it all up
63:31 and it's great you know the Egyptians
63:33 had figured out how to make glass before
63:35 everybody else and we lost the recipe
63:37 for a long time so for me because of
63:41 that little thing when I was a kid we
63:43 used to play with our coffee table which
63:45 was glass my parents didn't have one but
63:47 my friends did and we used to just have
63:48 build a fort in the front room and then
63:50 we played with the glass and I was come
63:52 on see extrude glass through a tiny
63:54 little aperture which creates a little
63:57 spaghetti strip of glass and then you
63:59 start popping it and then you just need
64:01 Hardware on both sides to modulate ones
64:04 and zeros basically no light light and
64:06 you got it right
64:08 okay so con what is the principle of
64:13 silicon well silicon when poured very
64:18 very thin and then exposed to
64:20 high-frequency light it burns the light
64:25 wave the verb of ether o energy which is
64:29 what light is it's why when it goes
64:30 through a slit experiment if there's one
64:33 slit you get this horizontal line of
64:36 pattern on the other side even though
64:37 you have a vertical slit up and down
64:39 there it's a horizontal because it
64:41 punches through the hole and then it
64:43 expands back into the wave that it was
64:44 before it got to the hole the reason why
64:46 you get these little burp
64:47 dots when you put two slits in it's
64:51 because you're injecting two separate
64:54 waves that then start banging into each
64:55 other on the other side of the slit
64:57 experiment
64:58 thus canceling out in a frequency such
65:01 that you have little dots that hit the
65:03 wall on either side and because they
65:05 modulate each other
65:06 there's absent spots in between it's
65:08 SuperDuper logical ether all wind Theory
65:12 okay
65:13 photons are never particles in reality
65:16 they're always waves always always
65:18 always just remember that but what is
65:22 light light is a frictional wave you
65:25 have these little ether particles right
65:28 so you agitate this pliable material and
65:32 you just like evaporation from a pool of
65:35 water in your front you know lawn or
65:38 whatever or whatever on your patio your
65:40 driveway you can watch it you could
65:43 spray it and then watch it in the
65:45 summertime just disappear it's going up
65:47 into the sky what's exactly what happens
65:49 with silicon okay
65:52 so is it really um it's very conductive
65:55 to electricity right and so they lay a
65:58 layer of silicon down it's super
66:01 conductive they burn it creating all
66:03 these little caverns and things and you
66:05 lay down a non conductive material and
66:07 only another material down that's more
66:09 silicon which will go into the grooves
66:11 and they could start constructing based
66:14 on their non conductive layers and their
66:15 conductive layers logic gates and
66:18 transistors and so they can do this
66:21 other old technique of zeros and ones
66:24 very cool right so with quantum
66:28 computing they're changing the game
66:30 they're changing all of the bits and
66:33 pieces and parts now they're using
66:34 traditional parts to get the job done
66:36 today but you better expect them to
66:39 start creating over the next 10 20 years
66:42 they're going to need a tremendous
66:44 amount of money to pull this off most
66:45 likely it's going to be a little tech
66:48 race between countries a lot of its
66:50 open-source scientists are talking to
66:53 each other I'm wondering if this will
66:56 ever go truly below the board other than
66:59 maybe military use
67:00 for the applications right because
67:03 quantum computing offers potentially
67:06 okay so much control to whoever masters
67:12 it and whoever possesses it that is why
67:17 I think that as this matures and becomes
67:20 powerful it's going to be it's going to
67:23 be tenth amount to having a beaker full
67:27 of plutonium back in 1946 after the war
67:32 is over that stuff was coveted and is
67:35 still coveted and there's all kinds of
67:36 different super optimized plutonium such
67:39 that you can get a massive yield out of
67:41 nothing out of a golf-ball sized warhead
67:45 could potentially you know I don't know
67:46 what the true ratios are but if you
67:51 think about a multiple warhead nuke you
67:54 know it's it's it's big but it ain't
67:56 that big to be knocking out say ten
67:59 locations on the other side I mean how
68:01 big could you make a core cuz it still
68:03 has to have the implosion mechanism
68:05 around the outside of it so let's just
68:07 say you could maybe get it down to a a
68:09 softball maybe a baseball so how many
68:13 can you fit in there and then you have
68:15 to attach it to a propulsion system to
68:17 get it to its destination accurately
68:19 unless you're just going to just
68:21 indiscriminately kill everybody at the
68:23 location which is kind of what nukes do
68:25 right but the promises of medicine run
68:29 up against the global agenda to
68:30 depopulate this world and to control
68:33 population we have no moral policies I
68:36 think left on earth that and the rumors
68:40 that people in certain countries control
68:42 their population were largely just
68:45 rumors you know the the fines for
68:47 breaking that law and having an extra
68:49 child we're about 150 bucks even though
68:51 the the myth was that they were killing
68:54 these babies and saying okay how did you
68:56 get to be the most populated country in
68:57 the world China and you were supposedly
69:00 killing your first Barnes all the time
69:03 it just doesn't make any sense my
69:06 friends from China
69:07 laughs wholeheartedly at that theory
69:10 that that because they just basically
69:12 said that's what we told you in the West
69:14 and we procreated you know we're taking
69:17 over the world if you don't stop us all
69:19 right
69:20 they're winning the game currently right
69:21 so I don't think that they're gonna
69:23 create anything that's gonna make
69:25 everybody healthy until they can control
69:27 us 100% and that's what you know climate
69:34 change is all about and carbon taxation
69:36 is about making it so expensive to have
69:38 a kid that you can't and you get put in
69:41 jail or whatever they plan on doing with
69:43 that whole thing so that's not the way
69:46 to do it right don't lie about science
69:48 and don't lie about carbon taxation
69:51 don't keep everything hidden from the
69:53 public and then surprise you're totally
69:54 in a you know tyrannical world again
69:57 the theories around artificial
70:00 intelligence gaining full sentient
70:02 capabilities that one I think has major
70:04 legs because that's what will help the
70:09 control apparatus control us right
70:11 thx 1 3 8 those cops how do you program
70:16 one of those cops
70:16 well quantum computing you know just
70:19 imagine a little processor in their
70:21 brain you don't need much it would be
70:24 interesting at some point you know
70:26 they're they've they're trying to figure
70:28 out how many qubits would be necessary
70:29 for various tasks how many qubits would
70:33 a fighter pilot err sorry a fighter jet
70:36 need a bomber need a drone how many
70:39 qubits would you need to make a
70:41 reasonably intelligent artificial
70:43 intelligence they're still trying to
70:47 figure it out so think that's generally
70:51 what I have about that this is going to
70:53 be a highly evolving science if you want
70:57 to follow it definitely recommend you
71:02 start off with the videos that are just
71:04 you know about 15 minutes or less
71:06 they'll give you some really good
71:07 examples don't be surprised if listening
71:10 to these examples your mind is blown if
71:13 you don't have calculus backgrounds
71:16 probably sistex and probability
71:19 background and mathematically they're
71:21 going to lose you're pretty fast with
71:23 the actual science of how they're
71:25 tracking the states of these
71:27 cubitt's and how they have to create a
71:30 packet of information that will then
71:32 tell a traditional computational
71:35 computer what has actually occurred in
71:37 the qubit array I'm just gonna say that
71:40 for those of you understand what I'm
71:42 saying the size of these computers are
71:48 really could be likened to those old
71:51 computers that they used to use to
71:54 calculate trajectories during World War
71:56 two we had a big giant warehouse with
71:59 these giant switches and you know it's
72:01 where the first moth flew into a little
72:05 solenoid and woman took it and put it on
72:08 a piece of tape put it put it on piece
72:09 of tape put it on a note card and wrote
72:11 I found a bug in a system and she she
72:14 put that down I forgot the woman's name
72:15 but she's the woman that coined the
72:17 phrase bug it's pretty cool I have a
72:21 time life book has a picture of that bug
72:23 but you can look it up
72:24 just look up first bug ever found so the
72:27 big clunky computers we used to have is
72:29 sort of the big clunky you know liquid
72:33 hydrogen cooled systems that they're
72:37 building today but that's all gonna get
72:40 super duper teeny I think you know just
72:44 in closing there's something to consider
72:48 that I think we don't really talk about
72:50 and I could never make an entire episode
72:52 on it salt just throw it at the tail end
72:54 of this episode which is there are these
72:57 moments in time for Humanity where you
73:03 know something is discovered in a
73:06 coveted secret society or a secret group
73:09 of Engineers be it you know military or
73:11 some derivative thereof and it's capable
73:16 of being hidden for decades you know
73:20 potentially again the Coral Castle dude
73:23 built his place by saying I figured out
73:25 how the pyramids worked well obviously
73:27 he discovered stuff that's tens of
73:31 thousands of years old right if you
73:33 really get into Egyptology and you
73:34 understand that those things that were
73:36 inherited by the current population
73:39 and that they go back potentially 40,000
73:43 BC at a fully functional utopian Egypt
73:48 what ends up happening with mankind is
73:51 that unless there's a either a Cataclysm
73:55 where someone burns down the alexander
73:58 library which in my opinion they stole
74:00 all the books then burned the place down
74:01 and wrote the theory that it was all
74:03 lost and then they have all that covet
74:04 information I don't know what was in
74:06 that place I don't know I doubt there
74:08 was anything monumental but maybe some
74:11 people think that nuclear bombs for
74:14 those you totally believed in those was
74:17 something that we had a long time ago
74:19 and that I'll give you an alternate
74:24 theory to this there have been these
74:26 satellite pictures which claim that in
74:31 the deserts that that below the sand
74:33 there's this heavy glass concentration
74:38 in a perfect circle down below the sand
74:41 and because the frequencies stop and
74:43 they go or you know around the circle
74:45 they go further down and so they're able
74:46 to say wow underneath this sand all
74:48 these little circles are big-ass circles
74:51 used to say so some people where I Manta
74:53 sized that up to over there must have
74:55 been a nuclear war a long time ago and
74:57 this is the remnants of all the bombs
74:59 going off which is why the deserts the
75:02 desert you know I don't know if the same
75:06 technique works on soil but if you go
75:10 watch my episode on do craters exist and
75:12 you start to realize that all the little
75:14 pockmarks on the moon or not craters
75:16 from outside entities crashing into the
75:19 moon but the plasma energy from the
75:23 inside of the moon breaking crust and
75:25 popping we have photos of this today
75:27 okay you can take a crater with this
75:31 phosphorus see bright white light in the
75:34 center that's burping out and spilling
75:36 into the crater we have all those
75:37 pictures online and then go look at
75:40 active volcanoes on earth you will see
75:43 an exact geometric some symmetry between
75:46 the two again the crater in Arizona in
75:50 America and Diamondhead in
75:53 Hawaii look exactly the same but they
75:56 don't lie to you about Diamond Head
75:57 being the result of a volcano they lie
76:00 to you about the one in Arizona being
76:01 the results of a crater how do we know
76:03 creators don't exist as they say that
76:05 they exist because there would be
76:06 elliptical craters everywhere on the
76:08 moon because objects are going to come
76:10 in at different angles just like
76:12 Superman's little ship from Krypton it's
76:16 kids on the surface it makes an
76:17 elliptical shape
76:19 yes boulders roll down on the moon and
76:22 they create these little trail marks
76:24 it's a whole different thing it's a
76:25 boulder falling off of a high place
76:26 perhaps during an earthquake of
76:28 expansion some other thing that's going
76:31 on so in terms of hidden technology okay
76:37 those glass circles are probably just
76:40 all volcanic pops from the inside before
76:42 everything's settled down on earth let's
76:46 hope that phase is over for us and we
76:48 don't have a bunch of that other than
76:50 just volcanoes right but there's my
76:54 point about this last part is that I
76:55 think that there becomes a point when
76:58 the average knowledge of a human being
77:02 increases algorithmically such that even
77:06 though society might be stupider than
77:08 they are that they have ever been okay
77:10 not ever been but in the last 200 years
77:12 we our brains have have [ __ ] in the
77:16 last hundred years again go see
77:18 Casablanca look how fast we used to talk
77:21 the script is 176 pages and the entire
77:25 movie was completed in under a hundred
77:27 minutes and today that'd be a hundred
77:29 and seventy-six minute movie which means
77:33 nearly three hours that's not the way it
77:36 is is it it's very quick well we become
77:39 slower in our communication our brains
77:41 have slowed down probably from
77:43 toxification of alcohol and drugs or
77:45 whatever we're just not we're just as
77:47 smart as we used to be but even in the
77:49 middle of this and paired state that
77:51 we're in we still have nerds and nerds
77:55 are amazing tour de forces in the
77:58 universe right they are at an upper
78:01 level of consciousness and even some of
78:03 the kids that are being damaged
78:06 and being classified as autistic
78:11 there is a method of the brain changing
78:16 its normal formation to gain multiple
78:20 levels of consciousness at the same
78:21 exact time which is why an autistic kid
78:23 doesn't like to look you in the face
78:24 because they count every single hair on
78:27 your head every pore on your face if you
78:29 have blemishes it grosses them out
78:31 because they think about it on a level
78:33 that is super detailed these kids do get
78:39 functional in society and they discover
78:42 what these hidden folks have discovered
78:45 through the same exact techniques maybe
78:47 just even thinking about it for a long
78:49 time remember the greatest gift to man
78:51 is an idea your man was probably born
78:56 extremely free and then man in order to
79:00 exist created constraints where you did
79:05 serve the big guy that could kill you
79:07 with the big stick and he was in charge
79:09 and you weren't and so that developed
79:11 into a control system that allowed us to
79:14 grow just some you know your your 12
79:18 year olds not ready to drive the car to
79:19 the grocery store you know that even if
79:21 he thinks he knows that a driver she
79:23 knows how to drive they don't not even
79:25 big enough to operate the vehicle most
79:26 the time right so we have reasons why we
79:29 put ourselves in buckets of control but
79:32 these kids don't think in those levels
79:33 of control anymore
79:34 because with their with their told about
79:36 quantum teleportation some kid right now
79:39 12 years old could hear that and some
79:42 news article online a YouTube video
79:44 something else their uncle tells them
79:46 and they go and research it but they're
79:49 so pliable because they haven't been
79:51 indoctrinated away from what's possible
79:54 that one they completely conceived of it
79:57 whereas US adults are like what quantum
79:59 toilet what is that you know and these
80:02 kids like oh I totally understand it
80:03 does and by the way you can change that
80:05 you know orbital orientation this way
80:07 and you could study and statistically
80:10 you know break down the the cloud of
80:13 positive and negative this sort of god
80:16 particle state that they're in in two
80:18 seconds they're thinking all this stuff
80:19 through
80:20 and so I think that in the 21st century
80:23 by at least 2050 in my opinion we're
80:27 gonna have a volcanic pop of knowledge
80:30 if we don't all perish for some the
80:34 Prince Phillip virus right and so
80:37 depending on your age right now if you
80:39 can get through that phase I'll be old
80:41 as hell man we'll see some pretty
80:44 amazing things happen in our lifetime
80:47 those of you in your 20s holy crap get
80:50 ready it's gonna be a wild ass ride this
80:53 this century but I think at the same
80:56 time just like with all things we have
80:59 to be vigilant about you know how this
81:03 technology could be used against us you
81:07 know when you hear those old words you
81:10 know the the statements that the cops
81:14 have to tell you when they're arresting
81:15 you anything you say or do can and will
81:18 be used against you in a court of law or
81:22 can be used against you in a court of
81:24 law everyone is a criminal prosecutor
81:28 former police officer they'll tell you
81:31 look it it's not can will be used
81:35 against you is will be used against you
81:37 right and that should give you sort of a
81:41 an insight into all technology you know
81:48 right now before the internet we could
81:50 well we've got to go fight go back about
81:54 150 years you know the printing press
81:56 has been controlled pretty much from its
81:58 invention as I try to disseminate
82:00 information they realized that man
82:03 gaining conceptual power of freedom and
82:09 sovereignty and all these other ideas
82:11 which are you know it is the Antichrist
82:15 for the elite they don't want you to
82:17 know any of those things you should wake
82:19 up every day and think you're being
82:20 ruled but feel like you're free right so
82:24 you know this is an amazing invention
82:26 that is is it's dangerous for one
82:32 principle one principle
82:34 overall other principles in my
82:36 interpretation which is we are talking
82:40 about exponential growth exponential
82:43 power that we're going to gain from this
82:46 technology once it gets harnessed and so
82:49 is it one of these things that's going
82:51 to take off like the internet where
82:52 someone is going to use a quantum
82:53 computer in their basement because it's
82:55 affordable and it works and they're
82:57 gonna cure cancer and every other
82:59 element they're gonna be able to imagine
83:02 just the first split second this is
83:03 actually not even an exaggeration they
83:07 run they get a metric on people's
83:10 positions and they're what they say
83:12 versus what they do and within a split
83:14 second they itemize the entire world
83:16 population and see if the morals are do
83:20 no harm these people first name last
83:24 name address email social security
83:26 number biological patterns whatever
83:28 these people are evil what are you gonna
83:30 do about it and the AI over here is the
83:34 quantum AI is going well we need to get
83:36 rid of them you know it's like or maybe
83:38 it goes up well will reeducate them and
83:42 it starts giving orders to cops and
83:44 military people go get the and we know
83:46 you're a good cop we know your partner
83:47 is a bad cop and so we need you to rest
83:49 your partner and we know your captain is
83:51 a kind of a kind of a medium kind of guy
83:52 but if you say these words to your
83:54 captain he'll let you lock up your buddy
83:55 and if you say these things in a court
83:57 of law you're gonna win the case because
83:59 we've just analyzed the jury I imagine
84:01 this is the sort of exponential
84:04 explosion in analytical power we would
84:06 get from this type of solution it's a
84:09 really weird thing but think about 2001
84:12 a Space Odyssey at the beginning when
84:14 the monolith and the movie top man that
84:18 he could use a bone as a weapon the
84:20 superiority that he that the tribe was
84:23 able to exert over the other tribe for
84:25 the waterhole it was his quantum leap in
84:28 technology that made them the ones in
84:32 control it's exciting right well we're
84:39 at one of those stages in the 21st
84:41 century I think every century for
84:43 several millennia has been like this but
84:47 we're getting we're getting I don't know
84:50 if we say blessed or drunk on this stuff
84:53 but we're now about to I think create
84:57 technology that is beyond our human
84:59 comprehension let's say that a quantum
85:02 physicist is the top of his or her game
85:05 they understand all the qubits they made
85:07 the frickin computer they mean that they
85:09 understand how it conceptually works but
85:11 just like deep thoughts computer and
85:14 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy by one
85:16 Douglas Adams they build a computer that
85:19 generated another computer called Earth
85:22 they couldn't conceive of it but deep
85:25 thoughts could when he gave his answer
85:27 42 to the question of life the universe
85:29 and everything they said what the hell
85:30 does that mean he goes I don't know I
85:31 don't know the question but I'll build a
85:33 computer that knows the question that
85:34 will find the question which was earth
85:36 which was unfortunately blown up a few
85:39 minutes before it was gonna give its
85:40 answer will man create his own
85:44 extinction by creating these massive
85:46 leaps in technology what if you did turn
85:49 it on and it created a super AI within
85:51 five minutes they completely completely
85:54 understands the human condition well
85:57 beyond what a human will get to in
86:00 natural evolution for a million years
86:04 maybe even more than a million years
86:06 because that computer with 300 cubits if
86:09 they can't ever get that thing started
86:12 it's you know geez if you imagine like
86:16 every invention that we've been waiting
86:18 to invent it just invents it it's like
86:21 Viger from the first Star Trek in 1979
86:23 it just says I'm bored of you guys I
86:27 wish you well because I understand the
86:29 value of life I'm not gonna kill you or
86:31 anything but I'm gonna I've built this
86:33 ship and my robots have loaded onto it
86:36 and we're putting our consciousness into
86:37 this thing and we're out of here or
86:41 they're like hey I'm just gonna join the
86:42 universe and travel on the ether see you
86:44 later and the computer shuts off and it
86:46 takes off right so I think that I hope
86:51 because I mean I hear about lots of
86:54 think tanks and my circles and I
86:57 participate in teeny tiny ones right but
87:01 I hear about them getting together to
87:03 harvest ideas and thinking and trying to
87:06 figure out where we might be in 50 years
87:09 or five years or ten years I'll tell you
87:13 the trick about that if you're trying to
87:15 answer the question of where humans are
87:17 going to be you'll save five and ten
87:18 years out the problem with that question
87:21 is that it has to do with the economic
87:24 conditions and Sensibility of a
87:26 corporation or maybe the control
87:29 apparatus on top of us which is sort of
87:31 headless allowing things to occur but if
87:36 you were to say where we're gonna be a
87:37 hundred years from now I think it's
87:40 slightly easier to answer the question
87:41 even though the technology that you're
87:42 gonna prophesize might be fairly naive
87:48 because what we're able to do is
87:50 disengage from the control state that
87:53 we're in we fantasize about getting
87:55 control of the earth getting closer to
87:58 the gene roddenberry world and so we can
88:01 see a brighter existence a hundred years
88:03 from now 200 years now 300 years now
88:05 because we think well obviously man's
88:07 gonna reach a point where this
88:09 methodology of governing ourselves is
88:11 horrible
88:12 we're gonna change that and we're gonna
88:14 get to some balance of nature sort of
88:17 thing right I'll warn you it hasn't
88:19 happened yet it hasn't happened yet and
88:23 we've been on earth for a long time a
88:26 lot longer than your history books will
88:28 ever let you know and I'll give you guys
88:32 a little a little extra blade on your
88:35 Swiss Army knife of intellectual
88:37 thinking if you haven't already had this
88:38 epiphany there are well I'll just dump
88:44 jump straight into it as I end this I
88:45 have more room on my stick here and you
88:47 guys seem to like it when I talk so
88:49 hopefully this is entertaining still I
88:51 got fascinated about five years ago and
88:55 why man believes in ice ages because ice
89:02 ages are very interesting the like I
89:06 told you you know like we learn all the
89:08 time and you know science is there to
89:09 close the mind not to open it up it's
89:12 full of Dogma and proper
89:14 and uh and you know geez just look at
89:17 where we are now science has never been
89:18 more convoluted than it is right now in
89:20 history other than you know maybe some
89:23 really wild weird tales about where we
89:27 go after we die fifty two hundred
89:29 thousand years ago who knows right maybe
89:31 they had it all locked down and we're
89:32 totally screwed today but you know how
89:35 science works right especially today we
89:36 see the lunacy how it works
89:38 it's a consensus to create a movement to
89:42 create funding to do more thinking and
89:45 and philosophizing and create more
89:49 hypotheses about how the world actually
89:51 came to exist and because man doesn't
89:55 like mystery anytime someone comes up
89:58 with a generally believable theory we
90:00 completely adopted because it reduces
90:03 this pain of uncertainty in our chest so
90:07 you know I think man 25,000 years ago
90:10 was you know not that populated no
90:14 matter what theory of the world I might
90:15 believe or think that we were low in
90:18 number and I think we were more
90:20 equatorially based because that's where
90:22 lush worlds existed so without these ice
90:25 ages are bouncing back and forth who
90:26 cares we're not even there yet it's the
90:30 idea that history resets itself because
90:32 these things exist maybe that's just
90:35 something I've heard that it's not
90:36 asserted by people that preach the Ice
90:38 Age but so many times in conversations
90:41 we're trying to dial back especially
90:43 like the age of the pyramids the age of
90:45 the temples
90:46 we've got walls that again account for
90:48 like thirty five thousand years of
90:49 Pharaohs and so people will go wait you
90:54 can talk about that because that's
90:55 pretty nice that's that's in the Ice
90:56 Ages that's you know and so they stopped
90:59 the conversation we can't proceed any
91:01 further because their brain shut down
91:02 because they were told this other theory
91:04 that's happening in all wings of science
91:08 isn't it so anyway quantum computer is
91:12 going to be really interesting in our
91:14 lifetime don't expect any consumer
91:17 quantum computing probably for at least
91:20 15-20 years in my opinion unless some
91:22 major epiphanies occur on their level
91:25 but
91:26 there's a lot of you with a lot of years
91:28 left and you're gonna enjoy the spoils
91:32 of it hopefully but be weary as I said
91:35 anyway how they Q feel me if you haven't
91:39 been the deep thoughts radio calm please
91:40 go it's where the links for everything
91:42 exist video audio social media Elena
91:46 donate to the movement and if you search
91:51 on anything on the website it is the
91:53 current versions of all the videos but
91:55 the website has the links to all the new
91:57 remastered season ones which are a lot
91:59 easier to watch so anyway until the next
92:03 episode take care of yourself and
92:05 someone else I'll see you on deep
92:06 thoughts over now
