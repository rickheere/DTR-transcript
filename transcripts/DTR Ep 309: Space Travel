00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen so today we're going to talk
00:42 about sort of the flip side of all this
00:47 anti NASA thinking that we do on a
00:50 routine basis right we don't believe
00:54 that our space agencies are telling the
00:55 truth about their accomplishments
00:57 it was started for political reasons one
01:02 to conceal the development of weapons
01:04 but the other one to defeat financially
01:08 supposedly Russia 60s and 70s
01:11 it would seem there's a lot of truth to
01:13 that one but today we're gonna talk
01:16 about with all of the epiphanies that
01:20 have occurred both in the past and that
01:23 have been resurrected because of the
01:24 internet and people that remember the
01:27 past and saying look well you know in
01:28 the 60s we had it here but then that got
01:30 erased and then the 70s we had it here
01:32 and got it reached but in the 1800s we
01:34 had it here and it got erased I want to
01:38 look at an exercise in thinking behind
01:42 the notion of actually traveling in
01:43 space what if the world reset and all of
01:48 these you know faked space programs are
01:52 completely exposed and potentially we
01:54 would find ones that are actually
01:55 occurring that actually have a bunch of
01:57 advanced technology now we can't rely on
01:59 that right I can't speak from that
02:01 because I don't know of any any secret
02:05 space programs we know that the weapons
02:07 are developed we know the propulsion
02:08 systems are developed and we have no
02:10 idea how they run oh I've heard UNH's of
02:13 rumors and there's all kinds of YouTube
02:15 videos about all kinds of stuff but
02:17 let's just take I think what we now know
02:21 from rediscovered science and let's
02:24 parse getting off this planet and then
02:30 how we would propel ourselves through
02:32 space and how would we deal with what we
02:36 would find in space both from a fabric
02:39 of the universe sort of void that we
02:43 have right we really don't know how the
02:45 universe is put together we have great
02:47 theories
02:48 as we can see what happens in our world
02:50 but again we have to build propulsion
02:52 systems that can deal with anything and
02:55 I mean anything we have traditional
02:59 rocketry that we understand which
03:01 definitely makes missiles fly but when
03:03 you try to escape Earth's gravitational
03:06 force you have another problem when you
03:09 try to deal with radiation belts you've
03:11 got another problem and then when you
03:14 get outside the radiation belt I don't
03:16 think man knows anything about that area
03:17 I mean hurling a satellite into space
03:21 is obviously a noble first step I'm not
03:25 sure that's occurred I'm not I think a
03:28 lot of the Voyager footage was either
03:30 artwork created by hand or it was
03:33 created in a computer because right
03:36 around the same time Voyager launches
03:38 and starts sending us back pictures of
03:40 things we started developing
03:42 computer-generated art fascinating right
03:46 but I'm going to try to absolutely make
03:49 this episode devoid of more accusations
03:51 towards the space program being faked
03:53 we've already done that recently we've
03:55 done it a lot so this is gonna be
03:57 hopefully a hundred percent constructive
03:59 conversation about what if and hopefully
04:04 I'll piece it together in a way it's a
04:05 neat adventure for your mind some of you
04:08 have a lot of knowledge in and around
04:10 the subjects you've done deep dives into
04:13 the rediscovered sciences and you're
04:15 gonna have epiphanies flying off this
04:17 episode like electrons off a bar uranium
04:20 so get ready traveling in space there's
04:25 two sides of it right there's the
04:27 technical side to achieve it and then
04:29 there's the sort of sociological side of
04:32 why do it typically man says we need to
04:36 find an alternative to being on this
04:37 planet in case we mess up the planet the
04:40 planet goes through some cycle that is
04:41 going to destroy mankind that were
04:43 unaware of or if there's some sort of
04:46 earth threat from space a meteorite some
04:50 other object that comes right at Earth
04:51 and we have very little notice
04:53 whatsoever for those of you who think I
04:58 might be fear-mongering a little bit of
04:59 that I want you to know that
05:02 I have I take a stance position against
05:05 fear-mongering things from space that
05:08 hurt her or could hurt earth which funds
05:11 these organizations you know there's all
05:14 kinds of tactics that people scare you
05:16 into giving the money and so that's not
05:20 where I'm coming from but I will remind
05:22 you that if we were not lied to okay
05:25 and I believe independent astronomers
05:27 have confirmed this I think within the
05:29 last 20 years right Jupiter took a hit
05:32 that was phenomenal was three giant
05:34 bodies I believe it was three one
05:36 theorized to be the size of Earth slams
05:39 into what we perceive as in the northern
05:42 hemisphere of the earth the southern
05:44 region of Jupiter and it's supposedly
05:47 left spots in the atmosphere and what
05:51 was interesting is these things ran into
05:53 the the bowels of Jupiter which is
05:56 called our vacuum right it's called the
05:58 big vacuum king of the solar system
06:00 vacuum cleaner because it has so much
06:01 gravity it's grabbing most of the big
06:03 stuff but could you imagine one slipping
06:06 by we're on the opposite side of Jupiter
06:09 here it comes
06:10 or it's all timed out properly since the
06:12 Jupiter never has any gravity pole on it
06:15 and even though we are a tiny tiny speck
06:18 in relative terms to everything else in
06:22 our solar system it was is by eclipses
06:24 maybe just clips the moon throwing 1/3
06:28 of the moon at the earth maybe it
06:31 impacts earth maybe totally destroys
06:33 earth maybe it hurts earth so these are
06:35 some of the reasons why we want the
06:37 control of our own destiny as a species
06:40 to be able to take ourselves from planet
06:43 Earth to another planet perhaps even a
06:46 moon if it could if it could host us
06:47 properly right now right off the bat
06:51 most junior scientists and sci-fi buffs
06:53 know that trying to find a earth-like
06:57 planet a guy a class planet right one
07:01 that has generally the same diameter as
07:03 the earth therefore the gravity is
07:05 remotely like the gravity we have here
07:07 you realize if it's off a little bit our
07:10 current species would suffer if it's a
07:13 little smaller we might do a little bit
07:14 better
07:15 it has to have the perfect atmosphere it
07:19 has to generate food that we can eat
07:21 even if we bring our own seeds it has to
07:23 have the right nitrate soil and acidity
07:27 in the soil to grow our seeds it has to
07:29 have water it just does as that fresh
07:32 water because we're probably not gonna
07:35 be able to bring a desalination plant
07:36 with us I mean who knows maybe we will
07:37 have some crazy you know fusion device
07:40 that can make anything into water and so
07:42 we could generally technically be
07:44 anywhere in the universe but we won't be
07:45 happy if we don't have lush you know
07:48 fields full of green grass to generate
07:51 metabolize the atmosphere that we need
07:54 for those of you who are Star Trek buffs
07:57 we know we're up against the prime
07:59 directive not to hurt anything that
08:00 exists on the planet do we want to find
08:02 a planet with only plant life most plant
08:05 life planets will theoretically have
08:09 insects and a bunch of other things that
08:11 could kill us there's all kinds of
08:13 issues before we even get to the planet
08:15 that we have to factor into is it worth
08:18 the effort for us to get into this
08:20 program I think it's just a tiny bit of
08:24 exploration angle researching our own
08:29 solar system is pretty much the first
08:32 step that we want to do where the hell
08:34 are we are we gonna round ball are we on
08:36 something else
08:37 is it a Parrish shape like Neil deGrasse
08:41 Tyson said give me a [ __ ] break
08:43 there's been a question that's been
08:45 posed quite a bit recently which is does
08:48 a rocket engine work in space you know
08:51 once you leave the atmosphere of which
08:52 you would a rocket engine would use to
08:54 push off yet pushes off the ground then
08:56 it pushes off the atmosphere pushes
08:58 against the atmosphere does it work once
09:01 it's in the vacuum of space most
09:05 physicists will sit there and say well
09:06 of course you're putting a propellant
09:08 inside of a cone and the propellant is
09:10 pushing off the cones you're creating
09:12 your relative your own relative force in
09:14 space some people wonder if that
09:18 actually works but let's start at the
09:21 propulsion systems the ones that we have
09:23 today now we have all kinds of different
09:26 rockets but they are pretty much the
09:28 same
09:28 mechanical mechanism the fuel
09:30 combinations changed and they refine
09:32 over the years right
09:33 but essentially goes through an engine
09:35 that combusts it falls out of a cone
09:38 it's pushing against the cone it's
09:40 pushing off earth and boom we get a
09:42 rocket
09:43 now again today everything seems to lose
09:46 its you know vertical ascent very very
09:49 quickly and then it's going on this idea
09:52 that it if it can just outpace the the
09:57 normal orbit of Earth and create an
09:59 elliptical orbit then the then the force
10:03 of the earth pulling on it which is
10:05 really the ether pushing on it is going
10:07 to create this crazy slingshot technique
10:10 with a little bit more fuel in a little
10:12 bit more fuel it's going to slingshot
10:14 itself away from Earth at least that's
10:17 the theory that supports every claim
10:19 that we've actually pulled it off right
10:21 but there's a problem with propulsion
10:23 system rockets and the whole theory of
10:26 them and what is that well you got to
10:29 bring your own fuel with you feels heavy
10:31 if you have a leak or you burn it in the
10:34 wrong way because you misinterpret
10:36 something that needs to occur the
10:37 computers have an error then you lose
10:40 all your fuel and you are stuck in space
10:41 going in the direction of which your
10:43 vehicle last was propelled god forbid
10:47 you're doing a horrible spin you know so
10:51 I think that the very first thing that
10:53 man has to do to even contemplate true
10:57 interplanetary travel before we get to
11:00 inter stellar travel right between stars
11:03 but just to get within our own solar
11:05 system if we can solve for that then we
11:07 can go visit Pluto the planet Pluto
11:12 we're going to need a whole different
11:14 methodology of traveling and I think
11:18 that the biggest problem that we have
11:19 and I created an episode way back in
11:21 season 1 which was sort of a fun
11:23 exploration of similar thinking which is
11:25 creating a UFO would be a tiny bit of
11:29 overlap with that but I've had you know
11:32 three more years to research new
11:34 technology to metabolize my thinking so
11:36 we're gonna go from a slightly more
11:38 clinical and fresh and clean perspective
11:42 this conversation yeah for those of you
11:44 who haven't seen my gravity episode it's
11:47 probably a really great precursor to
11:48 this which if you're like me you won't
11:51 go back and watch it right now you watch
11:52 it after this episode you're gonna get
11:54 the gist of what I'm talking about here
11:55 and have an ether episode as well I am
12:01 100,000 percent convinced that the
12:04 researchers such as Faraday and Tesla
12:06 were a hundred percent correct and their
12:09 discover discovery of ether the benign
12:15 particle in the universe that
12:16 constitutes all mass and energy that we
12:19 perceive in the universe everything is
12:22 made of ether everything in fact
12:24 everything is made of little elliptical
12:26 orbits and the funny thing is all we're
12:29 doing here is we're we're communicating
12:31 within this elliptical orbits
12:33 conglomerate which is my body your body
12:35 the camera the mic and everything when
12:38 you want to grow a flower in your
12:39 backyard what you're doing is you're
12:41 simply growing an e Thurl orbiting
12:44 object that pleases you you're growing
12:48 the scent frequencies for your nose so
12:50 you love a rose right but there was a
12:53 little shift in the thinking of mankind
12:55 around the time of Einstein who couldn't
12:59 figure out what it was and so he threw
13:00 it out and they created some bogus
13:03 experiments to try and kill it which are
13:05 all ridiculous
13:06 the ridiculous on levels that are crazy
13:09 but please watch those two episodes
13:11 again I'll forget to put it in the
13:13 description just like I forgot to put
13:15 the moon episodes in the moon moon part
13:17 3 which I call part 2 in the episode
13:19 really strange me I believe that if we
13:22 really want to travel throughout the
13:24 stars throughout our planets we're going
13:25 to have to rediscover it Rhian Dorse
13:28 and recertify the behavior of ether in
13:31 this universe because it is my belief
13:35 that we will if we can find the energy
13:39 systems which I believe we probably have
13:41 hidden away somewhere but even if we
13:43 have to create it from scratch that's
13:44 what we have to do we need zero-point
13:47 energy systems that can create massive
13:48 amounts of energy by themselves
13:51 completely without any stimulation from
13:53 outside
13:55 Van Allen belts or anything which we
13:57 could cannibalize some of the power
13:58 that's out there it's got almost going
14:01 to probably be a hybrid spaceship that
14:02 says look if we have some energy flowing
14:05 around the ship that will use that
14:07 energy but if we're in the vacuum of
14:09 space which really is in a vacuum but if
14:11 we're in the ether all winds of space we
14:13 will be able to metabolize that ether
14:15 through the ship or we'll have a device
14:18 inside of our ship that by stimulating
14:21 it will tell ether what to do around our
14:23 ship in a way that we can travel through
14:25 the Stars now for those of you who are
14:28 bob lazar fans who I mentioned all the
14:30 time on the show he has essentially
14:34 discovered the theory whether or not he
14:37 is working on a UFO I have no idea okay
14:40 but he is genius enough to talk about an
14:44 ether abased engine system whether or
14:46 not he yeah I don't think he ever says
14:47 ether I think it's funny he talks about
14:50 creating gravity voids which then the
14:53 ship flows into well all he's talking
14:57 about doing is pushing ether winds out
14:59 of the way in the SH in the direction
15:01 and the side of the ship that he wants
15:03 to go in the direction of right why does
15:07 a plane fly by his a bird's wings work
15:10 because the shape of the wing displaces
15:13 air pressure above the plane and creates
15:15 lift well that's sort of a really fluid
15:19 dynamic method of explaining ether bob
15:25 lazar to did H 45-minute interview in
15:29 front of a bunch of people or he took a
15:30 bunch of questions and it was pretty
15:32 much stuff you could have made up before
15:34 you ever saw him do the interview and
15:36 you would have been lucky you would have
15:37 been 95% correct but the one thing he
15:39 talked about was very fascinating and it
15:42 sort of gets into Star Trek II dilithium
15:44 crystal thinking which is also
15:46 interesting now I'm gonna give you this
15:48 what I believe to be probably a
15:49 fictional account hey if he's telling
15:52 the truth
15:52 awesome I mean awesome but it's a way to
15:56 think about the problem
15:57 okay puts it in context for your brain I
16:00 believe he claimed that there was a new
16:04 element that they had discovered a
16:06 crystal element that was inside one of
16:08 these spaceship
16:08 at the heart of the ship and that when
16:11 stimulated with a tiny bit of energy it
16:14 was like a piezo effect of a crystal but
16:17 a little bit of energy in and it creates
16:18 a big energy out and it always creates
16:20 the same effect right you can in a
16:22 crystal a piezo effect as I understand
16:25 it you can put variable stimulation into
16:27 a crystal but because of its structure
16:29 internally it always metabolizes it out
16:31 at a constant wave you can amplify it
16:35 right you can put more in and then the
16:37 wave around the crystal gets bigger but
16:39 the crystal is gonna give off one effect
16:41 which is why people put crystals in
16:43 their homes to calm themselves down to
16:45 get rid of radio frequencies there is a
16:48 bit of truth to that theory if not 100
16:51 percent of that theory but his theory
16:53 well what he claimed to be true was that
16:56 these the craft he worked on had this
16:58 element I don't know what the physical
17:00 volume size of it would be but through
17:03 stimulating it in a certain way it was
17:07 able to effect a gravitational field
17:09 around the ship creating pockets of
17:12 negativity which allows the ship to go
17:14 in that direction because essentially it
17:16 has nothing resisting it now to loop
17:20 back on gravity for one second in this
17:22 show in this deep thought show I believe
17:25 that gravity is the traditional Faraday
17:27 tesla theory which is it's a push not a
17:30 pull okay we're all held to this earth
17:33 not because earth is pulling us down
17:35 we're being pushed onto the earth by the
17:38 ether winds that come in from space the
17:41 reason why that we actually get pulled
17:44 down is that ether actually is being
17:46 stopped by the core of the earth which I
17:48 believe is a plasma core same as the Sun
17:51 okay by the earth getting bigger it
17:54 blocks more and more of the wind and
17:55 therefore we are pushed down if we had
17:59 wind coming up from the bottom of the
18:00 earth in equal amounts we'd be in a
18:03 weightless in this situation and we
18:05 float away from the earth we would have
18:06 never existed right so I believe that
18:09 the colleges of the universe the
18:10 colleges of this planet excuse me what
18:13 actually have to re endorsed ether
18:18 just forget about anyone telling you
18:19 that it doesn't exist because that's a
18:21 waste of your time go back and research
18:23 what they had discovered in the 1800s
18:26 okay we need to have an engine they can
18:30 manipulate ether and it's going to take
18:34 some sort of technique to make it happen
18:37 now the idea that there's a crystal that
18:40 does it is very interesting because you
18:42 get into sort of the Star Trek fictional
18:44 dilithium crystal problem where the
18:46 crystals deteriorate over time as their
18:48 user a Star Trek soul theories they have
18:50 dilithium crystals and those are used to
18:52 stimulate a warp field around the ship
18:55 which is basically doing the same thing
18:57 I'm talking about they're not allowed to
18:58 say it's an ether engine but that's
19:00 exactly what it would be and they can
19:03 travel really quickly right
19:04 every warp factors the speed of light
19:06 right so warp seven is seven times the
19:08 speed of light right that's why when you
19:10 get into the new series that come out
19:12 you know the new ones horrible but the I
19:15 haven't seen actually in a while but the
19:17 first several shows were just awful
19:21 but warp 11 you know everyone's looking
19:24 for the new engine how fast can it go
19:25 and that sort of thing but our ship is
19:29 going to have to displace ether so that
19:32 it can achieve a hundred percent
19:35 weightlessness basically anti-gravity
19:38 because it's controlling the factors
19:39 that actually comprise gravity right so
19:43 how do you do this well I've heard
19:46 theories and I've had I actually have
19:48 friends of mine that talked to people
19:50 supposedly deep in these programs and
19:53 it's really strange because they seek
19:55 out my friends who are famous people for
20:01 things that completely unrelated to any
20:02 of this okay so they're just fans of
20:04 their work and they want to sit down and
20:05 shoot the [ __ ] they're like man you
20:07 don't even know we've worked on and
20:09 dealt with and we're we're using you
20:12 know this sort of engine to make this
20:13 sort of thing happen and they never
20:14 really completely tell the person
20:17 exactly how it works I'm not sitting
20:18 here with any knowledge and when the
20:20 person tells me in secondhand knowledge
20:22 it gets even worse right but there would
20:24 be essentially two methodologies that I
20:26 can think of at this point to create
20:29 this sort of field around
20:31 a vehicle now we'd often easily have to
20:34 be careful with the way that we create
20:37 such a thing because there we need
20:39 gravity as a human being to process our
20:42 food or water and just simply be alive
20:44 right any of you've been hung upside
20:46 down in some piece of exercise equipment
20:47 or you're hanging out at the playground
20:50 when you're a kid you immediately feel
20:51 sick when you're turned upside down it's
20:55 gross actors that have had to do things
20:56 on Hollywood sets they can only be
20:59 upside down for for a few minutes before
21:01 they gotta get back up right again
21:03 because all the blood rushes to your
21:04 head your whole body is built to be head
21:06 to toe not toe to head right so if you
21:10 start to create this field within the
21:13 spacecraft then you're gonna start
21:15 making everyone sick and everyone's
21:16 gonna have issues zero gravity is not a
21:18 good idea most of you've read all the
21:20 papers about cosmonauts coming down
21:22 after what sixteen months and their bone
21:23 density is lightened horribly and
21:26 they're sick for weeks and months on end
21:28 you know I think the lower bits
21:31 definitely capable definitely possible I
21:33 think they've done it and I think
21:35 they've come down sick now maybe they
21:36 haven't it's all a bunch of BS but it
21:39 seems like people went through some
21:40 seriously bad stages in their life as a
21:43 result of being in space that seemed a
21:45 little a little bit of a stretch if
21:47 they're simply faking it I mean why fake
21:50 all this ailment want to just say it's
21:52 all wonderful but you can't go right now
21:55 if we were to say okay on one side of it
21:57 we've heard this outrageous theory that
21:59 there's a crystal element I want to say
22:02 it's it's in the 61 it's either 161 or
22:05 261 I can't remember
22:07 261 would be massively heavy I think
22:09 it's 161 or somewhere in there you can
22:11 look up Bob Lazar talking about this
22:13 kind of stuff doesn't really matter but
22:15 let's just say there's some sort of
22:16 element out there that we haven't
22:18 discovered yet that when stimulated its
22:20 piezo effect is an amazingly powerful
22:24 accurate redistribution of energy such
22:28 that it collides with ether you throw
22:32 winds that are going in every single
22:33 direction all the time around us that's
22:35 why gravity is so uniform and it's also
22:37 why it's so weak and it pushes this
22:40 stuff away it's sort of like an absolute
22:43 Van Allen belt that doesn't let any
22:44 inside including either itself now it
22:48 may be that we can't ever tell either to
22:50 completely go away maybe we can only get
22:53 so much velocity before we simply top
22:55 out our current engine right who knows
22:57 but the second technique if you don't
22:59 have some magic crystal to create this
23:01 stimulating field around your ship will
23:04 be to have a power source that is simply
23:06 so powerful the through moving electrons
23:09 and certain levels of density or maybe
23:12 even metabolizing up to pure plasma
23:16 we're able to tell ether what to do now
23:21 if earth has a plasma core and every
23:22 other celestial body in the universe has
23:24 a plasma core which I think we can
23:25 pretty much throw on the table as a
23:28 definite possibility then we know it
23:32 works on earth right or stuck to earth
23:34 because it blocks
23:35 ether winds up to a point right now you
23:37 will notice that all vegetation in the
23:40 world typically goes straight up so I
23:42 think a little bit of the ether is
23:43 actually seeping through the center or
23:45 it's the dielectric force ricochet of
23:48 ether hitting the core and bouncing back
23:49 out because if you think about gravity
23:52 in organic life all of the organic life
23:56 should be Moss like on the earth because
23:58 it would grow and immediately be pushed
24:00 down right it would just grow on the
24:01 bottom of our girl on the surface of the
24:04 earth you know you have protein patterns
24:07 and DNA strands that could start
24:08 crystallizing to create a vertical lift
24:10 but when you start looking at a redwood
24:12 tree you start looking at some serious
24:14 force pushing up to allow it to exist at
24:17 such Heights right
24:18 but again gravity is a pretty weak force
24:20 so maybe just a little bit of
24:21 crystallization can topple any sort of
24:24 force pushing down within a certain unit
24:27 of space on the surface of the earth
24:30 right now my friends have been told that
24:33 the military has actually devised a non
24:36 crystal technique of actually propelling
24:40 ships in anti-gravity but they're never
24:44 disclosing is the ether model that
24:46 surrounds the theory so they could say
24:48 gravity waves or whatever but they're
24:49 really talking about ether when you hear
24:52 that we discover gravity waves what
24:54 we've really discovered is they are
24:56 gravity waves but that is defined by
24:58 waves of condensed ether that is
25:01 behaving a certain way due to perhaps
25:03 shockwaves that have happened out of the
25:05 of various regions of our galaxy coming
25:08 at us right I think it's real it's just
25:12 different than what they think it is
25:13 right so what would an antigravity
25:15 device allow us to do and well in short
25:21 you wouldn't have to have these launch
25:22 pads like we have today you wouldn't
25:25 have a fuel system necessarily like the
25:27 ones we have today now maybe if the ship
25:29 is that the engine on the outside of the
25:32 ship is lethal if you get close to it
25:36 because it's disturbing so much ether
25:38 but if you're standing next to just
25:39 shatters who you are just literally
25:41 obliterate your body it obliterates the
25:43 the holding mechanisms around the ship
25:46 then you have to be extremely careful
25:48 right now there's also another theory
25:52 when you get into ether all patterns of
25:54 energy and stimulating energy in general
25:56 you get into a different model of
25:58 propulsion our thought is always fuel
26:01 inside of a cylinder that falls out of
26:03 or some sort of canister or cylinder
26:05 container that falls out of a spout it's
26:07 then routed in a certain vector to
26:09 create lift right there's a lot more to
26:12 it than that
26:13 but it's your basic model now how many
26:15 of you have bought a television in the
26:17 last two years where there's no speakers
26:19 on the television at all and the surface
26:22 of the television is now the speaker new
26:25 Sony televisions the new O LED
26:26 televisions which are phenomenal they
26:29 are the speaker and they actually shape
26:31 they actually curve the speaker a little
26:33 bit in one direction such that it
26:35 focuses the sound towards the sofa of
26:37 which you're probably pointing the TV at
26:39 it's fantastic so no longer do we have
26:42 speakers well that's a pretty phenomenal
26:44 twist if you were to bring that
26:46 television back to the 1970s and set it
26:48 up and show somebody they would freak
26:50 out right where's the speakers well the
26:53 television is the speaker what yeah you
26:56 know I mean what is the speaker it's a
26:57 bladder that vibrates well we're now
26:59 vibrating the entire television holy
27:01 [ __ ] yeah so yeah cool right ironically
27:06 think about the shape of a speaker being
27:08 sort of a conical device being
27:10 translated into a surface
27:12 well imagine our ship itself it's made
27:16 of a metal that is able to carry the
27:19 wave that the engine itself is putting
27:21 out it is the electrical sort of event
27:25 horizon of the beginning of whatever
27:27 algorithm some sacred geometry algorithm
27:30 you know you put sand on a speaker and
27:32 you play a certain wave and it turns
27:34 into those sacred shapes right we would
27:36 have some sort of algorithm on the
27:38 outside of our ship that would take this
27:41 stimulation and create perhaps a more of
27:43 an absence and egg-shaped towards the
27:46 left towards the right towards the top
27:48 towards the bottom if you want to
27:50 totally hold still you just hover it in
27:52 all directions and it just simply stops
27:54 right like an anchor in space if you
27:57 want to go in a particular direction you
27:59 see a moon a planet a star you just
28:02 simply keep creating that wave in front
28:04 of your ship now I'm gonna throw some
28:07 assumptions out there just some little
28:08 guesses out there as to how this might
28:10 actually work if we're able to create
28:12 such a thing and again I've been told
28:14 that I've actually was I was actually
28:16 told I sort of made me laugh that the
28:18 the mercury engine that you will see in
28:21 the episode of the first episode of
28:23 Ironman the movie the first installment
28:25 of that movie series that the military
28:28 actually created that engine and that
28:29 there 20-30 years beyond that engine
28:32 that was the last sort of big claim I
28:33 heard which is sort of funny it's like
28:35 okay whatever but the idea is that if
28:39 the universe is comprised of this wind
28:41 and the wind is absolutely everywhere
28:42 and if gravity waves are real then the
28:45 very stability of space itself is
28:47 actually a variable wherever you are in
28:49 space it's not unified necessarily
28:51 especially if there are waves and it
28:53 makes complete sense right when you look
28:55 at a still pond or of still bathtub or
28:58 whatever where the water is just not
29:00 moving it's beautiful right there's not
29:01 a single drop coming in anywhere but
29:04 didn't you put a drop in there you get a
29:05 bunch of ripples and that would be a
29:08 star exploding something moving through
29:11 space we know of our planets move
29:13 through space if they are truly out
29:15 there and the moons go around them so at
29:18 all times it's affecting the ether all
29:21 density and distribution of ether which
29:23 creates the negative pockets of
29:25 ether which creates the gravity between
29:27 a moon and a planet right so the moon is
29:30 blocking a bunch of either between us
29:33 and the moon which keeps it locked to us
29:35 right
29:36 we're also blocking a bunch from the
29:38 behind of the earth that would normally
29:41 be hitting the moon and pushing it away
29:42 from us so we're pulling towards it and
29:45 it's pulling towards us but it's
29:47 actually a push because it's due to
29:48 negative pressure between two objects in
29:50 space with a etheral diffused non
29:55 positive non negative particle which
29:58 when it starts to orbit and ricochet you
30:00 get dielectric and magnetism which then
30:03 when they collide with each other you
30:04 get electromagnetism you can't go see
30:07 the gravity episode for all the details
30:09 now there's a lot of volatile things in
30:11 space as well and perhaps the ether all
30:15 density gets really intense when we're
30:18 in certain things like perhaps a Van
30:20 Allen bolt right what if the Van Allen
30:22 belts are I mean they're obviously made
30:24 of ether if ether exists and they would
30:26 be extremely dense and it would be sort
30:29 of like walking the difference between
30:31 walking through your pool if it's all
30:34 shallow right you walk from one end to
30:35 the other it's no problem your body can
30:38 out perform the water's force and then
30:42 it's the difference between going
30:43 through the Mississippi and trying to
30:45 swim straight across because it's
30:47 kicking the crap out of you and knocking
30:49 you down went downstream right so
30:52 whatever engine we create has got to be
30:56 unequivocally infinitely powerful to
30:59 overwhelm anything that we might run
31:01 into in space right now if either exists
31:04 we know that various bodies that are
31:07 bigger are gonna create more negative
31:09 space around us or negative pressure
31:11 around us and they're gonna suck us in
31:13 we're gonna be hit from behind less it
31:16 from underneath where this is where the
31:17 planet is and we're gonna push towards
31:18 it so at all times we have to have an
31:21 engine they can create this void that we
31:23 can overcome any any ether winds in
31:27 space no matter what now there's a big
31:30 scare in the in the scientific astronomy
31:33 community
31:34 cosmology community about black holes
31:36 right theorized I believe in the 17-7
31:39 these and it was rebirthed later in the
31:42 20th century and it's become a lot of
31:45 great fodder for science fiction
31:47 television shows several movies etc
31:51 Stephen W Hockey made ton of money off
31:54 of hit rate and of course this is the
31:57 idea that mass because in their model
32:00 okay ether doesn't exist it's this
32:03 mysterious phenomenon right gravity is a
32:06 phenomenon still but they say so know
32:08 what it is right you can calculate
32:09 gravity really well that it the more
32:13 mass that gets together it starts to
32:15 condense and condense to the point it
32:16 gets so intense that even the verbal
32:18 reaction called light can't escape it
32:21 and there's this event horizon where
32:23 when you're on the inside of the event
32:24 horizon you don't see anything from the
32:26 outside when you're on the outside you
32:28 see whatever the hell you see it could
32:30 be super bright could be various shades
32:32 of super high frequency light who knows
32:35 right you know I did a lot of research
32:38 in black holes and wrote some pretty
32:39 gigantic papers for friends in school of
32:43 which they got straight A's on and when
32:45 I was following it in the late 80s early
32:48 90s it got fully deprecated out of
32:49 existence by Hawking who was basically
32:51 writing papers saying it can't exist it
32:54 will diffuse itself it will create
32:56 super-heavy elements like helium 23 or
32:58 something before it totally disperses
33:01 it'll never be a round object it'll be a
33:02 disc but the disc then starts to
33:06 collapse in the center and it creates
33:07 these huge spouts above and below and
33:09 it'll diffuse it can't exist and it was
33:12 only supposed to be capable of being
33:13 created out of a mass for to mass twelve
33:16 star somewhere in there but but they
33:18 then said oh but a bunch of black holes
33:20 could get together after they've created
33:21 themselves and so you'd have a gigantic
33:23 one it's gonna swallow up the universe
33:24 and it was sort of like a little horror
33:26 story for a nerd you know going to bed
33:28 at night thinking that a black hole
33:30 could just show up in your solar system
33:32 and swallow the whole thing up maybe but
33:35 I'm not convinced then all the sudden
33:37 like 20 years later it shows up the
33:39 theory shows up again here my friends
33:40 telling me like they [ __ ] know it
33:41 exists right never seen one never a
33:44 photograph of one of any kind and they
33:46 said well you know there's a black hole
33:49 at the center of the galaxy oh my god
33:51 yeah
33:51 why because someone sold that to you cuz
33:53 you
33:53 ever go to the center of the galaxy so
33:55 you [ __ ] just automatically believe
33:56 it's there
33:57 oh well it's under pretty good
33:58 advisement remember Matt's like please
34:01 that's one thing we have to turn off in
34:03 this universe is BS theories that we
34:06 then have to waste time and money on you
34:10 know but our ship is going to have to to
34:15 its best ability being able to
34:17 counteract anything of that nature
34:18 something of amazing pressure such that
34:22 we can escape some huge gravity based
34:24 object could be a gigantic star that's a
34:27 thousand times bigger than our star and
34:28 it's just pulling everything in what if
34:32 we want to cruise past the center of the
34:34 galaxy because the center of the galaxy
34:35 exists I think if that's what those band
34:38 of stars are up there if all those
34:40 photographs of you know spiral things in
34:43 space are real and not some illustration
34:45 which they very may well be right but
34:48 now let's let's move past propulsion
34:50 beat that up quite a bit how do we
34:53 navigate through the Stars say we have
34:56 this ship now if we navigate through our
34:59 solar system probably pretty easy to get
35:01 back to earth even though it will freak
35:04 us out when we see how tiny the earth is
35:07 once we get to Jupiter once we get to
35:09 Saturn all these different planets that
35:10 are supposedly out there that we can see
35:12 through telescopes right they do exist
35:14 through telescopes man I've seen them
35:16 with junior telescopes that are ten
35:18 thousand power telescopes I've seen the
35:21 rings of Saturn with my own eyes in the
35:24 back of my buddy's house I've seen
35:27 Jupiter with my own eyes so there's
35:30 something out there and it's round and
35:31 it definitely has gas surface to it that
35:34 it definitely takes a circular shape
35:36 okay for anyone thinking that there's
35:37 some other thing so something's out
35:40 there but when we want to leave our
35:43 solar system what are we gonna do and I
35:47 know what all the Star Trek people say
35:49 well we just look at the Stars the Stars
35:51 are the ultimate map of the universe
35:53 okay
35:54 well what are all of our star maps based
35:58 on on planet Earth
36:00 they are based on looking from the
36:03 surface of the earth you find the
36:05 Northstar you can find the Southern
36:07 Cross the Big Dipper all that good stuff
36:09 right so when you're trying to find your
36:11 way on planet Earth you can look up look
36:13 at the Big Dipper find the North Star
36:16 and you know which direction you're
36:18 walking in generally right depending on
36:20 which hemisphere you're on but what if
36:23 you're in space and you're hauling ass
36:25 who knows what speed you're going maybe
36:27 are going the speed of light you're just
36:29 going SuperDuper quick now all of the
36:32 stars are going to potentially start
36:35 shifting a little bit the closest ones
36:36 will take a tiniest shift now the
36:39 beautiful thing is that stars are if
36:41 they're truly stars up there they're
36:43 really far away so they don't shift much
36:45 they don't parallax much because they're
36:47 so far away
36:49 you're not moving that much in space to
36:51 have a change position but now I don't
36:54 think this conversation is going to be
36:56 about just traveling the solar system
36:58 right I don't think there's any body in
37:00 our solar system that could support our
37:03 life so one of the things that we're
37:05 gonna run into just to pull back for one
37:06 second because we're gonna be kind of
37:08 bored we're gonna be fascinated and
37:10 we're gonna be bored at the same time
37:12 that all we can do is look at a lot of
37:15 these surfaces right because they're so
37:18 hostile but unless we created some sort
37:21 of you know gravity suit where it it
37:25 basically insulates us from winds that
37:28 are going a thousand miles an hour on
37:30 the surface of Europa or something we're
37:33 gonna have a hard time moving around and
37:36 looking around so it's gonna be a lot of
37:37 probing maybe it's driven by human
37:40 beings we're gonna have to come to grips
37:42 with the fact that man's probably not
37:43 gonna set up a lot of bases on foreign
37:45 planets maybe the moon maybe on Mars if
37:48 it's truly there and the way that we
37:50 have seen it portrayed through probably
37:53 Terrigen renderings but will we really
37:56 set up a colony on a on a planet that
37:58 doesn't have the proper gravity to keep
38:00 the human body sound well we probably
38:04 have to take our engine and modify it to
38:06 create some sort of relative gravity
38:08 that matches our gravity so that we feel
38:10 like we're at home we're going
38:12 to bring everything that we need to
38:15 survive including the seeds the soil
38:17 everything well we're gonna have to
38:19 create machines that can create this for
38:20 us right that's a tall order and it goes
38:23 way beyond the order of creating our own
38:25 spaceship I think it's going to be
38:26 easier to create an anti-gravity
38:28 spaceship to travel the Stars then some
38:30 sort of machine that can take you know
38:33 you know rocks and make it soil you know
38:36 I mean maybe at some point we can pull
38:39 it off but we would have to replicate a
38:40 hundred percent the atomic composite of
38:45 all the things that we need right
38:47 I think atmospheric systems are probably
38:50 pretty easy to create pretty basic
38:52 components that we that we breathe again
38:54 if we have an anti-gravity ship we got
38:56 an anti-gravity system we have a gravity
38:58 system for us on anywhere we go right
39:00 that's nice our ship is going to need
39:03 artificial gravity inside the ship right
39:06 underneath the floor plate it just is so
39:10 we're gonna have to divert some of that
39:11 energy down below and create an
39:15 artificial pull through negative energy
39:18 negative negative distribution of ether
39:21 to hold us down to the plate and we're
39:23 gonna have to survive in space for a
39:25 long time depending on how fast we can
39:28 get this ship to go what if gravity
39:33 waves are real and there's micro gravity
39:36 waves gravity waves exist on every
39:38 single frequency that we could possibly
39:40 imagine let's just say but any of you've
39:43 gotten in a boat and you ride on a lake
39:45 that's still you can haul ass in your
39:48 boat the second someone else cuts the
39:51 cuts the line in front of you or it's a
39:54 really windy day you start hitting the
39:56 chop what happens where your ship
39:58 doesn't go as fast does it and it really
40:00 takes the brunt force of all the waves
40:02 that you hit boom boom boom well if our
40:07 engine has a certain level of power to
40:10 push ether away to create these voids
40:12 that's we can propel our our craft in
40:15 whatever direction that we want it
40:17 should be safe to assume did this
40:20 technique is pushing ether away it's
40:23 hitting ether and saying go around go
40:25 around
40:26 well if either gets more dense more
40:28 quick more powerful there's been an
40:30 explosion you don't even know about and
40:31 this big giant tsunami is coming at you
40:34 imagine us being kicked completely
40:36 across the universe by this wave to the
40:39 point we can't stop and we can't control
40:41 our vehicle and then we hurl into
40:43 whatever is in the way right a meteorite
40:46 an asteroid a freaking planet a moon Sun
40:50 etc and they're all pulling on us saying
40:53 come to Papa
40:54 right cuz it's saying I've created a
40:56 huge negative pull towards me let's go
40:59 right so would man get out there and do
41:02 him by himself first risks getting so
41:06 deep in space that we can no longer
41:08 figure out where the hell we are if we
41:11 start traveling the speed of light now
41:13 the universe seems to be if all the
41:15 science is not completely bunk it's so
41:18 freaking big you could go ten times the
41:21 speed of light and you'll be travelling
41:23 for years to get to the next star now
41:25 when I was a kid they used to say that
41:27 Alpha Centauri was the closest star even
41:29 Sid Meier's made a game that was the
41:31 sequel to civilization which was awesome
41:33 by the way
41:33 and you took that spaceship that you
41:36 built its civilization you went to Alpha
41:37 Centauri and you live there was awesome
41:39 but even if you're going four times the
41:41 speed of light still gonna take your 1
41:42 year to get there not phenomenal one
41:45 year you have to bring all your food you
41:47 take care of yourself you're gonna have
41:49 to not go crazy inside your ship which
41:52 means this needs to be probably big
41:53 enough that you've got enough space that
41:55 you're not in some teeny tiny capsule
41:57 which means the bigger the whole of the
42:00 ship I'm assuming the more energy you're
42:03 going to need to create this wave that
42:05 we're talking about so the energy system
42:08 that we have I think needs to have an
42:10 exponential factor to it it's going to
42:13 be easy to dial in near infinite power
42:17 or if we have this crystal technique the
42:20 Bob Lazar is lamenting that and probably
42:22 took from Star Trek if he's not telling
42:23 the truth then we're gonna have to have
42:25 something that doesn't deteriorate and
42:27 for the duration of our trip right the
42:29 crystal can never go away
42:30 you can't break easily right and we put
42:33 in like a neat volt battery r was a
42:35 naval battery and the thing creates
42:37 enough energy for us to be in space for
42:39 a hundred years travelling at you know a
42:41 hundred times the speed of light so in
42:43 getting to where we want to go now if we
42:46 were ever to get to these massive warp
42:49 speeds or ten or whatever and we're
42:51 traveling our galaxy we're not going to
42:53 get out of the galaxy at warp ten
42:54 anytime soon if we do we might find
42:57 ourselves in a void of absolute boredom
42:59 and we'll probably kill ourselves before
43:01 we get anywhere you have to go like warp
43:03 a thousand to get to the next galaxies
43:05 in any decent amount of time for the
43:06 human psyche to to figure out or with
43:09 some of your sci-fi people are already
43:11 thinking we're gonna have to have some
43:13 sort of human stasis technology which is
43:16 unrelated to any of the advancements I'm
43:18 talking about where we actually slow
43:20 down time for human beings right and you
43:23 might get out your general relativity or
43:24 special relativity and try to create
43:26 some sort of theory there be careful
43:28 stepping into Einsteins ideas to
43:30 accomplish anything again you do live in
43:32 a world that's devoid of any Einstein
43:34 patents you are in a world of Tesla
43:36 patents but you probably don't even know
43:37 who that guy is
43:38 unless you're one of us right but unless
43:41 mankind bumps into another alien race
43:43 that likes us and says ho here's the
43:45 star maps and here's though we'll build
43:47 a little API from our computer to your
43:49 computer and what kind of plug do you
43:51 have oh yeah we've got the USB 42 port
43:54 you know we'll make you a little USB 3
43:56 converter or whatever we will let you
43:58 know where everything is in space you
43:59 never get lost well until we find those
44:02 those aliens that are so willing and
44:04 able to share their information we're
44:07 gonna have to real-time capture
44:08 everything that changes in space so that
44:12 we can rewind our trajectory and get
44:14 back to earth if that's truly our goal
44:15 which I'm dearly hoping that would be
44:17 the case right so imagine if those
44:20 systems were to go faulty can those
44:23 systems actually sense light through our
44:27 system that is actually blocking all
44:29 ether the answer is no they can't
44:32 because light is a factor of ether
44:34 traveling in a verbal concussion
44:37 reaction and a wave of energy that we
44:40 register as light in our brains right so
44:42 you're never going to get it inside your
44:43 ship or get it to hit a sensor unless
44:46 somehow you insulate this wave such that
44:51 it can actually bring a little bit of
44:52 light in to hit
44:53 sensor we won't see where the stars are
44:56 maybe there's some more advanced
44:58 technology where we could actually study
44:59 gravity waves through some interpolation
45:02 all right for those of you have ever
45:04 used sonar cameras and robots
45:06 there's always interpolation of the
45:08 frequency bouncing you put four or five
45:10 little eyeballs on your on your robot
45:12 and sending out all these audio signals
45:14 and they do with lasers now too but
45:15 they're a little harder because they're
45:16 tighter frequencies but there's all
45:18 kinds of beautiful algorithms to figure
45:20 out what obstacles are in the room with
45:21 the robot based on acoustic differential
45:24 algorithms it's amazing so perhaps we
45:26 take that technology move it up into the
45:28 concussive reaction of ether just say I
45:31 feel like we've got a big giant planet
45:32 over oh there's a Jupiter right there
45:34 you know it's this far away because this
45:36 is how these waves of this magnitude hit
45:38 us and vibrate our ship maybe that's one
45:41 of the ways we do it now I know that
45:43 there have been tremendous theories that
45:46 kept Einstein very employed such as
45:49 wormholes einstein-rosen bridge theories
45:51 where the fabric of the universe has
45:54 twisted and turned so much so that we
45:56 could penetrate the fabric of the
45:57 universe in such a way that we sort of
45:59 hyper space from one place to another
46:02 hmm well the idea is that and my problem
46:07 with this whole theory is that the one
46:11 it's all on paper and it's cute and it's
46:13 interesting for the mind to think about
46:15 but we are made out of the fabric of the
46:18 universe ourselves and one of the huge
46:21 anomalies are playing with ether in the
46:24 universe of any kind is that
46:25 imagine you turn on your spaceship you
46:28 figure out a way to displace ether and
46:29 some little mechanical device on a
46:31 laboratory it's microscopic it's like
46:32 sort of had a CERN Hadron Collider tiny
46:35 Nina site and then you try to build I
46:38 don't know some of the size of a shoebox
46:40 when you put a few little GI Joes in the
46:43 center just to see what would happen and
46:45 you turn it on and the the box actually
46:48 follows a pre-programmed path it flies
46:51 around the room and it lands but you
46:53 open the box up and all the mass inside
46:55 has obliterated into nothing or maybe
46:58 it's a big ball of plasma then shocks
47:01 the crap but everybody in the room hmm
47:04 why would that occur
47:06 well if you're gonna mess with all of
47:08 the ether outside your ship then you're
47:11 sort of messing with the very bloodline
47:12 of your existence either ether running
47:16 through everything that we experienced
47:18 today the entire time you've been alive
47:20 you've had ether flowing through your
47:21 body you are made of it everything
47:24 you've ever consumed eaten excreted the
47:27 storms that you experience when you go
47:29 outside your pillow at night it's all
47:32 made of ether so if you start playing
47:34 with the introduction of ether into your
47:37 ecosystem of existence basically
47:39 policing hey I don't want any ether from
47:42 this side of the ship all right maybe
47:44 it's not absolute maybe a certain amount
47:46 comes through we're probably gonna have
47:48 to figure out the science of saying okay
47:51 the human body needs this much
47:53 refreshing ether to continue to exist
47:56 because we are not a stationary object
47:59 it is my belief that we have that our
48:01 atoms are constantly refreshing its
48:04 orbital patterns of ether which make up
48:05 all of the sigma v those designations of
48:08 like protons neutrons electrons etc are
48:13 all constantly renewing okay so we're
48:17 probably gonna have to figure out how to
48:18 counterbalance the inside of our ship
48:21 that could be that we then regulate it
48:26 with our algorithm again let's say we
48:29 have a gravity plate that's pulling us
48:31 down we have anti-gravity outside some
48:34 you know maybe a big portion of the ship
48:35 two-thirds of the ship is actually being
48:40 hit by ether we want it to push us on
48:42 the backside right push the bus forward
48:44 that kind of thing maybe we can
48:46 cannibalize that ether at any one point
48:48 in time but if we want to stop our ship
48:50 we want it to completely balance out on
48:52 the outside don't push us in any
48:54 direction because we want to come to a
48:55 complete stop at that point we have
48:58 blocked all ether going through our ship
49:00 what are we made of made out of at that
49:02 point you see how it works we may
49:05 actually have to actually create some
49:06 sort of siphon into our vehicle at all
49:08 times simply getting to a general
49:12 approximation of being stationary then
49:16 there's communication
49:18 we probably wouldn't want to put a ship
49:20 in space that we couldn't communicate
49:21 with and I'm jumping ahead with human
49:24 beings being in this spaceship it should
49:26 go without saying that we would probably
49:27 create hundreds of probes that use this
49:31 technology
49:32 no human flesh in it at all we just want
49:34 to kind of see what's out there now
49:35 we're gonna use anti-gravity systems to
49:38 pull it off this exact ship with no
49:40 human beings inside everything I've
49:42 talked about has to be accounted for
49:43 anyway right gravity doesn't really
49:46 matter you know what to do the gravity
49:47 plate for a robot AI inside the system
49:50 taking in all the data but if you don't
49:53 give that that construct of a machine
49:55 its ether oil supply on a routine you
49:59 know nanosecond to nanosecond is going
50:02 to cease to exist you're gonna have a
50:03 problem
50:04 you're gonna scramble the inside of the
50:05 box right there was an interesting
50:07 fictional spaceship in the series
50:09 Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy called
50:11 the starship heart of gold and it had
50:14 inside of it the infinite improbability
50:16 drive those of you have read the story
50:20 it's absolutely hilarious but what it
50:24 talks about is once you turn the ship on
50:26 the ship is in every conceivable point
50:28 in the universe at the exact same moment
50:30 and it simply picks where it wants to
50:32 reach show up and what's interesting
50:34 about the stories it locks itself into
50:36 the galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox is the
50:38 president of the galaxy and he can't
50:40 figure out how he became the president
50:41 cuz he sort of knows deep down inside
50:44 he's a complete loser as much as he's a
50:46 total narcissist he knows he wasn't
50:49 qualified to be the president of
50:50 galaxies so he wants to find out how he
50:52 became the president the galaxy which is
50:55 sort of an homage to the way that
50:57 leaders are selected you know in this
50:59 day and age right they're not elected
51:02 hopefully that's changed in recent
51:03 history but if we could figure out a
51:07 little capsule some sort of device where
51:09 we could have all of the data that we
51:11 could possibly drag out of the universe
51:13 every attribute of measurement from heat
51:15 to II throw density to planets and stars
51:19 and moons and all the other objects out
51:22 there and we can sense them before we
51:24 run into them so we can move around them
51:26 and this engine has the exponential
51:29 factor that we're talking about
51:31 it can move one inch for four permanent
51:34 to orchid move to the next galaxy in the
51:37 next second it has that capability but
51:41 one you're disturbing space at the same
51:44 time you are travelling with the system
51:47 remember our boat analogy when someone
51:50 cuts a line in front of you with their
51:52 motors blasting you know which you're
51:54 unsure on noodle or some drinking a beer
51:56 you know here comes the wave and
51:58 everyone's popping up and down if you're
51:59 on the shore all the boats start
52:00 slamming into the dock it's a huge pain
52:02 in the ass well we'd probably want to
52:05 make sure that our engine is fairly well
52:06 balanced with the universe because we
52:09 don't want to be creating gigantic waves
52:11 that might be hurting other parts of the
52:13 universe
52:14 maybe those waves grow bigger because
52:16 they bounce off something else and it
52:18 starts to become an exponential problem
52:20 so we have a responsibility as we travel
52:23 don't we they don't want to tear
52:25 everything up we want to look and come
52:27 back home and report what we found now
52:31 for the objective of saving mankind
52:32 we're definitely going to have to go off
52:35 in multiple directions at all times we
52:37 need a vehicle they can travel and
52:38 discover these places where we could
52:40 perch for a little while
52:43 we'd have to figure out how much of
52:44 humanity we want to save if we're gonna
52:46 go in that direction do we save a
52:48 million people do we save ten people do
52:50 we save ten billion people and how will
52:53 we do that right we're gonna have to
52:56 bring all of our earthbound
52:58 needs with us and try to find again a
53:01 guy a class planet it's going to have
53:03 pretty much everything that we have on
53:04 this planet and hopefully not in another
53:07 intelligent life that says get the hell
53:09 out of here this is ours right it's
53:11 interesting the second that men were if
53:15 man were to come together and say look
53:17 I've got this technology from 1960 I
53:20 found this thing from 1890 I got this
53:22 that this and we weren't inhibited by
53:23 oil companies and other you know
53:26 governing bodies that are terrified of
53:27 us gaining control over our own lives
53:29 and we actually did come together and we
53:31 started building this ship and we
53:33 started figuring everything out week we
53:35 actually could do estimates where we
53:36 said you know I think in 10 years we're
53:38 gonna have this thing licked the
53:39 spaceship itself it's going to be able
53:41 to sustain computers it's going to be
53:43 able to sit assist
53:44 humans both it's gonna have enough room
53:47 that doesn't matter how big we build it
53:49 it's gonna be could build it on earth we
53:51 could build it on earth and then just
53:53 lift it into space with its own engines
53:55 right could be the size of a city could
53:57 be the size of a state if we can simply
53:59 construct it right the second that we
54:02 achieve that goal then we have to go
54:05 through all of the fictional scenarios
54:07 listen Arizona fiction up to this point
54:09 of our responsibility in the universe
54:12 right we have to devise a methodology to
54:15 search for a needle in a haystack yes
54:18 they tell you that there's what I don't
54:20 know I know what the count is several
54:21 hundred planets they think they found in
54:23 space that could sustain life because
54:26 we've done these spectral grams of all
54:28 of their light coming off and we think
54:30 we've seen oxygen and water and all this
54:32 other stuff whether or not we've
54:34 actually done that or not I don't know I
54:36 hope we have it's funny how these things
54:38 are discovered but the public is never
54:40 invited to come take a look isn't that
54:42 interesting when I was a kid I think I
54:45 mentioned this in one of the episodes a
54:47 long time ago when I was a kid and they
54:49 would run experiments like when they
54:51 supposedly crashed sensors probes down
54:55 into the bowels of Jupiter like 20 plus
54:58 years ago probably not that long ago but
55:02 they did the press conference and this
55:04 guy said we are gonna rewrite the book
55:06 on Jupiter the data we got back is
55:08 utterly phenomenal okay where's that
55:12 article where's the results of that data
55:14 I haven't seen anything
55:15 no one said I've seen the headline news
55:17 around the world that Jupiter's got you
55:19 know cheesecake at the center I'm not
55:22 seeing anything from those missions and
55:26 I asked around some of my NASA buddies
55:28 at the time and I said what's the deal
55:30 with them you know that they run these
55:32 these probes out there and the one that
55:34 goes up and listens to the Sun and then
55:35 comes down and crashes in this in the
55:37 desert like why does it take so damn
55:39 long to get the data to the public the
55:41 public is financing all this research
55:43 but were the last ones to know and in
55:45 most cases were never told what's going
55:47 on right like the project Orion that
55:49 refuses to tell us how lethal Evette
55:51 allen belts are because they're probably
55:52 massively lethal right my buddy just
55:55 laughed and he goes you know why he goes
55:57 he said we weren't in the conspiracy
56:00 world at this time but he said because
56:02 these scientists want to hoard
56:04 everything they want to name everything
56:06 after themselves and I thought wow there
56:10 needs to be some new policies passed
56:11 right real-time data back to the
56:14 citizens just a stream of data but tools
56:17 to analyze it whatever tools they're
56:19 using imagine with all the internet
56:21 people out there which are called the
56:22 autists the one that find everyone who's
56:24 ever lied about anything they they dig
56:27 in your past and they figure you out
56:28 politicians and celebrities mainly
56:30 musicians all that kind of stuff you put
56:33 them on this data creative right brain
56:36 thinkers that are also massively left
56:38 brain thinkers I'm thinking that the
56:40 public would come up with so much more
56:42 data interpretation potential theories
56:45 that we don't have in our school books
56:46 today the mecca of explosion in in so in
56:52 scientific thinking around the world
56:54 would be phenomenal and like I always
56:56 say on this show some five-year-olds
56:58 gonna look at the data and go oh it's
57:00 like this boom boom boom boom and the
57:03 rooms gonna go what you know the little
57:05 girl goes yeah you haven't even checked
57:06 this out look it's right there in front
57:07 of your face because she's not inhibited
57:09 by a bunch of doctrine and and paradigm
57:13 to constrain her thinking she hasn't
57:15 been told you can't travel faster and
57:16 realize she isn't totally bogus theories
57:18 that ether doesn't exist also there's
57:20 stuff if we start raising our kids with
57:23 all the information who knows what the
57:26 world could turn into right but how
57:29 funny would it be that if whatever space
57:32 organization we might come up with that
57:34 we believe would tell the truth I would
57:35 have this ultimate transparency it's
57:37 literally founded on a platform of
57:40 transparency in fact we put
57:42 international felonies down there you
57:44 know you can be in jail for the rest of
57:46 your life if you're caught blocking the
57:48 transparency of information to the
57:50 people intentionally right for your own
57:52 benefit or whatever right you're selling
57:55 secrets to somebody or something right
57:56 if they have this beautiful foundation
57:59 we sit in boardroom after boardroom
58:01 after boardroom cannibalizing all of the
58:04 fictional stories we've ever written
58:06 about space travel I would say Star Trek
58:09 would provide
58:11 99% of the DNA for how to handle space
58:15 travel all these fictional scenarios of
58:18 running into plaintiffs with viruses
58:20 that are killing off one race while the
58:22 other races okay do you save the one
58:24 that's that's dying is it survival of
58:27 the fittest
58:27 you know o X minus one episodes from the
58:30 50s for those of you missed the the old
58:32 tell our story I'll radio series from
58:34 the 50s called X minus one there's also
58:36 two thousand plus that preceded that
58:40 they've gone through these theories it's
58:43 amazing how long ago we've been thinking
58:46 about think about all the Asimov books
58:47 and and Heinlein books and all these
58:50 arthur c clarke books where they've
58:53 parsed the social impact of our
58:57 responsibility of traveling the universe
59:00 it's fascinating
59:02 these policies need to be decided on as
59:04 a human race if we can ever create the
59:06 ship right now i think very few of you
59:09 will take this this this tact this other
59:13 angle that I'm going to mention here but
59:16 I know that people are out there and
59:17 they think well I'm sure that if this is
59:21 possible NASA would have already done it
59:23 right a lot of you will laugh and you
59:27 should laugh a hearty hearty laugh it
59:30 boils down in my opinion to the
59:32 following reason why information isn't
59:36 freely distributed to us that might get
59:39 us to this point the reason why ether
59:42 was erased from the scientific books in
59:46 Einstein's era one I think he was an
59:49 idiot to begin with I think he was truly
59:52 a Peter Sellers and being there I think
59:54 he was completely a fraud we'll do that
59:56 episode this with this season I know I
59:58 promised it last season we're gonna
59:59 kneel on this this season I mean he did
60:02 some lecture as he did some talk so he
60:05 understood at least what he was pitched
60:07 he could reap itch it to other people
60:08 began he was such a theoretical level
60:12 I'm just not convinced that it's it's
60:15 proof that he was a genius but now think
60:18 about it how many of you grew up in a
60:22 household where he had a pretty strict
60:23 household
60:25 and in your brain you conceded to the
60:28 fact that you were under 18 and if
60:30 you're under 18 you can't do anything
60:32 about your life you have to go home to
60:34 your parents house and follow their
60:36 rules now legally that's still the case
60:38 unless you can somehow divorce your
60:39 parents under some pretense and so you
60:42 adopt the paradigm until you're 18 and
60:44 then when you're eating you get this
60:45 beautiful ability to leave your family's
60:48 home if you have an abusive parent you
60:50 get away from them if you just simply
60:52 you just feel it in your soul you feel
60:54 like man I know what I want to do with
60:57 my life that was me as a kid man I moved
60:59 out at 16 and it was like I ran my life
61:01 after 16 I pretty much ran it from about
61:03 13 and up but I still lived in under my
61:06 father's home until it's about 16 I just
61:08 popped out and it was just like euphoric
61:10 to control my universe I made a ton of
61:12 mistakes don't get me wrong but it
61:15 turned out okay in the end now your
61:17 parents are trying to do the very best
61:18 they possibly can for you which is why
61:20 obviously we don't always understand
61:22 what they're trying to do when we're
61:23 young and we wake up when were 25 or so
61:25 and we got oh geez I was a little
61:27 bastard wasn't I yes you were did you
61:29 turned out okay
61:30 I'm glad you worked it out but we know
61:33 that there are groups in the world and I
61:35 won't go off on a terrible stent in this
61:37 direction but it's something to do with
61:38 why I think technology is is coveted the
61:43 way that it is there's two layers of it
61:45 of course right there's economic benefit
61:48 and control you know you have your
61:51 social mobility in the world which means
61:52 you can traverse through the social
61:54 layers of the world the class structure
61:56 of the world meaning the richest people
61:57 in the world and the poorest people in
61:59 the world and if you're super duper
62:00 wealthy you can go back and forth you
62:03 can go visit Jamaica ghettos and you can
62:05 go to Monaco and toast champagne
62:07 watching the f1 race right that's full
62:11 social mobility generally speaking but
62:15 we got a layer people over that don't we
62:16 and they want to they control a lot of
62:19 things in this universe and this
62:21 universe called our planet Earth and if
62:24 we have the ability to leave planet
62:26 Earth
62:27 then we no longer have this controlling
62:31 force on top of us and they no longer
62:32 have the minions to control which means
62:35 say what if someone was a queen
62:38 and they needed their clothes cleaned
62:39 but no one wanted to do that anymore
62:41 because they're like screw you you don't
62:43 control me and she says I'll give you
62:45 money like I don't want your money I got
62:47 plenty of money my dignity alone will
62:49 prevent me from helping a person like
62:52 you the person who thinks they're higher
62:54 than me a person you can't even have
62:55 crimes put against them can't be charged
62:58 with a crime nice job you did there well
63:01 that's over now I'm going to Mars I'm
63:03 going to plant it whatever Zenon oh
63:07 that's a problem isn't it hmm how many
63:12 of you saw the movie in 1988 he was 88
63:15 called Total Recall with Arnold
63:18 Schwarzenegger in it now I won't go into
63:22 the premise of the movie that much but
63:23 he went to the planet Mars at some point
63:25 and when he went to Mars he found a
63:27 whole society of people that were
63:28 working to mine some sort of minerals
63:32 out of out of the bowels of Mars and
63:35 there were pretty much it looked like
63:39 about 90% of the people were sort of
63:41 peasant miners and 10% of the people
63:43 started to divide up into your sort of
63:46 aristocracy there and there was one guy
63:48 that ran the entire mining company and
63:51 they kind of played him off as the guy
63:53 that owns the entire mining company
63:54 probably as a board of directors or
63:55 whatever right but they only could get
63:58 to Mars one if you had a ton of money
64:01 you could get there on a vacation and
64:03 then you ran the tourist track but if
64:06 you wanted to live there you pretty much
64:08 had to either go into the ghettos of
64:10 this place and become some sort of like
64:13 Deadwood you know settler on on Mars or
64:16 you had to be a miner a person who mines
64:19 stuff out of the ground which means you
64:20 had a blue-collar job and you had to
64:22 answer to whatever they said whatever
64:24 the policies were and so they co-opted
64:27 Mars in this movie before any human
64:29 beings got to migrate there they put a
64:31 giant corporation there they control
64:34 everything including towards the end of
64:36 the movie you realize they control the
64:38 air that everyone believed breathes
64:40 right it's quality of its air whether it
64:43 was filtered or not the rich people had
64:45 filtered air and the poor people had bad
64:47 air and the people that had to breathe
64:49 bad air in the 100
64:51 years that it took to colonize that
64:53 place they started mutating and they
64:55 started having interesting side effects
64:57 to their mutations right seeing the
64:58 future and all kinds of walls though
64:59 well we're gonna build a new Space
65:01 Agency and forever gonna conquer foreign
65:05 soil then before all of this co-opting
65:08 occurs one of the things we're gonna
65:10 have to build into the policy is what is
65:12 the policy of conquering foreign land
65:14 foreign territory if the public is
65:17 itself paid for the program to get us
65:20 there then it's a public asset right but
65:25 if someone comes in and donates two
65:28 trillion dollars to the program and pays
65:30 for the conquering of a particular
65:31 planet they may say look I own that
65:34 planet you're not allowed unless you
65:36 follow my rules and we start creating a
65:38 little micro or maybe even macro
65:41 monarchies on all these different
65:43 planets bringing all their workers and
65:45 then it starts creating a class
65:47 structure and you have Total Recall
65:50 these are things we have to think about
65:52 if we start traveling through space now
65:55 why do this episode well one it
65:59 definitely gets through some of the
66:00 scientific it puts forth the notion of
66:04 certain scientific theories that are on
66:05 the table right now that have been on
66:07 the table for over a hundred and fifty
66:09 years the existence of ether and what
66:12 you can accomplish if you could dominate
66:13 ether you can figure it out right well
66:16 we got to figure out again what we're
66:17 made out of we have to redefine every
66:21 piece of atomic construct that we think
66:22 we know exists and find out that there's
66:25 a subatomic particle that's called ether
66:28 it has no charge its behavior and its
66:30 movement through our macro view gives it
66:33 the idea of a positive or negative it's
66:37 simply its rotational behavior when it
66:39 starts to bang into each other in this
66:41 big giant thing we call the universe but
66:44 the more important thing in my opinion
66:45 is not necessarily the technology
66:47 because I don't want to limit your brain
66:49 by anything I've said in this episode
66:51 Amen if you can make a ham sandwich get
66:53 us into space I'm all there baby
66:55 right I prefer less Mayo more mustard on
66:58 mine but for me the more fascinating
67:00 element is the social element and it's
67:03 most it's both in
67:05 an extroverted view of how would we
67:07 interact with others and have what we
67:09 dominate undiscovered land again because
67:11 we haven't had that privilege in a
67:12 really long time as mankind
67:14 everything's discovered now everything a
67:16 little island here whatever a backyard
67:19 Yemen walked into in a few years but for
67:21 the most part it's all been discovered
67:23 right
67:23 then there's the introverted policies of
67:26 okay if this particular space
67:30 organization is able to accomplish that
67:33 then it's all gonna be coveted by these
67:35 nerds in the organization they're not
67:37 gonna be transparent with the data
67:38 they're gonna possibly go off to a
67:40 paradise where they send us off to some
67:42 volcano planet right
67:43 we don't want private sector development
67:47 of space before we've had a chance to
67:49 develop in the public sector in my
67:51 opinion I think it should be just our
67:53 general rule that we actually do it as a
67:58 public sector thing remember the big
68:00 story arcs that kept reoccurring in the
68:02 Star Trek series once they started the
68:05 television series in the late 80s early
68:07 90s we got Starfleet Starfleet was I
68:10 don't think ever mentioned in the movies
68:12 or in maybe in the movies in the
68:14 eighties but I don't remember any scenes
68:15 for that it just existed you know
68:18 Captain Kirk's out there messing around
68:19 they did I don't believe another prime
68:22 directive back in the day right if you
68:23 saw a green chick it was all baby but by
68:26 the time the eighty series came around
68:28 there was you know we the Vulcans showed
68:30 up when Cochrane did the warp drive
68:33 experiment and then we started having
68:36 the Vulcans tell us what to do right now
68:39 is there a chance that would occur yeah
68:41 maybe maybe great show up maybe the
68:43 reptile show maybe the Annunaki show
68:45 back up whatever and they start saying
68:48 okay guys we got rules in space now if
68:50 that were to ever occur obviously we
68:51 would honor those rules because I'm
68:54 assuming they could police them quite
68:55 well my hunch is is that maybe we get to
69:01 do this all by ourselves
69:02 which means the more responsible we are
69:04 with our proliferation in space the more
69:07 privileges we would get when we are
69:08 discovered by someone else to say wow
69:10 you guys had enough forethought to be
69:12 polite about the universe you didn't
69:14 mess anything up you didn't go to
69:16 planets and tear them to shreds and say
69:18 oh I don't want this planet
69:19 when you go to the next one right now
69:21 let's put the final cap on this thing
69:24 which is an unfortunate reality that
69:27 could exist okay what if they're just
69:31 bad guys out in space like you're
69:33 Klingons right now from their
69:35 perspective they're not bad guys let's
69:38 just say we wander into their territory
69:39 and they're pissed off and they come at
69:43 us before they ever talk to us they just
69:45 come right at us and we forgot to do one
69:48 thing we forgot to create weapons of any
69:52 kind would that be a sad thing that we'd
69:55 have to develop to explore space is to
69:58 go around with weapons on our ship and
70:00 then as soon as we show up people are
70:02 freaked out because we have a whole
70:03 arsenal of destructive things now maybe
70:06 by sheer force were able to actually
70:10 keep weapons off of our ship they can't
70:13 destroy us they shoot a laser at us but
70:15 because we control ether we bounce that
70:17 off of our ship we just turn the ship up
70:19 of really high okay but now we've been
70:24 discovered they're on us we're on their
70:27 galactic radar system right I'll get
70:30 back to communication a second but how
70:33 can we escape can we escape in such a
70:35 way that we don't leave an ether a wave
70:37 of where we've been if you needed to
70:39 chase a boat on a lake it's pretty easy
70:42 just follow the ripples of the engine
70:44 right you'd have to find a way to go
70:46 stealth you have to find a way to just
70:48 disappear
70:49 somehow drift away is when you finally
70:51 take off you're behind a moan and they
70:53 can't see it and you get away right my
70:55 thought is they'd probably been there a
70:57 lot longer than us and they figured out
70:58 a lot of this stuff already so we'd have
71:01 to have some sort of peacekeeping
71:03 situation again what if the trillionaire
71:06 licensed the technology a hundred years
71:08 into this program of traveling the
71:10 universe and he has really bad ideas
71:11 about what to do to earth or he wants to
71:14 take over a planet that he likes more
71:15 than you do and it's long ways away it's
71:20 on the edge of the galaxy and he's just
71:22 gonna pummel the crap out of your
71:23 sovereign land whew brother you got to
71:27 play the scenario out to protect
71:29 yourself right
71:31 the thing I was gonna say about
71:32 communication which I me entered away
71:34 from was that we would need a
71:35 methodology of communicating back to
71:37 earth wouldn't we now in Hitchhiker's
71:42 Guide to the galaxy they have a
71:43 beautiful phrase called the sub-ether
71:44 wavenet and it's essentially he never
71:48 defines what it is and of course Star
71:49 Trek has several versions of this as
71:52 well but usually every science fiction
71:55 platform out there that tells stories
71:57 has some form of communicating with
71:59 earth of their home base fairly quickly
72:01 now Star Trek was actually fairly I
72:04 guess moderate in their development
72:07 technology which was again a mechanism
72:10 to create great storytelling where they
72:12 would send a message back to earth but
72:13 it was gonna take a long time to get to
72:15 earth when you watch Voyager and I guess
72:17 they're what 75 light-years away from
72:20 Earth I think you could 75 thousand I
72:24 can't remember they're really far away
72:25 it's gonna take 30 years or something to
72:27 get home they can't even send a message
72:29 back to earth it's gonna get there
72:32 before they're all dead and they're on
72:33 to the next generation on the ship if I
72:35 remember that correctly it's something
72:37 like that so we would have to find some
72:39 methodology of using ether o winds
72:43 because if that's the fundamental
72:44 particle in the universe and there's
72:46 nothing smaller we got to figure out a
72:48 way to create some sort of binary data
72:50 transmission over this fabric and we're
72:53 gonna want to make it fairly accurate
72:55 back to our planet and not back to a
72:57 bunch of other planets that might
72:58 Telegraph where we are in the universe
73:00 creating further problems for us right
73:02 so think about another subdivision one
73:05 divisions making the spaceship one
73:07 divisions making the outer spaceship
73:08 traveling system one is making the inner
73:11 spaceship traveling system one division
73:13 is completely assigned to the gravity
73:14 plate that's going to keep us alive the
73:16 other one is just trying to create a
73:17 spaceship that can house all of our food
73:20 and our supplies to make it fully
73:21 autonomous there's a little tiny ships
73:24 they're gonna go straight to the moon
73:25 and come back there's the ones are going
73:27 to go deeper into our solar system then
73:28 there's the inner inner Galactic one
73:32 it's going to go over the galaxies but
73:34 someone's going to have to create all
73:35 the other stuff the communication system
73:38 this is all done when the
73:42 you know Saturn or the Apollo project
73:44 you know came into fruition to get to
73:47 the moon which on this show we don't
73:50 believe actually occurred but at least
73:51 they theorized something right I think
73:55 it's the four second delay to send a
73:58 message to the moon and back that was
74:01 one of the biggest fallacy did in a lot
74:02 of the communications with the
74:04 astronauts one who are on the moon and
74:05 Richard Nixon makes the phone call sort
74:07 of a joke I was getting responses under
74:09 four seconds right but this is real we
74:12 want this to work don't we consequently
74:15 I heard an interesting fact I think back
74:16 in the 80s they said they wanted to
74:20 figure out how much vegetation needed to
74:23 be on a spaceship such that it would
74:25 account for one human beings breathing
74:27 it was an infinite supply what he
74:29 created
74:30 and what you breathed was one-to-one
74:33 correlation right and I think that the
74:35 number was astonishingly low I think it
74:38 was an omni magazine article and some of
74:41 you might laugh because it's sort of a
74:42 fun little rag back in the 80s but they
74:45 said that a 10 foot square healthy patch
74:48 of grass was enough to create oxygen for
74:51 one human being now of course she would
74:53 probably insulate that a little bit with
74:55 the algorithm just in case your grass
74:57 died for some reason but I truly
74:59 believed we could synthesize oxygen out
75:01 of some machine you know we could do
75:02 that and on an atomic level since it's
75:05 fairly primitive elements were working
75:07 with there especially if we could travel
75:09 through the stars what you think but now
75:12 imagine in closing imagine that every
75:16 University around the world from Caltech
75:18 to some little junior college in the
75:21 Midwest the science teachers were to
75:26 loosen up a little bit on there this is
75:28 true this is false
75:29 you know paradigms let's say they were
75:31 to allow in the conversation that there
75:33 is ether in the universe right basically
75:36 invite the students to say look if you
75:38 found a theory out there in the world
75:40 you're welcome to bring it in but over
75:43 the next year of this class we're gonna
75:46 create a side project you need to learn
75:47 physics you need to learn cosmology or
75:49 whatever astrophysics are
75:51 whatever it is you're in school for but
75:54 there's gonna be a project that this
75:56 university is going to get behind and
75:58 we're gonna fund it for 10 years every
76:01 single student that comes through is
76:03 welcome to contribute to it but we are
76:05 going to all create and our own little
76:07 little group our theory of how to get to
76:13 the moon to the to all the planets the
76:17 Stars this whole program I've discussed
76:19 on this show starts to become an
76:21 individual program at every single
76:22 College and then through the through the
76:26 notation and the mission statement of
76:28 this project we embed in it
76:31 transparency we start practicing
76:32 transparency for the very first time so
76:35 instead of Caltech hoarding all the most
76:37 brilliant people in the world away from
76:39 see again the some junior college in
76:42 Kansas or something it's all freely
76:44 distributed Cambridge does it
76:46 Oxford does the Oxford does it you know
76:50 MIT does it everyone does it around the
76:52 world in Russia and India everywhere in
76:55 the world and we say this we go look if
76:58 you violate the transparency clause
77:02 you're out of the program you're cut off
77:04 everything that you have is ceased and
77:07 not allow the other project anymore some
77:09 huge penalty of being cut out of the
77:12 program if you violate the transparency
77:15 in fact we come up with some new system
77:17 of discovery everything is videotaped
77:20 everything is put up for the world
77:22 costly you can't walk into the facility
77:24 and have a conversation in a boardroom
77:26 or drawing a draw on a board a
77:30 whiteboard or whatever without having a
77:32 video taped and put it directly out to
77:34 the Internet we protect the feeds do you
77:38 want to read the feet you're gonna have
77:39 to acknowledge who you are in this world
77:41 now we know there's lot of spying that
77:43 goes on on that kind of stuff so it
77:44 wouldn't probably be easy to police
77:46 unless the government's themselves got
77:48 behind it but let me ask you this one
77:51 little question here at the end of the
77:52 episode if that were to occur if like
77:57 was the dr. Steven Greer said like I
77:59 mentioned recently if everyone got
78:01 behind is zero-point energy project how
78:04 long would it take to create it
78:05 or would we find it's sitting on a shelf
78:07 somewhere sitting in the Patent Office
78:09 somewhere being protected and coveted
78:11 right now if someone's heard of a theory
78:14 and they go look I heard that if you do
78:16 this and that it works
78:17 let me find engine number one this one
78:20 goes am you know heard that's old some
78:23 defector out of some special project
78:24 goes you know what don't do that do this
78:26 and I know I'm supposed to be quiet
78:28 about this for twenty thirty years of my
78:29 whole life whatever been gagged would
78:31 screw it this this and this and this and
78:34 obviously we have predators who will try
78:37 to use that and weaponize it and
78:38 dominate the planet with it that's why
78:40 we have to be vigilant as citizens with
78:43 this information I don't have all the
78:44 answers I think it's just fascinating I
78:47 had this this gut feeling that if we
78:51 could get on the same program together
78:53 and harvest everything that's currently
78:56 aboveboard
78:57 that's ever been aboveboard at any point
78:59 in time it's obviously a lot of things
79:01 have been deprecated that are still true
79:02 I think we would have this solved
79:05 potentially if a child was born today
79:08 and they lived 80 years they would be
79:11 able to travel on this ship and at least
79:14 get to everything in our solar system
79:16 easy food for thought hopefully you feel
79:21 me if you haven't been to details
79:24 radio.com please go there's audio video
79:26 a locked facebook group and a patreon
79:28 page for those of you who support me in
79:30 any way shape or form thank you so much
79:32 please put your thoughts and
79:34 observations down below as mister what
79:36 does it
79:38 lyonell nation says I think it's a
79:40 brilliant statement but until then take
79:43 care of yourself in someone else and I
79:44 will see you in the next deep thoughts
79:46 over now
