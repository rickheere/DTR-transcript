00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts on this
00:36 not so freezing night
00:39 summer's coming around people as i say
00:42 that you know
00:42 probably a third of the countries
00:44 without power
00:46 do hope you guys are hanging in there
00:48 wherever you are
00:49 today i was reminiscing on youtube
00:54 because about i think about three or
00:57 four days ago
00:59 a rapper by the name of prince marky d
01:03 mysteriously passes away at 52 years old
01:06 he's in a rap band from the 80s called
01:09 the fat boys
01:12 we already lost uh daniel robinson who
01:16 was the major beat box
01:17 dude from that band 95
01:21 due to obesity and he accidentally fell
01:24 down and
01:26 couldn't get back up because he weighed
01:27 760 pounds
01:29 so this kicks off this episode which i'm
01:31 going to call burying our heroes
01:34 because isn't it a weird anomaly
01:37 someone you were a fan of and someone
01:40 you probably drew inspiration from
01:43 would be someone i would categorize as a
01:45 hero to you
01:48 you probably share several heroes
01:51 but it's a really strange thing because
01:53 it happens in different ways
01:56 the way that we lose our heroes and i
01:59 think that we reminisce in our mind
02:02 the loss of a hero differently
02:05 for different circumstances but i'm
02:07 willing to bet there's a lot of
02:08 commonality between
02:09 us and i thought it might be a real
02:11 valuable conversation
02:13 as we move on with our lives
02:16 to just talk about it because it is it
02:19 can be a very
02:21 shocking thing to your system
02:24 when these deaths occur and you wouldn't
02:27 have expected to get that information
02:29 for quite some time
02:31 the three species that i have discerned
02:34 in my own lifetime
02:35 goes something like this i'll start off
02:38 from severity
02:39 down to lack of severity to our system
02:42 still significant obviously prince marky
02:46 d dine at 52 years old
02:50 is shocking it's shocking to the system
02:52 if you know that guy was
02:54 and you know the positivity that the fat
02:56 boys brought us in the 80s
02:59 it's just like you want these
03:00 individuals to continue living
03:03 just so that they have a good life they
03:05 brought you a bunch of goodness and you
03:06 wish upon them
03:08 the same and so them dying early which
03:11 you know in this show we've got a
03:12 beautiful
03:14 beautiful transition that occurs
03:17 the transcendence uh they're in
03:19 wonderful places
03:21 but still we think that they would have
03:24 done
03:25 more if they had to continue to exist
03:27 and they would have enjoyed that
03:30 sometimes when they die very abruptly
03:33 and recently you know like in
03:35 in your time frame like when prince died
03:38 for me
03:40 absolutely sort of out of left field he
03:43 did have a
03:45 a problem on a plane they said he
03:46 actually died and got this adrenaline
03:48 shot
03:49 he was somehow playing with some
03:51 painkillers got himself in trouble
03:54 he ends up dying of a fentanyl fentanyl
03:57 injection or something
03:58 not quite sure how he took it i think he
04:02 was uh what 57 years old
04:04 boom this dude was
04:08 on a comeback for the last 10 years i
04:09 mean he was just cranking out stuff
04:11 and he'd take a little hiatus in the 90s
04:15 after he lost his son the music was his
04:18 output
04:19 his output was coming back into sort of
04:22 a style that we were all going oh that's
04:24 the prince we remember
04:25 not exactly in music species but in
04:29 kick-ass beats and melodies and singing
04:32 and just what he did right
04:34 and so with that kind of guy he's still
04:37 active he's still putting out the stuff
04:39 that you love
04:40 and all of a sudden poof it's gone
04:44 so that's the first category the really
04:46 recent ones that are still young
04:48 and neither you if they still if they
04:50 don't do what they
04:51 used to do like the fat boys didn't make
04:53 any music anymore
04:55 at least directly as that group you're
04:58 just like hey man i hope you have a
04:59 wonderful life
05:01 live long and prosper as they say
05:04 but when they get cut off in the middle
05:05 of what they're doing
05:07 wow super shocker isn't it the next
05:10 species of
05:12 current deaths that you might experience
05:15 is someone that is simply passed away
05:17 due to old age
05:18 but they were a legend in their time
05:22 and you just kind of go oh gosh they're
05:25 gone
05:27 meaning we won't see any more interviews
05:30 and for some strange reason
05:32 i don't know about you but when you find
05:35 out someone is still
05:36 alive like a dick van dyke is still
05:38 alive right now
05:39 february 2021 there's something cool
05:42 about that
05:44 dude's living forever he was this
05:46 amazing wonderful person and
05:48 he uh continues to exist we're going to
05:51 loop back on all this
05:54 the other one is a really strange one
05:56 but it happens to all of us
05:59 you discover someone in this world
06:03 who's in your past
06:06 and they were amazing in the past or
06:09 in your past but by the time you
06:13 discovered them
06:14 they were already gone
06:17 for a lot of us that would have been
06:19 someone like a jimi hendrix
06:22 you see the dude play the guitar and
06:24 you're just like
06:25 oh my god you know his guitars had souls
06:29 and he would have conversations with his
06:32 guitar
06:33 you know and their souls combined you
06:36 know and it was just this amazing
06:38 fluidity between music and the soul
06:41 emotion and sound
06:44 it's very profound and then you find out
06:48 oh my gosh you died a long time ago and
06:51 you just feel like
06:52 we got robbed we got robbed as a
06:56 society but it could be someone as far
06:59 back as a humphrey bogart or
07:01 you know a nikola tesla or someone like
07:04 that where you're just
07:05 i mean some of these folks once you look
07:06 at their photographs and it's in the
07:07 1800s
07:08 you're obviously not making any
07:10 attachment to them
07:12 so there's a really really interesting
07:14 thing if
07:16 you can do the math on a person's life
07:18 and say oh man jimmy would have been
07:19 alive
07:21 he would have been alive he would have
07:22 been old but he would have been alive we
07:24 probably would have had
07:26 50 albums out of this guy what would he
07:28 have been like during the 70s
07:30 all the way through and the 80s and the
07:32 90s who knows
07:33 how would he have taken today's music
07:36 and
07:38 spun it up to something different and
07:40 then of course we have our great
07:42 thinkers
07:44 our philosophers are incredible business
07:47 people
07:49 a steve jobs you know who
07:52 is not a anywhere close to a perfect
07:54 human being
07:56 but what he had down what he did
07:59 correctly
08:00 made the world a better place
08:03 it leaves us with this weird
08:06 feeling and it's very cathartic i mean
08:10 it has all kinds of
08:11 mixed emotions of depending on the
08:14 individual
08:16 and their contribution on a daily basis
08:18 to this world when they were alive and
08:20 in their prime
08:22 usually we see it as
08:26 excellence goodness
08:29 and i want to suggest that they are sort
08:32 of a
08:34 a pillar to community to the community
08:36 of the world
08:38 in that as long as that person's alive
08:41 something amazing is going to pop
08:43 out of them and even if the majority of
08:45 the world doesn't even know they exist
08:47 or doesn't appreciate what they do in
08:49 your circle
08:52 of influence where you allow things into
08:54 your world
08:56 they supply you with their magic
09:01 i'm gonna go with the fat boys for a
09:02 split second
09:04 for one specific reason
09:08 this band which if you watch the videos
09:10 today and you weren't a part of that era
09:11 you're going to laugh
09:13 which is part of what they wanted you to
09:14 do
09:17 all three of them were damn near my age
09:20 the oldest one i think was born in 67. i
09:22 was born in 69.
09:24 so part of it is and i didn't know how
09:27 young they were as a matter of fact
09:28 because that's how
09:29 cool j inspired me because he's just a
09:32 year and a half older than me
09:34 prince margarite died one day before his
09:37 birthday
09:38 so he would have been 53 a day later
09:41 let's give you
09:42 sort of the way my mind processes this
09:44 particular event so that you can compare
09:46 it to your own notes
09:47 of how subtle sometimes these heroes
09:50 were
09:50 in your life i had moved around the
09:54 united states
09:56 a little bit and it was always sort of
09:59 an unstable situation right where am i
10:01 going next and how long do i get to know
10:03 these friends until i get to the next
10:04 place
10:05 but by the time i turned 13 i managed to
10:07 get back to my hometown
10:09 and finish out my schooling there
10:13 and i got a car because that's the era
10:16 where i turned 14 in
10:18 in kansas in america in the 80s you
10:20 could drive
10:21 restricted at 14 to 16 16 got your full
10:24 license
10:24 you drive anywhere you want it's
10:27 interesting because a lot of states
10:28 don't have a license until you're 18
10:30 even back in the day
10:32 so i'm driving my car around i'm finally
10:35 starting to
10:36 settle i know i'm not going to be moved
10:38 anywhere else before high school is over
10:39 and i can choose to stay
10:41 go to college or i can go to california
10:43 which is what i end up doing
10:44 of course i don't have that vision at
10:45 that point in time
10:48 but 1984 they started dropping their
10:50 records
10:52 run dmc's records finally start to get
10:54 to the midwest
10:56 because def jam had done a distribution
10:58 deal with walmart
11:00 brilliant idea stop picking up these
11:03 these cassette tapes right putting them
11:05 in my car
11:07 now even though 95 of all fat boys
11:10 lyrics are just fun
11:12 classic rap stuff about how great they
11:14 are
11:15 which they were for the time they're
11:18 told i mean some people don't even know
11:19 these people existed it's nuts
11:21 and they were part of laying the
11:22 foundation for rap
11:24 such that other artists could step on
11:27 that foundation
11:29 out of brooklyn new york
11:32 but they had done a song that just never
11:34 left me
11:35 which is about staying out of jail
11:40 and they made it funny they made if they
11:42 had a lyric day it was uh
11:43 you're in jail because you failed and
11:46 today that's just the goofy little lyric
11:49 back in the day when i was 14
11:50 15 16 i'm listening to this i'm in no
11:55 i'm in no harm of getting into jail
11:58 i mean i'm just not that kind of kid all
12:00 my
12:01 crimes man were done before that
12:05 but it's still galvanized in me you know
12:08 be good
12:09 otherwise it's going to happen to you
12:11 but they did it in such a funny comical
12:13 way that i got the message
12:14 kind of wrapped in candy pardon the pun
12:19 i didn't find out until a couple of
12:20 years ago watching some documentary on
12:21 them
12:22 that the daniel robinson uh
12:26 buff or buffy who did the beatboxing had
12:28 actually passed away 95. i didn't
12:29 realize he had been gone for so long
12:32 now i'm obviously focusing a little bit
12:35 on musicians here just to make my
12:36 examples
12:38 the one thing i find amazing about
12:40 musicians that's different than
12:42 say an actor or something is that
12:45 musicians
12:47 at least used to write their own lyrics
12:51 even if they have a shadow writer today
12:53 most of what they
12:54 have are having written for them is
12:57 based on a theme they would give the
12:58 writer in the first place
13:00 and they're not going to say any lines
13:01 that they don't believe in
13:03 so what was interesting is
13:06 if you think about a band existing for a
13:08 long time which never happens
13:09 these days you're their age like i was
13:13 their age
13:14 roughly within plus or minus two years
13:17 and so as they evolved as human beings
13:21 and took in more of society and you
13:24 evolve and take in more in society you
13:27 have an opportunity there if you ever
13:29 get confused or
13:33 disenfranchised with the way society is
13:35 going sort of that no country for old
13:37 men algorithm
13:39 you can look these people up and you
13:42 know
13:42 prince marky d had a radio station uh sm
13:45 radio
13:45 radio station in florida then he started
13:47 his own podcast
13:49 and if i needed to i could reach out and
13:50 just listen to that guy
13:52 and if things are getting hot in america
13:54 or the world
13:56 and he's got a view he was a clever
13:58 lyricist to begin with so in terms of
14:00 expressing himself
14:01 he's got that power i know that i have
14:05 this
14:05 a similar frequency of understanding
14:08 information
14:10 because i was raised on them in a way
14:12 for at least a good four years
14:15 before i came to california by the time
14:17 i got to california things had changed a
14:18 little bit and they had kind of
14:20 blasted through gosh probably four
14:22 albums and they did the
14:24 disorderly's movie which is a very fun
14:27 cute movie but it's definitely not the
14:29 kind of movie watch today because it's
14:30 very goofy and very 80s
14:33 in its feel when musicians
14:37 turn into actors there's a there's a big
14:40 difference there
14:42 when elo cool j doesn't make albums as
14:44 often as he used to
14:46 well he's got to speak the lines that
14:48 are spoken for him or written for him
14:49 right
14:50 and so we no longer hear from his
14:52 opinion of anything
14:54 unless he becomes a writer and he's got
14:55 free range to do whatever is important
14:57 to him
14:58 and express himself which is why we tend
15:01 to follow these people on social media
15:02 to kind of see what they're saying in
15:03 the meantime
15:04 but we lose that connection ice cube is
15:08 now an actor
15:09 so i'm sure he cranks out a tune every
15:11 once in a while but man when he was
15:13 hitting it hard back in the day
15:15 it was waking the world up to a whole
15:17 area of
15:18 america that most kids didn't experience
15:22 now obviously has a huge influential
15:26 risk and that a bunch of kids that would
15:28 normally have turned out to be
15:30 generally good behaving kids they start
15:32 to emulate the negative
15:34 appeal of you know being tough and
15:38 they have no right of passage anymore so
15:40 they take on lyrics
15:42 that turn them into gangsters on some
15:44 occasions
15:45 and they get in trouble
15:49 and i call that a parenting issue more
15:51 than anything
15:53 but i've told you guys a hundred times
15:54 that i've watched
15:56 what's my line for several years now
15:58 probably three years
16:01 the show ran for 17 years it is going to
16:04 take me
16:06 probably another half decade at least
16:10 to watch all of the what's my line
16:11 episodes
16:13 the reason why i mentioned that show it
16:14 was a show where if you don't know
16:16 you came on the show and what's my line
16:18 means what's what's my job
16:20 like line of work there's a panelist of
16:24 four people
16:25 they guess 20 questions as to what you
16:28 do for a living if they can answer 10
16:31 questions
16:32 no they win 50 bucks which is about 500
16:35 today
16:36 then there's a secret guest which is a
16:38 famous person
16:39 the panelist has to put on blindfolds in
16:42 many cases
16:43 obviously they know these people they
16:44 know these people as a matter of just
16:46 being famous people a lot of people
16:47 actually
16:48 on the panel would know these people
16:49 personally and so they have to hide
16:51 their voice
16:52 it's really funny every episode is 30
16:55 minutes there's a whole channel on
16:56 youtube called what's my line
16:58 strongly recommend if you like any of
17:00 the old actors from back in the day or
17:02 any of the old celebrities betty white
17:04 was on that thing a hundred times
17:05 she's still alive to this day she was a
17:09 panelist she was a guest
17:10 it's tremendous right groucho marx
17:12 actually hosted the show a couple times
17:16 what i've discovered about this show
17:19 is that one i'll see all the classic
17:21 actors that i was raised on
17:24 and so you get to see them in their
17:25 prime you get to see them be funny
17:27 interact they're not reading lines
17:29 they're being their general persona self
17:32 in some cases 100 percent themselves but
17:35 what you also will find
17:36 is that there will be celebrities on the
17:39 show
17:40 who appear fairly young
17:43 and the crowd when they come out
17:45 especially for the uh
17:46 the mystery guest the audience is live
17:48 so they
17:50 they get to yell and scream fact the
17:51 beginning of saturday night live where
17:52 they say live from new york is saturday
17:54 it's actually spoof off of the 50s intro
17:57 of what's my line they'd say live from
17:59 new york it's what's my line you know
18:02 but you'll find someone young and the
18:03 whole audience is freaking out like
18:05 they're elvis presley or something
18:08 and which i don't know if elvis was ever
18:10 on the show actually
18:13 seems like he would have been everyone
18:14 else is on there i mean everyone else is
18:17 on this show who was
18:18 ever anyone ever it was a treasure
18:21 every sunday night they used to air this
18:23 show only missing a few episodes
18:25 throughout the year but you'll find a
18:28 really famous young person you're like
18:30 well how who is this person i don't even
18:31 know this person
18:32 existed man they're famous back in those
18:34 days and judging by their age they
18:36 should be alive today
18:38 sometimes you'll find that they are
18:40 alive but they simply blew through their
18:42 career really fast and that's cool
18:45 but more often than not probably three
18:47 out of five times i will find out that
18:49 they
18:50 died a very short i mean a very abrupt
18:53 life
18:53 you know they died young and that's why
18:56 i don't know that they existed
18:58 back then they were the bee's knees men
19:02 and it starts to do what it starts to
19:05 teach us about the ecosystem of
19:07 our lives now it's no mystery that we
19:11 most of us believe that death
19:13 is only a mechanism
19:16 to appreciate life in one way
19:20 while you're alive as most of you know
19:23 my philosophy of why we die
19:26 personally us me is that we live forever
19:31 and there's no way on any form of
19:34 existence that could be
19:35 treated as a trivial thing could we
19:38 exist
19:38 as an individual with the same name and
19:41 the same identity
19:42 going through history for a prolonged
19:44 period of time
19:46 if we are truly on some
19:49 celestial ball floating in space we sure
19:52 as hell don't want to live forever
19:53 because
19:54 eventually this place will disappear and
19:56 we'd only be floating in space
19:59 but we don't need to worry about the
20:00 second situation there
20:02 the one i want to emphasize now
20:06 is that old adage where someone loses
20:08 someone
20:09 close to them early
20:12 way before their time and
20:16 they typically will go through all the
20:17 grieving process but they will
20:20 undoubtedly if they have a conversation
20:23 with someone else they'll simply say
20:24 look
20:25 make sure you hug people that you love
20:28 while they're alive
20:30 tell them that you love them while
20:31 they're alive
20:33 because in one day they could be gone
20:36 forever
20:38 and it's a weird thing to deal with that
20:41 emotion now most of us don't spend any
20:45 time thinking about
20:48 the negative thing we don't think about
20:50 oh gosh i need to walk around
20:52 envisioning everyone that i know that i
20:54 love dying tomorrow
20:56 we don't want to do that to ourselves
20:57 right and we don't have the energy to do
20:59 that anyway
21:00 so what we do is we just build hopefully
21:02 a rapport
21:03 that is natural where we appreciate
21:06 people while they're alive
21:09 what's interesting about today in the
21:12 21st century is that
21:16 it used to be that
21:19 when we had that explosion of popularity
21:23 with like little richard and up and
21:26 there's definitely actors in the past
21:28 that have had this as well
21:29 but elvis presley the beatles
21:33 and then pretty much every big band
21:34 after that point
21:36 when they went into public they get
21:38 literally torn to shreds i mean
21:40 people try to steal a piece of their
21:43 which would be interesting to have the
21:45 museum of rock and roll clothing
21:47 collected from groupies over the last 70
21:50 years
21:52 where does that go i've never been to
21:53 anyone's house and they go this here's
21:55 steven tyler's jacket you know
21:57 this is elvis presley's hair but it
22:00 happened
22:02 it would happen the second that a
22:03 celebrity would leave a hotel room
22:05 the staff would go in there and try to
22:07 grab everything and then
22:09 sell it if they'd have any interest in
22:10 that artist it was really strange right
22:13 the other strange one is you will be a
22:16 fan of someone
22:19 and then you won't be a fan of someone
22:20 you grew up you changed your
22:22 your appetite for whatever it is music
22:25 acting what have you
22:27 and you have in a way
22:30 forgotten about these individuals and
22:33 then
22:34 you get the report that they had passed
22:36 away soon
22:37 i mean like early i should say
22:41 and then you're like oh my gosh you know
22:42 you're a little devastated
22:44 to hear that news but you think about it
22:46 like well i wasn't really paying
22:48 attention much to that person
22:50 like michael jackson for instance who
22:52 was
22:53 you know he'd take almost 10 years to
22:55 make any piece of music
22:57 because he just had that that ear that
23:00 said look i gotta it's got to be
23:02 utter and complete perfection before i
23:04 will call it a song
23:06 because every michael jackson song since
23:08 birth
23:10 has turned into an heirloom to the
23:12 united states of america and the rest of
23:14 the world
23:15 but he passes away in what 2009 right
23:20 and you know we're all playing his music
23:24 in parties on boats
23:27 uh in our cars what have you you know
23:29 might be working
23:31 late at night you know you put that song
23:33 on
23:35 i think that the unifying feeling that i
23:37 have when
23:38 these amazing influencers and
23:40 contributors die
23:43 is we lost a pillar of society
23:47 someone who would make everything better
23:51 and no matter if you knew what they were
23:53 or what they were doing
23:55 you just thought well out there
23:57 something good is happening
23:59 somewhere but to finish my other point
24:02 in the 21st century we have this sort of
24:05 interesting capability of getting closer
24:08 to these individuals no matter who they
24:11 are they could be professors for all you
24:12 care right
24:15 because there's instagram and
24:18 i hate to say twitter the platform of
24:20 satan
24:22 but facebook personal websites i've got
24:25 friends that can seem to find anyone's
24:27 email address it's the weirdest thing
24:28 sort of disturbing but you can get in
24:32 these dialogues
24:33 with individuals half the reason why
24:35 i've worked with
24:37 geez uh
24:40 i was going to say you know most of the
24:42 celebrities that i admire personally
24:44 before i ever got a chance to meet them
24:46 and work with them
24:48 i just reached out to them on the
24:50 internet when the internet was brand new
24:52 and so that era for a lot of celebrities
24:56 has now been protected
24:57 you can't get close to these individuals
25:00 and i guess the allure there
25:02 is very simple they are contributing to
25:05 the universe and you're enjoying their
25:07 contributions
25:08 the utter fantasy that one has to be
25:11 careful with
25:12 is we desperately want to
25:17 put something into them a conversation
25:20 a comment who knows piece of art
25:23 whatever it is
25:24 and they take that in their system add
25:27 it to their equation
25:29 and put something new out that has a
25:32 part of you in it
25:34 and when that happens it is one of the
25:36 most
25:37 amazing experiences you'll ever have
25:41 my first experience with that was with
25:43 steve jobs
25:45 i had built this weird rapport with him
25:47 through emails
25:49 using his pixar account and then
25:52 when he got back to apple i had already
25:54 been championing the reasons why one
25:57 should use their products
25:58 online had a very famous page why apple
26:01 my old domainstimulus.com which i sold
26:06 and so i had built out the reasons why
26:08 that
26:09 those products were the best
26:12 and when he got back in i used that
26:14 friendship i had with him
26:17 and i sent him a big part of the article
26:19 which was to say
26:21 the pentium was being propped up as
26:25 faster than the max
26:26 power pc line because of a megahertz
26:29 count
26:30 which if you're a race car driver just
26:32 means how fast your engine revs
26:36 now if you're even just a layman with
26:38 cars
26:39 you know that revving up a uh
26:43 a dodge dart and then roughing up a um
26:47 the top ferrari and you're both going in
26:50 fourth gear
26:51 at uh say 4000 rpm
26:54 there's a difference in your overall
26:57 experience isn't there
26:58 right one's going probably damn near 150
27:01 miles an hour
27:02 and the other one's probably going 50
27:04 miles an hour
27:06 and so i had written this article
27:09 which included the what i call the
27:11 megahertz myth
27:13 and fully outline the whole thing with a
27:15 bunch of other like
27:17 on point things you could probably use
27:18 the archive.org to find that article
27:22 and so i sent it to him and he copied he
27:24 replied to me and thanked me
27:26 and copied his vp of marketing
27:30 this is like in about march of that
27:32 particular year i
27:33 can't remember exactly what year was
27:35 it's the year that he walked onto
27:36 stage about in june i think it was
27:40 and he drops the bomb the megahertz myth
27:44 and just destroys intel's entire
27:48 leverage against him in one fell swoop
27:53 everyone in my work craft their pants
27:55 including me
27:57 after we cleaned up after a few minutes
28:00 i realized there was a game to this i
28:02 mean there was a real interaction and
28:04 and the the discipline was if i was
28:07 going to ever interact with these
28:08 amazing individuals
28:10 regardless of what they are you have to
28:12 wait till you have something of massive
28:14 substance then you have to
28:18 write it and refine it down to a
28:20 paragraph
28:21 at best and then you send it over and
28:25 you don't expect anything back and you
28:26 don't hassle them
28:28 again my regiment with steve at the time
28:30 was probably like one email every six
28:33 months
28:34 probably before that it won every year
28:36 and then eventually it developed into
28:38 something real where i ended up working
28:39 with his staff for a couple years so
28:42 that's
28:44 a huge thing that we all want to do
28:48 we want to interact with these people
28:51 and
28:51 if i may boast about you guys
28:55 for me when you post like an amazing
28:58 comment and bo i went through all of
28:59 them today
29:01 i answered dozens and dozens of
29:03 questions and comment
29:04 comment on your amazing posts for me
29:08 you guys are the celebrities
29:11 and you may not believe that i believe
29:13 that you may not believe that i can
29:14 conjure up almost the same exact feeling
29:16 i've had for the
29:17 the greats of the world for you but it's
29:20 absolutely the case when you guys blow
29:22 out a comment that's just
29:23 amazing i had a guy
29:27 forgive me for not knowing your name i
29:29 went through several comments today
29:30 but this dude made a point about the
29:34 the egyptians and the pre-dynastic stuff
29:36 and he said
29:37 isn't it weird that no hieroglyph
29:39 portrayed a pyramid
29:41 in the hieroglyph and my jaw just hit
29:44 the ground
29:44 i was just like oh my god
29:48 he had a bunch of other great points but
29:49 that comment will stick with me and
29:51 we're gonna figure out an episode for
29:52 that
29:54 here i'm watching all this uncharted x
29:56 i'm watching all the brian forrester
29:57 stuff and a thousand other videos that
29:59 have nothing to do with anyone i know
30:01 and no one's ever made that point
30:05 like that's the brain i love whoever
30:08 comes up with those
30:09 suggestions blows my mind there's
30:12 another one about non-breather aliens i
30:14 thought that was just tremendous too
30:15 a whole alien race that is called the
30:17 non-breathers because they
30:19 metabolize whatever they need out of the
30:21 universe perhaps
30:23 just great so i'm in the lap of luxury
30:26 surrounded by you guys who are
30:29 celebrities you know
30:31 and i want you to live the longest most
30:33 fulfilled
30:35 life that you can live why
30:38 for the same reason i want everyone else
30:40 to live that i would be could i convene
30:42 to you that's a famous person because
30:44 you're contributing to the world that
30:46 i'm in man
30:48 if i simply i mean it's almost like i'm
30:50 cheating i'm putting out a
30:52 episode that that triggers your brain
30:56 to dump your mad science on me man it's
30:58 like
30:59 i kind of found my source i found my
31:01 pure energy source i got my frisbee and
31:03 i'm drinking
31:05 my data disc and you know if you think
31:08 about like
31:09 how i might personally organize this
31:12 episode
31:14 it dawned on me initially to say okay
31:16 what would be the end goal emotion that
31:18 i would ever want to
31:20 stimulate in your brain
31:23 do we really want to get rid of because
31:25 it's alluring to say
31:27 i'll just fix it you know i'll say
31:29 something clever and
31:30 and when celebrities pass away or your
31:32 heroes forget celebrity i shouldn't say
31:34 a word
31:35 when heroes pass you're not gonna
31:38 be so devastated you'll be purely happy
31:40 for them and all this other stuff
31:42 man i would be doing you a disservice if
31:45 i gave you that gift
31:47 if i could even find it myself which i
31:49 won't even try to pursue it
31:52 what i'm trying to figure out how to do
31:54 is to
31:56 figure out a way to appreciate
31:59 those tough moments those
32:02 punchy in the gut moments when things
32:04 happen that are just
32:06 unexpected and you know there's a whole
32:10 another realm of loss which is our
32:12 personal family and friends
32:14 and those people could be your heroes
32:16 more than anyone in the whole planet
32:18 i think for this particular conversation
32:23 that is too personal that is too heavy
32:27 for me to address in this particular
32:29 episode so
32:31 if you're trying to quarantine your
32:32 brain i would say
32:36 the subtext would be heroes as defined
32:39 outside of your
32:41 normal day-to-day interactions
32:44 because it's that alienation it's that
32:46 it's that distance between you
32:48 and them that is the weird thing
32:52 because you know
32:55 when prince died
32:59 i was at a job interview i've said this
33:00 a hundred times i'm at a job interview
33:04 i've just talked to the hiring manager
33:05 he's cool he's like hey you got about 10
33:07 minutes before the first guy comes in
33:09 you want anything i'll just go to the
33:10 restroom
33:12 come back to my phone it's just blowing
33:14 up boom boom boom boom
33:15 i've got the whole buzzer thing off and
33:17 all that stuff
33:19 but the screen keeps giving me the
33:20 previews
33:22 that people are texting me and they're
33:23 texting the crap out of me really early
33:25 in the morning
33:26 for me anyway i'm thinking geez
33:29 you know what happened is another 911
33:31 going on or something like
33:32 open this phone and i just see one
33:36 preview piece of text going can you
33:38 believe it and then one of my other
33:39 buddies said prince died
33:42 and i'm sitting there just like i don't
33:45 know it's every movie where someone goes
33:47 through a
33:48 three second drug trip man i'm just like
33:50 what you know the hallway stretching and
33:53 you know whatever it's like being in the
33:54 tunnel of willy wonka
33:57 and i never met that man i got close to
34:00 me
34:00 once met levi caesar
34:05 i never met the guy i never contributed
34:08 to his dna other than uh
34:11 i created a chat room once that was used
34:12 by his record company as the official
34:14 prince chat room online in the late 90s
34:17 i doubt that had any uh input in his
34:19 life right
34:20 and so you sit there and you go man okay
34:23 what does this mean to me at this point
34:25 here i am
34:26 in my 40s i'm thinking you know okay
34:28 well i haven't
34:30 been a giant music guy like i used to be
34:32 in my teens where it was like your life
34:34 blood to wake up put an album on get
34:36 inspired and do amazing things
34:39 i had been definitely getting involved
34:41 with his last albums had some great
34:43 experiences with his last albums
34:45 but part of me was like okay
34:48 it's definitely an early departure for
34:51 sure
34:52 the fact that he did it with drugs or
34:55 you know nobody knows there's definitely
34:58 conspiracies around his death that i
35:00 think i'd like to have some questions
35:02 answered but
35:03 let's just say it's all official it
35:06 pisses me off that a guy that
35:08 was so adamant about you being a
35:10 vegetarian would
35:11 say don't you dare eat meat don't even
35:13 come in here after eating a hamburger go
35:14 brush your teeth and wait for now before
35:16 you walk into the steel with me but i'm
35:18 gonna shoot up fentanyl like crazy you
35:19 know
35:20 that for me was an extreme level of
35:24 hypocrisy from a man that
35:27 before hadn't been so apocryphal
35:31 which is why i have suspicions about
35:33 that death
35:35 he dies on the queen of england's
35:36 birthday
35:38 only one person's allowed to wear purple
35:40 right
35:41 there's this weird defense system that
35:44 turned on in my mind
35:45 which was you're not allowed to kill
35:49 that guy
35:49 he's not allowed to die i mean either
35:51 i'm talking to god or i'm talking to
35:53 somebody here on earth who contributed
35:55 to such a thing now i will always
35:57 believe that michael jackson was
35:58 murdered 100 percent
36:00 for one very specific reason which
36:02 nobody seems to remember
36:04 which is the story of my life the day he
36:06 died
36:07 if you watch the la news because i was
36:09 here in los angeles
36:12 they say two two individuals
36:15 ran away from his bedroom window on
36:17 surveillance camera
36:19 right at the time of death while the
36:21 doctors in the kitchen making a sandwich
36:24 lapd had that on tape and lapd lost it
36:29 oh wow sony sony got a got another one
36:33 and sony got george michael you know
36:37 making billions off these guys catalogs
36:39 right after death it's a business man in
36:41 my opinion
36:43 prince i don't know but i get this
36:46 feeling that's just defensive it's
36:48 illogical
36:49 it just says you're not allowed to take
36:52 a great person like that out of the
36:53 world
36:54 and yet prior to any one of these people
36:56 passing
36:57 we already lost tons of people early
37:02 you know i recently learned that jim
37:04 morrison hated
37:05 heroin he hated it his band members
37:07 apparently said look
37:09 you never did it and if you know
37:12 something different you let me know but
37:13 i heard a whole interview from one of
37:14 his band members that said
37:17 it was around us he hated it it
37:19 destroyed people
37:20 when it already took other people's
37:22 lives uh
37:24 he went you know definitely was like
37:25 keep that stuff away from me and then he
37:26 ods on it
37:29 and then you hear james clapper's uh
37:31 interrogation where he talks about
37:33 agents that arrange people's
37:36 overdose deaths and you're thinking wow
37:39 how old is this game
37:42 kurt cobain's death i'll never think
37:44 that was a normal thing
37:46 i wasn't a gigantic fan of his i was a
37:49 fan of his but not a gigantic fan of his
37:52 but the other interesting thing that
37:54 stems out of this because there's a few
37:56 famous people
37:58 that were so famous and there's a weird
38:01 threshold that appears to happen
38:04 and it's almost comical that if someone
38:06 gets so
38:08 famous and it's like a it's like a
38:09 threshold of how much
38:11 the percentage of the world that loves a
38:14 person
38:16 and it's also after a particular time in
38:19 history which i don't know exactly where
38:21 it is but
38:23 elvis presley tupac
38:27 and michael jackson suffer from this
38:30 other
38:30 interesting thing this like almost
38:33 psychosis
38:35 that everyone says they're still alive
38:39 it'll be 150 years after elvis death
38:43 and someone will still be saying he's
38:44 still alive you know it's strange
38:47 the poor guy from jurassic five gets
38:49 fingered as tupac recently
38:52 they do look similar it's amazing
38:54 unfortunately for everyone who loves
38:55 that conspiracy
38:57 those two guys have been in the same
38:58 room at the same time
39:01 david bowie actually had the producer
39:04 that looked
39:04 just like him appeared to have the same
39:07 teeth
39:08 as this guy same accent as this guy
39:11 when they did the bbc interview about
39:13 his death they had that guy on and no
39:15 one in the studio is saying
39:17 um so tell us about everyone thinking
39:21 you were david bowie your entire life
39:22 because you guys look identical strange
39:26 michael jackson well there's a bunch of
39:27 weird videos of
39:29 you know patty wagon going to the
39:31 hospital and someone looking just like
39:33 him
39:34 walking out of the back of the paddy
39:35 wagon
39:37 you know who knows that people are just
39:39 staging these videos to create a little
39:42 uh thing i mean imagine you just get
39:45 your buddies in a white van or something
39:47 you get some paramedic buddy of yours
39:48 and say look dude
39:49 if we can make this video you know
39:52 someone says the impersonator down off
39:54 of whatever
39:55 or you know joe he looks just like
39:57 michael in in body shape
39:59 we'll get 100 million views on this
40:01 video and we'll monetize that we got a
40:03 monetized channel already opened up and
40:05 we'll split 50 grand or whatever it is
40:08 believe me it's been done several times
40:11 by the way i falsely quoted i got i got
40:14 had by something and i repeated it on a
40:18 show
40:19 that is one of those youtube moments
40:21 where someone
40:22 cut and paste a bunch of stuff together
40:24 from the simpsons to make it look like
40:25 the duty went into the capitol building
40:27 with the horns on
40:28 was actually the janitor in some episode
40:31 that did the same thing at the capitol
40:33 building it's all stitched together in
40:34 photoshop the whole thing was fake
40:36 so it gets the best of us when we don't
40:39 police all the information that we get
40:41 i want to put a disclaimer on that one
40:44 you know it's funny i'd hear a lot and i
40:45 just heard it again recently
40:48 uh to go backwards in time quite a bit
40:52 people will talk about tesla
40:56 dying in a way that he died really early
40:58 in life and that he got taken out
41:00 and he did get hit by a car a week
41:02 before he passed
41:04 roughly but someone was like trying to
41:07 make it look like he was
41:08 he was taken out he lived like to what
41:12 84 85 years old or something like that i
41:15 mean the guy lived a long time man
41:16 you look at the last photographs of him
41:20 he was withering away it wasn't like he
41:23 was
41:24 robert redford or william shatner
41:28 william shatner's got the fountain of
41:29 youth i swear to god
41:32 that guy's about to turn 90 if he
41:34 already hasn't and
41:36 he's the youngest looking human of that
41:38 age bracket i have ever
41:40 knowingly seen it's just incredible
41:44 i think he's born in 1932 if i'm right
41:48 because there was a spock and
41:52 leonard nimoy and shatner born the same
41:54 year and the guy that played
41:56 scotty and bones they were born in the
41:58 same year 28 i believe
42:00 i got that right but we you know i think
42:02 the other part about it is
42:04 is that for those of you who can go back
42:06 a few
42:07 half centuries society was a better
42:12 thing back in the day and so what that
42:15 yielded
42:16 for us were individuals with bigger
42:19 minds
42:20 and more principles and they were simply
42:25 higher quality human beings than we get
42:27 today
42:28 at least in the realm of
42:31 they were allowed to express themselves
42:34 and their talents whether it be music or
42:35 acting or
42:36 writing or whatever science
42:39 and when they die
42:43 we we typically will say they broke the
42:45 mold right
42:47 neil degrasse tyson is no carl sagan
42:49 okay
42:51 if you like old movies for instance and
42:54 i'm willing to bet that everybody who
42:55 watches this show whether or not you
42:57 realize it or
42:57 not you love old movies
43:02 why because you got a big brain
43:05 that's why the pound-for-pound content
43:09 and the quality of the content in older
43:11 movies whether it be a comedy or drama
43:14 is dense and incredible it's at your
43:17 level
43:18 you are a mozart you increase the
43:22 the emotion within music and you
43:24 increase the
43:25 the note count in music
43:28 because that's what your brain needs you
43:31 don't want a brute force
43:33 back rub man you want
43:36 shiatsu you want acupuncture
43:39 you want the whole experience of
43:43 interacting with the human body to feel
43:46 and create
43:47 these kind of out-of-world out-of-body
43:49 experiences because it's so
43:50 amazing your brain needs massaging too
43:55 steve jobs said something that i i've
43:57 repeated on this show a couple times
43:59 for different points but it alludes back
44:03 to the quality of these beings that we
44:05 love so much
44:06 he said we don't ask the public what
44:08 they want because they don't know what
44:10 they want
44:11 they want more of the trophy best buy
44:13 crap if you ask them
44:16 so in order to innovate the future
44:18 steve's entire
44:20 pitch to all of his employees at the
44:21 creative realm was to say
44:24 we make what we want in this world that
44:26 doesn't exist in this world
44:28 and then we perfect it it just so
44:31 happens
44:31 once we're done with that experience the
44:33 world realizes
44:35 something cool has been made and then
44:37 they want to buy it
44:38 in the billions of dollars so the public
44:41 knows what they want
44:44 they just don't know that they want it
44:47 but when they see it they'll do anything
44:49 to get it like in needful things right
44:53 well that's us with most of the people
44:56 we admire
44:58 they had a need to be
45:01 who they were even if it's a
45:04 person where you might have like i did a
45:07 big dive on paul lin
45:09 because i think he's one of the most
45:10 brilliant comedian actors and even a
45:13 drama actor
45:14 dramatic actor back in the day but he
45:16 was always on bewitched he was on
45:18 um it wasn't always on bewitched
45:21 unfortunately but
45:23 he was on hollywood squares he was
45:25 always in the center right
45:27 and his quips were just utterly
45:30 masterful you can watch youtube videos
45:32 for hours with his quips man
45:34 he was a brilliant guy
45:37 but what i heard about him in this
45:39 documentary was that
45:41 he grew very um
45:45 i don't i don't know if angry is the
45:46 right word but he was sort of let down
45:48 that
45:49 even though he shined and everybody
45:51 loved exactly who he was
45:52 as he portrayed himself to us he never
45:55 quite got the
45:56 super stardom that perhaps like a jim
45:58 carrey gut
46:00 what's interesting about that when we
46:01 look back in retrospect is we go
46:04 but paul you were jim carrey you just
46:07 weren't like him
46:09 you gave us something in a place in
46:11 places
46:12 that would have been otherwise perhaps
46:15 very boring
46:17 when you find some inspirational
46:20 person in your life that's not again
46:22 family or friends
46:24 and it's very specific with this point
46:26 it's probably the easiest way to
46:28 delineate
46:28 why keeping it separate for this episode
46:30 is important
46:33 it seems like a human being is taking on
46:36 the same archetypal
46:39 introduction in your life like the ipod
46:42 did to people who love to carry music in
46:44 their pocket a thousand songs in their
46:46 pocket thing
46:48 it wasn't even conceivable that you
46:50 could carry a thousand songs in your
46:51 pocket
46:52 and then all of a sudden it not only was
46:54 conceived but it was ready to purchase
46:56 so the first time you hear about this
46:58 technology you can part with a couple
47:00 hundred bucks and have it
47:02 whoa well we hear a brand new band
47:06 which is led by whatever number of
47:08 musicians
47:10 we have a brand new actor which is a
47:12 male female term
47:14 come in to the world but then
47:18 we're blown away we just love tom hardy
47:21 or something like that these brand new
47:23 actors that come in that are like
47:25 just killing it and without them the
47:28 scripts can't get made because no one
47:29 else could take that role
47:31 someone else might have played the role
47:34 but then you wouldn't have liked the
47:35 movie
47:35 it would have been me but there is
47:37 alright that's why the 80s
47:39 for me and the 70s especially because it
47:42 was the two decades i really lived
47:44 and remember you know music was
47:48 insane in the 70s especially
47:53 you had you had bands showing up
47:56 with utterly
47:59 just blockbuster albums their first
48:02 albums are just
48:03 blockbusters and unlike today's bands
48:05 which make one album and then disappear
48:07 you know guns and roses
48:09 really made one album and then a few eps
48:12 and they were gone but you gotta
48:16 i mean how many bands do we know like
48:18 led zeppelin and
48:19 and you know gosh journey boston elo
48:22 a queen just one after the other after
48:25 the other
48:26 you know if if you didn't like every
48:27 single song you at least like half the
48:29 album
48:30 and uh two or three of the songs on the
48:33 albums would go to number
48:34 one or at least in your brain damn close
48:37 on the charts
48:40 and so and they're made out of the
48:41 highest quality
48:43 music and and lyrics and metaphor and
48:46 the people
48:47 took care of themselves as individuals
48:49 so they were almost a physical
48:52 inspiration to you in the 80s we really
48:55 got
48:56 the classic actors that are still making
48:58 movies to this day
49:01 stallone schwarzenegger um
49:04 bruce willis clint eastwood blew up
49:07 again
49:08 right he was already making spaghetti
49:09 westerns and then poof he blows up
49:13 and these people are still holding down
49:14 movies to this day
49:17 you know i walked into my writing
49:20 mentor's house one time and
49:22 within like five minutes he goes dude
49:25 here's
49:27 who are the strong males in hollywood
49:29 that could play
49:30 a strong male role this is probably
49:32 about two thousand
49:34 seven eight somewhere in there i said
49:37 what do you mean
49:38 he goes well if you subtract out all
49:41 these beta males out of hollywood
49:43 who could do what happened in the 80s
49:46 again who's left
49:49 i said oh that's heavy
49:52 because you really want to give credit
49:54 where credit's due but you're sitting
49:55 there going there's a few
49:58 i don't think tom hardy had quite blown
50:00 up in certain key roles that i would
50:02 have probably mentioned him but
50:03 he was like he goes at the time he goes
50:05 man only thing i can think it was like
50:06 nick cage
50:08 but he's getting old you know i was like
50:11 yeah he's definitely one of them
50:14 because the old heroes went away
50:17 and they do make you know uh whatever
50:20 the hell that uh i can't remember that
50:21 one
50:22 that stallone still makes sounds like
50:25 the indestructibles but it's not i
50:27 forgot the name i apologize
50:29 so when you recognize these amazing
50:31 people and whatever they do
50:35 when they disappear you almost feel like
50:38 an industry
50:40 disappeared with them perhaps the style
50:42 of music disappears prince was never
50:44 like anybody else so when he passes away
50:47 that utter snowflake
50:51 that we would call a prince song it will
50:53 never be made
50:54 except his vault's full of a ton of
50:55 music that his sister is doing an
50:57 amazing job putting out
50:58 i have to say i was very nervous about
51:01 anyone taking care of his catalogue and
51:03 i'm
51:04 for me his sister's got a straight a man
51:06 a plus
51:08 very fortunate that we have her
51:12 she's turned down some big offers to
51:14 have that music fleshed out and
51:16 perfected but that's not common is it
51:20 and what was interesting is the whole
51:21 time i mean i hate to od on prince for a
51:23 second but
51:25 the entire time i was a fan of his it
51:26 was very
51:28 uh exposed that he had this vault in the
51:32 basement of his house
51:33 which is the paisley park they had over
51:36 a thousand songs in it and i started
51:38 doing the math and i was thinking well
51:39 geez if you
51:41 if you did um 10 songs per album
51:45 then you got a 100 albums and so i
51:48 thought well
51:49 whenever we lose this guy which i was
51:51 envisioning being
51:52 much further out i mean bb king took
51:54 forever right
51:56 we were going to get 100 albums now it
51:59 turns out it's not quite that easy
52:01 because they're a bunch of beta tracks
52:02 and all that kind of stuff
52:04 not a ton of totally finished poly stuff
52:08 but it's it's pretty much good enough so
52:10 far
52:11 now the thing i want to remind us all
52:15 is that when we're in the bubble of
52:18 losing someone
52:19 that's of this particular category
52:23 not a family remember not a friend
52:27 not a personal friend and some of you
52:28 may be personal friends with your heroes
52:30 like this
52:33 there's always that moment when you feel
52:35 like you can't
52:36 digest it like you're never going to
52:39 accept
52:40 the fact that these people have moved on
52:42 early
52:43 you feel like you're going to wake up
52:44 every day and it's going to hurt
52:48 i was just talking to a friend of mine
52:50 yesterday
52:52 and there was some prince thing we were
52:54 we were reminiscing about
52:57 and she said to me she goes that one's
53:00 still too soon for me
53:02 i said yeah me too now i can listen to
53:05 his music now it's not a big issue
53:07 but there is just dial back to one that
53:09 passed
53:10 like stevie ray vaughn for me was
53:14 shocking utterly shocking again i was
53:17 practicing guitar to him
53:19 every single day for hours and hours and
53:22 hours
53:23 i would say not coming close to his
53:25 talent of course but still he was there
53:27 and
53:28 i would go between prince and
53:32 stevie trying to practice guitar and i
53:35 thought
53:35 man this is going to kill me and i
53:36 absolutely you know i've shared with you
53:39 and this year or early late last year
53:43 excuse me
53:44 an episode where i i did just recently
53:46 replay his 10-minute
53:48 voodoo child performance in texas which
53:51 was
53:52 right before his death and i sat on this
53:55 patio in the middle of like a fairly
53:58 decent day
53:59 and i didn't blubber but man i had tears
54:02 running around running down my face i
54:04 was like jesus christ we lost
54:06 this amazing man just as he was
54:10 launching thank god we got some albums
54:12 out of the guy
54:14 but it just whatever reason just hit me
54:16 like damn
54:19 too quick man but it calms down
54:22 and you'll well this way if you can
54:25 never have any casual conversation with
54:27 a friend
54:28 about one of these individuals that
54:30 inspired you who passed
54:33 and you're okay you know you're like
54:35 well you know that was the point we lost
54:36 so and so like michael jackson
54:38 we can talk about that now now when you
54:40 play his music does it hurt
54:41 sometimes yeah it does if you appreciate
54:44 his music right
54:46 just substitute your person in that
54:47 place
54:49 i think the big kicker
54:52 that i've realized in the
54:56 modern age is that there are some folks
54:59 that pass in this really peculiar place
55:02 in time where
55:05 you will do a silly piece of math
55:08 and go oh my gosh had they not died then
55:12 your life changed and got to a point
55:16 where you might have met them
55:19 in your line of work and then you could
55:22 have listened to them
55:23 i've been inspired by them you know like
55:26 i was blessed to listen to
55:29 ray bradbury speak live in ventura
55:33 california
55:34 i was sitting 10 feet from the guy wow
55:36 what a treat
55:38 i would have never thought a million
55:39 years i would have ever been in the same
55:41 place
55:42 with that gentleman and i made episodes
55:45 where i passed the wisdom
55:47 to you guys that i got from him i'm
55:50 curious if
55:52 you guys would agree as to the
55:56 i think that there's just a word i want
55:58 to use with the emotions that we have
56:00 when these things occur
56:02 given that they're not family members
56:03 and they're not friends
56:05 it's irrational
56:08 it is a weird that word just can't get
56:10 out of my head right now it is an
56:12 irrational
56:13 set of emotions that i think we have
56:16 when you
56:17 pull it down to the purity of what
56:20 you're experiencing
56:22 at least on some level now
56:25 empathetically
56:26 we wish them to have the longest life
56:28 they could possibly have don't
56:30 we so empathetically we feel for their
56:33 family members
56:34 and we feel for the loss that perhaps
56:38 we might translate as if they had stayed
56:41 they would have enjoyed it prince marky
56:44 d
56:45 definitely would have enjoyed staying
56:47 he's got family
56:50 but i think that one of the
56:54 almost blessings i guess is the mystery
56:57 of these feelings
56:59 who would we be if we were to be
57:02 sort of uh our factor brained right the
57:05 reptile brain
57:07 where it's just a matter of well people
57:10 die
57:11 that's it you know and some people will
57:13 pass away
57:14 because it's an interesting contrast
57:16 when someone passes away
57:18 that you have no invested interest in
57:22 uh for instance uh there's the
57:25 the actor that played chekov
57:28 in the new star trek series by
57:32 jj abrams seemed like a wonderful guy
57:34 i've seen him in some other films as
57:35 well
57:38 and he you know he got murdered by his
57:40 car his uh
57:41 car had a weird backup problem and he
57:43 went to go adjust the gate to his home
57:45 to close it and his vehicle backed into
57:47 him and the
57:48 perfect storm happened and he dies
57:53 now i think he was like 27 years old or
57:55 something like that
57:57 this weird magic number and uh
58:01 you just think geez that's that sucks
58:04 but i didn't have enough
58:06 experience with him as an actor to wrap
58:09 my soul around the guy
58:11 and really feel this amazing loss that i
58:13 feel for other folks of which i feel
58:15 like i grew up with
58:16 as a day-to-day piece of inspiration
58:20 and i think part of it is the
58:22 inspiration the reason why we use the
58:23 word hero
58:26 is that these individuals improved your
58:28 life however they did it they improved
58:30 your life
58:31 either they gave you just wonderful
58:33 music to augment a situation between
58:35 perhaps you and a loved one
58:37 you and your friends and it was like
58:40 that that day and
58:41 have a suit you're on the boat it's 114
58:43 out in your gym and
58:45 whatever you're jamming it's it's more i
58:48 think impactful with a solo artist like
58:50 michael jackson
58:51 and then when they pass you know that
58:53 there's no one else that can hold the
58:55 torch
58:55 he's the voice he's the the beat master
58:59 the melody master and so you lose the
59:01 whole thing when he's gone same with
59:03 prince right
59:04 but i'm just gonna i can only obsess on
59:07 the people that i know so i apologize
59:09 for reusing the same
59:11 artists and what have you in this
59:12 episode but i don't have
59:14 30 of these folks when i was going
59:17 through that
59:18 that weird puberty phase and going into
59:20 my teens where you're supposed to get
59:22 your game together as soon as possible
59:24 it's every 80s movie out there where
59:26 you've got the dork and the jock and the
59:28 the mud and all this other stuff really
59:31 like breakfast club's perfect right
59:34 i think that when i found
59:38 prince at like the age of 12 i think
59:42 his lyrics were mature
59:46 to a point because he wasn't you know
59:47 he's 10 years no sorry he's 12 years
59:49 older than me
59:51 where he was dropping his
59:54 lyrics about how to view himself
59:58 his relationship with his parents uh
60:01 his whole thing of how to come on the
60:03 chicks and turn them on
60:06 i was able to use my own version of his
60:09 game
60:10 to i believe in my mind succeed well
60:13 beyond
60:14 what i would have encountered had i just
60:17 been
60:18 without that influence i got to
60:22 jump ahead and get more out of life
60:26 because of those pieces of maturity and
60:29 eventually he became very spiritual
60:31 which also infected me so when these
60:34 people pass
60:35 you're like damn that's the dude who was
60:37 like my big brother
60:39 in a way cool jay was there too
60:42 cool j was like you know most classic
60:45 rap in the 80s was all about get your
60:46 [ __ ] together
60:47 stop making excuses and go succeed
60:52 why anyone would want to stop that
60:53 message from continuing to move through
60:56 lyrics and music is beyond me other than
60:59 you know the prison system changing rap
61:01 personally to put as many people in jail
61:04 as possible which was very very
61:05 successful
61:07 and we're still trying to kill the
61:09 glamorization of gangsterism
61:12 they're still stuck with the 90s
61:15 dudes are still wearing flannel this is
61:18 the red pill
61:19 guy who loved to death he's this
61:21 endearing guy anywhere just flannel like
61:23 it's
61:24 like it's nirvana time again do you
61:26 realize that once
61:28 flannel came in in the 90s i've said
61:30 this 100 times so i'm going to say it
61:31 again
61:33 men can't go to stores without flannel
61:35 everywhere
61:37 do you realize that up until the 90s
61:40 flannel was like something you'd find in
61:42 some camping gear place if you wanted to
61:44 dress up like a lumberjack
61:46 it wasn't fashion it was like
61:49 michael palin's singing you know i'm a
61:51 lumberjack and i'm okay you know
61:54 it's funny if monty python was they sing
61:56 that funny song i'm a lumberjack
61:59 and they're all dressed like lumberjacks
62:00 with those lumberjack hats on you know
62:02 and i'm sure that when they made that
62:04 skit in britain they had to go to a
62:06 special store to buy everyone a flannel
62:09 shirt
62:10 but today they just go into any men's
62:11 store and it's like
62:14 where do you have clothes that aren't
62:16 flannel because everything's like 90
62:18 flannel it's so pathetic man
62:22 you know say oh it's over there by the
62:23 baby blue and pink shirts you can put on
62:26 it's like men's clothing doesn't exist
62:28 anymore all right
62:30 it's a joke but i digress
62:34 so what would be a takeaway
62:37 will be a takeaway from this
62:38 conversation
62:40 i think that the the biggest tool that i
62:42 use in my life now when this kind of
62:44 thing occurs
62:46 and of course as you get older if your
62:47 heroes are
62:49 say 10 years older than you or more well
62:52 they're going to be passing away and
62:53 you're going to be alive
62:55 it's just math man but i think what we
62:58 have to do
62:58 is get good
63:03 at celebrating the life that they
63:06 had when they were here and maybe we're
63:09 not very good at it until we do it
63:11 you know a few times sometimes it's
63:13 gonna go deep it's gonna hurt
63:16 how many times have you heard people say
63:18 you know when i pass away i want there
63:20 to be a party
63:22 and sometimes it can it happens right
63:25 and you go wow we actually had a really
63:26 good party
63:28 um i don't think i've ever personally
63:31 attended anything like that
63:32 personally but it is truly the wish of
63:35 an artist
63:37 to celebrate their life you know and not
63:39 be all cry and weird
63:41 and what's interesting about it is that
63:44 i think funerals have been
63:48 designed very specifically in our lives
63:53 the elders of the universe have figured
63:55 out that we need a moment
63:57 to let as much out as we possibly can
63:59 because if we ever hold those emotions
64:01 in
64:03 it can i can personally attest okay
64:07 you can hold a sobbing cry
64:11 in for 20 years
64:15 case in point i dated a german exchange
64:19 student when i was 20 she was 18.
64:22 actually i think i turned 20 to watch
64:23 you right when she met me
64:26 and i dated her for a year were in love
64:28 we actually got engaged for a little
64:30 while
64:30 until she realized she couldn't stay in
64:32 america it was her idea
64:36 totally would have married this girl
64:38 would have been perfect
64:40 but then one day i have to take her to
64:42 lax
64:43 it's just me and her family's not there
64:47 and i'm watching this human being walk
64:50 away from me
64:52 because back then international terminal
64:55 was like all terminals today where the
64:57 passenger or the friends can't go past a
65:00 certain point right
65:01 which is right at the gate i mean right
65:03 at the front of the place right in front
65:04 of the terminal
65:06 and i'm watching her walk away and i
65:07 just gave her a hug for the very last
65:08 time but she told me she goes don't you
65:10 dare cry because you're going to make me
65:11 cry
65:12 and like an idiot well when i'm a guy so
65:15 crying in public is not my thing and
65:17 crying's
65:18 not something i do a whole lot of but uh
65:20 just for stevie ray vaughan
65:23 but she walks away and i held it in and
65:26 i thought to myself i'm gonna get to my
65:27 car i'm gonna let it go
65:29 i got to my car and i kid you not if you
65:32 were to film the scene
65:33 i'm in my mitsubishi cordia and i'm
65:36 sitting in some parking garage
65:38 and i'm just sitting there i'm sitting
65:40 there and i cannot cry
65:42 but i feel this cinder of sadness
65:46 in my chest you know i drove all the way
65:49 home which was lax to
65:51 camarillo california which is at least
65:53 an hour couldn't pull it out
65:56 never did never cried then
65:59 20 years later almost to the year
66:02 and month i contacted her through
66:06 some random friends and i finally found
66:08 her and she skyped me
66:10 and we probably talked for six months
66:13 and it even i was so happy to see her
66:15 was anything sad about that at all
66:17 but then you know over the course the
66:20 next few weeks
66:21 she's married with kids and you know her
66:23 husband actually waved to me and stuff
66:24 in the call so nothing funky happened on
66:26 the side
66:27 she's not that kind of person anyway
66:29 neither am i
66:31 but she starts sobbing on the other side
66:34 of the phone
66:35 or the skype call and the strange thing
66:38 was i
66:38 just had a natural don't cry i didn't
66:41 feel like crying it was like i had to be
66:42 there for her and support her
66:45 and then a couple days later it was my
66:47 turn
66:48 and i had no idea was coming man but
66:51 that
66:51 freaking cry that was stuck down inside
66:53 my chest for 20 years goes
66:55 boom out the door man and again it's not
66:58 a noisy cry but it's just
67:00 man you just can't stop the tears man
67:04 and we probably did that a couple times
67:07 and now we're fine we don't talk that
67:10 much anymore
67:13 i thanked her husband separately because
67:15 he was such a nice guy to help us do
67:17 that thing
67:18 but taking that little experience and
67:20 applying it to these
67:21 these losses i'm gonna say
67:25 if you are one to use that technique to
67:28 get this sorrow and this sadness and
67:30 this pain out of your chest
67:32 go wherever you're gonna go to feel
67:34 comfortable for that
67:37 and let it out and i wanna say
67:41 because i've heard this recently and i'm
67:43 trying to think
67:45 i had one sad moment in front of my
67:47 daughter once which is the funniest
67:48 thing on planet earth
67:50 i wasn't crying or anything but i was
67:51 definitely like i just got dumped by
67:53 this girl
67:54 and i'm sitting on my bed it's kind of
67:56 dusky outside my daughter's running
67:58 around the house
67:59 and she comes up to me and hops up on
68:01 the bed it comes right up on my chest
68:03 and she goes
68:05 you know she touches my face she's like
68:07 what's wrong
68:08 i thought oh my god this is one of the
68:10 most endearing moments of my life that
68:12 my kid can read my freaking mind at like
68:14 two
68:16 and uh i said uh
68:21 i think i'd cut myself shaving as well
68:24 and i think she thought that that little
68:26 little piece of paper you put on your
68:27 face a little blood dot in it
68:29 was the reason why i was feeling bad
68:31 right and she looks at me
68:33 real seriously she goes you got to stop
68:35 shaking
68:37 i said what and she takes her little
68:39 hands up she goes you gotta stop shaking
68:42 she was trying to say you gotta stop
68:44 shaving
68:46 because you cut yourself and that's
68:47 what's making you sad
68:49 absolutely hilarious moment but
68:52 my point about this is the following
68:55 i have recently heard probably two
68:58 people say
68:59 over the course of maybe in the last
69:01 three months just random conversations
69:03 i'm listening to
69:06 someone say that was the first time or
69:08 the only time i ever saw my father cry
69:10 or my mother crying
69:11 usually it's more dramatic obviously
69:13 with the father so if you're a dude and
69:15 you're like man i don't want to
69:16 have an emotional moment around my kid
69:20 what's interesting about it is that when
69:22 i hear kids who are now
69:23 grown adults in their 50s talk about
69:26 those
69:26 really poignant moments where you got
69:29 their parents got so overtaken by
69:31 emotion
69:33 there's a great love and respect and
69:36 humanity that your kid
69:40 will eventually develop for your moment
69:43 of sadness and if you're crying all over
69:44 the house all the time
69:45 it's probably gonna go the opposite
69:46 direction but if you have a real genuine
69:48 moment of hurt
69:51 you don't need to fear
69:54 letting it out in front of your kids
69:56 every once in a while you don't want to
69:57 do it on purpose because they may be
69:58 freaking out like why is daddy crying
69:59 especially if they're too young
70:02 but if you're like like my dad you know
70:04 when he he lost elvis man
70:06 i cannot believe that he didn't let out
70:09 a tear i just can't believe it
70:11 i mean i'm sure my father
70:15 found in elvis what i found in prince
70:17 you know he's like he's just a cool
70:19 abstaining guy
70:20 and i wasn't a part of that eras i don't
70:23 know
70:24 exactly what he felt but when i was in
70:25 the car with him real late one night
70:27 and he turns the radio and we have to
70:29 drive 27 miles home from his
70:30 photoshop or his photo studio he turns
70:33 the radio on and boom they set it and he
70:35 goes
70:36 what and he grabs the volume and turns
70:38 it up and it was just a silent drive all
70:40 the way home
70:40 as we're listening to the radio i mean
70:43 here they are pulling it on thick man
70:45 they're
70:45 playing his music they're talking about
70:47 amazing he was and this dude's just
70:48 driving her car and i'm thinking
70:50 when i look back i'm like my dad
70:53 definitely plays the tough guy
70:55 but he's he's got a good soul inside
70:58 where
70:58 i know he feels emotion and i just
71:00 wonder if he ever broke down
71:01 i should ask him but now maybe in
71:05 closing
71:05 one of the interesting ways to look at
71:07 it
71:08 is that uh we're calling them heroes
71:12 in this episode so they're an external
71:15 person to your family and friends
71:16 circuit
71:17 and they're your heroes man which means
71:20 they gave you something
71:22 that you accepted and you embed it in
71:25 your system
71:27 and now you are a part of them think
71:30 about
71:32 uh gosh we could even use fictional
71:34 movies
71:35 uh let's see the most esoteric one i
71:38 could mention would be dark crystal
71:41 or at the beginning of the movie this
71:43 gelfling
71:44 character goes up to his elder which is
71:47 this kind of hunched over
71:48 bizarre looking character and he tells
71:52 him what he needs to do
71:53 you go do this
71:56 and then the dude just vanishes he's
71:58 kind of like
71:59 just just sinks into his ground
72:03 he disappears and his clothing's the
72:04 only thing that's there and so the kid
72:06 starts on his journey
72:07 and that's the beginning of the film in
72:09 star wars we obviously have
72:12 yoda eventually passing and luke's gotta
72:16 take what he learned from yoda and go
72:18 for it you know a little easier for luke
72:20 because he can see ghosts and stuff for
72:22 these individuals
72:24 but any time in history where your
72:26 heroes pass away
72:28 whether you know them or not there's a
72:32 baton that's happening
72:33 isn't it it's sort of your
72:36 rite of passage whenever it occurs
72:40 and you know when i lost some really
72:42 good friends in high school
72:44 and after high school i felt like i had
72:48 to hold the baton down for those
72:50 individuals they didn't get to live
72:51 their lives past
72:53 you know 19 years old and here i am
72:55 going
72:56 okay i got a big plan here and it's
72:59 it's i don't know what the hell is going
73:01 to happen but for my friend randy
73:03 martinez i'm gonna take his life and go
73:06 we're going to california man come on
73:08 let's do this
73:09 whether it be him actually being with me
73:12 or
73:13 me just carrying him inside me he was
73:16 one of the coolest
73:17 most dapper amazing soft-spoken guys
73:20 he's the second guy
73:21 that inspired me to be that way and so
73:25 i embedded him in me way before i lost
73:28 him
73:29 but definitely doubled down after i lost
73:30 him i mean i was thinking about that guy
73:33 every day for 10 years
73:36 and so i honor him as best i can by
73:40 being someone that he would be proud of
73:42 that makes me feel better prince went
73:45 through all kinds of phases of his life
73:47 where he was
73:48 saying all kinds of dirty words as part
73:50 of his song titles as well as
73:52 in the lyrics and then he got fairly
73:54 religious he became a jehovah's witness
73:56 which you won't find me being probably
73:58 any time in my life
73:59 but he was a god-fearing man he believed
74:02 in
74:04 the the you know every year he seemed to
74:06 get older
74:07 after about 1990 he just became a softer
74:10 more amazing soul
74:14 i'll never be that refined in the near
74:16 future
74:17 but maybe eventually i'll get to that
74:19 point
74:20 uh the one thing i got from the comments
74:22 today several times and several comments
74:25 and
74:25 there's no way for me to easily
74:28 allow you to see these because they're
74:30 in a bunch of different videos bunch of
74:31 people are going through a ton of videos
74:33 which i love because they're giving me
74:36 all this input
74:37 it's crazy i need more episode ideas so
74:39 it's perfect timing but so many people
74:43 said one way or another
74:47 that all of you to you are their peeps
74:51 you know people would i it's hard to
74:54 describe but they would talk
74:56 like one person commenting is talking
74:57 about the rest of you commenting and
74:59 complimenting all of you
75:02 sort of because i found my clan i found
75:04 folks that think deep
75:07 and of course we do this differently
75:09 maybe i'm a unifying tone on a little
75:12 uh tuning bar for the
75:15 hour that you watch this but you go away
75:17 and you become your own person
75:19 100 but i think we want a bunch of us
75:23 don't we you know and i think that the
75:26 other thing is that
75:27 we don't realize it sometimes but we are
75:30 other people's heroes and
75:33 it's more personal of course it would be
75:36 you're going down into that friend
75:37 circle down into that family circle
75:39 you are inspirational to your cousin
75:42 your nephew
75:43 your aunt your uncle your brother your
75:44 sister and sometimes
75:46 the closer the relative gets the less
75:49 they're likely to tell you because
75:51 sometimes they have a little bit of an
75:52 ego barrier but in the end
75:54 they listen to you and if you've had
75:56 kids
75:57 you'll have that whole thing of like
75:58 heal me now listen to me later
76:00 it happens like that you'll be given
76:02 some advice and the kid's just like
76:05 i want your advice and then you find out
76:08 two months later they're doing exactly
76:09 what you said and they're succeeding and
76:11 they're even twisting a little bit
76:12 better than you gave it to them
76:15 all of this just highlights the value of
76:18 all of us to all of us doesn't it
76:23 i think that man is because society is
76:25 still being run by a bunch of nuts
76:28 we don't get a chance to
76:32 smell the flowers as it were and wear
76:35 the flowers
76:36 we don't get to smell it all the time
76:40 because we're so preoccupied with paying
76:42 a bill
76:43 or trying to keep up with the the
76:46 joneses or what have you keeping up
76:48 appearances
76:50 yeah that's part of what heroes are
76:53 about they
76:54 they help you mitigate these weird
76:56 situations
76:59 and what's crazy is you know in this
77:01 particular show i'm blessed to get all
77:03 of your feedback personally
77:06 if you read the comments you'll get it
77:07 too our facebook page is pretty badass
77:10 too
77:11 you're potentially making a comment
77:14 every once in a while or i'm making a
77:15 comment an episode which is
77:17 about you know astrophysics way off on
77:20 the left field of your life
77:22 but just like the reason why they make
77:25 you take algebra
77:27 algebra is something i've never used in
77:30 my professional life
77:31 trigonometry definitely but algebra not
77:34 once man not once and you can make video
77:37 games all day long with barely using any
77:41 now but that taught me how to think
77:44 right so simplifying things simplifying
77:48 things down
77:49 is the huge investment that that gives
77:53 you and
77:54 the schools are so stupid okay
77:58 they don't tell kids this on the first
77:59 day the reason why you're going to take
78:01 this class and because reiteration and
78:03 reiteration is so important for kids and
78:05 all of us
78:07 they need to say this about every i
78:09 don't know 10th class
78:10 a class why are we taking this class
78:13 because it teaches us how to think
78:14 yes how does it teach you how to think
78:17 you know it's refinement and
78:18 simplification
78:20 taking something super complex and
78:21 making it super easy that's not only
78:24 a mathematical game but it's how your
78:26 brain works it's how you might
78:28 refine your language to say the fewest
78:31 amount of words the least amount of
78:32 words wow
78:34 the least amount of words and have the
78:36 same exact meaning as saying this huge
78:37 paragraph or even maybe
78:40 a more profound statement
78:43 anyway i could probably ramble on for
78:45 days about this but i won't
78:47 as always super interested in your take
78:50 on this one this one is one that
78:52 i think that even i have struggled with
78:55 a lot and not been able to identify that
78:58 i've been struggling with this
79:00 whole situation that's why when
79:04 you know people rush to social media to
79:06 report someone is dead
79:09 when ello cool j posted that prince
79:11 marky d
79:12 passed away i know l.l coolidge has got
79:15 a connection with prince marky d
79:16 i know that there is a huge soul
79:19 connection with those two individuals
79:22 makes sense to me but when random person
79:27 just is always that first person to say
79:29 this person died this person that that
79:31 person died it's like okay
79:32 not a single sentence about how these
79:34 people touch their lives
79:36 i think that that's a bad game so if you
79:40 ever do post something like that
79:41 on social media let me just give you a
79:43 piece of advice
79:45 write a sentence write a sentence of why
79:47 this touched you
79:48 why would that person passing touched
79:49 you you'll find out what's in your own
79:51 soul
79:52 as you construct that sentence and i
79:54 totally understand needing to
79:56 just put it out there with you're really
79:59 hurt by that loss and you're like come
80:01 on everyone
80:02 come to the table let's all talk about
80:03 this because i can't deal with this
80:05 right now
80:06 give me your greatest story of how this
80:09 person touched your life
80:11 and on that note if you haven't been to
