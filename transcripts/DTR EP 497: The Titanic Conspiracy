00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen the
00:31 deep thoughts so we're finally here
00:35 we're finally here at the Titanic
00:37 episode
00:39 I'm gonna wanted to do this forever when
00:41 I first heard this story it blew my mind
00:45 and what's really cool about it is the
00:47 evidence just got conclusive and what's
00:51 gonna be funny is anybody who tries to
00:52 deny this I'm gonna show a photograph at
00:54 the very very end that will just fix it
00:58 all for everybody
00:59 many of us I think every human being on
01:02 planet earth regardless of your age
01:04 you've been taught this romantic story
01:06 about the largest ship ever built called
01:09 the Titanic and how on its maiden voyage
01:13 leaving from was it uh Southampton
01:22 England headed for the United States it
01:29 runs into an iceberg terrorists big
01:32 stripped down the side of the hole and
01:35 then it took on water and of course the
01:38 romantic story is that the captain
01:40 thought ah man it's the Titanic no way
01:42 could this possibly ever sink and
01:44 eventually of course it sings a bunch of
01:45 people died a bunch of people survived
01:47 rich people survived poor immigrants
01:50 died down below and then what's
01:53 interesting for young people who don't
01:55 remember well Bernie no not don't
01:58 remember but you didn't experience this
02:01 mmm everyone over 50 I don't remember
02:05 when they found it I would say probably
02:07 everyone over 40 we didn't know where
02:10 the thing was was at the bottom of the
02:12 ocean it would nowhere and then
02:14 eventually someone found a James Cameron
02:17 went down and looked at it and all this
02:18 other stuff and that was pretty much the
02:22 end of it you know a few Titanic
02:24 specials on TV and the evidence I'm
02:29 gonna report in this episode should if
02:33 you've never heard this theory you're
02:34 gonna have the best time of your life if
02:36 you heard this theory I'm gonna update
02:38 you with um I think just conclusive
02:42 stuff I found in some videos some other
02:44 reading it has not been debunked I'm
02:48 gonna talk about a debunking
02:50 special I saw on TV which was the
02:53 biggest bunch of BS I've ever seen in my
02:55 life
02:56 and we'll show you how they did that I
03:00 don't know if I could find the frames
03:02 from that thing I probably can't yep and
03:05 I do want to put a footnote in real
03:07 quick some people say you know why don't
03:08 you put more photos in your videos under
03:10 there's a very strategic reason why
03:12 sometimes it's sheer busyness on my part
03:15 but most the time it's because I think
03:17 that the just the way that the music
03:20 industry was allowing sampling to occur
03:22 as soon as they figured out how to do it
03:24 and then eventually everyone had to pay
03:26 for their samples you're going to have
03:29 censorship that's going to kill a bunch
03:32 of videos out there because they use a
03:33 frame from someone else's content and
03:35 I've done it right and there might be
03:37 videos that are removed but imagine you
03:39 know a frame of a movie is forbidden to
03:43 be to be used so I try to keep it down
03:47 to some pretty easy images these days
03:50 but okay what where does this all begin
03:55 well there's a company called White Star
03:58 owned by a look guy you might know
04:01 called JP Morgan and they set out to
04:05 create two ships that were utterly
04:09 identical except for a few things and
04:13 we'll get into those differences just a
04:15 little bit down the line here because it
04:18 won't make much sense to you right at
04:19 the beginning but one was called the
04:23 Olympic and it was finished first looked
04:26 exactly like the Titanic - a couple
04:28 little things and then there was another
04:30 ship second called the Titanic from the
04:34 white star passenger company now the
04:42 Olympic because it set sail first it
04:48 immediately had a collision with a
04:50 tugboat destroy the tugboat and slightly
04:55 hurt the ship and then it runs into a
04:58 what comes like a battleship from back
05:01 in the day called the hawk
05:04 and it severely injures the hawk and
05:09 then when they looked at the you know
05:11 cause and all that kind of stuff
05:13 it of course white stars saying it's the
05:17 Hawks fault but the people who serve the
05:20 insurance company said no no no it was
05:22 the Olympics well you've already bumped
05:24 into a tugboat you're a [ __ ]
05:26 those are done we're going to get into
05:27 the captain as well and then they kind
05:31 of patch it up a little bit and then
05:32 they take it on another trip and they
05:35 run into a shipwreck down below and they
05:39 hurt the ship again
05:41 so three huge wrecks on this Olympic
05:44 finally when they finally said you know
05:46 hey what-what are we gonna do to fix
05:52 this ship to make it seaworthy again and
05:55 I said you're gonna have to open the
05:59 ship up and replace its frame a little
06:03 problem there but the theory is is that
06:07 we're gonna get into all the facts
06:09 you're gonna go through this is because
06:11 the Olympic was so screwed up and they
06:14 were out of money
06:15 each ship cost ten million dollars to
06:18 make yeah I mean you know they had money
06:21 but the come on it's adventure you're
06:23 gonna have to you know all businessmen
06:27 have limits right so the theory is that
06:30 they swapped the boats and you might be
06:35 like what well they look almost
06:37 identical the there there are two things
06:43 about the boats that are physically
06:45 different although in photographs men I
06:47 can't find the second one but we're
06:49 gonna bump around the very end here with
06:52 at the very end this other debunking
06:55 video I saw which was utterly laughable
06:57 and the fact that the guy accepted what
06:59 he saw was ridiculous the guy researched
07:01 us for over 30 years and he was brought
07:03 in to some museum or something and we'll
07:06 get to that a little bit later but if
07:09 you were to take the ship and pretty
07:10 much divided it down the middle
07:12 the front half of the ship had two
07:15 things differ
07:17 and again photographs I can't tell the
07:21 second thing I'm gonna say but the one
07:23 you can definitely tell is that the
07:24 windows on the side of the shipment for
07:27 the Titanic or twice as wide they're
07:30 very thin windows but they're twice as
07:32 wide on the Titanic meaning when you
07:35 open them the hole that you look at it
07:38 was twice as big
07:39 now we're talking probably I don't know
07:43 you know that the pictures are from
07:44 really far away but let's just say the
07:47 Olympics windows open to 12 inches that
07:50 would mean that the Titanic's opened up
07:52 24 inches something like that very
07:56 visible in the photographs
07:58 now the other one that was reported
08:00 later was that you know how ships have
08:03 the hull and then they have a deck and
08:04 then they have the part where the really
08:06 fancy passenger compartments go and then
08:08 they have the captain's sort of you know
08:10 deck up above they say that one of the
08:15 ships had a curved front piece of steel
08:18 I guess offering a little more real
08:20 estate and one of them had a flat design
08:24 it's a little less real estate at that
08:26 level can't see it in the photographs
08:28 that I've seen but then again the
08:30 Olympic has very few photographs is the
08:32 problem but there are photographs of
08:33 both of these boats in a port together
08:36 this conspiracy is going to start with a
08:42 very basic concept of insurance fraud
08:45 and then it's going to end with a
08:50 facilitation of the Federal Reserve Bank
08:52 in the United States of America and
08:56 where he gets all that so as I said
09:00 right after the Olympic is deployed for
09:03 its first maiden voyage within a week it
09:05 hits this tugboat just cream in the
09:07 tugboat September 20th 1911 the Olympic
09:13 has another accident with the HMS Hawke
09:16 again they argued about whose fault it
09:19 was but of course you're always gonna
09:21 say it's not you because you're gonna to
09:22 pay a ton of money but the whoever was
09:25 presiding over the accident claim on
09:28 behalf of the people I guess said no no
09:31 is the
09:31 pekes fault the hawk was really bad off
09:36 I mean the front of it was just caved in
09:38 really bad and it was a British inquiry
09:43 just so that you know the Hamptons over
09:45 there
09:46 so immediately because the British
09:50 inquiry with the collision with the hawk
09:52 white star was found liable and had to
09:56 pay money to the hawk and I can't find a
09:59 number for that those damages but then
10:01 they're losing more money right I
10:03 haven't finished the Titanic yet and
10:05 they're out a bunch of cash having to
10:06 fix the Olympic and pay for damages
10:08 right February 28 1912 that's when it
10:14 hit the shipwreck which is kind of a
10:17 bummer right I mean you almost know no I
10:19 don't know how easy it is to know where
10:21 shipwrecks are and in various regions
10:23 it wasn't the internet days with GPS and
10:26 all these trackers and stuff we could
10:28 just say this is where all the space
10:29 junk is in space and don't add anything
10:31 okay when it hit the shipwreck we it was
10:40 a very fortuitous thing for this theory
10:43 to become solidified now usually a
10:46 propeller on a ship takes about five
10:49 hours to replace as I'm told but since
10:55 this propeller is so utterly massive on
10:57 back of one of these ships when they hit
11:00 the shipwreck it damaged the propeller
11:02 and a damaged propeller has got all
11:05 kinds of issues if it's if it's not
11:06 balanced perfectly the ship will wobble
11:09 it won't be able to hit speeds it's
11:11 going to start shaking all the the
11:13 innards of the ship and the ball
11:15 bearings and everything it just doesn't
11:16 work so you have to replace it well they
11:21 don't want the Olympic to be out of
11:23 commission for a long time as they build
11:26 this new propeller but to their benefit
11:30 they have a copy ship that is right
11:34 there so they take the propeller off of
11:38 the Titanic and they put it on the
11:41 Olympic and there's a little number on
11:44 the propeller
11:45 number 401 so that has been stuck on the
11:49 Olympic remember that number start that
11:54 so this point we have all this damage
11:56 we've got a liable case to the HMS Hawke
12:00 they've had to replace a propeller
12:03 propeller excuse me they've got you know
12:05 somebody claiming there and have to cut
12:07 the ship in half and put a new frame
12:08 inside I mean just think about that
12:10 that's huge rate so they're up to their
12:13 butt in bills debt in the only way to
12:17 really feasibly recoup all this money is
12:20 to run both ships full steam all day
12:23 long with paying passengers free cargo
12:26 whatever but the Olympic is sort of just
12:30 holding together by a by a thread now
12:35 you might ask yourself how the hell
12:37 could they possibly swap ships how could
12:41 you possibly do it but this point very
12:44 few people have sailed on a ship so it's
12:46 not like everybody has it in the back of
12:48 their mind but the ships are physically
12:50 identical except for those two things
12:51 and half the people I've read through
12:54 don't have any clue about the supposed
12:56 bow shaped front piece on the front of
13:00 the of the captain's deck again I
13:04 examine the photographs again today try
13:06 and see it and I'm telling you both of
13:08 them look flat to me I think that's part
13:13 of a second conspiracy we're gonna get
13:15 to in the end here but what the White
13:17 Star Company did was that the only
13:21 places where the ship's name is
13:24 indicated anywhere on the on the vehicle
13:27 that's actually permanently attached the
13:30 vehicle I mean get this this is true
13:33 story true fact is the nameplate on the
13:36 front of the ship it's a nameplate and
13:39 it's usually etched into the hull to
13:41 ship but they had plaques that were
13:44 bolted on and this is a great thing it's
13:49 gonna be a great thing in the future of
13:51 our story here so in the middle of the
13:54 night we think they swapped the plaques
13:58 okay what else has got the name of the
14:00 ship on it well believe it or not the
14:03 only two things outside of the plaque
14:05 totaling three things as if the
14:08 lifeboats and the lifejackets have the
14:11 name of the ship on it everything else
14:14 inside both ships just said white star
14:17 on it keeping it nice and generic thus
14:21 facilitating the swap now it might be
14:25 worth noting but here we have official
14:30 facts
14:32 okay the official story facts they're
14:34 all these things about the Olympic and
14:35 you never even heard of the Olympic
14:36 great you never heard of it I never
14:38 heard of it the Titanic sank there's a
14:40 whole movie about it James Cameron made
14:42 it right I made a [ __ ] ton of money they
14:44 never mentioned the Olympic I mean I
14:46 don't remember the movie maybe it was in
14:48 the beginning not my kind of phone guys
14:51 okay well that limp ik without any
14:55 repairs at all continued in service for
14:58 25 years until it was commissioned by
15:01 the British government hmm how is it
15:06 possible that you basically have a
15:07 salvage ship any of you know about
15:09 salvaged cars you can go get a car at a
15:13 junkyard where they've literally cut the
15:16 back half of a car off that was hit from
15:18 the rear keep the front cut the another
15:22 car in half the same exact year and
15:24 model get rid of the front half that's
15:25 been impacted in the front and the weld
15:27 the two halves together and several
15:30 friends have these cars named one fine
15:32 you just wouldn't want to be in a super
15:34 high impact collision in them so the
15:38 Olympic had basically that version of a
15:40 problem but the frame needed to be
15:43 replaced but supposedly it runs for 25
15:47 years full profit no problem mm-hmm
15:52 so before we get into the actual night
15:56 of it's important that you understand
15:58 something now many of you who understand
16:02 the Federal Reserve story have heard
16:04 about the Jekyll Island meeting was it
16:07 bill still
16:09 is literally a god when it comes to this
16:11 information
16:12 he created the amazing three and a half
16:14 hour series called the money changers
16:17 little Paul Harvey there he got
16:19 completely screwed by the guy that
16:20 actually duplicated and published the
16:22 discs and he barely he doesn't make any
16:25 money from that and almost never did
16:27 back in the day because he got screwed
16:28 so he went off and created a Jekyll
16:31 Island movie that if you haven't seen it
16:32 just look a bill still and I think is
16:34 probably bill still calm haven't seen
16:36 him for a long time he's a real
16:38 journalist but he taught us all about
16:40 how the money changers do what they do
16:43 but there was a meeting and some very
16:48 powerful people got together the names
16:51 are Paul Warburg senator Nelson Aldrich
16:56 Frank Vanderlip Benjamin strong Henry
17:00 Davidson Charles Norton and Abe Andrews
17:03 they all met to plan the Federal Reserve
17:07 Federal Reserve was obviously what we
17:10 have today
17:11 it just went gov recently we're hoping
17:13 that means there's giant changes coming
17:15 with Treasury notes to replace their
17:17 fake paper what they were gonna do
17:20 though is obviously take us off the gold
17:22 standard print fantasy money just like
17:24 monopoly money they were never going to
17:27 create the interest money that we're
17:29 gonna oh every time we have them make us
17:31 money so it's a Ponzi scheme we can
17:32 never pay back the loan because there's
17:35 never enough money created to pay off
17:37 the loan that we we have they took all
17:39 of our gold as collateral
17:41 it's all been removed from Fort Knox and
17:44 they invented the IRS which is a whole
17:48 gaggle of police officers or to come
17:50 steal your stuff although I have to say
17:52 I've never personally known anyone
17:54 that's ever had that happen they knew
17:57 our Constitution forbid taxes from ever
18:00 being collected off the people unless it
18:03 was an apportioned taxed which means
18:06 everyone is the same rate which we never
18:08 have so inside the tax code it says is
18:11 voluntary but their argument is well if
18:15 traffic lights voluntary to which is not
18:18 it's a look it's there's a law and a
18:19 statute says you gotta stop at a red
18:21 light
18:21 so that's where the Tea Party came up in
18:24 the United States with 3,600 X IRS
18:27 agents it said this is complete fraud
18:28 you don't have to pay taxes on your on
18:31 your personal property then people like
18:33 Wesley Snipes learn that tried to do it
18:36 and they put him in jail so they control
18:41 the judges you can never bring any
18:43 evidence in some people have won cases
18:44 against them but up until 1913 in the
18:48 United States of America
18:49 corporations firearms and tobacco
18:52 paid all the taxes for America and we
18:55 were just fine what they did was is in
18:58 Jekyll Island they plan to give
19:00 themselves infinite tax breaks on the
19:02 corporate level firearms in tobacco can
19:05 still be taxed attacks more and more and
19:07 more these days but all went on the back
19:09 of the people the people were sold a
19:12 Robin Hood story of the exact opposite
19:14 and within a year they had raised over
19:17 350 million dollars in 1913 it was never
19:20 ratified in all 50 states
19:22 meaning approved three states reported
19:25 up being held at gunpoint on Christmas
19:27 Eve I think which is Pennsylvania
19:32 Oklahoma in Kentucky I think but there's
19:35 other states too but once the 16th
19:39 amendment in America was falsely
19:41 ratified America was in big trouble and
19:44 we've been in big trouble ever since so
19:47 this is a big event but they had this
19:49 meeting fortunately there were three
19:53 representatives who were also
19:54 millionaires they're from America John
19:59 Jacob Astor Benjamin Guggenheim and
20:02 Isidor Straus they were at the meetings
20:06 and they said this is [ __ ] we're not
20:09 letting you do this to America we've
20:10 already been there before this is why
20:12 America was invented because of these
20:14 Ponzi schemes and you know when whoever
20:16 controls the money controls everything
20:18 you've tried it all you know several
20:20 times in the late 1700s the war of 1812
20:24 only ended because we agreed to do a
20:27 temporary version of the federal reserve
20:30 but they had been trying in the 1890s
20:33 they installed there
20:35 our attorney she'll Philander Knox who's
20:37 for Knox is actually named after not the
20:40 Navy admiral they give you that story
20:42 about and then Taft the first Skull and
20:46 Bones president tried to get it passed
20:48 during his term couldn't get it passed
20:51 and so they went and suckered a history
20:53 professor Woodrow Wilson who had a
20:56 handler on him and they got it falsely
20:59 ratified using yellow journalism from
21:01 the Hearst Corporation to tell everybody
21:03 was ratified then everyone just accepted
21:05 it of course they spun it really
21:06 positive I liked the press today Woodrow
21:10 Wilson was known as dying in his
21:12 backyard of kind of dementia saying I
21:15 think I just sold my country out and he
21:17 was right that's why presidents have to
21:19 have business savvy not just be people
21:23 out of thin air for a particular race or
21:26 gender you have to have business acumen
21:29 to run a business like a country because
21:32 we are all financially bound and
21:34 finances are the way that a country is
21:37 rated as being strong in the 21st
21:39 century didn't used to be that way used
21:41 to be music and culture and art and
21:43 invention and science and product
21:46 creation and that kind of thing but now
21:48 it's all devolved down to money some
21:51 people criticize presidents for running
21:53 countries like companies the ridiculous
21:56 and that's why you have so much
21:58 socialism and that kind of stuff so this
22:05 South Hampton ship is about to set sail
22:09 for America on its maiden voyage and
22:14 those three guys were on the ship hmm
22:17 none of the other guys from Jekyll
22:20 Island were on the ship JP Morgan was
22:23 supposed to be on the ship claimed he
22:26 had the flu consequently 50 of his
22:29 employees were supposed to be on the
22:31 ship in 50 out of 50 also were sick in
22:35 fact a ton of people who were supposed
22:39 to be in first class called in sick so
22:42 the boat was estimated to be about half
22:44 empty including first class
22:48 GP morgen I've heard several stories
22:51 about where he was the night of they
22:53 said he was at the Moulin Rouge in Paris
22:56 a couple days later he was photographed
22:58 with his mistress in Paris no little
23:02 facto it was the JP Morgan was gonna be
23:06 shipping a bunch of very valuable bronze
23:09 statues to America on the Titanic well
23:15 he had them all removed from the ship
23:17 they were on the ship as reported and he
23:20 had him removed from the ship hmm sounds
23:24 like maybe he knew what was gonna happen
23:27 in addition there was very little
23:29 publicity to sell tickets to get on this
23:33 ship remember when I was a kid it was
23:36 billed as the biggest ship in the world
23:37 hence all the little cliches and claims
23:44 of you know it's a Titanic proportion
23:46 you know another thing that was peculiar
23:51 well because of all these cancellations
23:53 in first-class by some of the richest
23:55 people in the world including JP Morgan
23:57 himself they had a bunch of vacancies
24:00 now a bunch of really wealthy people
24:03 wanted to be on that ship
24:05 to be a part of history every time they
24:09 would call in or I guess go down to the
24:13 place to talk about being on the ship
24:16 they were told that there were no first
24:18 class cabins available that if they were
24:22 gonna buy a ticket they were gonna be in
24:23 second class some people have thought
24:27 well that doesn't make sense for two
24:30 reasons first reason is it was
24:34 half-empty
24:35 just JP Morgan and his 50 employees that
24:38 opens up 51 seats and that's just if
24:40 they didn't bring their spouses or
24:42 mistresses right so maybe you'd double
24:44 that to a hundred it's a lot of
24:47 vacancies that's a lot of money lost
24:50 isn't it I mean I was soom that you
24:53 wouldn't have to pay for the ticket if
24:54 you didn't get on but now what was the
24:56 status of the white star company at the
24:59 time
24:59 they are in financial peril the Olympic
25:03 is supposedly the other ship in the bay
25:06 it's got all kinds of busted up problems
25:09 gonna have to replace the frame it's hit
25:12 a tugboat and said the HMS Hawke its hit
25:18 shipwreck the bottom the ocean or
25:21 whatever in the bay so it's got damages
25:24 they're operating on half of their
25:26 income just think about these
25:28 restaurants are gonna have to open after
25:30 this ridiculous fiasco we've had 20 20
25:33 there's a 5% to 10% profit in any normal
25:37 restaurant and now they're gonna have to
25:38 operate at 50% capacity that's still
25:40 death total death every time you start
25:44 your business you staff up like you're
25:46 gonna have a full restaurant and then it
25:49 could say notice a number of chefs but
25:51 now you make it half the money now the
25:54 other sad part about this is that
25:57 despite all of this shenanigans that are
26:00 going on in first-class
26:03 they didn't spare or give any excuse to
26:07 the immigrants that we're gonna be down
26:10 below they could buy a ticket no problem
26:15 later we will find that the immigrants
26:18 were locked into their chambers down
26:21 below so when this thing got hit they go
26:26 to the door and they can't get out now
26:30 maybe someone could say that's [ __ ]
26:31 but I think the main reason why that is
26:37 believable to me is that if you have a
26:42 bunch of rich people and the deck and
26:45 above you don't want a bunch of
26:47 immigrants over 1,200 of them rushing
26:52 around the deck taking up life rafts
26:55 right they didn't have enough life rafts
26:56 for everybody and so you don't want them
27:01 taking up seats for the rich people they
27:04 even rich people on the boat so before
27:07 we get into the night up more background
27:09 I told you the each ship cost ten
27:12 million dollars
27:13 ten million dollars in nineteen ten and
27:16 eleven twelve what was a tremendous
27:19 amount of money now this thing's sink on
27:22 April 15th 1912 so the Olympic was in
27:28 service for about six months ahead of
27:30 time each ship was insured for twelve
27:33 million dollars and after the Titanic
27:37 sank white star profited two million
27:40 dollars got the whole you know cost of
27:45 the ship back plus two million dollars
27:46 hmm sounds like a couple buildings I
27:50 know but now we need to introduce you to
27:54 captain Edward J Smith Captain Smith
27:59 look like the absolute stereotypical
28:04 Navy captain big white beautifully you
28:08 know groomed beard I mean just like he
28:12 just was born to have a beard then he
28:14 had the captain's hat on always dressed
28:17 in you know full Navy gear that sort of
28:19 thing but he was known as being a
28:22 maverick when he operated ships and he
28:26 had two qualities or I should say
28:29 attributes about him one he liked to
28:33 drive ships as fast as they possibly
28:35 could go he was known for that when
28:38 everything worked out right everybody
28:39 was super excited about a little lance
28:41 terasi speed record rate but the other
28:45 attribute about him was that dude is
28:47 maverick nature of driving ships as fast
28:49 as they could he got in a lot of
28:52 accidents now I told you about three
28:56 accidents that the Olympic had he was
29:01 the captain of the Olympic during all
29:03 three accidents and he might blow off
29:07 two out of three because the tugboats a
29:09 hard thing to see on a gigantic boat
29:11 like the Titanic I might even cut him
29:13 slack there not again I'm not sure how
29:15 easy it is to know where all the
29:17 shipwrecks are so I might could I'm
29:18 slack on that one too
29:19 but the HMS Hawke was a big piece of
29:22 metal and definitely should have been
29:25 seen
29:27 so let's take a quick examination here
29:30 of the psychological state of Captain
29:34 Smith he's an old guy he looked like he
29:37 was at least in his late 50s he had just
29:43 basically destroyed a 10 million dollar
29:46 ship wrecking it three times costing the
29:50 company a tremendous amount of money and
29:52 he had a record of like hurting ships so
29:58 it's pretty easy to conclude slash
30:02 speculate he's probably pretty desperate
30:04 here he you know could dig himself out
30:10 of a ditch as long as he was willing to
30:12 go along with this conspiracy but he had
30:15 one condition about sailing on the now
30:19 quote-unquote Titanic he demanded to let
30:25 pick his crew specifically for this
30:27 maiden voyage now it's very interesting
30:32 when the crew got over to this
30:36 quote-unquote fresh brand-new Titanic
30:38 and went down and looked at the engine
30:43 they immediately came back and said this
30:47 is engines totally worn it even needs
30:50 some repairs how was a brand-new ship
30:54 got a custom-made gigantic engine and
30:58 it's already worn hmm cuz it's probably
31:03 the Olympic so JPMorgan owns white star
31:09 he won't even go on his own ship in this
31:13 maiden voyage across the Atlantic which
31:17 is really where they consider the maiden
31:18 voyage in our real voice not just
31:20 driving the Olympic round crashing it in
31:22 the bay and all that kind of stuff this
31:25 is where we have to introduce another
31:26 ship just so happen to also be owned by
31:30 JP Morgan and it's called the California
31:35 and it's kind of a freighter ship that
31:36 goes back and forth nothing fancy now at
31:41 the time there was a coal shortage in
31:44 England and California was noted as
31:49 setting sail with a full hull of coal
31:53 meaning it had a lot of fuel essentially
31:58 to keep going wherever it was gonna go
32:00 supposed to be going to Boston captain
32:04 Stanley Lord goes out into the ocean
32:08 ahead of the quote-unquote Titanic and
32:12 he ends up going right to well very very
32:17 close to where the Titanic actually
32:19 ended up sinking and parking on April
32:23 13th and he not only parked his ship
32:28 there which parking makes no sense he
32:32 said to his crew two things keep the
32:35 engines running at all times ready to go
32:38 whenever I want you to and two I want
32:41 you to look off the bow of the ship for
32:45 flares especially this what is it red
32:50 and blue flares just in case something
32:53 happens right now the other weird thing
32:57 was the night of the accident again
33:00 where the Titanic sunk at 2:00 a.m. on
33:03 the 14th so even though we say April
33:06 14th there were only two hours into the
33:08 day he sent three messages south towards
33:16 the Titanic giving whatever could
33:20 receive the message and he you know he
33:24 labeled his messages you know to the
33:26 Titanic three times he told them where
33:28 he was now going back to Captain Smith
33:32 he was now driving this Olympic with the
33:36 Titanic plate on it he plots a course
33:39 through a known iceberg field now you
33:45 might think well you know it's still the
33:47 official story doesn't make any
33:49 bah blah blah incapable visibility was
33:51 confirmed by every ship in the area and
33:53 there's three other ships in the area
33:54 within 60 miles of that ship she was
33:57 about 90 miles away and the tight the
33:59 excuse me the California is about 19
34:03 miles north of the Titanic visibility
34:07 was said to be 4 to 6 ma are five to six
34:10 miles excuse me and crystal clear so no
34:13 fog no problems night isn't looking up
34:17 on sort of what visibility would be
34:20 required to see icebergs and that sort
34:22 of thing generally speaking if
34:24 visibility is at two miles at the time
34:28 it's deemed safe completely safe because
34:31 you can turn a gigantic ship and two
34:32 miles away from anything that's out
34:34 there now the night of Captain Smith who
34:43 didn't usually do what I'm about to tell
34:44 you did something different he lays down
34:47 to go to bed except he sleeps in his
34:50 office fully closed not a typical
34:54 procedure for a standard c2c flight
34:57 they're not flight her journey I should
34:59 say he leaves an officer Murdoch in
35:03 charge and of course he's like you know
35:07 look out for icebergs all this other
35:09 kind of stuff and Murdoch sees as how's
35:15 the story goes the iceberg on the
35:19 starboard side and so he does a maneuver
35:24 that to us might sound totally logical
35:27 but the sailors they say that this is a
35:31 suicide move and absolutely ignorant to
35:34 a degree he tells his crew to hit full
35:42 steam ahead and he go port port side
35:47 which is left right the way you can
35:48 always remember a port and starboard is
35:50 that left the word left has three
35:53 letters in it or four letters in excuse
35:54 me three sir
35:56 and port has four letters too so
35:59 starboard is more than four that's right
36:01 port is left
36:03 what this manoeuvre does is it basically
36:05 skids the side of the ship right into
36:09 the iceberg so it is actually a
36:11 manoeuvre to hit an iceberg and make it
36:14 drag down the starboard side which is
36:18 exactly what we think occurred so here
36:22 you have this impact with an iceberg now
36:24 what's really going on at this moment of
36:27 the collision most of you know this is
36:29 that the and and there's a conspiracy
36:33 that I haven't heard surfaced in a while
36:35 that the steel that they used to build
36:37 both ships was crap steel and it was
36:40 made very hastily and it was very
36:42 brittle
36:43 now that's maybe a conspiracy just to
36:47 make this whole thing go down and give
36:49 you an excuse but what the iceberg did
36:51 was it ripped a thin hole all the way
36:53 down the starboard side of the hull
36:57 obviously allowing metric tons of water
37:00 to start coming into the Titanic now for
37:05 most of us that don't build ships for a
37:06 living we're not quite sure you know
37:09 what happens when that happens right
37:11 well inside the skeleton of the ship
37:14 most of you know that there's like
37:16 ribcage inside the hull of a ship to
37:18 keep it you know having structural
37:20 integrity this thing I'm about to tell
37:23 you doesn't happen in modern day ships
37:24 but it was a very unfortunate oversight
37:28 and design back in the days which is
37:30 that there were essentially like
37:32 firewalls inside the skeleton so every
37:35 rib at a wall wall wall wall as I've
37:40 read it several times and seen it in the
37:42 official news things is that most while
37:45 ships today have these walls capped off
37:48 at the top meaning if you take on the
37:52 water inside one chamber all you got to
37:54 do is get people to go to the
37:55 neighboring chambers close the door
37:57 close the hatch screw it tight and that
38:00 will fill up but it won't seem to ship
38:02 because it's only one cell in the hull
38:04 that's full but the Titanic was designed
38:08 in a way that these didn't have like
38:10 roofs over them and so it's build from
38:13 one to the other to the other and that's
38:15 why it took so long to sink
38:17 as it gets dragged down it just takes on
38:20 more and more it's an exponential curve
38:22 until obviously you see the ship sink
38:24 rate so here's this ship it's ripped
38:27 down one side the captain's notified all
38:34 ight witnesses said and the inquiry in
38:36 Britain after this whole thing happens
38:38 we're going to detail here the crew
38:41 wasn't remotely alarmed and especially
38:44 not captain Smith as if everything went
38:48 to plan now one could construe that Wow
38:52 this is an amazing level of accuracy to
38:55 create a collision but again a bigger
38:57 ship in the world hitting a pretty big
38:59 iceberg I don't know how hard that is
39:02 right you just basically chase one until
39:04 you run into it again the truth of the
39:07 matter of how this went down in terms of
39:09 seeing an iceberg trying to do a
39:11 maneuver and hitting it may be
39:13 absolutely untrue and they just drove
39:15 right at it and then just turn port
39:18 Florida BAM never those three guys on
39:22 the ship you might think but all the
39:28 other rich people got off the ship why
39:30 didn't those three other guys get off
39:32 the ship that we're gonna run over and
39:33 tell on these dudes that we're gonna
39:35 form this fraud called the Federal
39:37 Reserve well you're in the middle the
39:41 ocean you just kill them you just kill
39:45 them however you kill them strangle them
39:47 to death suffocate them probably not
39:49 fire a firearm but you kill them and
39:52 they simply never show up to the deck to
39:54 be rescued now most of you know that
39:57 that these life rafts these these um
40:01 boats that you put over the side take a
40:05 little while to prep they're all clamped
40:07 down they're you know they're put in
40:09 place so they don't fly off the ship now
40:12 they hang them from the roofs which is
40:15 something that Sid me too actually
40:16 invented for one of the cruise liners
40:18 and they they thought it was crazy and
40:20 then they finally looked at how much
40:21 space you get by doing it now they all
40:23 do it it's really funny you just put
40:25 that in design now it's the standard of
40:26 the world back in the day you would have
40:29 your walk
40:30 around the outside of the ship and then
40:32 the distance between you and the edge on
40:35 these parts we have these rafts that's
40:38 where the boats were so Murdoch and
40:42 Smith they don't begin preparing these
40:44 boats until 45 minutes after the impact
40:47 which is kind of wild you know they
40:52 don't deploy the first boat in the water
40:54 until an hour and 25 minutes after
40:56 impact and if you've seen the movie
40:59 you'll see this portrayed all the time
41:01 rate now Captain Lord is up in the
41:07 California approximately 19 miles north
41:11 of the Titanic and the problem is that
41:15 that's that's fairly long distance in
41:17 the ocean with five to six miles of
41:19 visibility they can't even see the
41:21 Titanic now we obviously think that the
41:25 California making a ridiculous stop and
41:27 melly ocean which if any of you've dealt
41:29 with Freight you know that you're paid
41:31 based on when it arrives and stopping in
41:34 the middle eocene
41:34 to have a nap is utterly absurd so
41:39 that's really absolutely circumstantial
41:42 proof that that they were trying to be
41:44 there when the Titanic goes down to
41:47 rescue all the millionaire's problem the
41:52 Titanic navigator makes a huge mistake
41:55 and they're not where they're supposed
41:57 to be but the California is where it's
41:59 supposed to be and the Titanic supposed
42:01 to be 12 miles closer gotta get down to
42:04 seven miles making it really easy to
42:07 just drive over there and rescue
42:08 everyone the California never made it to
42:12 the Titanic never helped a single person
42:16 a ship called the Carpathia carpathian
42:20 ends up rescuing everybody and the
42:23 interesting thing about that is that the
42:25 time of the impact the estimate that the
42:27 carpathian was about fifty eight miles
42:29 away and so it heard the distress calls
42:33 somehow managed to figure out where the
42:35 hell everybody was and picked up all the
42:39 survivors
42:41 now the totals printed in the British
42:44 newspaper were 866 people rescued which
42:48 is a tremendous amount actually kind of
42:51 blows me away but over twelve hundred
42:53 and fifty immigrants died down below to
42:57 make it even weirder the carpathian
43:01 takes all the survivors back to England
43:04 and instead of being met by their family
43:08 members and you know the press and
43:10 everyone they end up getting hauled off
43:13 into a warehouse again
43:16 premeditation this is where we start
43:19 getting into like literally things that
43:22 would have never happened had this been
43:24 just a plain ol accident they're held in
43:28 a warehouse for a day 24 hours this is
43:33 not a place with any beds it's not a
43:35 place it's convenient for anyone you got
43:38 millionaires in there like a
43:40 millionaires in the nineteen twelve okay
43:43 April 15th right I mean this is like
43:46 Mega Money JP Morgan was said to have
43:49 died and he only had two and a half
43:50 million dollars in his personal bank
43:53 account because he was actually a proxy
43:55 for the Rothschilds so he never really
43:58 had a ton of his own money 2.5 million
44:00 is a lot of money but it's not Mega
44:02 Money which is why we think the White
44:04 Star couldn't just fix the Olympic and
44:08 get back out there and do its thing GP
44:11 wasn't as rich as he put on he was rich
44:13 enough to hang on Paris but not you know
44:16 just throwing millions and millions of
44:19 dollars around not only are they held in
44:23 a warehouse for 24 hours but here's
44:25 where you get into the almost
44:26 confirmation that this was a pre-planned
44:27 event they were not allowed to leave
44:30 until they all agreed to sign a document
44:35 silencing them from discussing any of
44:38 the vents that they had just encountered
44:40 - probably a cover story narrative that
44:44 they were going to publish themselves
44:45 right
44:48 so initially the British government was
44:52 not going to have any inquiry into the
44:54 event was simply gonna be a shipwreck
44:57 all too bad you all died right however
45:03 the people of Britain were like we want
45:07 to know what just happened this is
45:08 ridiculous twelve hundred and fifty
45:10 people just died and so they're like
45:13 okay begrudgingly the British government
45:18 creates this inquiry some speculation is
45:23 that the White Star shipping company had
45:30 to leverage points against the British
45:33 government the low-hanging fruit was
45:37 that twenty thousand employees in
45:39 Britain were employed by white star and
45:42 so they didn't want to lose twenty
45:43 thousand jobs you know don't piss us off
45:45 so I don't sue is out of existence
45:47 because then we'll fold our thing up and
45:50 twenty thousand people be unemployed but
45:53 the other one which is a little more
45:54 strategic is that the British government
45:56 was allowed by JP Morgan to borrow any
46:01 white starship if it was available for
46:03 moving troops around and what-have-you
46:06 dignitaries they want to lose that
46:09 that's pretty strategic a world war pops
46:12 out and you know you need
46:16 remember by 1937 this this Titanic which
46:22 was now called the Olympic was only
46:25 taken out of commission because the
46:26 British government commandeered it most
46:28 likely for World War two but they
46:31 appoint this super corrupt judge Judge
46:35 George Lord may see here just was
46:40 notorious in his own way
46:42 look him up there was a so you know when
46:47 you go into like a a court you have a
46:49 plaintiff and a defendant and usually in
46:52 most cases it's two different people
46:54 it's two different companies the person
46:57 against the company and company against
46:58 a person right not in this case and this
47:03 inquiry which was pretty much like into
47:08 the 9/11 Commission report slash inquiry
47:12 nobody asking any hard questions is one
47:14 thing that they noted but the plaintiff
47:17 and the defendant was the same group
47:20 called the Board of Trade so they were
47:23 representing both sides of the game and
47:26 it was noted that one of the attorneys
47:29 this is hilarious okay can you never
47:32 hear this kind of stuff one of the
47:34 attorneys representing the Board of
47:35 Trade during his many dissertations and
47:38 certain questions referred to the
47:42 Titanic several times as the Olympic hmm
47:47 it's kind of a George Bush call and al
47:50 Qaeda al CIA de which was the CIA's
47:53 database of operatives in Afghanistan
47:57 hilarious George Bush was aware of what
48:01 was going on behind the scenes and so of
48:03 course he used the real word he was
48:06 always told that that's the database of
48:08 these people and say we said it wrong on
48:10 TV but get this this is what's just
48:15 unbelievable for me personally at least
48:20 so where does the blame fall after the
48:22 inquiry is over okay you would think the
48:26 captain Smith would be
48:29 someone at fault no he was completely
48:33 exonerated of any guilt so who was found
48:37 guilty remember the California it was
48:41 supposed to rescue everyone that was got
48:43 they're just going in a circle well
48:46 they're not even going in a circle but
48:48 out there and the captain's taking a nap
48:49 making sure everybody looks for the
48:52 distress call make sure the Titanian got
48:54 three messages tell him where he was
48:56 captain lord of the california was
49:00 blamed for the entire thing that if he
49:04 had been where he was supposed to be i
49:05 guess so that everybody would have been
49:07 rescued I mean it was just a ludicrous
49:09 assertion they just pawned the whole
49:11 thing off on that dude apparently he
49:13 went to his death not executed or
49:15 anything but and you know he was trying
49:17 to get a new trial into this matter
49:19 before he died so he could clean his
49:21 name but he never got the trial so now
49:27 the shipwreck
49:29 there is a shipwreck on the bottom of
49:31 the ocean you've seen the little clips
49:34 by James Cameron is a little little boat
49:38 down there
49:39 then he build his own submarine to get
49:41 that done well there's a few interesting
49:45 things about it the shipwreck that we
49:50 have seen on the bottom the ocean was
49:52 discovered to have gray paint that's an
49:56 undercoat on the hull well here's a
50:00 little factory on the Olympic got the
50:03 gray paint the Titanic never got a gray
50:06 paint so time you see gray paint you're
50:08 looking at the Olympic not the Titanic
50:12 now do you remember the story I told you
50:14 about when the Olympic hit the shipwreck
50:18 it busted its propeller and the
50:21 propeller had to be moved from the
50:23 Titanic over to Olympic well they built
50:25 a new one for the Titanic
50:27 remember the 401 stamp I told you about
50:31 in the shipwreck on the bottom of the
50:34 ocean right now the 401 propeller is on
50:39 the shipwreck down there
50:41 conclusive proof the
50:43 that's the Olympic and not the Titanic
50:47 now another thing
50:51 I told you that the Olympic had three
50:54 accidents the tugboat accidents and the
50:58 hawk HMS Hawke accident damaged the keel
51:02 and it had repairs on it
51:05 well the shipwreck the bomb the ocean
51:08 has repairs on the keel
51:11 okay well the Titanic never was in an
51:15 accident
51:15 supposedly prior to this whole event
51:17 right conspiracy aside it was the one
51:21 that sank great but it should have no
51:23 pre-existing damage on its hull and the
51:26 one on the bottom the ocean has that
51:28 repair thus the Olympic not the Titanic
51:33 now let's say you're still not convinced
51:36 I don't know how you couldn't be
51:38 convinced but let's say you're not
51:39 convinced at this point in the video you
51:44 are going to see photographic proof it's
51:47 the Olympic and not the Titanic now you
51:51 remember me telling you way back at the
51:53 beginning of this story
51:54 there was only three things that made it
51:59 labeled either the Titanic or the
52:01 Olympic the life rafts and the life
52:06 vests or were swapped okay so those all
52:11 check out of course if there's any left
52:13 unknown but the nameplate was swapped if
52:17 my theory slashed the theory everyone's
52:20 theory is correct
52:22 well someone noted that plaques were not
52:27 actually the standard methodology of
52:30 putting the name of a ship on the ship
52:33 that it was actually etched into the
52:35 steel and I mean beautifully etched in
52:37 this deal if you ever ever seen like um
52:39 you know the name of a building edged in
52:42 the marble outside it's that beautiful
52:44 just relief writing that's what they
52:46 used to do to the steel and for any of
52:49 you that know that guns have their sale
52:53 numbers pounded into the steel just
52:56 before they completely dry that you
52:58 molecular lee galvanized the steel
53:01 molecules and such that even if you file
53:03 off the
53:04 serial number of a gun you could put it
53:08 in acid melt the filing layers off and
53:11 the number will reveal itself again same
53:13 thing for when I say my bicycle got
53:17 stolen in Boston when I was a kid and it
53:21 was just a bunch of bicycles were
53:22 getting stolen and my dad died we're
53:24 driving to a an event he was in his
53:26 full-blown military officer Guard garb
53:30 bulbs medals and [ __ ]
53:32 and he's driving by and I'm not paying
53:34 attention he's like is that kid on your
53:35 bike not probably no no I just want
53:38 didn't want to stop the car
53:40 because I think it was he flips around
53:41 the car and it's some kid he's probably
53:44 on Oh 14 15 years old riding my bike was
53:47 like a was a black phantom Schwinn bike
53:49 my dad just walked over with the kids
53:52 sitting on the bike he just grabs the
53:53 frame pulls it up knocks to get off the
53:55 bike and looks underneath and sure
53:57 enough the kids tried to file off the
53:59 serial number and he just I don't know
54:03 he just threatened the kids and put it
54:04 in the back of the car and drove back
54:06 home and dropped the bike off it was
54:08 painted all black it was already black
54:10 anyway but they got rid of some fenders
54:12 off the chain bastards got my bike back
54:15 down okay what's that do the story well
54:20 God has God works in mysterious ways
54:23 sometimes right if it wasn't bad enough
54:26 there's gray paint there's a 401 stamped
54:29 on the propeller and the keel has been
54:31 repaired something never to have been
54:34 recorded in Titanic's history the
54:38 nameplate
54:38 this is Titanic on it has corroded away
54:42 and revealed some letters underneath now
54:48 the divers didn't have permission to
54:51 touch the boat and change it right so
54:53 all they can do is take a picture of
54:55 what's revealed underneath this
54:57 corrosion area of the plate they don't
54:59 have permission to take the plate off
55:01 clean it off and see the full word
55:03 Olympic underneath the taint plate but
55:10 as luck would have it
55:12 you can see clear as day two letters
55:16 underneath the plate an M and P and I
55:21 don't know about your spelling I'm not
55:23 exactly the best speller in the whole
55:25 world but I don't think M or P is in the
55:29 word Titanic and so we now have I'll put
55:32 this on the video proof that this thing
55:37 is indeed the Olympic now I told you I
55:42 would tell you another story I've seen
55:45 where a gentleman followed this for 30
55:50 years and what's interesting about these
55:52 millionaires and is that once they hatch
55:55 a story they love to keep it they don't
56:00 want anything to unravel and I'm gonna
56:04 go off with some changes cuz I got more
56:06 time on my steak and we will be done
56:08 with this story here shortly so I'm
56:09 gonna at least D Markey where my
56:13 potential rambling might start for some
56:16 of you they get all butthurt about me
56:18 talking off topic but very few of you
56:22 just some people to come so my god
56:24 you're rambling like raising my latitude
56:25 it's 500 shows trying to do that without
56:28 rambling anyway this guy presents all of
56:32 his facts and of course it's I think it
56:34 was like a BBC sort of thing and most of
56:37 you know the term called a hit piece
56:39 right hit piece is where they have
56:42 already pre decided how to slant
56:43 everything that show MythBusters is
56:47 nothing more than a shilly shally r the
56:50 way for all of the dark events of the
56:54 world elite right Penn & Teller to
56:58 shills that will take money they're from
57:01 New York and they literally both the
57:05 Mythbusters and Penn & Teller never
57:07 present you architects and engineers for
57:09 9/11 truth data 3000 PhD 7,000 graduate
57:14 undergraduate degrees in specific areas
57:16 of architecture metallurgy and
57:18 structural engineering you know they're
57:20 telling you things are impossible
57:22 so this hid pieces goes out on this guy
57:25 and they bait this dude forever and this
57:28 thing well maybe you're right well tell
57:29 us all of your facts about why you think
57:31 this is the case what was interesting is
57:33 they must have edited out a tremendous
57:36 amount of what I just told you and he at
57:39 the time this was recorded I don't know
57:42 when this was recorded the one I saw I'm
57:45 gonna tell you about area they get him
57:48 all the way to the end of this
57:50 documentary which physically was
57:52 beautiful I mean the way they filmed it
57:53 and everything and they take him down to
57:55 some archive must be thin Southampton I
57:58 don't know but if somebody may have seen
58:01 this they take him down to this archive
58:03 and they're like we are going to pull
58:05 out the original schematics for the
58:11 Titanic and the Olympic and let's take a
58:15 look at the physical evidence of what we
58:17 found on the bottom of the ocean and
58:20 prove whether or not it's the Titanic or
58:22 the Olympic and they're showing him you
58:26 know photographs of the shipwreck you've
58:28 seen all that stuff he has seen all that
58:29 and this is where this this not even
58:33 what the hell you call it you guys are
58:34 probably sailors you know exactly what
58:35 this is but the front part of the ship
58:38 where the captains quarters are or you
58:42 know his command center there and again
58:44 I can't remember which way it was but
58:46 one was bowed and one was flattened
58:49 whatever one is on the bottom of the
58:51 ocean here's what was hilarious they
58:53 portrayed this guy as losing all faith
58:56 in his conspiracy theory on this spot
58:58 they open up these blueprints I hope you
59:03 guys are yelling at the camera right now
59:04 with how absurd this is but they open it
59:08 up okay there's the technique there's
59:10 okay and I what I haven't seen with the
59:13 bottom of the ocean thing or the windows
59:15 whit's seems like they'll be pretty easy
59:18 to verify one way or the other but again
59:21 the propeller let me break it was never
59:23 moved back to the other ship why do that
59:26 it's gonna cost you a bunch of money for
59:28 no reason why was the engine and the
59:30 Titanic worn at least six months before
59:33 it ever set sail impossible yeah he
59:36 might run it
59:37 the doc but you're gonna run it to the
59:38 level of you know having you know
59:41 massive wear and tear that engineers
59:43 gonna go in here what the hell is this
59:44 you know sure enough the Titanic labeled
59:47 blueprint okay had the that shape
59:53 accurate to the one that's on the bottom
59:55 of the ocean you know these these
59:58 documents are old supposedly from 1911
60:00 ish right probably between 8 and 11
60:04 right 99
60:05 11 because you design it before you
60:07 build it sort of thing right but the
60:09 thing is it said the idea that they
60:12 would hatch a conspiracy of this level
60:15 to defraud the insurance company first
60:17 and foremost it's worth 2 million
60:19 dollars in profit let alone the 10
60:21 million you're gonna be out with this
60:23 ship's principal cost rate and remember
60:26 they lost the case to the HMS Hawke who
60:31 knows what the damages to that boat is
60:32 right and the whole front was caved in
60:34 and it was really bad it looks like it
60:36 could definitely be repaired trust me
60:38 but it's not like 10% of the front of
60:40 the ship is going okay you don't think
60:45 that they would have printed falsified
60:49 blueprints and then stick him in an
60:51 archive they would do the falsified
60:54 blueprints just to win the case against
60:56 their insurance company alone and again
61:00 I can't see the shape of this because
61:05 when they took photographs the one
61:07 photograph you see of the Olympic and
61:09 the Titanic in the in the docking bay at
61:11 the same exact time
61:12 I believe the Olympic is facing away
61:15 from us on the left and the Olympic is
61:17 facing towards the camera on the right
61:19 it's so exposed that you don't get
61:23 contour on the front of the ship so it's
61:25 like a borrow white you don't get any
61:27 like shading or anything right maybe
61:30 Photoshop get help if you have the
61:31 original photograph unfortunately they
61:34 didn't have like an Ansel Adams camera
61:35 they sat there for you know a minute of
61:38 an exposure or something to really get
61:40 the HDMI or sorry HDR you know 32-bit
61:45 color
61:47 but yeah he sees this and they portray
61:50 it November they can cut anything they
61:54 way they want to cut it and I'll tell
61:55 you how they cut these documentaries in
61:57 case you see something like this or god
61:59 forbid you're ever involved in one one
62:03 the people that are usually suckered
62:05 into a hit piece have initially when it
62:09 first happens to them they have no clue
62:12 this is happening to them they think
62:14 there's going to be a genuine genuine
62:16 exposure moment for them they're lured
62:18 in by the producers I mean I could tell
62:20 you this I'm again I've met producers of
62:23 shows like um
62:26 Jesse Ventura show know one of his
62:29 producers once he then called him a
62:30 complete fraud but they'll call you up
62:33 on the phone and they'll say things like
62:34 this you're the guy that's been studying
62:37 the the Olympic Titanic swap yeah oh
62:40 yeah yeah you know we want to you we're
62:43 gonna we're gonna pay for a whole
62:45 45-minute aka one-hour special it's
62:49 gonna be on Discovery Channel History
62:51 Channel whatever and we really want you
62:53 to make your case because we'd love to
62:55 expose this once and for all the dudes
62:58 like yeah you know they can he's gonna
63:00 get his story to be the finale of the
63:04 show finally exposed 30 years
63:06 vindication he's no longer crazy to all
63:08 his neighbors by the way there's a
63:10 tremendous amount of my new details
63:13 about the cast air connections the cast
63:16 the crew cast anchor the crew the gun on
63:19 the ship and finding the little
63:20 anomalies and things in that particular
63:22 special seat receipt it does have value
63:24 and you can just laugh at the finale but
63:28 I remember them them showing his face
63:31 looking at these blueprints and just
63:34 having this I mean this is the way I
63:36 remember it it was bits been several
63:37 years since I've seen this I think I saw
63:39 it through YouTube I think
63:42 but he was just devastated you know I
63:45 don't think he cried or anything but he
63:46 was just devastating of course they're
63:47 telling him see so you know you're
63:49 totally wrong you know and of course
63:51 it's like ah yeah this is where I wish I
63:54 was involved in those situations because
63:56 I would have just looked at the guy but
63:57 again imagine imagine it was me right I
64:02 would have just told him to their face
64:04 that this is obviously a forgery that
64:06 this is a conspiracy they're trying to
64:08 defraud an insurance company you don't
64:10 think they're gonna print false
64:11 blueprints this is nothing yes they are
64:14 100 years old because they printed this
64:17 hundred years ago to defraud insurance
64:19 company now the interesting thing was is
64:22 that the ship not being discovered for a
64:26 really long time was very fascinating
64:28 because I think that they wanted enough
64:30 distance between them and they and the
64:33 wreck and their deaths right because it
64:35 is related to Jekyll Island you know I
64:38 think this was gonna happen anyway but
64:40 remember the people who say never let a
64:46 crisis go to waste and so when they
64:48 decide that a ship is going down you
64:53 just grab these three dudes give them
64:54 first-class tickets and poof they're off
64:58 to the races right but even if that guy
65:00 looked down at the blueprints and said
65:02 you know this is a fraud did it address
65:04 that everything I just said guess what
65:07 they just cut it and it never airs so it
65:10 looks like he goes home a you know a
65:12 loser to his theory so a lot of
65:16 celebrities nowadays you know Michael
65:18 Jackson did this when he got interviewed
65:21 by that Indian guy it was just pushing
65:24 and pushing and pushing you have any
65:27 doubts about that go see my Neverland
65:29 series there's two shows to it one right
65:32 after I watch the HBO special where I
65:34 hadn't done my research and then the
65:37 very next episode was after doing
65:38 research of fingering at that fraud
65:42 but do you demand to have in your
65:45 contract with whoever's going to do a
65:47 documentary on you you demand to have
65:49 your own camera in the room and the
65:50 rights to publish your footage X amount
65:56 of weeks or days or hours after they
65:58 published theirs and so that way you can
66:02 say they cut the interview I said this
66:05 they said that you lied the other one
66:07 that celebrities do and this is actually
66:09 for a lot of you who might you know have
66:11 some stardom in a small way if you're
66:14 ever interviewed there's you know
66:18 several different ways they do
66:19 interviews there's email interviews
66:21 which is very ironclad because you have
66:23 your responses to their questions and
66:26 you could just publish your email
66:27 publish the email that you sent to clear
66:28 up the the misrepresentation the second
66:33 one is a radio interview and if you
66:36 don't record what you say and what they
66:38 say then they can construe and claim you
66:42 said things you didn't say
66:43 misunderstandings do a-kor occur
66:45 organically but you know one of the
66:47 reasons why Stanley Kubrick stopped
66:51 talking to the press
66:52 right after starting to talk to the
66:53 press was that he said it doesn't matter
66:56 what I say they print whatever they want
66:58 and so I'm just never gonna do an
66:59 interview with them so they can never
67:01 say that I said something I didn't say
67:04 and Prince was the same way you know
67:07 that Prince was also known for because
67:10 usually when like Rolling Stone magazine
67:12 shows up to to do an interview with you
67:14 they bring a cameraman with them and
67:17 Brennan said stipulations that said you
67:19 have to bring a Polaroid back to the
67:22 camera so you can take a shot but I have
67:24 to have a Polaroid immediate preview and
67:26 then I get to tell you what pictures you
67:28 can take with you very fast things to
67:31 rolls of film will be put aside but the
67:34 other one is obviously a videotaped
67:35 interview and that's where you have your
67:37 own camera rolling no matter what and
67:39 quite frankly just do it anyway
67:41 the one I do often is I'll just turn the
67:46 recorder on my phone and just put it out
67:48 there if I'm having some meeting with
67:49 someone just let him know you didn't
67:50 mind if I do this it's come in handy you
67:54 know so why would they want to separate
67:59 themselves from this event well it
68:02 reveals a massive conspiracy which to
68:04 date no one cares about anymore right
68:06 you know and again I was on Facebook
68:08 probably about four months ago and
68:10 someone talked about the Titanic and he
68:12 talked about the swab and it was some
68:14 you know people from my hometown I don't
68:19 know who the guy was he's probably not
68:20 from my own town but close by and this
68:23 one was like oh my gosh really did that
68:25 happen and this guy comes in in his
68:27 blood hurt official story obviously
68:29 doesn't work for JPMorgan he just was
68:31 told us into him this is a complete
68:34 conspiracy and it's just misrepresents
68:36 history like what the [ __ ] do you what
68:38 are you Matt what do you care about the
68:40 Olympic of the Titanic being so op do
68:42 you know I showed a friend of mine who's
68:46 from England now lives in America I
68:48 showed them the the rebuilding of
68:51 Stonehenge in 1954 from its original
68:54 site you know it really was there it
68:57 just was not where you find it today and
68:59 they it was all collapsed there was only
69:01 like one stone that had the little t bar
69:04 across the top right there was at the
69:06 inn bar whatever it is right the altar
69:08 thing and they picked all the stones up
69:11 and they took him someplace and they
69:12 repaired them with cement so that they
69:14 had the bases again
69:15 and then they picked a ritual circle
69:18 that had no stones but it was a place
69:20 that had a relief
69:22 circle so seemed like a place where
69:25 stone age could have been built and they
69:27 reassembled it they took a 110
69:29 photographs of black and white the
69:31 public was there you watch these little
69:33 kids you know watching them rebuild
69:35 Stonehenge but today they tell you
69:37 that's exactly where Stonehenge was
69:39 built and it's a complete and utter lie
69:41 and the funny thing was is that my
69:44 friend looks at this and you know could
69:46 barely you know process it and the funny
69:49 thing is that they're kind of a you know
69:51 red pill person not a tremendously red
69:53 pill person and then they just couldn't
69:55 let the whole thing just be true they
69:57 said well they they they probably built
70:00 it where it was and I said well did you
70:03 watch all the photographs now it was
70:04 going to slow the video was going to
70:06 slow so
70:07 cognitive dissidence kubler-ross denial
70:09 never got past that stage we stayed in
70:12 negotiation on the phone never
70:13 acceptance I said no you watch the whole
70:16 thing I mean the circles at the very
70:19 beginnings I could because you missed
70:20 that photograph right maybe didn't know
70:22 what you're looking at I get it I had to
70:24 watch the two three times myself still
70:27 couldn't just accept what was there and
70:31 so those people get earmarked as not
70:33 really where you want to get your
70:34 information from for me I think it's the
70:37 Jekyll Island angle that is the reason
70:40 why they don't want you to know this
70:41 kind of stuff and there's a lot of
70:43 theories out there that have a little
70:46 thread in the sweater and they don't
70:48 want you to find the thread that you
70:49 could pull in the whole sweater goes
70:51 dead now I'm gonna take you down a
70:56 similar archetype of a truth that is
71:01 being hidden so that you don't find out
71:04 where oil comes from because it unravels
71:07 things is very similar to why on earth
71:09 would they deny us some very upfront
71:13 science that was taught in schools up
71:18 until about 1962 at least last person I
71:21 know that said they went to college and
71:22 they were actually taught this as a
71:23 complete theory of how the world
71:25 functions but it's being suppressed
71:29 because it reveals that oil is not a
71:31 fossil fuel that oil is an organic thing
71:34 that the world creates very naturally
71:36 many of you listen to the show several
71:38 times you've heard this before this is
71:40 sort of like when someone goes into the
71:43 spin of like why would they lie about
71:44 that
71:45 usually because they killed three guys
71:47 that we're gonna come to America and
71:49 spill the beans about Jekyll Island we
71:52 only find out about Jekyll Island now
71:53 because there's what do they care
71:55 they've got complete control he'll tell
71:58 you to your face yeah yeah I'll be
72:00 killed kidding me no problem we're gonna
72:01 do about it he's dead he's been dead for
72:02 over 60 years or 57 years we're gonna do
72:06 about it
72:06 oh nothing that's why I thought so up
72:10 until 1962 in America in various
72:14 colleges probably not all colleges they
72:15 taught you that the world expands
72:17 you can see it with your own eyes it is
72:20 the most evident thing but if you can't
72:23 see expansion you gotta check yourself I
72:26 know a bunch of people I love out there
72:28 don't believe in it but you just have to
72:30 check yourself if you take the planet
72:33 Earth and you shrink away all the oceans
72:35 all the continents
72:37 unlike Pangaea drift Theory where they
72:40 put them all together in a big Islands
72:41 he in a big continent somewhere floating
72:43 in the ocean they told you that this
72:45 continent just breaks away just somehow
72:47 great no explanation for the force
72:49 that's gonna have make that happen
72:51 and all these pieces floated around
72:52 which is why you know for a fact that
72:54 South America butts up against Africa
72:56 perfectly but to their luck the human
73:01 mind doesn't really have hand-eye
73:03 coordination 3d object space a little
73:06 analysis really well developed because
73:08 we're on the art in school anymore so
73:10 the brain just stays [ __ ] on the
73:11 right side but if you take Australia and
73:15 the Asian Pacific Rim you can move those
73:18 right over and they kiss against North
73:21 America and South America they time to
73:24 get rid of all the oceans without using
73:26 subduction which is pushing one
73:28 continent underneath another very
73:31 discipline mathematical approaches to
73:34 this whole thing the world completely
73:36 connects on all sides there are two
73:39 seams in the world that are worth noting
73:43 one down the Pacific and one down the
73:46 Atlantic if you look at any relief map
73:49 of the ocean bottoms they forgot to
73:51 erase that so you can see it they don't
73:55 teach us anymore they teach you Pangaea
73:57 drift because if you learn that there's
74:01 a force at the centre of the earth
74:03 pushing it out it completely changes
74:06 come cosmology completely this little
74:11 change to everything will erase fossil
74:16 fuel how did it get classified as fossil
74:19 fuel I got the numbers right
74:21 it was 1894 and the Rockefellers who had
74:25 the oil market from Standard Oil
74:26 completely cornered they could never
74:29 really raise the rate of
74:30 because well burps out of this out of
74:33 the crust of the earth naturally and
74:35 again people don't know this but if you
74:38 asked Texas historians they will know
74:41 this but a lot of areas in South Texas
74:43 had just seas of oil probably not that
74:48 deep but probably not that shallow
74:50 either because it just seeps out because
74:53 it's naturally created just at the crust
74:57 level of the outer coating of Earth okay
75:02 just bump the mic try not to touch the
75:04 mic this time now Tesla the Springfield
75:08 Colorado proved that the world's core is
75:11 made of plasma energy he proved it
75:14 that's how he got the standing light
75:16 bulb lightning bolt for one minute and
75:17 his laboratory there and once he proved
75:20 that he packed everything up and went
75:21 back to New York as he figured it out
75:22 this is when he started working on his
75:24 Tesla Tower 1917 JP Morgan also [ __ ]
75:29 that one up to center of the sinus
75:33 plasma center the moon is plasma every
75:36 body in space then is a hard surface
75:39 most definitely as a plasma core now gas
75:41 giants most likely have a combination of
75:44 a bunch of different things
75:45 definitely a plasma core though the
75:48 reason why your compass points north
75:50 isn't because of the ridiculous theory
75:53 that we have nickel iron at the core of
75:54 the earth I have read that nickel iron
75:57 at 6,500 degrees Fahrenheit loses all
75:59 magnetism well what did they tell you
76:01 about the center of the earth and its
76:02 heat way above 6500 degrees Fahrenheit
76:05 so there's not gonna be any compass
76:07 pointing north with a nickel iron core
76:09 that's a no that's some cover theory
76:11 that they use but if it's made of
76:13 electricity okay which is plasma energy
76:16 when a plasma looks like but look up a
76:18 lightning bolt that's a plasma energy is
76:20 it is the stem cell of nuclear matter
76:23 okay it's moving so fast it's ether on
76:26 matter moving so quickly it hasn't
76:28 slowed down to become anything well why
76:32 would the world expand why would that
76:33 ever happen well because the Sun is
76:36 constantly ejecting its subatomic ether
76:41 all particles which was going to
76:43 metabolize into
76:45 moving fifty times the speed of light
76:47 and through sheer gravity wells that are
76:50 created by negative pockets of ether it
76:52 goes into the top of earth becomes our
76:57 bowels and goes at the bottom and
76:58 everything is trading these these
77:01 spirals of this energy of the subatomic
77:04 matter that goes into our planets and
77:07 expands us the world expands 19
77:10 centimeters a year I just think about
77:12 that a 7900 my lacrosse ball 24,000
77:18 miles around is expanding 19 centimeters
77:22 that's a lot of expansion what would
77:26 happen if you had a crust on the outside
77:28 because it cools with the zero
77:31 temperature of space or eight and as
77:32 where you get a crust okay or you're
77:37 gonna start tearing the outer surface of
77:40 this crust and we just happen to have
77:42 two weak points the weakest point is the
77:46 seam down the Pacific Ocean which is why
77:49 it's bigger it ripped faster which is
77:52 why it's got a bigger gap the Atlantic
77:54 is slightly stronger it expanded slower
77:57 which is why the Atlantic Ocean is
77:59 smaller and easier to cross thank God
78:01 okay what are the two most abundant
78:07 atoms in the universe carbon and
78:12 hydrogen you ever heard that human
78:15 beings are carbon-based life forms yeah
78:18 it's cuz it's really common well what is
78:21 oil right what is oil
78:24 what's a combination of carbon and
78:27 hydrogen now some of you may have heard
78:30 of methane gas it's very very flammable
78:33 that's why mexico city´s blew up that
78:35 one day because their sewage system
78:37 wasn't draining out all the sewage and
78:40 there's a natural returning back to its
78:43 carbon-based form and you get methane
78:45 gas and then they had a spark and boom
78:47 the whole street blew up is a pretty
78:49 amazing video that you wanna go look it
78:50 up
78:52 okay so methane gas is one carbon for
78:56 hydrogen well as carbon flammable no no
79:00 carbon is what you see when you burn a
79:02 log when you burn it all the way down
79:03 you see its carbon base right well what
79:07 happens when you light hydrogen afire
79:10 remember the was at the Hindenburg
79:12 wasn't that a hydrogen vehicle it blows
79:15 up it's a natural explosive which is why
79:19 the Sun there's got a lot of hydrogen on
79:23 its outside
79:24 well methane gas is really easy to make
79:27 one carbon as the binder and four
79:30 hydrogen on the outside now that's
79:34 naturally being created at the precipice
79:36 of the plasma ball on the inside of
79:39 earth and the first slowing death slowed
79:42 down particles that turn into atoms
79:44 right a lot of carbon down there and a
79:47 lot of hydrogen down there
79:49 well they eventually get crushed inside
79:53 the crust of the earth what's crude oil
79:57 we'll go look it up just go look it up
80:00 on Wikipedia you're gonna have an
80:02 inverse equation lots of carbon less
80:05 hydrogen there methane is the opposite
80:07 ratio lots of hydrogen one carbon when
80:11 you crush it you're going to be crushing
80:13 more of the non flammable stuff because
80:17 if it was flammable would have burned
80:18 away so this non flammable carbon gets
80:20 in there and reverses the polarity of
80:22 the molecule how do we refine gas okay
80:28 do you put crew on your car or Depot gas
80:30 in your car is your gasoline the same as
80:33 diesel gasoline versus unleaded versus
80:35 all these high-octane super fuels jet
80:38 fuel and kerosene and same thing got
80:41 some racecar gas it's like it was 105
80:44 octane hmm have you seen a refinery they
80:51 essentially boil in gigantic pipes cruel
80:57 and what that process does is that gets
81:00 the carbon atoms
81:02 yeah the carbon atoms to move out of the
81:05 crude oil
81:05 it separates the carbon from the
81:07 hydrogen as I've had explained to me the
81:12 heavier gas versions like diesel are at
81:15 the bottom towards the bottom of the
81:16 pipe and the high octane fuels way up
81:19 towards the top of the pipe because it
81:20 weighs less because of the less carbon
81:22 in it remember let it unleaded a little
81:24 thing so all we're doing is returning
81:28 crude oil back to its original state
81:30 which is methane gas now some people
81:33 might say and you know I've seen
81:35 experiments where they they take plants
81:38 and they let them rot and it turns
81:39 straight into carbon and so and kind of
81:43 an oily sticky substance and I see it's
81:45 proof that all the ferns from the
81:47 dinosaur days and the dinosaurs
81:49 themselves all turn into the oil that we
81:53 keep drilling out of the ground no
81:54 matter what when 1894 the Rockefellers
81:59 took a sample of crude oil to I believe
82:03 like some convention like a Geneva type
82:05 convention where they were looking at
82:07 this sort of thing and they had it
82:08 classified as a fossil fuel and how did
82:10 they pull that off and I crazy now if
82:16 you go look up this is the great
82:18 experiment you could do first go look up
82:21 all of the chemicals that are found in
82:23 the spectrum of a coronal mass ejection
82:25 off the surface of the Sun you'll find
82:30 tons of hydrogen some helium in there
82:34 but eventually if you look way down on
82:36 the index a single percent is divided
82:40 into a bunch of different things and
82:41 oxygen is one of the things that they
82:43 find the spectrum why is that well the
82:47 Sun is a big giant pollen space very
82:50 heavy and you have lots of gravity you
82:52 can create fusion right on the surface
82:55 of the Sun if you read a little deeper
82:58 you will find that the they say that the
83:01 center of the Sun is cooler than the
83:02 crust and if that was well big hydrogen
83:05 balled and the center be really hot and
83:07 the outside would be a little bit cooler
83:08 even if it's millions and millions of
83:09 degrees but because the center is most
83:12 likely hollow that's why that happens it
83:15 gets cooler as you go towards the inside
83:16 a sunspot is looking into the bowels of
83:19 a blank
83:19 empty ball so the same infant essa Mille
83:24 amount of oxygen that is found on the
83:26 surface of the Sun is the same
83:28 percentage found in cruel what they did
83:31 was they leveraged this little bit of
83:33 oxygen I mean less than a percent in
83:36 sight crude oil to get it classified as
83:38 a fossil fuel why would they do that why
83:41 would Standard Oil Company want that to
83:44 ever occur it's ingenious
83:46 it's absolutely monetarily ingenious now
83:51 it's always said that by 1830 the
83:54 Rockefeller Standard Oil Company had
83:56 found this process of refining crude oil
83:59 into things that were usable but then
84:02 they had to develop markets to use it
84:03 right you know combustion vehicles
84:05 anything well you fast forward 64 years
84:11 and they hadn't really been able to
84:14 raise the rate of oil because there was
84:16 so much of it on the surface of the
84:18 earth and when they punch a hole in the
84:21 ground just like that you know you see
84:22 Beverly Hillbillies you might think it's
84:24 crazy the jib shot at a rabbit in the
84:27 credits and oil King poking out just
84:30 bubbling out right and that's how it was
84:33 a Texas screw what does it Texas tea
84:36 here's what they said in the song right
84:38 and he moves to Beverly Hills and he's
84:39 really really rich what he did was
84:41 actually technically possible did you'd
84:44 pin a trait the crust of the earth and
84:46 poufy a little bubble looks like a water
84:48 fountain of oil crude oil yeah it was
84:52 that plentiful back in the day after it
84:56 became a fossil fuel Standard Oil for
85:01 the first time was able to significantly
85:03 raise the rate of oil what's that do
85:07 makes them extremely rich right how many
85:11 of you have heard Peak Oil theories
85:13 we're gonna run how to oil
85:15 one of the most asinine things I've ever
85:18 heard of my life and unfortunately the
85:21 amazing red pillar michael rupert fell
85:26 for that one hard core we're never gonna
85:29 run out
85:30 now we can drill it so fast that the
85:33 Earth's natural process of creating it
85:35 slows way way down I mean it's got a
85:37 it's got a standard rate which it
85:38 creates this stuff but my family's been
85:41 in oil and all kinds of different ways I
85:43 got a family that we own land that has a
85:45 low we lease my father worked in oils a
85:47 perforator the wells another family
85:52 member of mine is leased oil wells for
85:56 35 years and then he retired just oil
85:59 oil oil there's one thing that most
86:02 people get an oil don't know until they
86:04 get into it they're like oh my god it's
86:05 a miracle it's an ATM machine you drill
86:08 one well empty just like literally
86:12 sucking on a straw and there's nothing
86:13 there to get that sound right and then
86:15 you go over and drill another part of
86:16 your land and you drill that one empty
86:19 then you come over and survey your
86:21 previous empty hole when it's full again
86:24 the Arabs found this out a long time ago
86:26 they have the sweetest crude in the
86:28 world right there [ __ ] just pops out of
86:30 the planet now I watched an amazing
86:33 documentary by a guy who was a how would
86:38 he call him he's like a father he's a
86:40 preacher that worked for the Alaskan oil
86:43 company I can remember who actually owns
86:45 that up there
86:46 it's like Exxon or somebody I can't find
86:51 this documentary more but right after
86:52 the documentary had no problem doing
86:54 what he said and now I can't find it
86:56 anywhere on the planet he said he had
86:59 made friends with the head of the old
87:01 company up there the guy that was a part
87:03 of that region in charge of that region
87:05 region and he said that you know he got
87:08 into like their circles where they
87:09 smoked cigars and played poker
87:11 drank booze and stuff cuz no one else to
87:14 do up there and he said they just kept
87:16 him closer and closer and closer until
87:18 they finally told him the story of
87:20 figuring out that there was a formula
87:22 that they had figured out in 1979 they
87:24 figure out the entire mathematical
87:25 formula the eco cycle of ecosystem of
87:29 this methane to crude oil to gasoline
87:32 and then that was Infinite you'll find a
87:36 video out there one of the head
87:37 geologists of America talks about being
87:40 in a conference I think he said like
87:42 three years off and on and he's sitting
87:44 to the head geologist of the world and
87:45 said is it a fossil fuel at dinner and a
87:47 guy laughed in his face and he said that
87:50 the idea that ferns and dinosaurs and
87:53 also the crap makes crude oil then we
87:56 have this finite amount of it is BS
87:58 because it's sixteen thousand feet all
88:00 life stops that's just five or three
88:05 miles just three miles down and we don't
88:08 have anymore life but we can find oil as
88:10 far down as we can drill with the
88:11 Russians went over eight miles once
88:13 right so nothing has ever been alive
88:16 down there and you're finding crude oil
88:17 down there will guarantee you it's not
88:19 ferns that drain down into the center of
88:22 the earth the original volcano how it
88:23 works
88:24 it goes up down as much as gravity might
88:27 try to pull so things are kept secret
88:32 because the link to other things I don't
88:37 know exactly why the Titanic was
88:39 concealed in the modern days right they
88:42 could reveal the whole conspiracy today
88:44 but they don't want you to step on this
88:48 other associated thing with the three
88:50 gentlemen we're going to tattletale on
88:52 the Federal Reserve plan we know that
88:57 there is a ton of theories that will
89:01 undermine the confidence of the citizens
89:03 and their government Pearl Harbor was
89:07 orchestrated just go look it up you know
89:12 the Korean War well who knows Fred Franz
89:16 Ferdinand being killed to start World
89:17 War one he was definitely murdered but
89:20 making that the catalyst to start a
89:22 world war is a bit of a stretch the gulf
89:27 of tonkin that starts vietnam war
89:28 totally in the books is never ever
89:30 having occurred but the the catalyzing
89:33 event that LBJ used to reward the
89:35 bankers for his participation in the
89:38 death of JFK go see my episode killing
89:41 our heroes the moon missions well NASA
89:47 is still in business right GPL still in
89:49 business Megan tons of money
89:51 it's a nice little apparatus to move a
89:53 lot of money into shadow projects that
89:56 no citizen would ever approve and so
89:58 it's a cash cow they're selling you
90:01 pictures that's all they're doing rocket
90:03 goes out of your view and the rest is
90:05 all CG now a little preview to probably
90:10 the next episode I'm gonna do here more
90:13 stuff that is being concealed because it
90:16 will reveal all August of last year 2019
90:20 an employee of Google defected out of
90:23 the company and went straight to project
90:25 Veritas with I think when I downloaded
90:29 it was about 350 megabytes of text files
90:32 which if anybody knows how small text
90:35 files are in general a screenplay can
90:37 compress down to like 220 K 120 pages
90:41 there's a lot of data I perused it I
90:45 found one text file that was all of the
90:49 words that are gagged from Google mean
90:52 if you try to search on them they act
90:54 like they don't know what you're talking
90:55 about
90:56 well conclusive proof that a bunch of
91:00 things are exactly what you think they
91:03 are if you've taken the red pill the
91:06 file is full of hundreds and hundreds of
91:09 key phrases and what I found was amazing
91:13 and I I'm I don't know again I haven't
91:16 seen every video on YouTube but no one
91:18 seems to have covered this guy and it
91:20 was strange when he defected they found
91:23 out that he had this these files and
91:27 this is like sick [ __ ] pen they called
91:31 the San Francisco Police Department and
91:34 told them where he lived and then this
91:37 corporation not a psychiatric ward not
91:41 some hospital not some psychologist not
91:44 his family they told the police officers
91:46 that he was mentally unstable and
91:49 probably armed to the teeth and that he
91:53 was a danger to society and he needed to
91:54 be apprehended ASAP that's the official
91:58 story probably some cash in the
92:00 background was going on in San Francisco
92:02 being corrupted who could possibly could
92:05 that go right they have one almost
92:08 corrupt senators on planet earth right
92:10 okay they go to this guy's house during
92:13 the day like in the morning as he tells
92:15 the story I'm probably Barrett oz and
92:17 he's surrounded he lives in like the
92:18 upper part of a strip of apartments like
92:20 there's the businesses down below the
92:22 apartments above it anyone's been in San
92:23 Francisco does that's how that works
92:25 right they surround the whole block cut
92:28 off all the traffic they start bull
92:31 horning him and saying you know you're
92:32 so-and-so
92:33 you need to come out with your hands up
92:35 and he won't come out because he's like
92:37 holy crap they're gonna shoot me now and
92:39 say that I did something and so he gets
92:41 one of his best friends to help him out
92:44 filming he calls him so he comes outside
92:46 and starts filming the door and I guess
92:49 he's far enough away the cops are you
92:50 I've seen the video and he has to come
92:54 out with his hands up
92:55 walking slow I mean just he's in fear of
92:57 being shot dead men tell no tales right
93:00 the Google corporation should be sued
93:04 beyond your wildest dreams what this kid
93:06 had to go through because it was like
93:08 and the San Francisco Police Department
93:09 II to be at least investigated right
93:11 like how could you possibly take a phone
93:13 call from an employer and just buy it
93:16 lock stock and barrel not like well you
93:19 know you need more evidence than just
93:20 you're pissed off a disgruntled employee
93:22 maybe just say he stole something
93:26 intellectual property and then the
93:27 federal marshals have the right to go
93:29 and get it back you know that's probably
93:30 more legit than saying he's not that
93:32 great but this text file I'm gonna say
93:37 just a general estimation it was
93:40 probably 80% full of two types of
93:42 phrases and your preview of what's
93:44 coming up every single false flag
93:52 massacre in this country for the last 15
93:55 years is in this text file whatever you
94:00 want to look up the location I'm not
94:04 gonna name them I'll read them to you in
94:06 the next episode but in addition to all
94:11 of the names and I mean all the places
94:13 are all the names and places like the
94:15 city and the state and maybe the
94:17 institution that was
94:18 and involved in some shooting again I'm
94:22 never gonna say to you that people don't
94:24 get killed in some of these things we
94:26 know some events I think have no
94:28 evidence to prove any one guy killed a
94:30 lot of them plenty of evidence okay but
94:34 the phrase crisis actor was blocked in
94:37 several different ways every way you
94:38 could possibly construe these two words
94:40 together was in this file in addition
94:46 any crisis actor by name that was
94:48 identified with an IMDB acting portfolio
94:53 kid named Hodges is in there must be 20
94:56 entries for Hodges 20 entries for any
95:00 one of the name that has ever been
95:01 pinned down you're not allowed to search
95:04 on their names don't you think that is
95:07 incredibly incredibly revealing and he
95:10 gets on veritas and gets interviewed he
95:11 seemed a little phony to me to be honest
95:15 with you but like almost like they put
95:16 this guy out there to make him look make
95:18 us look at something else maybe he gave
95:20 us files that are misleading us but this
95:23 one file is so damning it's unbelievable
95:25 80% of this file is blocking red pill
95:30 subjects by name by specific name
95:34 everybody could misspell someone's name
95:36 is in there not every single way but
95:39 pretty damn pretty damn covered to block
95:42 it from ever showing up now the one
95:45 stipulation they said which I think is
95:46 absurd is that it was only for mobile
95:49 phones that was at least the file that
95:51 we got was targeted at mobile customers
95:53 but come on one analyzes ever enough
95:56 file right why is it in the database
95:58 with an interface like you know they're
96:00 not maybe they do use flat file lookups
96:02 to make it faster I have no idea but
96:04 you're gonna read it into memory for a
96:06 query you're not gonna read it from a
96:08 file and you're gonna read from the
96:09 database until it's marked as refreshed
96:13 so the interesting thing the reason why
96:15 I'm going to these other things one I
96:16 had more time on my stake but two
96:19 we're always looking for archetypes of
96:23 deceit because this is how you poke
96:27 their eye out you know when you play a
96:30 video game
96:31 take the old Zelda games right if you
96:35 ever battled a Zelda boss it's sort of a
96:38 visual way of looking at an archetype in
96:41 a story what do you do you walk in the
96:44 room there's the bus
96:45 you've never cheated you never looked
96:46 through a walkthrough no-one's ever
96:47 played the game before you just got it
96:49 from the store none of your friends have
96:51 beaten the bosses yet what do you do
96:53 you got certain number of weapons you
96:55 can use rangy you shoot a bunch of
96:56 arrows at the dude and it doesn't seem
96:58 to work he's going through different
96:59 phases in different stages at one point
97:02 his eyeball gets really big and whatever
97:04 and you figure out oh I have to wait for
97:06 him to show his eyeball to me then I
97:08 shoot him with the arrow then I got to
97:09 move out of the way I don't fire him at
97:11 all cuz he's invincible in his face and
97:13 then he's easy boner will pop up a POW
97:15 stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 different
97:18 weapons throw a bomb drop a bomb shoot
97:20 him an arrow I don't want your sword
97:21 eventually the dude dies the dude dies
97:23 eventually right this is how we have to
97:27 do our non-work we're so informed these
97:31 days again because we have been the
97:35 victims of all their crimes they only
97:39 see it from one side they try to
97:40 estimate what it's like to be the victim
97:42 of what they do but they can't quite be
97:45 the victim because they never allow
97:47 themselves to be the victim and so here
97:49 we are getting a you know a PhD and
97:52 being victims of their system we get so
97:56 good at it that we can see it coming
97:58 before it happens
98:00 just ask Bill Cooper if he saw it coming
98:03 right the dudes murdered before the end
98:06 of 2001 because he predicted 9/11 before
98:09 it happened he saw the scene in an
98:10 interview with Osama bin Laden he goes
98:13 ok guys brace yourself it's coming
98:15 they're pushing them they're telling you
98:18 that the government's been looking for
98:19 him as the most wanted target since 1997
98:22 and all of our Intel couldn't find this
98:24 guy in the world
98:26 the Zenon gets a sit-down interview with
98:28 the guy oh really
98:31 okay so bill Cooper called it right boom
98:33 we get this thing that happens blamed on
98:36 this phantom guy who's got a totally
98:39 normal name by the way I think too that
98:42 there's just you knows a fair number of
98:45 people still in existence that take the
98:46 blue pill every morning and they go
98:49 through their you know cognitive
98:52 dissidence all day long and they go back
98:54 to bed and they wake up they take the
98:55 pill again and make sure that nothing
98:56 ever messes up their fragile lifes
99:00 they're used to having everything given
99:02 to them by somebody either their parents
99:04 or the state and so they don't know how
99:06 to get tough and so they can't ingest
99:09 anything stay helicopter flies over
99:14 every little interesting story helps us
99:17 ingest a bigger story
99:19 so you might but you know when people
99:24 learn that the world is not really what
99:26 they think it is that all the history is
99:28 wrong and it's wrong only for one reason
99:31 mainly and we do get things wrong
99:33 organically but it's wrong because it's
99:36 protecting something in a lot of cases
99:39 the Titanic is just one little story
99:43 Stonehenge is just one low story all the
99:47 assassinations are one story the moon is
99:50 a big story he goes on and on and on
99:54 what I like about these little stories
99:56 is that you can tell anybody these
99:58 stories and you know you'll be
100:02 fascinated you'll show someone the MP
100:05 picture from the Olympic on the bottom
100:07 of the ocean and they still act like
100:10 they're completely blind to anything
100:13 probably something most probably
100:15 something I'm is isn't it funny that was
100:18 a Star Trek the motion picture from 79
100:20 had a similar thing where Voyager was
100:24 covered in scum from space and it it
100:29 thought its name was feature it's pretty
100:31 funny right anyway hope you dug the
100:34 episode but want to do this for a very
100:35 very long time
100:37 and so we're gonna try to make the last
100:39 few episodes of this season pretty
100:41 killer
100:41 so hopefully you dug that hopefully you
100:43 didn't mind the digression afterwards
100:45 anyway if you haven't been to deep
100:47 thoughts radio.com

101:09 very kind in this very tumultuous time
101:12 we've had these 50 bucks add it to the
101:16 patreon and the last between the last
101:19 episode in this episode someone gave me
101:22 a good chunk of change from PayPal so
101:25 thank you so much you're all in the
101:27 credits you've been the credits from
101:29 this point forward

101:32 as well there's a store if you wanna get
101:34 some shots keys that will go dead in
101:36 about ten days I guess yeah about ten
101:38 days from today's the 21st and there's a
101:42 whole new remastered season one so you
101:44 will not find the first hundred episodes
101:46 on this channel it's off on a different
101:47 channel I had to do that so I wouldn't
101:49 interrupt all the numbering systems on
101:51 this channel took me a long time to go
101:53 300 episodes but they're all audio
101:54 balanced it's a reference show at the
101:57 beginning but the content is mainly for
101:58 you personally to improve your life all
102:01 kinds of different things there's all
102:02 kinds of cool stuff in season one but I
102:05 had the microphone like right up next to
102:06 my mouth so I didn't know what I was
102:07 doing I apologize but anyway take care
102:12 of yourself in someone else and I will
102:13 see you in the next deep thoughts over
102:15 now
