00:02 [Music]
00:23 you
00:24 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen today we're gonna take on the
00:40 the moon missions again out of massive
00:44 requests from you guys my two first
00:48 videos on this I think episode 26 and
00:50 somewhere around the 160s of season 2 I
00:53 did a second version of it where I
00:55 figured out some more stuff for myself
00:57 those two videos have exploded and just
01:01 recently in the last six months or so
01:03 and so people are like man could you
01:05 please talk about this some more and I
01:08 would be happy to talk about it because
01:10 the lunacy of the whole thing is it ebbs
01:16 and flows right there if you want to
01:21 probably find the people that are
01:22 actively conspiring to keep the moon
01:26 hoax active in our minds you need to
01:29 look at anyone who was involved in
01:31 movies since the moon mission that are
01:36 Pro moon look at everyone who was the
01:39 executive producers look at the people
01:40 who were financing it
01:42 those are your current forces that are
01:45 keeping up the lie certain actors that
01:48 have been accused of being pedophiles of
01:52 buying little girls they'll be the lead
01:54 actor in the and the movie because
01:56 they're so [ __ ] co-opted they're so
01:58 controlled and by their addictions they
02:02 get stuffed into these films I'll just
02:04 let you do your own exploration this
02:07 year we have a new film and because of
02:09 copyright and also their lunacy [ __ ]
02:12 going on until our president starts to
02:14 lay down some [ __ ] laws and say
02:17 people can talk about where the [ __ ]
02:19 they want to talk about I'll be a little
02:23 referential this is 2018 so New Moon
02:28 movie comes out and and the big [ __ ]
02:30 controversies they won't put in buzz'
02:33 aldrin pounding in the american flag
02:35 because it was one of the biggest
02:36 [ __ ] reveals that they were on a
02:39 movie set you have actors inside these
02:45 astronaut fits with this reflective
02:47 glass
02:48 such that you can't see their face
02:49 course they got a [ __ ] excuse for it
02:52 they're wearing environmental packs that
02:54 don't actually have anything in them so
02:55 they're not getting fed necessarily
02:57 oxygen maybe they were maybe they
03:00 weren't not sure but they're hot as [ __ ]
03:04 inside those suits just like anyone
03:06 who's ever played a character in some
03:07 Disney theme park they sweat their balls
03:12 off inside these things it's 1969 this
03:16 is a fast build this is taking suits
03:18 that aren't necessarily built for a hoax
03:21 putting them on a movie set and then you
03:23 got to chill it down you have to chill
03:25 it down so you run gigantic air
03:28 conditioners and so when the actor buzz
03:32 not buzz aldrin but the CIA guy who's
03:36 putting this thing in this [ __ ] soil
03:37 either in the desert in some crazy
03:40 soundstage which is my personal opinion
03:43 the flag is flopping left and right like
03:47 crazy no atmosphere on the moon
03:49 and of course the [ __ ] geniuses the
03:53 geniuses at NASA said Oh buzz hit the
03:56 flagpole with his foot no evidence of
03:59 that or shook it with his hand and it
04:02 was going up the kinetic energy was
04:04 going up transferring a thousand percent
04:06 [ __ ] augmentation to the original
04:08 force meaning you touch it with your
04:10 fingertip and it's [ __ ] you no atom
04:12 bomb at the end and this Flags is
04:14 [ __ ] going crazy
04:14 absolutely [ __ ] absurd in any of
04:16 you've ever played a video game a lot of
04:20 your baby boomers never even played
04:22 donkey tone for chrissake but you've got
04:23 all this [ __ ] authority about what
04:25 happened and what didn't happen
04:27 we have physics engines now inside of
04:30 computer games there are a thousand
04:33 percent correct the other thing that
04:35 isn't correct is if we have to soften
04:37 the physics because the human being
04:38 can't control the game such as a racing
04:41 game or some sort of game that requires
04:43 that you really have a $0.05 body to
04:46 deal with the objects so programming and
04:49 true physics is easy today transfer of
04:52 energy easy
04:54 potential energy easy
04:58 but what's been happening recently since
05:00 these to move videos of mine have been
05:02 picked up again by somebody I don't know
05:03 who I get this request to cover this
05:08 topic a lot but also I'm getting a
05:11 really unified comment and it's bizarre
05:14 because the comments been going on and
05:16 on and on for six months and the six
05:18 month comment is once I step back and
05:21 looked at this I looked at the lunar
05:24 lander I looked at the Apollo capsule I
05:27 looked at the fact that they want me to
05:29 believe that a bullet-head object right
05:31 the lunar module the capsule that comes
05:34 back down somehow will turn around
05:37 and glide it in on its butt as if
05:41 there's any ability an aerodynamic
05:45 history for that to occur for a bullet
05:47 to essentially be traveling straight
05:49 towards your face with the pointy end
05:51 towards your head and it just just cause
05:53 you fire a little retrorocket it turns
05:55 around and uses its ass yeah yeah that's
05:59 that's possible so we have some super
06:02 bad science super bad science and it was
06:07 really just sort of science fiction when
06:09 they were developing this whole mission
06:11 to the moon it was science fiction now
06:14 symbolically these steps need to occur
06:17 probably a multi-stage rocket if we
06:19 don't have [ __ ] anti-gravity which
06:21 I'm sure we do some poor someplace
06:23 locked away but if we have to use a
06:24 propellant we're gonna have to maybe
06:29 start from a space station move our ass
06:31 over to the moon we're gonna have to
06:34 achieve an orbit we're gonna have to put
06:35 something down there
06:36 it's gonna have to get it to ass back
06:38 into space is gonna have to find
06:41 propellant to get home and it's a long
06:44 journey people it's a long journey again
06:47 the space station averages 250 to 350
06:53 hundred miles up in the sky earth is
06:56 eight thousand miles approximately
06:58 across and again my analogy that you
07:01 have to repeat to yourself and to your
07:03 family is that if you took the average
07:06 distance between the floor and an
07:08 eight-foot ceiling you flip it into
07:10 metric to keep it
07:11 every centimeters about a thousand miles
07:14 up
07:15 there's 237 centimeters to the top of
07:19 the ceiling in your house every
07:22 millimeter equals a hundred miles so at
07:27 best we're about three and a half
07:29 millimeters off the [ __ ] ground
07:31 today and they want you to believe in
07:34 1969 they were able to do it from 1969
07:38 to 1972 seven missions six that landed
07:41 from the floor to the ceiling Circle up
07:45 their land have no [ __ ] health
07:47 problems whatsoever come back and land
07:49 right you have to be at almost like an
07:56 ice pick lobotomy patient to believe
07:59 that that is possible and the stupider
08:02 that you are the easier it is for you to
08:04 believe and that's the goddamn truth and
08:06 I'm really sorry about that
08:08 1969 how many people in the world had
08:10 technical jobs how many people had
08:12 technical things that they had to learn
08:13 in order to be a part of society a
08:18 fraction 19 50 percent of the world was
08:23 in a technical position I would I would
08:25 guess that the average person count and
08:27 percentage of the Earth's surface that
08:30 touched a computer on average or gotten
08:34 Danny like ISO based I think the guy so
08:37 existed I'm not sure I saw based
08:40 manufacturing Sigma six military project
08:44 management methodology one two percent
08:47 of the population of the world so yeah
08:50 when this stuff's hit in the airwaves in
08:52 1969 of course everybody believes that
08:56 it is the most technical thing that
08:58 they've ever seen
09:00 but today in 2018 how many people have
09:03 touched a computer how many people can
09:05 program the computer in one way or
09:07 another right how many people are
09:10 familiar with ISO 9000 plus
09:15 manufacturing techniques I know someone
09:18 who works for SpaceX I know all kinds of
09:22 technical people and now it's a lot
09:24 different
09:25 to pump this crap down people's throats
09:28 because people starting to look at the
09:29 whole cycle and they understand when you
09:32 want to do something simple like hey
09:33 we're going to create smart volume for a
09:35 television but it doesn't exist yet they
09:38 know they're looking at a year two years
09:40 worth of research just to do something
09:41 as silly as make some volume detection
09:45 system some average algorithm that can
09:48 smooth all the sound out what America
09:54 went from almost having no rocketry to
09:56 getting ourselves on the moon mm-hmm
10:01 one of the big things that people are
10:03 noticing is the Apollo Lander is
10:05 probably the silliest looking thing
10:09 you've ever seen in your life
10:11 there's evidence that there's tent poles
10:15 like when you go down to buy a tent in
10:17 1968 some of the equipment that you
10:20 would use to hold up tent together is on
10:23 that unit you got these frumpy [ __ ]
10:26 legs and you've just because you cover
10:29 it in reflective foil all sudden it
10:31 looks technical the cabin isn't big
10:34 enough for the astronauts especially
10:36 when they're fully inflated I mean one
10:38 of the nephews of one of the astronauts
10:40 measured the door and said this isn't
10:42 big enough for anyone to get it out of
10:43 how do you figure was just 24 inches in
10:48 diameter can you imagine being a human
10:50 body crawling through a two foot hole
10:52 you know your average hallways 36 inches
10:55 folks but now you're gonna be strapped
10:57 on with an inflated suit with a big
10:59 giant environmental pack on the back
11:01 oopsy now you got an astronaut that's
11:03 nearly three feet wide three feet thick
11:05 not gonna fit through that hole
11:07 oopsie you really don't need any more
11:11 evidence than one of these smoking guns
11:13 to pull your head out of your ass and
11:14 just go oh I'm not sure exactly who did
11:16 it why they did it
11:17 but we didn't do it I mean the hoax got
11:20 done right but Hollywood keeps a steady
11:23 beat don't they they keep a steady beat
11:25 of moon hoax revisionist history
11:28 [ __ ] which technically should be
11:31 illegal to be reported as news now if
11:37 you want to tell a fictional story about
11:38 what if we
11:39 had actually gone that's great but
11:42 probably getting something as the truth
11:44 when it's true propaganda and lies to
11:45 the people
11:46 shouldn't that be illegal shouldn't that
11:50 be illegal the one that burns my ass for
11:53 anybody who's trying to say that we did
11:55 go is they don't know anything about
11:56 project Orion project Orion was a
12:00 mission launched inside of NASA to do
12:05 several flights I don't know if you call
12:10 it a mission it's a division or
12:11 something a project a plan to put human
12:18 flesh through the Van Allen belts
12:19 because no one could do it because the
12:23 Van Allen belts are lethal and they know
12:25 they're lethal they're lethal way before
12:27 the 1,000 mile altitude mark were they
12:30 are at their full first full capacity
12:33 now again just like amperage and
12:35 electricity you could have one volt at
12:38 200 amps and it's a lot more intense
12:41 than one volt at 20 amps it's the amount
12:44 that flows over a particular unit of
12:46 time so when you position yourself in
12:49 the Van Allen belts especially at the
12:50 poles North Pole in the South Pole
12:52 the amperage is insane because that's
12:55 where it's all coming out of the top of
12:57 the earth and it's all going back in the
12:59 bottom of the earth super [ __ ]
13:01 powerful but of course they tell Joe
13:02 Rogan they [ __ ] steered the goddamn
13:04 Saturn 5 through a hole in the North
13:08 Pole which has got to be the most
13:10 ludicrous [ __ ] thing I've ever heard
13:12 on coast-to-coast in my [ __ ] life oh
13:15 they did that but they never put it in
13:18 the history books mm-hmm and because an
13:20 artist draws the Van Allen belts is
13:22 having a little hole at the top they
13:24 think there's actually a hole at the top
13:25 sorry folks rain to hold the top and you
13:28 couldn't make a right angle [ __ ] turn
13:30 to get through it even if there was one
13:32 risk a little hung out today but what
13:37 happens with Project Orion they
13:38 announced this thing and immediately
13:39 everyone with their head other ass and
13:41 who knows that we didn't go the moon
13:42 goes well yeah Wow amazing they just
13:44 admitted we didn't go to the moon they
13:46 just admitted it because they supposedly
13:48 did this again 14 [ __ ] times in fact
13:52 more net 16 times at least maybe even 18
13:55 times anytime they go to the moon circle
13:58 and come back even in a pre Apollo 10
14:02 I think Paolo eight did it too something
14:05 like that
14:06 they they said they went through it and
14:09 they survived and a quarter-inch thick
14:10 aluminum capsule absolute [ __ ]
14:14 because you would need Project Orion if
14:17 you did it you wouldn't need it
14:19 so what's Project Orion do they build a
14:22 capsule looks like the Apollo capsule
14:23 okay then they launch it unmanned first
14:26 just to take sensor readings because
14:28 they don't know kind of what they're
14:29 getting into why don't they know what
14:31 they're getting into would you lose the
14:33 [ __ ] data didn't even matter if you
14:35 lose the data because they didn't talk
14:37 about this this belt existing back in
14:38 the 60s even though I think it was
14:41 theorized to exist but they push all
14:44 these astronauts through it supposedly
14:45 and they all come back safe mm-hmm
14:49 mission flies once they take a bunch of
14:52 sensor readings and they cancel the
14:53 project
14:54 I imagine this what if you put the
14:59 capsule up there and the readings are
15:02 zero it's totally not as lethal as they
15:05 thought it was no problem well then you
15:08 can just keep the part you can cancel
15:09 the project and flash not through it all
15:11 the time in fact you could debunk right
15:13 away the fact that the Van Allen belts
15:15 have been sensationalized up in the pop
15:17 culture of conspiracy on YouTube but
15:19 they actually have no force whatsoever
15:21 meanwhile all of the [ __ ] that comes
15:23 from the Sun all these meteorites and
15:24 everything that comes at earth gets
15:26 fended off by this exact shield I mean
15:30 it's a invisible electromagnetic shield
15:33 but is so [ __ ] powerful you can't
15:35 even see the damn thing that offends off
15:37 a 99 plus percent I'll rate of all solar
15:41 radiation coming at Earth pretty amazing
15:44 pretty amazing bart sibrel who I
15:48 interviewed last season the gentleman
15:51 that made funny thing happened on the
15:53 way of the moon and astronauts gone wild
15:54 to videos you have to see if you care
15:56 about this whole movement said that he
15:59 went to NASA and said can I have the
16:01 data at least of the radiation readings
16:03 from this
16:06 project Orion and they said nope sir
16:08 it's a matter of national security
16:10 you said what the [ __ ] you talking about
16:13 how much radiation is in the space is a
16:16 national security issue are you kidding
16:18 me
16:18 I suppose it's national security of how
16:21 much radiation comes off the Sun or the
16:25 moon all right can't know how the
16:28 universe is built because it's a matter
16:29 of national security what are you
16:31 [ __ ] kidding me they didn't want to
16:34 admit on paper that it's impossible to
16:38 go through them with the current
16:39 technology therefore the moon missions
16:41 definitely did not occur between 69 72
16:43 they don't want to admit it but
16:46 inadvertently they did they canceled the
16:50 project that's over hmm
16:53 we know they didn't go we do but why
16:58 keep beating it up well I say because
17:02 they keep trying to shove it down our
17:03 throat they make a movie when we make an
17:07 episode on YouTube they make another
17:09 movie we make another episode we have to
17:13 kill this [ __ ] because this idea that
17:17 they can lie to us and we swallow it up
17:20 has got to be destroyed we already have
17:25 almost zero accountability with
17:27 government to the people right there's
17:30 you know big change going on here in
17:33 America but the battle isn't won yet so
17:39 we must continue fighting so now what
17:42 are the alternatives to lying about
17:45 going to the moon because there's all
17:47 kinds of different tactics that they
17:49 talk about why did they why did they lie
17:51 well we're the cold war with Russia true
17:55 someone might say post all of this well
17:59 this was to inspire kids to get into
18:03 technology all right well that
18:05 definitely occurred I haven't heard
18:07 anyone put it directly on point besides
18:08 myself but I think that's the case I'm
18:11 sure people have made that point
18:13 for the finance ears of the entire thing
18:15 it was a profit based venture I think in
18:19 one of Bart's movies he itemized it at
18:22 the time again you have to prorate the
18:25 money up but like almost ten billion
18:27 dollars basically was invested into the
18:29 Apollo missions and that's the 10 years
18:32 up to the Apollo missions plus the three
18:36 years of the afaik landings now I think
18:40 what's probably the case for most folks
18:44 is most folks in the world have already
18:48 made up their mind whether or not
18:49 they're gonna believe this [ __ ] or
18:50 they're not gonna believe this
18:52 what's interesting is I've seen a lot of
18:54 buzz from Europe which is very
18:56 encouraging that says something to the
18:59 effect of I think someone's even posted
19:00 on lock's Facebook page you Americans
19:03 are the only ones that believe that you
19:05 went to the moon I like that I liked it
19:09 I hope that's true because then we can
19:12 address our own systemic illness now for
19:16 whatever reason America innovates really
19:18 well we do we invent tons of crap all
19:22 right we don't invent at all though we
19:25 don't do too bad so why say that because
19:31 one of the things I think we're trying
19:33 to innovate and create and instill and
19:36 protect supposed to be Donald Trump in
19:38 office is truth in government some of
19:42 you might roll your eyes and laugh your
19:43 ass off at that statement believe me I
19:45 understand where your cynicism comes
19:47 from yeah maybe we're getting played
19:50 maybe everyone's getting played who
19:51 knows right but we're seeing an awful
19:55 lot of super [ __ ] evil people go down
19:58 from CEOs of Google to CEOs of film
20:04 companies even the Pope is having a few
20:08 problems these days lots of people are
20:11 not running for office again lots of
20:15 people were posing for selfies with Isis
20:18 leaders so there's a movement going on
20:22 that might actually help things like
20:25 moon mission
20:27 folks trying to figure out the truth but
20:30 I think at this stage again one of the
20:32 coolest things you can do is just load
20:33 up a picture of the Apollo 11 landing
20:36 take a look at it just bring up a really
20:38 good picture I just look at it for a
20:42 second and ask yourself really is that
20:47 it is that what you would design if you
20:49 had to land on the [ __ ] moon right
20:53 and why do I say like that because at
20:55 the time we were only partially
20:59 convinced that we knew what the moon was
21:01 made out of for all we knew it was quick
21:05 seen for all we knew again it was seems
21:09 to hold its form but what do we know we
21:13 supposedly put a 10,000 pound thrust
21:15 engine on the bottom of this thing to
21:16 blast down to keep us from you know
21:18 smacking into the surface really hard
21:20 but for what we knew it was the loosest
21:23 soil on planet moon on the moon and it
21:26 would have flown away and dug a huge
21:28 crater and it would have been stuck in
21:30 it and they theorized that that might
21:32 occur you see out the window the video
21:36 of all that [ __ ] soil swimming away
21:39 from the bottom of the craft but by the
21:41 time it lands all five legs that there's
21:43 five legs are dust free because they
21:46 [ __ ] up when they lowered it down onto
21:48 the set even that funny they made so
21:54 many mistakes with Apollo 11 and Bart
21:56 Saburo was so brilliant and figuring out
21:58 that that's all he needed to go for was
22:01 Apollo 11 that they hate it now they
22:05 hate having to cover up for these old
22:07 mistakes but what's happening today
22:12 where's the Space Shuttle nah doesn't
22:15 fly anymore does it what do you see out
22:17 of NASA at all at 60 million dollars a
22:20 day and that's before Jeep GP LS budget
22:24 60 million a day to keep NASA alive hey
22:28 I'm all for really cool research jobs
22:30 but there's not a single project in NASA
22:32 that's going after the zero-point energy
22:35 system don't you think they should
22:38 [ __ ] try to make that
22:40 oh all right we're on a petrol dollar
22:42 system so we can't have nice things
22:44 because we have to keep these elite
22:46 [ __ ] in the world alive by
22:48 selling a barrel of oil hmm not a single
22:53 project in the world and I'm taking that
22:55 from dr. Steven Greer from the
22:57 disclosure project he said it and when
23:01 he said it I couldn't unhear it you're
23:03 absolutely right sir why not now I think
23:07 he works for them but he's got to say
23:11 something to gain credibility with us
23:12 and I think that's a good one we
23:13 shouldn't forget so we don't have a
23:16 shuttle anymore we're not going to the
23:18 moon anymore what's happening well
23:21 everything is being split off into sub
23:23 companies like SpaceX this weird [ __ ]
23:28 anomaly named Elon Musk who if there
23:32 ever was a guy in public who looked like
23:34 an absolutely persecuted MKULTRA dude it
23:37 would be Elon Musk a guy who is ever
23:41 nervous artistically brilliant but he
23:46 seems like he just comes out of a
23:48 dungeon of absolute [ __ ] mental and
23:50 physical torture it's like they clean up
23:52 all the cart contusions and bruises and
23:55 Nicks and cuts and they put him on TV
23:57 they put him on a stage to demonstrate a
23:59 product and he just fumbles through that
24:01 [ __ ] thing as if he's never been
24:03 around people before and maybe it's due
24:05 to a true autistic nature of his mind
24:08 I'm sure he actually islets istic and a
24:10 good way and like the Rain Man way
24:13 definitely not a dumb guy but what is he
24:17 he's the tip of the spear and
24:20 unfortunately I think that Spears got
24:22 some poison in the tip I'm not sure it's
24:25 his fault is that ever any of these kids
24:29 faults were put up there at the top
24:32 Lacy's calling out pedophilia on a
24:34 couple people like that's kind of cool
24:36 but now if you reduce NASA to a legal
24:39 liability standpoint having lied to the
24:41 people and stolen money from a
24:42 particular series of countries the
24:46 attorneys are going to say okay how do
24:49 we get out of this problem well I think
24:52 pedophilia will help us understand
24:54 NASA's gonna get out of this problem
24:57 jimmy savile died in the UK having been
25:00 one of the biggest child traffickers on
25:03 planet earth but he got away scot-free
25:08 and how'd he get away scot-free he died
25:09 didn't he all right well what is NASA
25:14 NASA isn't a human being I mean
25:15 technically on paper it is because it's
25:17 a corporation you have two layers of
25:20 reality for a corporation you've got the
25:22 corporation itself which is a piece of
25:24 paper and some [ __ ] vault somewhere
25:26 but then you have the heads of state of
25:28 the organization that made the decisions
25:31 at the time that the hoax or hoaxes were
25:33 actually being perpetrated on the people
25:38 all right so we need two things to occur
25:43 first and foremost we need to stop the
25:45 hoaxes at NASA which is probably
25:47 impossible at this point because of so
25:49 many [ __ ] lies that they tell so many
25:51 the projects that they have are a
25:53 complete [ __ ]
25:54 how could they stop seriously the camp
25:59 but at least the severity and the
26:01 expense of what they do can be slowed
26:03 down a little bit right there's no
26:05 Apollo mission sucking billions and
26:07 billions of dollars out of the people
26:08 all right
26:09 but now the people that actually
26:11 participated in these crimes have to die
26:12 too or be so old that no one would touch
26:15 them because they're in a hospice or
26:17 whatever well that certainly occurred
26:19 how many people were alive today that
26:22 participated at NASA at any high
26:24 decision level during the moon hoaxes I
26:27 would wager none Wernher von Braun died
26:30 before 1980 and I would put money on the
26:35 fact that however he died was
26:36 orchestrated because he wasn't playing
26:39 along anymore I think he'd passed away
26:41 in 78
26:42 that's just my hunch
26:45 so you take NASA and you divide it up
26:48 into pieces and of course it's been run
26:51 by the clown organizations the alphabet
26:54 agencies for a long long time its entire
26:56 objective was to you know move Nazis
26:59 from from Germany over to here through
27:03 Project Paperclip using the Dulles
27:05 brothers as a nice agent to pull this
27:08 off half of them go off to the alphabet
27:10 agencies in half and go off to NASA
27:12 rotor von Braun who engineered the v1 of
27:15 v2 rockets that killed the [ __ ] out of
27:17 people indiscriminately is in charge
27:18 she's cleansed in the eyes of the people
27:20 right [ __ ] unbelievable right it's
27:24 like Hannibal [ __ ] liked her becoming
27:25 a daycare teacher some Boy Scout leader
27:30 after all the things he did but you take
27:36 it up and you can part mentalize it just
27:37 like the little pie piece in Trivial
27:39 Pursuit right spacex takes part of it
27:45 the new space core i think is what they
27:48 call it the trump organization
27:50 there's a lot more significant that i
27:52 think people understand if q and on is
27:55 correct and i believe that he is and i
27:57 believe that he's legit and he's not
27:58 alarp a live-action role-playing
28:00 exercise especially after John McCain's
28:03 death John became a being put to death
28:08 should I say this planet is utterly
28:10 surrounded by Intelligence Agency
28:12 satellites that are not operating under
28:16 any rule of law and they spy there's
28:23 also weapons up their weapons with all
28:26 kinds of capabilities scary weapons like
28:30 directed-energy weapons that can zap me
28:33 in this backyard they could zap me in
28:36 this backyard and leave my clothing
28:38 pretty much unscathed and they can use
28:42 the infinite power of the Van Allen
28:43 belts to harvest electrons into power to
28:48 run any one of these satellites that are
28:50 up far enough right so you need an
28:53 agency to go up there and clean up space
28:54 to commandeer and kill the big bird
28:57 satellites up there
28:59 they're doing heinous things monitoring
29:01 communications intercepting everything
29:03 everything that's beamed into the sky
29:05 isn't necessarily beamed in a straight
29:07 line folks right it's a big conical
29:10 sheep it's like an ice-cream cone at the
29:12 base is the tip and as it goes up it
29:14 starts to spread out like an ice-cream
29:16 cone all you got to do is put a
29:18 satellite in that little area and you
29:20 can get a copy everything you could
29:23 invade a communication satellites
29:25 firmware and have a duplicate sent off
29:27 to a done location encrypted even I
29:31 think we're in the very first stages of
29:33 NASA being divided up into pieces and
29:35 privatized into the private sector and
29:38 then NASA can go away and with it it
29:41 will bury all of its crimes and after
29:45 some decades pass we'll be able to tell
29:47 our kids and tell the world that we
29:48 actually didn't go to the moon because
29:51 if anyone were to get there they would
29:52 look down and go oh [ __ ] nothing is
29:55 there
29:55 where they said they landed six times
29:57 and put up flags and drove [ __ ]
29:59 Chrysler's everywhere those things don't
30:01 exist up there but I assure you one
30:04 thing what they're going to attempt to
30:06 do is to find believable locations and
30:09 put all those objects up there they're
30:13 gonna look at photographs and try to
30:14 drive the car and generally the path
30:16 that the car was recorded having driven
30:18 in the previous footage they're going to
30:22 artificially age American flags and put
30:24 them up there they're gonna build these
30:25 ludicrous [ __ ] Lander kickstands
30:28 because you know the top part comes back
30:30 again just to visit the technology that
30:33 would be required to pull this thing off
30:35 is really truly mind-numbing ly
30:39 amazingly stupid that we believed that
30:41 they could pull this off
30:42 and in the quick short time that they
30:45 have and I'll tell you what there's a
30:47 few maneuvers that they were never able
30:48 to test ever until they did it the most
30:54 delicate maneuver that I'm aware of is
30:56 when the lunar module the the actual and
30:59 habbit habitants capsule blasts off okay
31:03 some miraculous engine in it with no
31:07 propellant you know goes back up to
31:10 space again there's very little gravity
31:12 supposedly
31:13 supposed to 1/6 gravity but if you again
31:15 roll all the moon footage 2x you'll find
31:18 it's real time which is not one-sixth
31:19 gravity right they would have needed to
31:22 over crank the camera six times as fast
31:27 as normal so film takes 24 frames per
31:30 second to become animated in a movie
31:32 theater at the time so just think about
31:34 that talking almost a hundred and thirty
31:37 frames per second is how fast it would
31:38 have to move the camera back in those
31:40 days to really capture what one-sixth
31:41 gravity might look like but anyway when
31:44 this thing is going back up and
31:46 attaching to the capsule to get the two
31:51 astronauts back inside so they can turn
31:52 around and fly home that is a maneuver
31:55 you can't practice anywhere on earth
31:58 you can only practice it on the moon
32:00 because you need the moon's gravity you
32:02 need the environment and they never ever
32:06 [ __ ] it up once it just worked and
32:09 some people just again they have no
32:12 technical aptitude which is fine but
32:15 they just believe anything that they're
32:16 told because they want to believe that
32:18 they believe in mathematics they believe
32:19 mathematics accounts for everything ok
32:22 mm-hmm
32:23 once you ask a general how far the plane
32:25 goes for war they strategize and
32:29 strategize inside of computer
32:30 simulations and they win but when they
32:34 first fired the first bullet on that
32:36 plan the Jenners will tell you that the
32:39 plan disappears oh it's a general
32:42 figment ation that's generally going in
32:44 that direction but it's not it's not
32:50 gonna happen the way that they simulated
32:53 it in the Whopper computer it's a
32:57 general approximation well let me tell
33:00 you let me ask you this question let's
33:02 put that way in this gigantic thing
33:05 called space okay look up in this guy
33:09 how many planes would you have to fly
33:11 over your house to get a collision quite
33:14 a few the inverse is correct in that if
33:18 they made the tiniest tiniest tiniest
33:22 little mistake in that little
33:26 recho were little rocket or whatever
33:28 that took that little module and put it
33:29 into space again off the moon surface
33:31 here comes the the module the capsule
33:36 coming around to rendezvous with this
33:37 thing can you imagine the absolute
33:41 precision if they were off a micron a
33:44 nanosecond of trajectory of angle of
33:48 degree of thrust if even the propellant
33:51 inside the little rocket wasn't stacked
33:53 up uniformly inside the Rockets a little
33:56 sputter a little bit would not put it in
34:00 the place is supposed to be I would put
34:03 it in the place it's not supposed to be
34:04 and they would miss but they never did
34:08 did they it was picture perfect every
34:10 single time okay
34:14 smartest people in the whole universe
34:16 maybe could pull that off not us okay I
34:22 mean it what's funny about it is you
34:24 have cars at the same time probably
34:27 getting an average of like 16 to 20
34:29 miles to the gallon we hadn't even
34:33 really put together seatbelts as a
34:35 mandatory thing I mean it was it was
34:36 coming like a 73 or so seatbelts became
34:39 mandatory that we have junk technology
34:43 all over the earth and the here they are
34:46 inventing magic technology up there in
34:48 space all right out of sight out of mind
34:51 the lunacy pardon the pun of it all is
34:55 ridiculous and I think the reason one of
34:58 the reasons why those of us who follow
35:00 it follow it is because it's really
35:04 disheartening to have adults okay tell
35:12 you that we went to the moon and then
35:13 try to tell you what political candidate
35:15 you're supposed to vote for to tell you
35:19 anything about the world at all oh okay
35:22 mom dad grandma grandpa you believe in
35:25 this complete [ __ ] which means your
35:28 ability to float yourself a bunch of
35:32 crap a bunch of Lies is pretty
35:34 effortless we know that you don't really
35:37 care about what is true and what is
35:38 false because you won't do a single bit
35:40 research in anything and now everything
35:43 you've ever told me for your entire life
35:45 has to be flushed down the toilet at a
35:49 minimum at a minimum if I have some
35:51 guttural bloodline and respect for you I
35:54 might might take some of what I'm about
35:57 to flush down the toilet
35:58 and put it in an evaluation pile over
36:01 here to see ya maybe they were able to
36:04 hang on to some form of reality or maybe
36:06 they got some knowledge from a great
36:07 grandparent of their own who actually
36:10 did care about the truth
36:12 maybe as before a propaganda I've ran
36:14 the world and so there are some tidbits
36:16 there but that's how fundamental this
36:19 problem is in my opinion my preference
36:23 is to catch him before it's all over
36:25 because the nice thing is is I think all
36:28 the heads of state of NASA today haven't
36:30 inherited the crime and so there's a
36:32 different type of evaluation judicial
36:37 process and persecution for someone
36:43 inheriting a crime I don't think we have
36:46 to go balls-out on them I don't think
36:47 they have to be sentenced to jail for
36:49 the rest of their life by any means I
36:51 think we just need to simply say okay I
36:53 see you inherited the drug trafficking
36:57 problem that the offload agencies
36:58 created to fund themselves and you know
37:01 obviously when you got the job you
37:02 didn't know what was going on but they
37:04 briefed you on your first day and told
37:07 you what the consequences were if you
37:08 were to reveal it hey we get what you
37:11 went along with it we do you can't
37:13 exactly whistle blow if the next thing
37:14 that's going to happen is your brains
37:16 are splattered all over a wall but in
37:19 the 60s okay
37:21 NASA conspired against the world
37:25 conspired against anyone paying tax
37:27 dollars into the organization to lie to
37:29 them now it's not clear if they actually
37:33 were intending on faking this thing from
37:36 the very beginning when Kennedy said we
37:37 should do it I'm gonna hold out maybe
37:41 I'm naive that that wasn't the direct
37:44 objective that they were going to try
37:46 and do it
37:47 I think they believed that the Russians
37:49 were doing things that the Russians
37:50 weren't doing I'm not sure of all the
37:52 claims that Russia made it being true
37:54 first men in space first woman in space
37:56 first two vehicles in space first moon
37:58 while our spacewalk excuse me first
38:01 satellite Sputnik seems fairly
38:02 believable we weren't able to move any
38:06 aircraft that fast and beam stuff down
38:08 to earth but I think it is interesting
38:11 that the the Russians probably could
38:15 have leveraged their knowledge about
38:16 what we did and faked the mission of
38:20 their own but they had a bit of a
38:22 problem
38:23 I think they couldn't quite get the
38:24 Saturn 5 type rocket that they were
38:27 building because they were building a
38:29 massive goddamn rocket to get to the
38:31 moon and it was much more powerful than
38:33 ours right there boosters again were
38:35 archived in 1973 in Siberia in a
38:39 warehouse and NASA asked permission to
38:43 open that warehouse in 1995 and they
38:45 bought those boosters and immediately
38:48 found that they were two-and-a-half
38:50 times more powerful than all the
38:51 boosters that we had built up to 1995
38:53 people the whole Saturn 5 hoax is based
38:58 on the f1 booster which schematics had
39:00 never been revealed they said they found
39:02 some on the bottom the ocean but they
39:05 won't reveal them to us because kids can
39:09 put them in simulation packages today
39:10 and find out that they do not have the
39:12 thrust that they said they did the
39:13 Russians had perfected a technique of
39:15 basically creating a turbo such that the
39:19 unspent fuel would go back into the
39:20 rocket and be spent so it was extremely
39:22 efficient and they didn't go now again
39:27 back to the idea that America innovates
39:29 things really well we in effect we
39:31 innovate things really really well and I
39:33 think we're gonna innovate the next
39:35 version of freedom in this planet I
39:37 think that's what we're doing right now
39:38 Europe is helping Canada is helping
39:42 people from all around the world who are
39:44 following the Cuban on movement and
39:45 again regardless that this guy is
39:46 telling the truth or not
39:48 so I definitely think he is there is a
39:53 movement to take over this planet from
39:55 the bankers put them away forever
39:59 restructure all law in the world such
40:02 that it will become illegal to engage in
40:05 Ussery
40:05 it will be illegal to engage in fee
40:08 currencies that are not controlled
40:09 completely transparent to the people
40:12 meaning debt versus interest which
40:15 should be not allowed
40:19 compound interest should be absolutely
40:21 outlawed around the world
40:22 it's called usury it's horrible destroys
40:24 lives it's an impossible algorithm you
40:26 can't possibly pay off but the one thing
40:32 we really don't talk about which I want
40:34 to use to close off this episode for a
40:37 few tens of minutes is how do we get
40:41 there how do we get to the moon and is
40:45 it important that we ever get to the
40:46 moon right there's of course folks that
40:49 are flat earthers that believe that the
40:50 moon is 3,200 miles up because that's
40:53 what the Sexton says it is and them and
40:56 the Sun is also said to be 3,200 miles
40:58 up with a Sexton again they're the same
41:01 [ __ ] size during a black hole Sun
41:04 Eclipse right pretty astronomically
41:10 against right random rock in space
41:13 random distance from other rock in space
41:16 that surround a Sun happens to be the
41:19 exact size as the Sun when Eclipse t' i
41:24 think that that is so astronomically
41:27 against it is an IQ test for mankind so
41:31 how do we get there the society need to
41:34 change first before we even tempt this
41:36 whole thing I would wager yes and we're
41:41 not there yet
41:42 so we can't just jump right in and fix
41:44 this issue we have to fix the fabric of
41:48 man because I would say that integrity
41:54 still isn't the most popular cologne in
41:56 this world is it needs to be and I love
42:01 the analogy of a cologne because what
42:03 that really means is you you permeate
42:11 this into the atmosphere you have an
42:13 aura a smell of integrity which means
42:16 you tell the truth and your word is bond
42:18 hey you might accidentally say something
42:21 that isn't
42:22 but it's not because you're trying to
42:23 deceive anyone is simply because you
42:25 were misinformed or you made an
42:27 assumption that it didn't turn out to be
42:28 correct you still have integrity you're
42:32 trying and to that effect that you make
42:35 a mistake
42:36 to the extent you making a mistake you
42:38 go back to your constituents the people
42:41 that you had the discussion with and you
42:43 tell them hey I am very sorry that
42:45 didn't turn out to be true I thought it
42:47 was and this is where I got my
42:49 information and this is why I was
42:50 convinced that it was true but it wasn't
42:51 true and you'll find people cut you
42:54 slack now obviously if you make a huge
42:56 habit of miss reading everything in the
42:58 world you will most likely end up the
43:00 ESOP fable the boy who called wolf right
43:02 so first and foremost truth and
43:05 integrity has to become the platform the
43:10 substrate of which society operates on
43:12 every single second of every single day
43:14 we have to monitor that in each other
43:20 doesn't mean you can't say a dirty word
43:22 here and there just don't say it around
43:24 a little kid or a woman if you can help
43:26 it right sorry ladies I hate to think
43:29 this is an old boys club because it's
43:31 not but then we need what we need a
43:35 shit-ton of technology to pull this
43:37 thing off first and foremost you're
43:40 probably need to figure out these Van
43:41 Allen belts because even if we had zero
43:42 gravity figured out we soft to get some
43:46 sort of capsule that can be protected
43:48 against radiation well I am going to
43:52 cannibalize what has been said to have
43:54 occurred on Mars which I do not think
43:56 any of it has actually occurred no I do
43:58 not believe we have any satellites
43:59 around Mars no or do I think we have any
44:01 Rovers on Mars I simply don't think we
44:03 do I think it's a combination of CG
44:07 terrain technology which has existed
44:10 since the late 80s early 90s again I met
44:13 two gentlemen that developed this for
44:14 JPL in San Diego a long conversation
44:17 with him about it was some bizarre nerd
44:19 behind me he was an albino just a black
44:21 leather with all kinds of Masonic rings
44:23 on his fingers and they said and that
44:24 guy still works for them right now 40
44:27 years later but they specifically said
44:30 they developed terrain simulation
44:33 technology
44:34 starting in 1983 by 1984 they had
44:39 developed spherical gas giant simulators
44:42 for the movie 2010 and Space Odyssey
44:44 directed by Peter Hyams and if you watch
44:46 all of the making of of that movie you
44:49 will find a reel that is actually shot
44:50 inside GPL labs with Jupiter on a
44:53 monitor behind the guy and it is
44:56 beautiful now it's not quite accurate to
44:58 what we see in a telescope but I'm sure
45:00 the refinements have been made at this
45:02 point the reason why Saturn has a
45:04 hexagon on the top is not because
45:06 there's a [ __ ] hexagon on Saturn
45:08 folks it's because that rendering of
45:10 Saturn is in a computer and spherical
45:14 algorithms weren't that great in the 80s
45:18 and so they made a mistake and it has a
45:19 hexagonal path for the light simulation
45:24 for its geometry and they didn't correct
45:27 it so now they're trying to make excuses
45:28 as to why that would occur disregard
45:31 disregard disregard it's all CG folks if
45:36 one thing is certain is that the
45:38 alphabet agencies are probably our
45:41 government has CG at a level that is
45:43 absolutely photo-real we know this
45:45 already you guys have seen videos posted
45:47 by some of our listeners on the lock
45:48 facebook group we can simulate anyone's
45:51 voice anyone's face it's all simulated
45:55 the whole thing is simulated they could
45:57 definitely play my face into the system
45:59 and learn all my facial anomalies with
46:01 sunglasses on and then when they need to
46:03 simulate me saying something to you it's
46:06 a flick of a switch how many hours did
46:09 they have of my voice 400 hours easy
46:11 they got me down I could be your next
46:13 Siri and a [ __ ] telephone right but
46:17 we would send a probe to the moon before
46:19 we would ever send a human being to the
46:21 moon now why would why wouldn't we do
46:23 this in the 60s not quite sure we
46:26 definitely had remote-control cars
46:28 figured out by then I mean I had a
46:30 little Trans Am in 1977 in my house you
46:35 know so I'm sure the government figured
46:39 that out but today in 2018 it's no
46:43 problem right we've got robot technology
46:45 at a level that's insane
46:47 of traversing any terrain whatsoever so
46:50 us dropping a Rover up there is the way
46:53 to do it now what they will do if they
46:57 ever do it in your lifetime without
46:59 dissolving us and admitting that the
47:01 moon is a hoax the moon missions are
47:02 hoax is that they'll put that Rover
47:04 really far away from all the landing
47:06 sites because they can't possibly
47:09 confirm that those landing sites don't
47:12 exist just like the Mars missions right
47:16 most of you understand that there are
47:18 pyramids on the surface of Mars at least
47:21 if any of the original satellites the
47:23 Viking missions or whatever they were
47:25 went over there and looked it looked
47:26 down which may not have occurred people
47:29 maybe that whole thing is fake but if
47:32 everything that they've told us is true
47:34 they wouldn't have put these Rovers in
47:35 the most boring goddamn places on Mars
47:38 they wouldn't have put it on it you know
47:40 they won't try to land it right on top
47:42 of pyramids because that would be too
47:43 you know dangerous so you find a nice
47:46 clearing some hundred miles square
47:49 clearing where you can drop this thing
47:51 it's just flat surface and there it is
47:54 it lands and you wake it up and you move
47:55 around but you make a beeline straight
47:57 for the most amazing things on Mars we
48:01 never see that do we right I mean just
48:04 think about it in 10 years we've had
48:06 drone technology take off on a level
48:08 that no one ever saw coming so now if
48:12 you send a probe to Mars if it's really
48:14 going on GPL you'd have a you'd have a
48:19 drone on top that's maybe covered up
48:21 most the time and they can do a little
48:24 mission it flies out does a bunch of
48:26 surveying and it knows how to come right
48:27 back just like a bee back to the nest
48:29 lands
48:30 you know vibrates itself and gets off
48:32 all the dust of fact the the drone could
48:34 use its power to rinse off all of the
48:38 iron dust off of the unit if you design
48:41 it properly the out take a long time to
48:43 charge probably maybe in Christ the Sun
48:46 does come up right I think the days are
48:49 one-third the sigh I went through the
48:51 length or something like that I can't
48:52 remember but the moon is always exposed
48:55 to the Sun now isn't it
48:59 okay so it wanes it waxes in the waxing
49:06 phase it's gonna get a tremendous amount
49:07 of power and they could fly all over
49:08 that place the fact that they went to
49:11 Mars and set it back to the moon because
49:13 I've said in previous episodes is your
49:15 smoking gun they never went to the moon
49:17 in the first place of course you would
49:20 try your new Mars technology out on the
49:22 moon of course you would that would be
49:24 the first thing out of your [ __ ]
49:25 mouth right if you're building a new
49:29 boat you've never built a boat before in
49:30 your life where would you test it would
49:32 you test it in a pond first probably
49:34 maybe even a bathtub a swimming pool of
49:37 sorts just to see if your hole works
49:40 there's a displaced water enough to
49:41 create buoyancy yes it does
49:43 great let's put in the pond try to go
49:45 across the pond oh it worked great now
49:47 we're gonna try to put more [ __ ] in to
49:49 figure out how much this hole can can
49:50 you know through the ratio of
49:52 displacement of water towards the weight
49:54 the cargo that can go inside we test it
49:56 on a lake then we test it in a fairly
49:59 calm ocean maybe put across the the
50:01 channel between England and France right
50:02 11 miles or whatever that is and then
50:04 only then once all the data comes back
50:07 and it's great we push it over the
50:08 Pacific or the Atlantic I'll be Atlantic
50:11 first cuz it's shorter which is what we
50:13 did that's how technology works we do
50:17 not go to the moon before we go across
50:21 the Pacific we don't and that's what
50:24 going to Mars was all about before we
50:27 went to the moon now again as long as
50:34 someone knows something that you don't
50:35 you tend to believe it especially if
50:38 they can explain it to you in a way that
50:39 seems plausible right and that word is
50:42 very dangerous okay
50:44 there's plausibility now how many of you
50:48 have stood out at night and looked at
50:50 the Stars and then you find these really
50:52 bright things and you're start looking
50:53 up on your telephone with a little
50:55 astronomy app and you realize you're
50:56 looking at Venus you're looking at Mars
50:58 again some of you don't believe these
51:00 things are what they say they are and
51:02 I'm right there with you in terms of
51:03 possibility there but you build a
51:07 gigantic rocket
51:08 on earth and you send it over the
51:11 Atlantic Ocean and before it reaches you
51:14 know I don't know hundred miles up it's
51:18 already lost virtually all of its
51:20 vertical ascent it is now hugging the
51:23 earth in orbit and of course they've
51:24 created this slingshot theory the
51:27 cameras never ever ever stay on do they
51:30 there's this weird blackout phase that
51:33 doesn't need to happen okay it doesn't
51:35 need to happen we don't need to be
51:37 missing one frame of a launch all that's
51:38 [ __ ] it's to create a narrative
51:41 switch from real-life rocket that's
51:44 actually potentially going somewhere in
51:45 a plausible argument to a computer
51:48 simulation
51:48 Vanessa provides in the feed but they
51:52 never track a camera all the way to Mars
51:56 for those old folks to think there's not
51:58 enough filming the camera to do that
52:00 okay digital cameras don't have any film
52:03 all they do is transmit back to earth
52:04 and hey if there's a moment where we're
52:06 behind the moon or where you've rotated
52:08 out of receive ability of this thing
52:10 which is not true because they're
52:11 stations all over the world and no
52:13 matter how it rotates we're always got
52:14 something they can listen to whatever
52:17 direction an object is going in space it
52:20 would buffer and memory the missing
52:23 frames which doesn't cost much okay I'm
52:26 filming right now in 4k these episodes
52:29 are I could go two hours on this stick
52:31 it's 128 gig stick okay I think NASA can
52:34 afford terabytes of sticks of RAM on
52:38 these cameras even if it's off for a
52:39 week there's no problem
52:41 filming 4k and sending it all back to us
52:45 using the energy it has on it you could
52:48 use its nuclear power plant which is a
52:50 bunch of isotope rods they put off
52:53 electric clouds that are transmitted and
52:55 are translated into electromagnetic
52:57 energy or just using solar panel
53:00 technology whatever or some zero-point
53:03 thing that we don't even know exists
53:05 right they don't want you to see the
53:09 full journey why don't they want you to
53:12 see that because the math doesn't
53:14 actually work throwing an object a
53:17 little dot in space no matter how
53:20 accurate you think the
53:22 astronomy technology is or the
53:23 mathematics of where things are in space
53:25 at any one point in time you're talking
53:27 about a unit that barely has any
53:30 propellant left after it is going in its
53:33 orbital rendezvous with this body in
53:35 space now again the moon is a lot easier
53:37 because it's really really close you can
53:39 see the thing the whole time we could
53:41 just put a sensor on the front of a
53:42 rocket with a little bit of fuel but it
53:44 just you know point at the brightest
53:45 thing in the sky and keep the retros
53:47 always pointed at it you know and you
53:49 could deduce some sort of orbital
53:50 approach right but Mars is a planet
53:54 people okay and it's hauling ass around
53:59 the Sun a lot different than the moon
54:03 just the differential for how fast we
54:06 shoot a rocket and how fast Mars is
54:08 going around the Sun should give you an
54:12 idea of how hard it is to get a bullet
54:15 going one mile an hour to orbit a car
54:19 going a hundred and ninety miles an hour
54:22 right it's never going to match up it's
54:25 never going to orbit the other one
54:27 because it doesn't have enough speed to
54:29 do it our satellite has to be going the
54:33 same speed as the orbit of Mars in order
54:35 to achieve any form of orbit it just
54:39 does now what do they call these people
54:43 right what's the career that pretty much
54:46 levels anybody in the room from arguing
54:48 with the other individual astrophysicist
54:53 my god man just it's hard to say it man
54:57 okay Jethro so there's sort of a shock
55:02 and awe at the career itself there's a
55:05 shock and awe at the amount of
55:06 mathematics these individuals do
55:08 understand and you don't understand it
55:12 there we have created the barrier of
55:15 intellectual capacity to conceive of
55:17 what the other person is claiming how
55:20 many times again I mentioned on the show
55:21 you hear someone say something to the
55:24 effect of well did you know there's like
55:26 30 dimensions of space and time oh
55:28 really
55:30 where'd you get that man I read it in a
55:33 magazine
55:35 first I read it in Newsweek well how
55:39 long was the article man Oh least a
55:41 quarter page oh great
55:44 did you see all the mathematics that
55:47 theorized this into existence well no
55:50 you know I don't understand that kind of
55:52 stuff but this really smart fella
55:53 figured it out boom
55:56 now that smart fella right that was it
55:59 smart feller fart smeller
56:02 he can now [ __ ] you left and right
56:06 any it's not a bad thing to theorize
56:09 these things and see if you do come up
56:10 with some legitimate parsing of
56:12 existence and we can find the simulator
56:14 owners and all that kind of stuff yeah
56:16 great but I've been listening to this
56:18 [ __ ] for 35 40 years that is never
56:21 evolved right this gets revisited over
56:24 and over and over
56:26 never amounts to anything
56:30 the latest hoorah of complete lunacy is
56:33 the CERN Hadron Collider and the Higgs
56:37 boson god particle right the multiverse
56:41 people and a single verse people finding
56:44 the frequency directly between their two
56:45 algorithms I mean seriously if you
56:49 believe that then you have been recently
56:51 had right who knows what that thing is
56:54 really trying to do official story is
56:58 everyone should be in jail who put it
57:01 together because they based it on
57:02 theories that were over 50 years old
57:04 right no one ever went back to school
57:07 and learn anything new they took old ass
57:11 theories big bang theories of all things
57:14 right with three are the four colliders
57:16 and the CERN Hadron Collider we're
57:17 looking for big bang evidence really did
57:21 you find the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus
57:22 at the same time why don't we build a
57:25 Hadron Collider for that while we put up
57:26 when we do a big Arctic mission to find
57:28 Santa Clauses layer up there and let's
57:31 grab Superman while we're at it right
57:34 this is what we've been boiled down to
57:36 and I think it boils down to something
57:39 that we can say is life imitates art way
57:43 too much at this point and why is that
57:46 and it
57:46 it's actually healthy algorithm up to a
57:48 point you must be inspired to go and
57:52 find reality those of you want to be
57:54 enlightened in the world you have to be
57:57 inspired to be enlightened it's just
57:59 something that has to occur everyone who
58:02 ate those mushrooms under pine trees
58:05 it's got that big name I can never
58:07 remember what's the red ones with the
58:08 white polka dots that are always seen
58:10 with gnomes because everyone's tripping
58:13 balls and seeing gnomes at the same time
58:15 after they eat these things they were
58:16 enlightened through serendipitous
58:18 chemical modifications to their mortal
58:21 coil I think it's interesting whoever
58:24 created the human body made it possible
58:26 to do that and it's perhaps that whole
58:30 thing I did in episode 2 about the
58:31 visual cortex being ganked by a layer of
58:35 cells that says you can only use 20% of
58:37 your visual cortex to see the universe
58:39 what happens when we are sorry I think
58:43 it's a 10% sorry what happens when we
58:46 can use the other 90% what do we see do
58:49 we see the stuff that people see when
58:50 they take DMT there's other aliens
58:52 around maybe we're not even on a ball
58:54 they were in some consensus reality as
58:57 I've talked about in other episodes I
58:59 recently went down this path with a
59:02 friend of mine about the moon and I
59:04 haven't gone down that path in years
59:06 probably a year or two or someone was
59:09 like oh but this but that but this we
59:11 know we went because of this with that
59:13 and again I could I told this guy said
59:15 look man I was debriefed by two people
59:17 from NASA that we didn't go who were on
59:19 the Mars mission who went and tried to
59:21 look up what happened with the moon so
59:22 they would have a base platforms get to
59:24 Mars and were officially told one of
59:26 them was officially told look we didn't
59:27 go you can get your paycheck between now
59:29 and the day you die we'll never go to
59:31 Mars don't worry about it
59:32 they were wrong in that particular
59:34 estimate because I figured out a way to
59:35 hoax the whole thing together with these
59:37 these probes these Landers these little
59:41 Rover things but that just went in one
59:46 ear and out the other like I was lying
59:47 to the guy didn't really have any
59:51 interest in hearing how they faked it I
59:54 didn't manage to get a couple things out
59:57 I'm not sure they ever stalked but he
59:59 was all stuck on
60:00 mirror the mirror on the moon surface is
60:03 the proof that we went to the moon and I
60:06 said well do you realize that they've
60:08 been bouncing lasers off the moon before
60:09 the MIR ever existed ooh
60:12 Whiteface let's let's go ahead and
60:16 change the subject everybody
60:17 this guy is younger than me younger than
60:22 me still hanging on to that old
60:23 patriotic bunch of horseshit that we
60:25 went so let's say we get the world on a
60:30 substrate of truth
60:31 and they actually research and it's a
60:33 it's a requirement to utter anything in
60:36 conversation to another human being
60:37 oh really I haven't heard of that it's
60:40 not common knowledge okay you've made
60:42 the claim now I need you to back up and
60:44 tell us where you got all your
60:45 information I don't care if it came from
60:48 YouTube or the Internet's or your buddy
60:52 in college or your own laboratory
60:53 experiments I just need to know where
60:55 you got this and what your logic path is
60:57 for saying you believe this and then
61:00 we'll all in the room can make our own
61:02 choice as to whether or not we believe
61:03 it but doesn't that sound like a
61:05 reasonable path to knowledge but then
61:10 you have this patriotic layer on top the
61:14 layer that keeps everyone defending
61:15 these hoaxes and I mean this is a sort
61:19 of a positive hoax precise Gus Grissom
61:21 and his two buddies getting murdered
61:24 than the Apollo one other than that
61:27 and probably a several dozen other
61:29 people that wanted to tell the story
61:30 tell the truth that were unaware of this
61:36 patriotic stuff creates death doesn't it
61:39 there's a problem that we have in
61:41 society today and it's something that q
61:43 and on is alluded to which is that we
61:46 have pedophiles all over the world and
61:49 in very prestigious positions their
61:52 presidents Chancellor's prime ministers
61:54 they are politicians they're police
61:56 officers they're our military people
61:57 they're Hollywood people they're the
62:00 people down the street as well but when
62:03 it comes to government like if they'll
62:04 bust the guy down the street no problem
62:07 because they can push that in the press
62:09 they can either hide it in the press so
62:10 it doesn't never gets reported or they
62:12 can push it in the press is that one guy
62:13 that does that
62:14 one bad thing but when it comes to
62:17 political officials doing it the
62:21 Catholics who do it constantly right
62:23 Catholics are a [ __ ] plague the
62:25 priests and the bishops and all these
62:27 people they're they're a [ __ ] plague
62:28 on society on average since I've been
62:31 alive they rape your kids they just do
62:35 yeah I'm not making it up it just it's
62:37 in the press constantly right
62:39 never any [ __ ] persecution for these
62:43 people the Vatican just paid off three
62:45 billion dollars in settlements I would
62:49 say that's the first good step to be
62:51 honest but they need to stop this mess
62:53 going on around the world and I don't
62:54 have any faith that that's occurred I
62:56 think within the next 10 years we're
62:58 gonna find another priest another bishop
63:00 somewhere in the world that between this
63:04 episode and 2018 and when we find out
63:07 that in that news the guy has raped five
63:09 hundred kids or done something
63:11 inappropriate how was that allowed to
63:15 happen because there's a patriotism
63:17 patriotism excuse me on religion can't
63:21 there's basically too big to rape your
63:24 kids they're too big to ever be
63:25 persecuted for what they do to your kids
63:28 is that the world you want to live in
63:30 seriously
63:32 I'll give you another digression away
63:34 from the moon I apologize but this is
63:35 part of the fabric if we everyone want
63:37 this thing to happen we can't just focus
63:39 on NASA NASA Nessa Nessa SpaceX we've
63:42 got to focus on ourselves first we
63:44 absolutely have to how many people are
63:47 shitty to other people on this planet
63:49 they step on your head to get ahead they
63:52 lie they cheat and they steal and one
63:54 way or another maybe it's not a bank
63:56 heist steal but they take your money and
63:59 they say they're gonna pay you back and
64:00 they never do but you see them with
64:01 money later on where they could they
64:04 could have paid you back and they never
64:05 did people who lie and well they lie
64:10 they lie about infidelity they lie about
64:13 what they're gonna do for you would they
64:14 support you or whatever they're gonna be
64:16 there for you when you need them
64:17 and what has it been up to this point
64:21 without the internet I think without the
64:25 internet we haven't had any option to
64:27 beause these people for exactly what
64:29 they are and so they get to go back into
64:33 society you break up with them you
64:34 divorce them whatever you you sever your
64:36 business partnership with them and they
64:38 get to go out and run their scam until
64:40 the day they die just like these
64:41 pedophiles of old if it gets to die like
64:45 Jimmy Savile having done everything that
64:47 he ever wanted to do and he's never
64:49 gonna get prosecuted I will assure you
64:51 that any family on this planet that has
64:54 laws that protect them from being
64:55 prosecuted we have to look very deep
64:57 into their past into their lifestyle to
65:00 make sure they don't have this sort of
65:04 activity what was it the guy that tried
65:05 to drive his car into I believe the the
65:08 king of Norway I think that's where it
65:10 was I apologize if I had that wrong but
65:12 there's a video of a guy trying to drive
65:14 his car at a public appearance and they
65:18 stopped him and as they're pulling him
65:20 out the car he says they're killing our
65:22 children help me stop them mmm
65:27 interesting interesting I think it was
65:30 there the king and queen of Norway
65:32 they're one of their presidential
65:35 palaces or royal palaces the grounds
65:38 they found like seven to 12 kids bodies
65:41 buried in the back of one of their Lots
65:45 yeah I guess maybe some farmer down the
65:48 streets doing it and bearing in a royal
65:49 land just to screw him over maybe they
65:52 couldn't as far as I understood the
65:53 story they couldn't determine it when
65:54 that was 7 or 12 because they were just
65:56 bones so trying to figure it out I'm
65:59 sure they could my feeling today is that
66:02 we have to be very careful letting these
66:05 people go you don't want to get all
66:08 caught up in revenge and and all the
66:10 negativity but I think it might just be
66:12 interesting to just publish a statement
66:13 about your life with this individual and
66:15 say this is what I experienced with that
66:18 individual maybe they change maybe they
66:19 become a better person I guarantee if
66:22 they're in their 40s and still doing it
66:24 and they've always done it since they
66:25 were teenagers or whatever chances are
66:27 they're probably continue screwing
66:29 everybody else everyone everybody else
66:31 and yeah there are these social media
66:33 apps that are going to be it's already
66:35 being started in China where you have to
66:37 obey the law of China otherwise you get
66:39 a down arrow and s stuff that's not
66:41 I'm talking about I'm talking about the
66:44 old-fashioned Scarlet Letter for
66:45 individuals who lie how many people in
66:48 America right now in politics are being
66:50 busted for lying the rod Rosen scenes
66:53 the Muellers the stocks the pages
66:55 they're all getting away scot-free
66:57 because Obama pardoned them before he
67:00 left they're all being arrested and then
67:02 they pull out this piece of paper and go
67:03 I was pardoned the pardoned in the
67:07 pedestrian public eye but they're not
67:09 pardoned in a military tribunal manner
67:11 which is why John McCain was put to
67:13 death you can expect a lot more of that
67:16 people and that's America creating
67:19 freedom 2.0 hopefully we succeed because
67:23 if we succeed your standards will go up
67:24 around the world what as acceptable will
67:29 have its bar lifted considerably if we
67:32 achieve this then we'll have the fabric
67:34 of society that we need in order to get
67:36 to the moon to get to Mars to figure out
67:38 where the hell we are
67:40 so that pedestrians can fly over the
67:43 South Pole and convince themselves since
67:45 either a round ball or it's you're gonna
67:47 bang into some [ __ ] barrier it's some
67:49 simulation of a ball it's made to look
67:52 like a ball but we're actually in some
67:53 firmament don't because we have captors
67:56 maybe we're on a big giant planet which
67:59 makes the size of the moon makes sense
68:01 but we've never seen 98% of it because
68:05 that's being run by the people that
68:06 drive by and UFOs UFOs exist don't they
68:12 they exist now maybe the majority of
68:16 UFOs are all you know plasma balls
68:19 coming out of the bowels of the earth
68:20 spinning creating a chrome sphere or
68:23 chrome disc and then they hit negative
68:26 pockets in the atmosphere and they zip
68:28 zap but you know 4000 miles maybe if a
68:31 jet pursues it it modifies the
68:33 atmosphere and thus gives it the natural
68:35 means of flying away but maybe they're
68:37 really UFOs from time to time
68:40 intelligent beings and side ships that
68:42 aren't necessarily of our human nature I
68:45 mean maybe they're human maybe they're
68:47 not maybe the little grey aliens don't
68:49 know but that's being coveted and hidden
68:54 from
68:55 society and society of all things has
68:58 the right to know the truth don't we how
69:02 many times have you heard the narrative
69:03 of a new technology that's invented by
69:08 Tesla he invented all kinds of cool [ __ ]
69:11 when he dies it's all harvested again
69:14 don't forget Donald Trump's uncle who
69:18 was the big head physicist at MIT was
69:21 told to go get the information out of
69:23 Tesla's apartment and that it's all
69:27 weaponized by the government no that guy
69:30 in particular probably had nothing to do
69:31 with it but he was the one that was
69:33 deemed the most intelligent person that
69:35 the FBI had access to to go in and take
69:37 a look and discern what is valuable and
69:40 what is not but we currently in freedom
69:43 1.0 we are allowing we haven't written
69:48 enough laws to protect our freedoms and
69:51 specific cases that are now apparent in
69:53 2018 right so we have to have a revisal
69:57 of our Constitution of the United States
69:59 in America to outlaw compound interest
70:01 to redefine the parameters of national
70:05 security we have to specifically talk
70:08 about things like UFOs and specifically
70:12 offer a region of the community if you
70:15 want to join this particular community
70:16 let's just say you want to stay a
70:17 Catholic and you want to be blissfully
70:20 ignorant of child rape and all the other
70:22 things that happen you don't want to
70:23 believe that UFOs exist because you
70:25 think that that defeats your belief in
70:27 God and Jesus Christ and all this other
70:29 stuff fine you can stay in your little
70:31 compound somewhere but a big part of us
70:34 an infinite part of us can go into the
70:36 other sector and learn the truth about s
70:39 for area 51 UFOs all the footage all the
70:43 contact with the greys from the Roswell
70:46 crash you can do this and if any of you
70:50 are rolling your eyes about Roswell
70:51 believe me I have sympathy you haven't
70:53 seen my Roswell episode you know
70:55 subscribe to the channel on YouTube go
70:56 to the deep thoughts radio.com put in
70:58 the search field Roswell
71:01 and listen to my episode on it because I
71:05 went in trying to debunk that thing
71:06 hardcore was convinced my entire life
71:09 that was [ __ ] and by the time I was
71:11 done I was utterly convinced that it did
71:13 occur I'm not convinced of other ones
71:15 I'm not but that one I am entirely
71:18 convinced that it happened so I think we
71:21 have been visited I think that's very
71:23 important information and I think that
71:25 would sway the very fabric of society
71:27 and and I'm not talking about the George
71:30 Bush or the sorry the Ronald Reagan more
71:34 speech about us all uniting under one
71:37 front and getting into a new world order
71:39 we're not ready for that step whatsoever
71:42 sorry Jim Carrey well that guys turn
71:45 into a [ __ ] piece of work add me god
71:48 damn I would like to see us get to the
71:51 moon whether it be a rover or a human
71:54 being I would like to see us get there
71:55 whether it be a tiny little ball 3,200
71:58 miles up in space which would be really
72:00 interesting or if it's a true big-ass
72:07 rock in space it was a 1200 mile
72:09 diameter I want to see what's up there
72:13 if there are UFOs and there's a lot of
72:17 folks that believe this is true then we
72:20 believe that they have touched base on
72:22 the moon
72:23 some people like John Lear believe
72:24 there's bases on the darks of the moon
72:26 hey maybe I don't know I'm not convinced
72:28 with any of the photographic evidence
72:29 he's submitted that that's the case but
72:32 it'd be a great place to look because it
72:33 hasn't been touched by mankind for
72:35 goddamn sure the amount of evidence
72:39 against having gone to the moon is just
72:41 ever-growing ever conclusive ever
72:44 smoking gun it is again when you have to
72:49 argue with folks about this their
72:53 research is [ __ ] their evidence is [ __ ]
72:58 it is it's horrible it is right out of a
73:02 [ __ ] coffee table book that you would
73:03 buy at Barnes & Noble it's awful I have
73:09 never ever ever been challenged by
73:12 someone saying we did go to the moon who
73:14 didn't concede by the end
73:15 the conversation if they were
73:16 participating in the conversation let's
73:17 just say that we didn't go including
73:22 again two other people from NASA that I
73:26 talked to probably in the last 15 years
73:27 who called me a name at the beginning
73:29 the conversation indirectly and within
73:32 I'm telling you within two minutes I
73:35 think even 60 seconds I had these guys
73:37 really back and laughing that I knew we
73:42 didn't go and to save their own
73:45 intelligence quota with me they admitted
73:50 that we they don't think we went either
73:51 and that of course we didn't go okay
73:55 what up said that one of them went from
73:57 anyone doesn't believe this is just an
73:59 [ __ ] to of course we didn't go isn't
74:01 that funny
74:02 I meant another gentleman who worked for
74:04 teller the h-bomb inventor when we went
74:09 to the moon he just shrugged and was
74:11 like well of course that was a bunch of
74:13 [ __ ] of course we were creating
74:17 ICBMs and missiles that's what that
74:19 whole project was all about I was like
74:21 you know then he was like [ __ ] yeah I
74:24 know I had a little Masonic ring on to
74:26 it's really interesting in some point at
74:31 some point for those of you who believe
74:32 this is a simulation I have to agree in
74:34 that in my own journeys what's really
74:37 weird is that I will have these people
74:39 come to me either in 1991 when I had the
74:43 serendipitous meeting with two
74:45 colleagues of mine and the company I
74:47 work for tell me we didn't go with all
74:49 the specifics to bumping into bart
74:51 sibrel movies to then having two
74:54 gentlemen sat down in front of me like
74:56 the guy who knew both of us said you two
74:58 have to talk boom sits me down and I
75:00 have these conversations the teller guy
75:02 I just bumped into in the and the public
75:05 and then within seconds were having this
75:09 conversation and I don't believe I ever
75:12 asked him about his ring I just saw it
75:14 and he was very brilliant this guy so if
75:19 you're listening to this video maybe I
75:21 am one of your folks that's there to
75:24 nudge you in a direction that your mind
75:25 is ready to go and again most of you
75:28 shouldn't say most of you I think most
75:30 of you already have a belief that we
75:32 didn't go in the first place only a
75:34 couple butthurt people come in and try
75:36 to debunk with again just the horrible
75:39 nasa.gov debunking web pages which I
75:44 don't know if they exist anymore
75:46 I think NASA kind of pulled out of it
75:47 because they do they do understand that
75:49 at this point in society kids have
75:51 engineering apps just as accurate as
75:53 NASA and we can put boosters inside
75:55 simulations run fuel through them all
75:57 the combustion taking care of everything
75:59 that an f1 booster would do in real life
76:02 can be simulated inside of average
76:04 college engineering software so they
76:06 can't allow that those designs to ever
76:08 be published I don't know it for a fact
76:12 but I would wager your money that at
76:14 some point in NASA's history they've sat
76:16 down a group of scientists to say okay
76:17 can you reengineering booster but now
76:20 what we know about Russian technology
76:23 and can't use the Russian technology
76:24 because we've admitted we didn't have it
76:26 but can you do our singular engine and
76:30 try to figure out how to make the moon
76:32 missions work and I'm sure they
76:33 deliberated and they put time in they
76:35 realize not even close dude we can't
76:38 even the best thing to do is not even
76:39 touch the subject anymore just let them
76:41 fight it out online I don't know what
76:43 the grand plan is to admonish NASA from
76:47 all responsibility
76:48 SpaceX but we'll have to wait for that
76:51 plan B to come around probably designed
76:53 by again attorneys that don't want to
76:54 have to deal with the they would have no
76:58 problem actually charging NASA for the
76:59 legal time but they don't want their
77:02 client to go down the tubes having to
77:05 admit this stuff didn't happen and then
77:07 incur all the expenses and litigation
77:09 thereof we give you an analogy they'll
77:12 close this thing off with for those of
77:16 you have been in a difficult
77:16 relationship in your lifetime it could
77:18 be a personal one where you're I'm
77:20 talking about your spouse or your
77:21 boyfriend/girlfriend or could just be a
77:23 business relationship or a relationship
77:24 with a friend at one point this person
77:27 was ideal for you spending time was very
77:30 rewarding and very compatible again
77:33 however that occurred but then you grew
77:36 apart and they became very chaotic and
77:39 crazy
77:40 maybe they became an alcoholic a drug
77:42 use
77:42 maybe they just started becoming
77:44 schizophrenic or whatever
77:46 psychopathic right and but you still
77:51 have a little bit of communication with
77:53 them and you have credibility with them
77:55 and so what you're trying to do is
77:56 figure out the one thing that you can
77:58 mention to them some pattern that you
78:00 think that they don't enjoy of their own
78:02 life right there they're
78:03 self-destructive in a particular
78:05 sequence of their life and so you're
78:06 thinking maybe if I can make them aware
78:08 of this self-destructive thing that
78:09 they're doing they'll wake up and handle
78:12 all the bigger agendas or the like
78:14 agendas that destroy their life and thus
78:17 your time with them right the MU
78:19 missions being a hoax for America at
78:23 least okay we could we could put it on
78:26 NASA's back but I think it's good for
78:28 the entire country of America this is
78:32 our thing the moon missions are a thing
78:34 that we can mention and say look guys we
78:37 are not one person we are an entire
78:38 country with the idea of freedom we're
78:42 currently living off version 1.0 we need
78:44 to get to 2.0 the Great Awakening is 2.0
78:47 but it hasn't solidified into laws and
78:49 statutes that will re fortify the
78:53 concepts of freedom so the moon missions
78:57 are a place we can look and say this is
78:59 how our your government can lie to you
79:01 this is how Hollywood can make movies to
79:04 continually reinforce the revised
79:06 history of these moments and by no means
79:09 is it the only history being revised we
79:11 all know that okay but since we vote on
79:14 our leaders and I think the votes being
79:16 protected more than ever we have to get
79:17 George Soros out of our [ __ ] voting
79:19 machines and out of politically
79:22 influencing as a foreign dignitary or
79:24 the [ __ ] he is we're trying to figure
79:27 out what then I his US citizenship
79:29 because he's from Hungary he probably
79:30 does but we have to use this as a
79:33 leverage point to fix society to fix the
79:36 world and there's many others but this
79:38 is a nice comfortable one that is not as
79:41 acidic as some of them out there again
79:44 there have been deaths but that's why
79:47 from time to time I'll mention it to
79:48 people who are willing to listen now
79:51 today what's funny is most people
79:54 believe that I run into they
79:56 have a big problem believing that it was
79:57 a fake even folks they tell for the very
80:00 first time kids in their early 20s that
80:01 I kind of run it down because they're
80:03 spouting this stuff and they go oh oh
80:04 yeah right oh oh my gosh that's so silly
80:07 why did I ever think this was real well
80:10 I don't blame you kid I did too when I
80:12 was young
80:13 hell I believed probably until this
80:15 century that it was real
80:16 till bart sibrel repeating what my
80:18 friends told me 91 if you haven't seen
80:22 the other two episodes I suggest you go
80:24 see them I'll put them in the comment
80:25 section if I can remember
80:26 I'm actually pretty horrible about that
80:28 because it takes days and days to get
80:29 these things edited and out the door I
80:31 think you feel me please leave your
80:35 comments in the section below on YouTube
80:37 if you can a lot of thinking going on
80:40 here if you have them in a deep house
80:43 radio calm please go
80:44 we have video audio locked Facebook
80:47 group and a patreon page as always take
80:50 care of yourself in someone else and
80:52 I'll see in the next D thoughts over now
