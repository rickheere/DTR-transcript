00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:36 deep thoughts as the ice-cream man does
00:39 little turned my block here today I
00:45 thought I would talk about something I'm
00:47 gonna refer to as the SIOP train what
00:51 that references is there seems to be
00:56 this sort of holy war going on online
01:00 underneath all the other holy wars that
01:02 are going on and the big distinction has
01:05 to do with if you were to believe in
01:08 anything online a conspiracy of some
01:10 sort especially are you being duped by
01:15 some SIOP out there
01:17 a government conspiracy or probably
01:23 government conspiracy to get you to
01:26 believe something so that you become
01:27 punished as a result of believing it
01:29 right there's a lot of upset people they
01:35 get angry that you believe something
01:36 like Flat Earth very upset and if you
01:42 talk about it and you don't freely
01:44 criticize it they get even more hurt I
01:47 know this is sort of a tired subject but
01:49 it's a good place to start in this
01:50 theory because we're going to go through
01:53 the theory of you know governmental
01:56 psyops all right what I would might say
01:59 is um but let's think about what the
02:03 purpose of a PSYOP would be I think the
02:06 most fundamental definition would be you
02:09 are being misled that's the number one
02:12 reason why someone would do it
02:14 but mislead usually is just the very
02:17 first operating principle of a PSYOP
02:19 because in the end what you're supposed
02:22 to end up doing is getting lead
02:28 somewhere that's bad and so then the
02:33 question is well what actually occurs in
02:37 order to mislead something so let's put
02:39 a pin in that right there we'll come
02:41 right back to that what would they want
02:44 you to believe in order to damage you or
02:47 mislead you or reduce your credibility
02:49 right there's a million things you could
02:51 say out there it's pretty much anything
02:53 that's not what the official story right
02:58 the official story would be exactly
03:01 where governments would want you to be
03:02 every split second of your life and so
03:07 the theory I believe that is sort of
03:09 being asserted online is all right
03:12 if you step off the beaten path the
03:16 people at the Army Corps of psyops and
03:18 every other deep state organization that
03:20 should be [ __ ] shut down is that we
03:24 need to make it really painful if you're
03:28 caught going off the beaten path right
03:31 the funny part about it is is that no
03:35 matter how you slice it you're thinking
03:39 most the time now we know people to jump
03:43 off in conspiracies all the time and
03:44 they they don't think very much and
03:48 that's the problem with them they
03:49 believe anything and everything online
03:52 what's funny about it is is that people
03:54 who want to believe the official story
03:55 use that sort of criticism to say oh you
03:59 believe anything online don't you and
04:02 then palete people who really do a lot
04:05 of research think that people who
04:08 believe in official stories believe
04:10 anything that they hear from certain
04:12 sources right our group of folks here
04:16 they contributing communion of deep
04:19 thoughts video I believe our goal is to
04:22 maintain control of our opinion and as I
04:26 always say as most
04:27 people say you were fairly humble about
04:31 what's going on here is don't believe
04:34 everything I say go research yourself
04:36 understand that even if I point you at a
04:38 particular direction I'm probably not
04:42 pointing you at all the directions I'm
04:43 probably missing tons of little
04:45 directions that I went that I can't even
04:48 remember so this is one of the reasons
04:51 why I have a little bit of resistance
04:52 against the sort of thought police
04:57 individuals that are all over YouTube
04:59 who mean well they do mean well they
05:02 want a police what we can think what we
05:05 should know to be things that we should
05:07 be allowed to think or something for me
05:11 it's like I look at people and I go well
05:13 are they thinking well then that's good
05:17 because that's what's missing from
05:19 society in general no one's thinking
05:23 that [ __ ] gets old and it messes up the
05:25 world right but again to paint a picture
05:29 inside of our minds let's restart here
05:31 we have a official story path the sort
05:34 of revised history propaganda
05:37 understanding of our world with fake
05:39 gods that don't exist
05:42 fake prophets that never existed fake
05:47 history that never existed and that is
05:52 literally sewn into the the brains of
05:54 people on earth I mean it's phenomenal
05:55 how many people actually believed that
05:58 there was a Noah's Ark and that the
06:00 whole place you know flooded and that
06:03 there really were two of every animal on
06:05 a particular boat that blows me away
06:07 Goodin eating would ever assert such a
06:09 thing but that's the official story it's
06:16 no mystery my disbelief in the story of
06:19 Christ and his existence basically being
06:22 nothing more than a fictional construct
06:23 to give Rome you know reign over their
06:26 own people and they were about to
06:27 collapse right they gave him an extra or
06:29 twelve hundred years of you know
06:34 self-tan mindset right today it's a
06:37 little more subtle
06:39 today as long as you have a
06:40 computer-generated image of the universe
06:46 doing a Big Bang of far-off planets that
06:51 are one way or the other societies
06:53 willing to jump on board and say well
06:54 you know hey my life is pretty boring
06:56 why don't I go ahead and believe in all
06:58 this stuff it's more fun and hey you
07:01 know what probably nothing wrong with
07:03 that if that's your choice as an adult I
07:07 think that it starts becoming a little
07:09 bit of an accountability issue when you
07:11 start passing that to your children
07:13 instead of saying well you know what I'm
07:15 a lazy [ __ ] and I believe all the [ __ ]
07:17 just because I don't I don't want to
07:19 read a book I don't know how to read and
07:21 so kid you know don't listen to anything
07:23 I believe you go to school you learn how
07:25 to read don't buy you know books simply
07:28 because they have big pictures in them
07:29 and at least you will not hobble the
07:33 next generation that made me necessary
07:35 in order to save us from but you
07:37 cataclysmic event great I think it would
07:40 be interesting imagine that you know
07:44 NASA has been lying and lying and lying
07:46 and lying about almost everything
07:47 they've ever done they're spinning off
07:49 agencies like SpaceX you know and then
07:54 some earth-shattering thing starts to
07:58 occur right a big-ass meteorite is
08:03 coming at Earth let's just say all
08:05 that's real - and we need to get the
08:08 [ __ ] off this planet we need to get
08:10 inside some ship and get out of here but
08:13 nASA has been lying the entire time at
08:15 60 million dollars a day and they're you
08:20 don't we pull out all the most covert
08:21 technology and the one I know that some
08:23 of you you apologists to love area51
08:25 ideas and s4 I think we've got all kinds
08:28 of stuff and maybe we do but because
08:31 it's been so convert ly covertly you
08:33 know hidden we're not able to build a
08:35 big giant ship to get enough people off
08:37 the planet to actually preserve humanity
08:40 but all this coveting and coveting and
08:43 coveting you know the Nerds with the
08:45 passwords you know used to be the
08:47 janitors with the keys
08:49 society turns to all these aerospace
08:52 folks and all these folks that have been
08:53 living on lies and they say get us off
08:56 this planet this thing is coming in it's
08:59 gonna take let's just say a year to get
09:02 here you have the entire resource pool
09:05 of the world for free infinite human
09:09 beings infinite resources no one's
09:12 looking for a paycheck
09:13 everyone's feeding everyone for free we
09:15 just are trying to build an ark to get
09:17 off this planet right and now all the
09:19 lies start coming out and people who are
09:21 scared for their life start to tell the
09:23 truth for the very first time we don't
09:26 have any of this technology nothing is
09:28 up in space or what's up in space is
09:30 crap the ISS is fake the Space Shuttle
09:32 was fake or whatever whatever I'm not
09:34 trying to pull on other conspiracies so
09:38 but I got off track the straight and
09:41 narrow path is the efficient story
09:43 believe believe don't question don't
09:45 research just believe the state will
09:48 tell you who to hate who to love what is
09:50 true what is false what you can do and
09:53 what you can't do all your god-given
09:56 rights of the Republic are now you know
10:00 extorted to you you got to do things for
10:04 someone else right another equal human
10:05 being to you in your brain because you
10:08 accepted a paradigm of authority can
10:10 tell you what to do now sadly of course
10:14 every time I say that I think about the
10:16 kids that can't speak their own language
10:18 remotely correct and them saying you
10:21 can't tell me what to do so anything
10:25 outside this line would be considered an
10:28 alternate form of information and in
10:32 this day and age it's considered usually
10:34 very easily a conspiracy or just a plain
10:39 lie and so we're all supposed to be
10:44 conforming right I had another commenter
10:48 it's been it's been about a year the
10:49 other guy come in he goes I love your
10:51 show cut your hair and I just thought
10:53 wow I like what you say that conform
10:56 conform conform conform so I can feel
10:59 better about you really funny right
11:02 it happens so if you were trying to
11:07 create the narrative that is the
11:09 straight and narrow
11:10 official story propaganda revised
11:13 history that gives you power it creates
11:18 a Prussian state right we are this we've
11:22 never been anything else but this this
11:24 is where our people come from right to
11:26 think that there are groups of people in
11:28 this world that think that they're
11:29 people roamed around in the desert for
11:31 40 years unbelievable I mean it's 2017
11:35 and people are just like Christ you know
11:38 a Disney comic book has more reality
11:40 than most people's religions you know
11:44 it's crazy so but now if you were to
11:47 create an organization like the Army
11:49 Corps of psyops or some other deep state
11:51 huge PR organization to enforce this
11:55 straight and narrow what are you gonna
11:57 do what are your strategies right so we
12:02 think we've for instance for flat earth
12:04 and a few other things that are probably
12:07 released in the last since 2008 I should
12:09 say there was a cognitive infiltration
12:12 document supposedly you know written by
12:14 the government circulated around the web
12:17 to dispel essentially any any conspiracy
12:21 you can attach it to this document and
12:24 say look everything you believe has been
12:26 hatched by this organization to deceive
12:28 you the thing is like I said in the
12:32 beginning but they want to do is make it
12:34 painful if you step off that sidewalk
12:38 your you know your foot hits the third
12:39 rail of a subway with all the powers
12:42 going and you get fried you get fried to
12:46 your relatives to your friends and then
12:48 they don't really care whether or not
12:51 they see you or they interact with you
12:54 what they wanted to make sure is that in
12:55 your part in your personal circle you
12:58 start looking like a crazy person or an
13:00 ignorant person or both again the
13:04 oxymoron of our universe right now is
13:07 that if someone were to talk about most
13:09 religions the modern day Christianity
13:12 religion especially
13:14 and recall it as a as a true story you
13:18 be accepted in most circles in this
13:20 world and how unbelievable is that you
13:23 know I said way back in season one when
13:25 I used to talk to Mormons and they would
13:28 come by my house on the first group of
13:32 guys that ever came over I sat him down
13:34 and I said I had a globe that I was
13:36 giving away or something like my
13:38 daughter was using when she was young
13:39 nothing fancy and I said if I said you
13:43 know I'm an Egyptian and I actually
13:47 believe in all of the ancient gods of
13:49 Egypt set and and Horus and Isis and
13:55 Anubis and although every single thing
13:57 ever written about those gods what would
14:00 you think of me I said wouldn't you
14:03 think that I would be kind of a silly
14:05 human being for believing in these sort
14:07 of you know animal head humans with all
14:09 these incredible powers that have
14:11 changed over time of course right I said
14:14 what if I told you I'm Native American
14:15 and I believe that all the stars in the
14:18 skies are merely the souls of those who
14:19 have left you know that idea makes a lot
14:24 more sense to me today than it ever did
14:26 to be honest I said wouldn't you think
14:28 I'm crazy but I said why is it that all
14:30 other religions seem hilarious to you
14:32 but you're seems ironclad and yours has
14:35 more elaborate fiction than any of
14:37 theirs or at least as much now I'm gonna
14:41 take a position that they might take for
14:44 a split second because we I think we
14:46 need to look at this and be grown-ups
14:48 about it which is the following what if
14:52 we've been down this road before we've
14:55 been down this road before and someone
14:59 and say the Babylonian times said we're
15:02 always going to tell the truth and it
15:03 wasn't even a point of resistance it's
15:06 not a single person disagree with that
15:07 idea that yeah okay we'll be completely
15:09 honest that means you honest with your
15:11 children you're honest with your spouse
15:12 your friends everybody and go take my
15:16 episode on politics which I probably
15:18 should have called it something slightly
15:19 different where I simulate slowly the
15:22 creation of a society on an island so
15:24 you can see the power structure evolved
15:26 and good people turning
15:27 bad people simply because that's just
15:30 one of those things that happen or at
15:34 least it happens a perception with a few
15:35 generations of spoiled children you
15:37 really do get corruption right well
15:40 let's just say we had a society it was
15:43 totally honest and it really got ugly
15:45 it really got ugly very quickly maybe it
15:49 was even good for a thousand years but
15:50 after a while stuff started accumulating
15:52 the very reason to perhaps not tell the
15:57 truth started to exacerbate right and
16:00 after perhaps some millennia of trying
16:05 to hold it together the elders of the
16:07 world simply said look we have tried to
16:09 educate our people as much as possible
16:11 we have tried to you know enlightened
16:15 each other on the empathetic needs of
16:19 each other perhaps even back in that age
16:21 they had more empathy because they
16:23 didn't have any distractions and for
16:26 whatever reason that fell apart and so
16:28 the idea of the oppression education
16:31 system which enforces loyalty over all
16:34 other objectives it forces it over truth
16:38 the elders of the world simply said look
16:41 man we have tried all kinds of different
16:43 techniques and some of it works for a
16:45 little while but then it it crumbles if
16:47 any of you ever saw Groundhog Day back
16:49 in the day with Bill Murray there's a
16:52 point in the center of the film tiny
16:54 spoiler alert if you haven't seen a 25
16:56 year old movie where he he lives every
17:01 single day over and over and over again
17:02 and he went to this town where he
17:04 doesn't come from and something happens
17:09 where he keeps waking up and so it
17:11 eventually just gives up on his what he
17:13 was supposed to be doing which is
17:14 working with a TV crew he just roams
17:16 around town he learns things and he
17:18 meets people and he keeps bumping into
17:21 this homeless man in an alleyway and he
17:25 just keeps ignoring him ignoring him but
17:27 then eventually he pays attention to him
17:29 and he says
17:31 I'm gonna save this guy right so he
17:34 picks him up off the street gets him a
17:36 lunch then eventually he dies in the
17:40 alleyway later that day and then he
17:43 takes him and takes him to the hospital
17:45 the next time he bumps into them the
17:46 very next day tries to get a bunch of
17:48 medical care on him and he still dies in
17:52 the only way it was like this determined
17:56 thing for this guy right so this could
17:59 be the position of the whatever the
18:02 folks that decide to help create the
18:05 society around a group of people because
18:07 no matter how you do this like in my
18:09 politics episode someone's got to run
18:12 the the larger processes for society
18:17 when it gets to a certain size because
18:21 there's going to be conflict at some
18:22 point not necessarily violent conflict
18:25 or anything like that but maybe there's
18:27 two farmers and there's just a land
18:28 dispute and you got to figure out how to
18:31 delegate authority to okay well we need
18:34 this much wheat and that much corn and
18:39 so we've got to figure out how to do
18:41 this and people are gonna have to get
18:42 together and debate and it could be that
18:45 our elders have simply gone down a lot
18:49 of paths and prior to exploiting the
18:53 system which is I think where we are
18:54 today
18:56 perhaps this was a technique that was
18:59 just simply discovered to simply go look
19:01 it is better that people don't know
19:03 things that distract them because it
19:06 messes with the core resources of our
19:08 society what if the farmer you know
19:11 started playing with pottery or start
19:14 looking at his navel or started noticing
19:15 that there's another hill over there and
19:17 let's just go over there and figure out
19:18 what's there and so you lose your best
19:20 farmer the guy that knows how to rotate
19:23 crops and plant seeds and understands
19:25 the seasons and because we've had
19:27 perhaps some play go through the village
19:30 we didn't have as many kids at a
19:32 particular generation that we were
19:33 supposed to have because the women died
19:35 or the children died or whatever and so
19:36 now we have to stretch one of the
19:38 generations for another 15 to 30 years
19:41 before we're going to have working males
19:42 to go out and do the farms right
19:45 all kinds of [ __ ] can happen in a split
19:47 second to destroy a society so there
19:50 could be a lot of true history that we
19:52 have no knowledge of that is giving a
19:56 rationale to some individuals and you
19:58 know there are tons of you know
20:00 philosophers on how to run society
20:02 Strauss and all those guys Marxism and
20:06 you know how to run the economy the
20:08 economic layer and the resource layer
20:10 and you know what have you I always
20:15 mentioned that the movie thx 1 1 3 8
20:17 that is an extreme example of how
20:19 society could turn out I think below
20:21 that you might have 1984 and below that
20:23 you might have they might have brave new
20:28 world and below that you might have
20:29 rollerball in 1975 you know just being
20:32 progression into this control apparatus
20:34 right so psyops
20:38 I believe could be the mechanism by
20:40 which those who are inclined to think
20:44 those that recline to wander with their
20:46 thoughts can be manipulated but I know
20:53 that some of you are already thinking
20:54 about the next section I want to discuss
20:56 so let's move right into it here
20:57 there are psyops that might tell you
20:59 that the world is round when it's flat
21:01 because if you ever figured out it was
21:03 flat on any any shape you want to think
21:06 about it's wavy or whatever but it still
21:08 has a border around or something most of
21:10 us want to go see the border and we want
21:13 to know what the hell's on the outside
21:14 when for all we know the people who are
21:16 on the other side don't want us so
21:18 they're like they'll kill us if we go on
21:20 the other side and so our authorities
21:22 might be like look we we wanted to know
21:24 too and when we met him they weren't
21:25 very friendly they said you know keep
21:27 your ass in your own little area and by
21:29 the way you're an experiment to see who
21:31 you know if we can create the most
21:33 resilient population or species or
21:39 whatever you're an experiment you know
21:41 who knows that's just an example off the
21:45 deep end but there are groups that that
21:50 gain control and thus money and thus
21:52 power
21:53 and it really comes down to having
21:55 fancier stuff and having sex with
21:58 whoever you want to have sex with I mean
22:01 that's really as simple as it goes when
22:03 it goes up the chain of command right
22:05 and so the straight and narrow could be
22:11 very dark you know John F Kennedy was
22:15 murdered not by Lee Harvey Oswald at all
22:18 right so the folks that did that
22:22 obviously had reasons to maintain their
22:25 their financial control over the United
22:28 States of America their military control
22:30 over the United States of America their
22:32 political control etc etc etc so when
22:35 this guy came in and he was smart enough
22:37 with open eyes to say Jesus we gotta we
22:39 gotta save this country because his
22:41 grandfather remembered what it was like
22:43 before these people moved in and
22:45 completely took everything over so
22:48 seemed as if it was sort of a family
22:50 conspiracy to get America back on track
22:53 a very familiar thing that's happening
22:55 right now
22:56 JFK's killed RFK is killed and Ted
23:00 Kennedy who accidentally murdered his
23:03 girlfriend I don't think he
23:06 intentionally meant to do that but he
23:07 accidentally killed his girlfriend gets
23:09 off scot-free because he's loyal Kennedy
23:12 sort of being the story is narrated that
23:15 he was a coward and she was upside down
23:16 in this car and he did not attempt to
23:19 save her who knows I'm not judging I
23:22 don't know the truth he decided to join
23:25 them and honestly if you had two
23:27 brothers and both of them were murdered
23:30 at a time when two other black leaders
23:33 were murdered at a time when you know
23:37 it's just prior to what was it Nixon had
23:41 one of his running mates murdered or not
23:43 murder excuse me shot in the gut and
23:45 paralyzed right I mean just this country
23:48 was out of [ __ ] control in the 60s
23:50 right so psyops are potentially
23:56 enforcing the Prussian narrative which
23:58 is to say be loyal to country over all
24:00 other things you know
24:02 and then there's the other side which is
24:05 hey don't look over here
24:08 now I'm gonna sound like a bit of a
24:09 broken record but let me just remind you
24:12 let me just talk about it from my own
24:15 perspective I was I guess easily 46
24:22 years old before I ever contemplated for
24:26 a second that the world might be a
24:28 different shape now I went through my
24:30 whole thing I came back using expanding
24:32 earth and a few other things to return
24:35 back to the heliocentric model or at
24:38 least heliocentric ish model you know it
24:43 was funny you know had you ever heard
24:46 anyone in again you know I I was a dude
24:49 who aced the [ __ ] out of college
24:51 astronomy without taking a single note
24:53 okay I have never heard a scientist a
24:57 cosmologists and believe me I owned at
25:00 one point probably a hundred books I
25:01 devoured on the subject including all
25:05 the subatomic stuff blah blah blah so I
25:07 had never heard anyone ever insinuate
25:11 that the world was a pear shape or it
25:13 has swollen Center as a matter of fact
25:16 my teacher in high school and I've heard
25:19 this repeated and I've actually asked
25:20 people to confirm this over time said
25:23 that the this the earth is so smooth
25:26 that if you took a big giant towel and
25:29 you dried off all the oceans
25:30 you know remember some of these are
25:32 seven miles deep plus right that is
25:35 still smoother than the smoothest cue
25:37 ball you could make for a game of pool
25:39 and it's more round but as soon as
25:45 flatterer theory comes out and really
25:48 this statements more for those of you
25:50 who get very angry about someone even
25:52 remotely entertaining the idea Neil
25:56 deGrasse Tyson comes out and says it's
25:58 pear-shaped indicating that there's a
26:01 bottom to the earth like it knows that
26:04 there's up and down I can't imagine a
26:07 more ludicrous example or theory that
26:10 it's pear-shaped
26:12 that comes out and goes away it's like
26:14 he threw it out there too somehow you
26:16 know explains some of the weird data
26:18 coming in from the Flat Earth people and
26:20 then he hasn't said it again since and
26:22 then I think Bill Nye the douchebag guy
26:25 comes out and starts talking about how
26:26 it's I forgot this the name of the shape
26:29 but it's you know the swollen center the
26:30 equator a little more swollen which
26:33 would mean that the top curve and the
26:35 lower curve of the North Pole and the
26:36 South Pole are actually anything but
26:38 pear-shaped I never heard any alternate
26:42 theories about the heliocentric shape of
26:44 the earth until a flat earth community
26:46 forced the scientific community to come
26:48 out with these alternate statements
26:50 never heard it before
26:52 alright it seemed like damage control
26:56 didn't it
26:58 why if it's round it's round if it's not
27:02 it's not I have said several times on
27:05 the show Joe Rogan used to believe that
27:09 we hadn't gone to the moon he had
27:11 aggregated a pretty good collection of
27:13 evidence as to why we didn't go he was
27:18 on Coast to Coast AM radio in calls some
27:20 expert from NASA who tells him a huge
27:23 lie about the haldi saturn v sent the
27:26 capsule through the North Pole of the
27:30 Van Allen belts to make sure it didn't
27:32 run into as much rain at Van Allen belts
27:34 as it would had a gun out the middle
27:36 when the actual inverse concentration of
27:39 electrons in the Van Allen belts would
27:42 make that the most ignorant statement
27:44 because the North Pole in the South
27:45 Poles were at all eject out and
27:47 condenses down into the bowels of the
27:49 earth so going out the North Pole the
27:53 South Pole be the most lethal area but
27:57 Joe bought it and Joe is flipped and now
27:59 Joe Joe feels like he's in the club of
28:01 the rest of the world who believe right
28:05 on a coast to coast you can hear it's
28:09 it's actually a video on YouTube - you
28:12 can hear Joe get punished for having an
28:15 open mind and he's punished with lies in
28:19 the worst part is he bought it or
28:22 someone came up to him but I really
28:24 think that Joe is genuine dude as much
28:26 as he
28:26 I might disagree I think he's genuine I
28:28 think he's speaking from his heart I
28:31 don't think he's sitting there saying
28:32 something he doesn't believe because I
28:34 don't think he fears anybody in this
28:35 world
28:36 least of all physically and I think that
28:40 someone operates from a different tone
28:42 of voice if you have been forced to say
28:45 something you don't believe right I
28:47 don't think that many of you regardless
28:51 if you're pro or against anything I've
28:54 said in this particular episode or any
28:55 other episodes would argue that humanity
28:58 thinking and researching and thinking
29:00 and researching going in that loop is
29:03 anything but a great thing but I think
29:08 that that's what we've allowed to occur
29:12 and we are we are relegated to hanging
29:18 on to official stories lest we be
29:20 demonized to the public at large right
29:23 so what do we do about all this what do
29:28 we do about this sort of orchestrated
29:30 pressure we have fake news organizations
29:33 and I would say almost all of them are
29:35 fake unless they are made by you the
29:37 people then they have a chance of being
29:39 true and then our burden as being sort
29:42 of alternate folks and I'm not saying me
29:44 because I'm not really trying to bring
29:45 you any news but we have to do
29:48 incredible due diligence to figure out
29:51 if what we're saying is actually true
29:54 and again one of the most valuable
29:56 things that you can do with your
29:58 research is simply to call it the
29:59 question and to say well I'm not sure
30:02 you know who did 9/11 or why but I'm
30:05 going to tell you right now those
30:06 buildings were demolished physics
30:08 completely counters everything you saw
30:11 that morning you toe out of 110 stories
30:14 of steel it turned into dust there's
30:17 barely anything left at the bottom of
30:19 those buildings and everyone who's
30:20 involved with pancake Theory knows that
30:22 it would be you know 30 to 35 floors
30:25 worth of steel at the bottom once you
30:27 compress all the air out of the steel
30:28 that took to build that place the
30:31 concrete Center columns of the World
30:33 Trade Centers 1 & 2 simply vanished that
30:37 doesn't happen right they don't fall
30:39 down for one thing and they
30:40 zel don't just vanish right and yes
30:43 there was tons of Steel over the place
30:44 but per capita for the two gigantic 110
30:47 storey buildings something from probably
30:51 space atomized the shine of these things
30:53 the Hutchison effect right
30:55 you know Hutchison who had all of his
30:56 research I think confiscated by the
30:58 Canadian government and then the
30:59 Canadian government sold it to the
31:01 United States government
31:02 crazy right it may be just to simply
31:06 wipe out any evidence that this
31:08 technology exists but there's a lot of
31:10 research students over the last 50 60
31:12 years who have taken paper clips and
31:14 resonated them out of existence takes a
31:17 lot of energy but if the Van Allen belts
31:20 truly exist and we can truly put a
31:22 satellite in space trust me you can find
31:24 pretty much infinite power up there for
31:27 anything you need to do down here on
31:28 earth and John alums Feld said there are
31:30 directed energy weapons within seven
31:32 days of 9/11 with the general standard
31:37 right next one you just said they don't
31:38 use them that's all
31:39 but what do we do about this I think the
31:45 number one thing we can do is be very
31:46 careful as we ridicule people in our own
31:49 brains before we ever speak a word out
31:51 loud before we ever type in a sentence
31:53 in a comment anywhere you know I have an
31:59 episode of the season one I believe
32:00 called the unknown it's a very important
32:02 episode maybe it's in season two I can't
32:03 remember but it's all about being okay
32:06 with not knowing and I think that's
32:10 probably the lubrication we need in our
32:12 brains to to live with uncertainty right
32:17 and I think at this point in our society
32:20 I think a lot of us feel like the
32:24 quality of living has gone down quite a
32:27 bit
32:27 and it usually gets counteracted in the
32:31 United States by people that simply say
32:33 yeah well you have no idea how bad it is
32:36 outside the United States a year
32:37 probably one of the luckier people on
32:39 this planet if you live in the United
32:41 States I've heard arguments to the
32:44 contrary on that to trust me now having
32:46 grown up as a kid in the United States
32:48 of America when people had very little
32:50 knowledge about anything yet they were
32:52 able to
32:54 pay for everything in the house with one
32:55 income I know that today is a farce
33:00 right it is a complete farce and you
33:04 know my father was able to pay all the
33:07 bills when I was a kid he didn't matter
33:10 if he drove a UPS truck or sold used
33:12 cars or whatever worked for the National
33:15 Guard after got out of the military he
33:17 was able to pay all the bills and sure
33:20 it was tight every once in a while
33:21 that's because we went on vacation and
33:23 so we took a little hit but on credit
33:25 cards a little bit of on credit cards
33:26 and to pay it all down so it was good at
33:30 one point the 70s I'm telling you right
33:33 now were in terms of the quality of the
33:35 family it was phenomenal at least in the
33:38 Midwest and I know enough people now in
33:41 their 60s the 70s and 80s here in Los
33:44 Angeles that that sentiment is echoed a
33:47 hundred percent no one said over the
33:49 seventies were horrible
33:50 now gun no one likes war so no one liked
33:52 the Vietnam and what it was doing to our
33:54 kids there's always some little dark
33:55 spot did it the bankers but overall you
34:00 can just go get a college degree you
34:02 could get it without debt and you could
34:04 come out and just get a job and most
34:06 jobs and most degrees were related to
34:07 trade skills right so we always say on
34:09 the show and so the official narrative
34:12 does very little to preserve this magic
34:15 moment in history where things were
34:19 really really good I even think the
34:22 Middle East in general which again you
34:24 know there was the iraq-iran war and a
34:27 few other things I think that most of
34:29 people in those countries actually lived
34:30 a much better life than they do right
34:32 this very second in some regards you
34:35 know of course now they've got
34:37 McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken
34:39 and cell phones and drugs not gonna not
34:42 like we are but I have to say that I am
34:45 unaware of any official narrative that
34:47 if we all followed it
34:49 it would be anything other than slaves
34:52 headed towards the thx 1-1 3-8
34:55 eventualities where we're all wearing
34:56 you know white fascist robes with bald
34:59 heads and just taking our food
35:03 supplements everyday with robotic boston
35:06 dynamic robots you know with dole was a
35:09 silver faces oh cop outfits hitting us
35:12 with counter prods the first sub
35:16 structure that will put that in place is
35:18 socialism which is so hilariously pushed
35:23 by an auntie file the anti-fascism group
35:27 right they are the number one faction on
35:30 this planet that is bringing into effect
35:34 the THX 1-1 3-8 reality in the first
35:38 phase first phase of it all it's really
35:41 funny I was eating my dinner last night
35:43 by myself and I had two gentlemen right
35:46 in front of me
35:47 literally three four feet in front of me
35:49 they're sitting perpendicular to my
35:51 viewing angle and it was two guys having
35:54 sort of a I guess a Trump bashing
35:58 conversation one guys really really
36:02 young probably in his late 20s mid 20s
36:04 and the other guys some really old
36:05 disgusting weird guy and they're going
36:09 back and forth and back and forth and it
36:12 became apparent that the young guy was
36:15 just young and uneducated about the
36:18 world in general which is very typical
36:20 and that's where I was when I was his
36:22 age and again you shouldn't have to
36:23 unless you devote yourself to politics
36:25 no you know anything more than how maybe
36:28 the legislation legislative bodies work
36:30 and how bills are passed and created in
36:32 that kind of thing which we have
36:33 cartoons in the United States to teach
36:35 yeah that works but the older gentleman
36:37 was really struggling to speak the
36:41 English language I think and he
36:45 immediately went into his
36:46 disenfranchised you know spiel which is
36:50 what I covered in the cultism episode
36:52 and he was he was essentially hating on
36:55 everyone else because when he was young
36:57 I guess he was yes he said himself he
36:59 goes I had curly hair and I was fat
37:02 and so people didn't like me and so for
37:07 him the narrative that helps him out is
37:09 to say I'm gonna go with the underdog
37:12 group literally just simply brands
37:14 themselves the underdog group maybe they
37:17 are maybe they aren't you know when your
37:19 group controls all the press in the
37:20 world and all the textbooks I hardly
37:23 think you're the disenfranchised but now
37:26 it used to be back in the day that the
37:28 politicians of the world just became fat
37:30 cats then they gain that control right
37:33 they get the best property the best
37:36 human options for sex they usually stay
37:41 within their age bracket they didn't run
37:42 after children most the time but I would
37:46 say over the last thirty years that's
37:48 all changed and the fringy things that
37:52 we heard happening in Bohemian Grove and
37:54 a bunch of other crazy you know cult
37:57 locations are now starting to become
37:58 mainstream when I was a kid you know if
38:02 somebody murdered someone is a big deal
38:05 serial murders really came out of the
38:08 late 70s Son of Sam and then there's the
38:11 Georgia Killer the Atlanta Georgia
38:12 killer and you know it ramped up and
38:16 nowadays when you hear about what
38:18 happens in the news and man you know
38:20 [ __ ] I don't know maybe this did happen
38:21 a long time ago but it seems like you
38:25 know when someone is caught for murder
38:26 or something is put on the front page of
38:28 all the news to traumatize you so you
38:30 believe everything else there shove them
38:31 down your throat the crimes are
38:33 horrendous and so the the very lust
38:39 fabric that's in a human being starts to
38:41 become insane nowadays in my opinion
38:44 right so the very quality of the of the
38:47 threads in the social fabric of our
38:49 society are started to degrade at rapid
38:51 pace and I don't think this is any news
38:52 to anyone out there
38:54 but the probably around probably around
39:00 the mid 40s we had something introduced
39:02 into the water supply as a test I
39:03 believe in Pennsylvania because it was
39:06 initially told to me fluoride a toxic
39:09 substance that is the residual product
39:12 of creating aluminum now again there's
39:15 minut amounts of this in agriculture but
39:18 we're talking about for the parts per
39:22 million in your toothpaste and the parts
39:23 per million in say black tea it's like
39:26 probably one to a million in terms of
39:29 ratio your body can handle my nude
39:32 amounts that don't have any ability to
39:34 touch your physiology when you start
39:36 jamming the stuff in your mouth it's
39:37 like a lab rat when we feed lab rats GMO
39:41 wheat they grow tumors that are 50% the
39:44 magnitude of their own bodies 50% and
39:47 then they die really quickly
39:48 well we compare that to the way per
39:51 capita we would ingest GMO foods the FDA
39:54 says well you know again I'll be retired
39:56 by the time everyone starts dying to
39:57 cancer and because cancer doesn't leave
39:59 a calling card as to how it occurs no
40:01 will ever find out so the stuff that's
40:05 happening today is a little bit
40:08 different than the stuff that used to
40:09 happen in the past
40:10 we know that depopulation is a central
40:13 focus of the ruling class of the world
40:16 I'll remind you this is very important
40:18 body of mine was hired to speak about
40:22 electric cars and in the room was one of
40:26 the little Rothschild kids right he's
40:29 the young guy that went around and
40:30 couldn't figure out the order of the
40:32 planets right because either he knows
40:34 something we don't or he's one of the
40:35 dumbest people on planet earth you
40:37 missed virtually every astronomy book
40:39 published in the last hundred years
40:42 my friend is no more than 10 minutes
40:44 into his presentation when this
40:46 Rothschild kid said you know I don't
40:47 know why we're worried about all this
40:49 electric car crap what we need to be
40:51 worried about is depopulation and my
40:56 buddies 30-minute presentation was cut
40:59 short as they all went around the room
41:01 you know brown nosing this guy and all
41:05 coming up with depopulation how horrible
41:07 the world
41:08 gonna be and how fast the population is
41:10 going to grow and it's whatever it takes
41:14 to get rid of this and again the big
41:16 threat the passive threat about
41:17 depopulation as if we don't do something
41:19 now that what we're gonna have to do in
41:21 50 to 100 years is going to be draconian
41:24 killing people simply because they exist
41:26 and there you know again the model does
41:32 hold up under certain you know
41:35 mathematical realities you know the the
41:39 population growth is exponential under
41:42 certain scenarios but again as I've
41:45 always said on this show if
41:47 overpopulation was a huge problem then
41:49 there would be cataclysmic changes to
41:51 India and China and none of that is
41:54 happening in fact China removed their
41:56 you know one-child policy because
41:59 they're running out of people to pay for
42:00 the old people's salaries and they're
42:02 definitely running out of girls the
42:03 number I've heard is there's 11 boys to
42:06 every girl but in China the boys are
42:08 worshipped as princes and kings and the
42:12 girls are just bull you know they're the
42:14 stupid idiots right again these are for
42:16 my friends who are Chinese that go to
42:18 China constantly from China telling me
42:21 this so I guess they could be wrong but
42:23 I'm not just making that up out of some
42:25 weird article I read and I have at least
42:28 one American friend who's lived there
42:29 for seven years and he loves it over
42:32 there he loves the people but we're not
42:35 doing anything about curbing population
42:38 control on a level that is sort of a
42:42 household methodology right two people
42:45 have one child they get their child but
42:48 they reduce population by one to people
42:50 of to maintains anything over expands
42:53 right we have you know clouds now
42:59 exclusively made by planes exclusively
43:03 made by sky right now is probably about
43:05 I know 25-30 percent full of white
43:10 debris that is coming out of planes that
43:13 can't seem to you know keep the show
43:16 coming out of the plane the entire time
43:18 it started
43:18 stops as logical shapes and all kinds of
43:21 stuff see my episodes on chemtrails to
43:24 hear all the details about that but the
43:26 second they started spraying of November
43:28 10th I filmed a little video for MKULTRA
43:32 radio page on Facebook told everyone
43:35 they're gonna get sick and sure enough
43:37 within five days everybody I knew in Los
43:41 Angeles was fighting a cold couple my
43:43 friends got severely ill and you know if
43:46 you if you have a friend who's your age
43:49 young and they get sick I'm making that
43:53 bio statement right now you're like okay
43:56 you're gonna pull through it you'll just
43:57 get a little cold and that's okay but
43:59 when you have friends in their 80s and
44:00 70s who gets these ailments you know a
44:04 cold could kill them combined with other
44:07 elements and a weaker immune system and
44:10 age in general and so I think they know
44:13 what game they're playing flouride 1954
44:16 was made a mainstream chemical in all
44:19 well not all water but anyone it was
44:21 susceptible to putting that in there in
44:23 the water supply I did find out recently
44:25 I'd say within the last ten years that
44:27 my home town did not fluoridate its
44:29 water they may have done it since but
44:32 when I was growing up I didn't have it
44:33 right but again I didn't sit around
44:36 drinking water out of a tap very much
44:39 but who knows how that absorbs into your
44:41 system right so back on track with the
44:46 SIOP train the thing is is the more
44:51 people that wake up its going to mess
44:55 with the official narrative what's
44:57 beautiful about it is that psyops no
45:00 matter how they work unless they can
45:02 infect your body with a chemical
45:04 aspartame fluoride whatever GMO foods
45:08 that just simply terminate your gene
45:09 sequence unless they can get inside your
45:13 body vaccinations flu shots all that
45:17 [ __ ] you're going to be a problem no
45:20 matter how they try to come at you
45:22 because you're gonna think you're gonna
45:24 research you know some due diligence as
45:26 long as there's a little humility in
45:28 your own opinion making process you'll
45:30 come out on top in the end
45:32 and that's what's exciting one of the
45:34 reasons why I like making episodes like
45:36 this on a fairly maybe every 20 episode
45:40 heartbeat is we do need reminders that
45:44 this stuff's going on around us we do
45:46 need reminders every once in a while to
45:47 stay in control stay in control own your
45:51 own opinions of all things there is a an
45:56 amazing amount of history that was
45:59 injected into us about the 20th century
46:01 there's now being undone that has
46:04 essentially been forbidden to be even
46:08 questioned some of you know exactly what
46:11 I'm talking about
46:12 right people are said to be some of the
46:13 most evil people in the world that ever
46:15 existed now being exonerated at alarming
46:19 rates and what's interesting is they're
46:21 being exonerated by people that were
46:23 supposedly the victims of these
46:25 individuals and so could you imagine
46:28 someone telling you a story that your
46:29 uncle died because of a bad person and
46:32 you pretty much believe that your whole
46:34 life and then he hit 40 and new
46:37 information starts arising and you start
46:39 going oh my god was I being duped was I
46:43 being duped that I was a victim of this
46:46 particular individual when it never
46:49 really happened and truth is so powerful
46:52 for people these days that they are
46:53 actually eyes ain't coming around and
46:56 they're there saying look I would rather
46:59 know the truth and that I was duped than
47:01 anything else in the entire world and
47:04 then I'm gonna find out how that came to
47:06 pass who's enforcing it to this day you
47:09 know we have this big saying right now
47:11 that's been around for quite a while but
47:13 was a hunter Thompson said on 911 the
47:16 morning of 9/11 he said just follow the
47:18 money and you'll find out who did this
47:19 and he was right but revised history
47:22 that is enforced by laws let's just say
47:25 is also you know it's not necessarily
47:29 follow the money is follow the benefit
47:31 structure who benefited right which is
47:34 the other saying I can't remember it's
47:35 in Latin dude I've had individuals in my
47:39 life that I've given the privilege to to
47:42 instruct me and be my bosses
47:45 and I have to say that the majority of
47:49 them honored that privilege
47:51 beautifully and every time I'm given a
47:53 role of authority I do my very best to
47:56 be as humble and as humiliated as
47:58 possible and really keep my employees
48:00 safe and happy and on the right track
48:04 but there's been a couple times where
48:06 I've had individuals that for whatever
48:08 reason you through cronyism or nepotism
48:11 or just sheer luck they get to be my
48:14 boss and you know I don't care really
48:17 how anyone gets in charge of my you know
48:21 daily efforts or whatever as long as
48:23 they're good people they don't have to
48:24 be perfect it can have flaws they can
48:26 mess up you can have bad judgment every
48:29 once in a while we're all human right
48:31 but what's interesting is the ones that
48:34 really are and I've only met a couple
48:36 that are really truly I think dark
48:38 inside I don't know if anyone's truly
48:41 evil I don't know if I've ever loved
48:42 anyone like that but they're about to do
48:44 a few folks that are I say extremely
48:48 selfish and what what has been the case
48:54 for me and I'm making this example
48:55 because this is where you're gonna view
48:57 yourself in contrast to society and
48:59 controlling bodies around you to be
49:02 governmental or whatever on an
49:05 individual level this is much easier but
49:07 the times that I have essentially taken
49:13 away their control and probably angered
49:18 them as when I simply communicated with
49:22 them I am no longer allowing you to
49:24 control me I quit you know and I haven't
49:28 really well actually I guess I've jumped
49:30 ship a couple times when companies that
49:32 I've worked for got the wrong leadership
49:34 that could sense that we were going out
49:36 of business even though in fact I left
49:39 one company that had just gotten a huge
49:41 three and a half million dollar infusion
49:43 of cash and I watched marketing below it
49:46 on a level that was incredible and I
49:50 essentially found a new job I was
49:52 jumping ship from the database industry
49:54 into the internet industry hundred
49:57 percent
49:58 took a tiny pig cut really tiny pay cut
50:01 and the CEO wandered in my room my
50:05 office one day
50:06 has he had heard that I had resigned and
50:10 he was being very cordial about it and I
50:12 don't know if he cared whether or not
50:13 his company went down or not because he
50:15 was brought in as sort of an emergency
50:16 CEO to fix things he didn't really try
50:19 to talk me back into staying or anything
50:21 like that but in the conversation it
50:23 came up where I told him I said you know
50:26 your company's going out of business and
50:28 I've been with this company since 1982
50:30 and now it's 1997 actually I was in
50:33 there in 1991 so off and on I was work
50:36 for them as their chief engineer and
50:38 then I left it some consulting work when
50:41 I came back as their one of their lead
50:43 designers and he looked at me funny like
50:47 you really think we're gonna business
50:48 you know we just got some money and we
50:51 just did a bunch of marketing push and
50:52 all this other stuff and I said yeah you
50:54 know I just I just know it is this is
50:56 done and sure enough within within 12
51:00 months of me leaving the company had
51:02 sold its brand and his technology off to
51:04 some other company funny thing is it he
51:06 still exists to this day and I have no
51:08 idea on earth who would ever buy the
51:10 product and ever use it but they still
51:12 it's still out there like old legacy
51:14 point-of-sale systems you'll see that
51:16 running das at some restaurant you know
51:18 it's a company that hasn't sold a copy
51:20 hasn't sold a new copy since 1995 but
51:22 they still have you know installed base
51:24 of a couple files and they can keep
51:25 people employed right reason why I
51:28 mention that example to you is that a
51:29 lot of what you think controls you is
51:31 simply in your head all right
51:34 national debt is just a concept that we
51:37 believe as a society when all the debt
51:39 that we have acquired is through illegal
51:41 Ponzi schemes but we sit around and
51:43 worry about the national debt debt to
51:47 whom banking cartels that loan us money
51:50 with no ability to pay back the interest
51:53 that it is never created isn't that
51:57 interesting who would have ever thought
51:59 that's that we would have millions of
52:01 people around the world who understand
52:03 that all of a sudden the Internet's made
52:05 that possible for now right
52:07 I don't usually mention current affairs
52:09 that much but I do want to say because I
52:11 had a couple young
52:12 people come at me from there they're in
52:13 their early 20s and they said they're
52:16 very concerned but because I am a
52:19 trusted asset of their family they were
52:22 coming to me and saying well what about
52:23 this net neutrality thing isn't it
52:25 something we want to save you know it
52:27 sounds good net neutrality well when you
52:30 follow the money and you follow who
52:31 benefits from it it was funded up to I
52:34 believe 72 million dollars to create the
52:36 bill that was passed and it was funded
52:38 by George Soros championed by Google and
52:42 Apple and all these companies that want
52:43 to legally engage in censorship the
52:48 Patriot Act is anything other than
52:49 patriotic and net neutrality is anything
52:52 other than neutral and of course they
52:54 scare you with these stupid stories
52:56 about will you know the the ISPs the
52:58 Internet service providers can charge
53:00 you you know different bandwidths for
53:02 television versus audio versus video and
53:05 also their stuff and it's like not a
53:07 free market they can right and we'll
53:11 just simply stop buying their [ __ ]
53:12 if that's the case we will create our
53:14 own little dark net or subnet or kim.com
53:16 net and we'll wipe you out and you'll
53:20 have no power over us because you happen
53:22 to like Princess Lee I said Tarkin
53:24 squeezed too much we pop out through
53:26 your fingers right slip through your
53:29 fingers I guess is the term so as I'm
53:32 preaching to you that you should
53:33 maintain control over your own mind that
53:35 have your own discipline towards things
53:37 some of you might have this feeling of
53:40 disparage that that's not a possibility
53:42 for you but it is it is instantaneously
53:46 you know one of the problems we have
53:49 though is that this starts happening a
53:51 little too early and it starts happening
53:52 in areas that shouldn't happen sometimes
53:56 what am I talking about well how many
53:58 times well it's for this way if you're
54:01 over 45 let's just say which means you
54:03 have a pretty good grasp of what it was
54:05 like to live in the 70s kids did not
54:07 live off to their parents like they do
54:09 today kids did not do things in society
54:12 in least most of America like they do
54:15 today disobeying is sort of the way that
54:18 one conceives of a rite of passage in
54:21 today's environment which is obviously
54:24 good because unless the child is able to
54:27 acquire tremendous amount of education
54:30 and eclipse their parents experience
54:33 with life right and their wisdom of life
54:35 they're not equipped to make their own
54:38 decisions yet the Society says a rebel
54:42 rebel rebel this is what's cool right
54:45 the other thing to keep in mind which I
54:48 may or may not have mentioned in the the
54:50 YouTube phenomenon video is you know
54:53 with this new medium in this new batch
54:56 of information about reality one there
55:00 is no policing of the information which
55:03 again is good right we do want we don't
55:05 you know we do not want a bunch of
55:07 regulations on how we pass new
55:11 information from one person to another
55:13 it is best if the information is passed
55:15 in a public forum which is why I love
55:17 YouTube if I were to come up here and
55:19 tell you something nuts and put it on
55:21 YouTube
55:22 well then it's out there for the world
55:23 and it can get picked up by news
55:25 organizations bloggers and they could
55:26 say listen to this guy's crazy thing
55:29 right there's been a reprisal of
55:32 interest in the know forest on Flat
55:35 Earth theory that you know every every
55:39 volcanic magma crystallization is the
55:44 base of a tree well that guy put himself
55:47 out there he created a tremendous amount
55:48 of interest it was ripped off and
55:50 reposted a thousand times translated
55:52 also to stuff and hey in the end it's
55:54 probably all horse crap for the reasons
55:56 I noted in my episode against it but
55:58 what's beautiful about it is everybody
56:00 started thinking for a split second and
56:02 some people kept thinking as a results
56:04 I've ever seen right so if we're in a
56:08 new medium whereby information is going
56:10 around and we're trying to figure out
56:11 what's a PSYOP and what's real well you
56:16 know anything that's controversial could
56:19 be called a PSYOP anything doesn't mean
56:22 it is right a PSYOP is truly someone who
56:25 is in government or a deep state
56:28 organization who's trying to manipulate
56:30 your belief system such that again
56:33 you'll get burned or
56:35 you get burned in reputation but let's
56:38 say that you don't have any friends or
56:39 family that you share this stuff with
56:40 you just don't you're smart you want to
56:43 vet it for years before you ever pass it
56:45 out to anyone you're waiting for a
56:47 rocket test to find out what they're not
56:49 the world's round or not right you still
56:53 have it going on inside your mind and so
56:56 there's still a game being played all
56:57 the time inside our hearts inside our
56:59 souls I had a weird vision the other day
57:03 and it was just one of these silly
57:06 things it was I was working on some
57:08 script ideas and what I'm about to say
57:13 is not relating any script of mine but I
57:14 thought imagine you die and your your
57:18 body passes away and your soul
57:19 transcends to the other ubiquitous layer
57:23 of reality with all the other souls and
57:26 you find yourself sort of proverbially
57:30 in a proverbially inside a locker room
57:35 of some sort and you're kind of coming
57:38 off your shift you're like well what am
57:41 I doing here you're like yeah yeah yeah
57:42 that'd be inhuman thing yeah
57:44 well that was just you know we're
57:47 working on an experiment here to create
57:48 the best human figure and then you go
57:54 but my vision just kept kind of going
57:56 and going and it was like having that
57:58 conversation with someone in the locker
57:59 room and you're saying well really that
58:02 was that was an experiment yeah this
58:04 whole thing yeah yeah it's a disc but
58:06 you know we got it under control trust
58:08 me they'll never figure it out no matter
58:09 what and you go well what happened what
58:13 was all the chemtrails for all the
58:14 poisonous stuff and oh oh that well you
58:17 know what's going on with that is that
58:18 we've allowed the leaders of that of
58:21 that realm to know what's kind of going
58:22 on just a little bit so they know it's
58:24 kind of hit but we do have to control
58:26 the population within the within the
58:28 dome and we'd rather not unleash the
58:31 plague and create a lot of suffering so
58:33 we're letting people have a pretty good
58:34 life but it's gonna be shortened by
58:36 toxins and that kind of stuff so we have
58:38 to keep this all under control and you
58:41 know then you're kind of going what do I
58:43 do now I think you take a break if you
58:44 want there's a bunch of cheez-its in
58:46 that room over there and
58:48 women over there if that's what you're
58:49 into and you know eventually you come
58:52 back and you can dial up wherever you
58:53 want to be in society we don't let you
58:56 go back in time or anything but you can
58:58 drop in wherever you want there's a
59:01 whole scale of difficulty right there if
59:03 you want to be a little boy in a slum
59:04 slumlord place in India you can do that
59:07 or you can be a privileged you know rich
59:09 kid but those rich kid slots are going
59:11 fast you know
59:12 alright and the the thing the whole kind
59:16 of weird storyline in my head which is
59:19 obviously just a fictional thought
59:21 process I was going through is that
59:23 maybe this world doesn't matter as much
59:26 as we think it does second to second but
59:31 even if we are an experiment and this is
59:32 a matrix and all that kind of thing then
59:34 it would be essentially a really amazing
59:37 video game it is the ultimate VR we are
59:41 in it to win it you know and imagine if
59:46 you kept a tremendous amount of your
59:47 wisdom and knowledge as sort of this
59:49 algorithmic knowledge and instinct in
59:51 your system as a soul and then you go
59:53 back down and live again then you sort
59:55 of have that third eye it's it's you
59:59 know I shouldn't do this I feel like
60:00 I've done this before I feel like that's
60:02 a bad idea and you don't you know zip
60:06 down the highway in some old shity car
60:08 going 130 miles an hour
60:10 and then you you you wreck and die that
60:12 doesn't happen because you have an
60:14 instinct that that's a bad idea because
60:15 you've either done it before you saw
60:16 someone do it perspective I don't think
60:22 everything that you disagree with online
60:24 or that has a movement as a saya I think
60:29 it would be an amazing piece of
60:31 information to learn is it aasaiya have
60:34 you ever wondered what it'd be like to
60:36 know all the facts of the universe that
60:38 you live in
60:39 basically planet Earth just what's
60:42 really going on who's really in charge
60:44 who built the Georgia Guidestones who
60:46 updated the Georgia Guidestones with a
60:47 little 2014 stone at the top who did
60:50 that why did they do that someone spent
60:51 some money someone organized this and
60:53 when sliced it out put this little brick
60:55 in there well what happened in 2014 I
60:58 don't know of any cataclysmic thing that
61:00 happened in 2014 to you
61:02 supposedly world was supposed to end you
61:05 know due to Planet X [ __ ] you know
61:08 which keeps coming and going and coming
61:09 and going and people keep jumping on
61:11 that religious bandwagon that there's
61:13 this alternate solar system that kind of
61:15 orbits into our solar system and kills
61:17 everything how many times oh these
61:19 people jump on that bandwagon and fail
61:21 and keep jumping back on why would they
61:24 do that what's their motivation inside
61:26 to believe in a doomsday situation is
61:29 that the doomsday promise you know God's
61:34 coming the dome owners are coming it's
61:36 all gonna be resolved no more taxes no
61:38 more stress it's Cinnabons for everybody
61:42 right it used to be that we would say
61:44 hey get a good education and all this
61:46 will be a hell of a lot easier and
61:48 there's probably more truth to that than
61:50 anything else but nowadays we know that
61:53 textbooks are written by European
61:54 agencies to keep you away from knowing
61:57 how things work in this world as we
61:59 always say on the show do you then lack
62:02 the capability of making connections you
62:06 lack the ability to develop any valuable
62:07 intuition that's a pretty slippery slope
62:13 the two gentlemen in front of me were
62:15 talking last night is it this guy god
62:18 bless him you know he was yeah I hate to
62:24 say this but you you know you've been in
62:26 public and you've talked to people who
62:27 think slowly you can just hear it in
62:29 their sentence construction you can hear
62:32 it in their gullibility of what they
62:33 think is true and false like they're so
62:36 certain about things that can't be
62:37 certain about etc accession he was
62:40 saying that he is completely against the
62:44 home schooling that people do today now
62:48 I will confess that when I first heard
62:50 about one of my relatives homeschooling
62:52 I was pretty terrified because she might
62:54 be one of the
62:55 least educated least experienced human
62:58 beings in our entire family so when she
63:01 was gonna homeschool her kids I was like
63:03 oh my god
63:04 really the blind leading the blind this
63:06 is horrendous but then I started meeting
63:09 people who were young people in their
63:13 20s and they were extremely brilliant
63:16 extremely I would say on the straight
63:19 and narrow of truth capable of kind of
63:22 saying I don't know what the truth is
63:23 most the time but I'm I research and I
63:26 try to figure out what makes sense and
63:27 what doesn't make sense right and then I
63:31 said well you know where'd you go to
63:32 school
63:32 it came up oh well up until high school
63:36 I was home-schooled and then I went to
63:38 high school and I said well what was
63:40 that experience like I said was pretty
63:41 tough actually and I said my brain I'm
63:43 thinking oh because your parents didn't
63:45 teach you much right and you're
63:46 struggling with catching up with
63:48 everyone in an academic level and it was
63:50 completely the opposite they said no
63:52 everybody was stupid at school I
63:54 couldn't believe the basics that they
63:56 didn't understand and so it was very
63:59 very tough and so I thought of schools
64:02 more like a social experience and if I
64:04 really wanted to continue my education I
64:06 had to take over all my parent left off
64:08 and so and the same was true for their
64:12 their college days as well but they're
64:15 able to kind of get into advanced
64:16 placement courses and challenge
64:19 themselves for the first time since they
64:21 got out of their own home schooling so
64:23 home schooling is a lot different now
64:24 than it used to be right there's always
64:27 exceptions to the rule always but what
64:32 this guy was saying without saying it it
64:35 was in front of me at this restaurant
64:36 last night was that you know his concern
64:40 was that the official narrative of which
64:43 he obviously was hugging very tightly to
64:45 his chest was no longer going to
64:47 propagate more children into the system
64:49 that would be compatible with his
64:51 narrative of the world so it was kind of
64:54 protectionism for his own compatibility
64:56 with the universe of which seen through
64:59 his conversation with this other younger
65:00 guy he had just pretty much reached the
65:03 sweet spot where the social justice
65:05 warrior fabric of antifa
65:06 gave him a platform to be
65:08 disenfranchised
65:09 to say yeah I hate all pretty people the
65:13 guy said no less than three times
65:15 probably more how he was fat and he had
65:19 curly hair and you know he said that um
65:23 he made this interesting example it's
65:25 really funny he said if I want to care
65:28 about what I look like he goes I would
65:30 stay inside all day
65:32 and he goes or I would get rid of all
65:35 the mirrors in the world
65:37 Wow that's that was kind of a weird
65:40 statement right he obviously was very
65:43 comfortable well at least in his outward
65:46 persona he was comfortable in being
65:49 overweight being very scruffy has a
65:52 really weird beard and he did have very
65:55 curly hair so he said he had curly hair
65:57 he wasn't joking very dense super tight
65:59 curly hair it's all grey you know and I
66:03 think what he was trying to get to what
66:05 this kid was to say you know let's not
66:07 let pretty people take over the world
66:10 which is kind of funny because the guy
66:11 he was talking to was on all accounts a
66:14 very handsome very well-built probably
66:16 six foot plus kid who was essentially
66:20 being indoctrinated by this guy across
66:22 the table how they know each other I
66:23 don't know they didn't seem to have any
66:27 relation or work stories or any you know
66:31 back surgeries like they were just meet
66:32 each other for the first time at this
66:34 restaurant
66:35 even though was right a little tender
66:36 action against me you certainly didn't
66:38 look compatible and tell you that but it
66:42 was eye-opening just sit and watch this
66:44 was kind of painful for about half of it
66:46 then I started kind of listening to this
66:48 guy go on and on you know Marilyn Manson
66:50 has made an entire career out of the
66:52 disenfranchised his entire life he wrote
66:54 the song the beautiful people and I will
66:58 say that that song really shook my mind
67:01 back when he came out with that and I
67:03 thought oh my god yeah I guess from the
67:06 perspective if you didn't feel like you
67:07 were pretty which is obviously a social
67:11 definition of what is pretty there's
67:13 always someone for somebody always is
67:15 right
67:16 no matter what you look like there's
67:18 someone out there who loves exactly what
67:19 you look like period exactly who you are
67:22 as a human being what you know what you
67:23 don't know right but he was talking
67:26 about how going to school made him you
67:28 know very uncomfortable being in society
67:32 made him uncomfortable
67:34 and so his kind of subtextual goal was
67:38 to make everyone uncomfortable so that
67:41 he wouldn't be sort of the only guy who
67:43 feels this way
67:44 I don't know what I would have been like
67:46 as a person where I looked in the mirror
67:47 and thought I was unattractive I don't
67:49 know I don't know what that would be
67:50 like right I didn't really you know if
67:54 anyone ever complimented the way I
67:55 looked as a kid which definitely
67:57 happened I was sort of incapable of
68:01 letting it go to my head or become a
68:03 part of me I'd ever walked into a room
68:05 and said well I'm definitely
68:06 better-looking than that person just
68:09 whatever reason my upbringing my genes
68:11 it just was repulsed by such an elitist
68:14 notion you know and again I might be
68:20 good-looking in my neighborhood but in
68:21 other neighborhoods I am you know the
68:23 devil who knows right I hope you feel me
68:26 I'll lose in my light so I'm gonna go
68:28 ahead and sign off here it's even darker
68:31 wear sunglasses of course but if you're
68:34 on the truth path with the capital T you
68:39 know it's a tough path to have I got
68:40 lots of episodes about it there's a lot
68:43 of punishment involved with it just you
68:50 know as much as you might think that
68:52 things are psyops you don't throw it out
68:54 there keep it out there in the back of
68:55 your head but I think the official story
68:58 is more of a PSYOP than any conspiracy
69:00 out there so let's do this you know I
69:03 know that people make videos bait
69:04 everyone to make comments and I always
69:06 absolutely hate hearing this [ __ ] at
69:09 the end of an episode on YouTube it's
69:11 like tell me what you think about the
69:14 Oreo cookies in the can you know in the
69:16 comments section but let's do this in
69:19 this particular comment section because
69:21 you guys have some big brains out there
69:23 men and your comments are usually
69:24 insanely insightful with just a sentence
69:27 or two feel free to write a
69:29 a festive just picking on one comment
69:31 for me please let me know what you fear
69:36 is a PSYOP out there and also let me
69:40 know what you think might just be an
69:41 organic movement that has either state
69:45 organic or become a PSYOP you know let's
69:48 let's delve into some of things mention
69:50 Flat Earth mention whatever you want to
69:52 do conspiracies of history or science or
69:56 whatever but where do you think where we
69:59 have it most correct and where do you
70:01 think we're being duped away from the
70:03 most correct or duped into something
70:05 that is completely incorrect right yes I
70:09 think that has value I would love to
70:10 compare notes with you guys and I think
70:12 it would be healthy for all of us to
70:13 kind of compare notes on this particular
70:15 episode so deep thoughts radio calm for
70:19 all the feeds there's video and audio
70:21 your video is YouTube and Vimeo
70:25 audio is iTunes and Google Play which
70:28 you can just go to deep thoughts radio
70:29 calm and subscribe to the the RSS feed
70:34 straight from there I will warn you as
70:36 of right now in December actually it's
70:39 the tail end in November 2017 I had to
70:41 move off of a really expensive server
70:43 which does a much better job hosting the
70:46 podcast you're gonna need to download
70:48 the episodes to whatever podcast device
70:51 you have because you will not be able to
70:52 start and stop at least with podcast
70:54 attic you can't do it to start and stop
70:56 in the middle of an episode because the
70:58 server I think is having a bit of a it's
71:01 just configured not to allow somehow
71:02 random access to an mp3 I don't know why
71:05 there's also a patreon if you guys want
71:07 to contribute some folks have said that
71:11 they don't want to go through patreon
71:13 because they take so much tax out of
71:16 your contribution I might be putting up
71:18 a PayPal for any what he wants to do
71:20 that I'm not sure if there's a
71:22 reoccurring PayPal interface i I've done
71:24 a lot of PayPal programming in my life
71:26 but I've never done a
71:27 I've used other services once they want
71:29 to go to a reoccurring billing system we
71:32 go to much more powerful systems they
71:35 use all kinds of different backends but
71:37 so I might put that together if you guys
71:39 are interested in that but regardless
71:41 take care of yourself and someone else
71:43 and I will see in the next thoughts
