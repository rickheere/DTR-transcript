00:29 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:31 deep thoughts as the Huntington Beach
00:35 helicopter is flying in some circle
00:38 around my house just as I turned on the
00:40 camera of course today I wanted to talk
00:45 about a subject that I've had on my list
00:47 forever but thanks to a woman named Rosa
00:51 Corey I want to spell this her I'm gonna
00:54 put links down below
00:55 she's got an entire movement that is
00:58 educating about this that is actually
00:59 suing various sections of the government
01:02 to make sure that we don't fall victim
01:06 to this in America the agenda 21 is very
01:11 interesting because in my experience it
01:13 is the number one thing that people
01:15 don't know anything about but it is the
01:18 single most active program on planet
01:21 earth and it actually encompasses a ton
01:25 of other things like global warming /
01:29 climate change any of this regulatory
01:32 stuff where we can't use our resources
01:36 but when you go into agenda 21 which is
01:39 actually I'm gonna probably dual title
01:41 this because it's now been rebranded
01:43 agenda 2030 because they know they need
01:46 another 10 years to pull this off you'll
01:49 get all kinds of people trying to
01:52 interpret the information it is
01:54 extremely complicated if you try to go
01:57 into their office created documentation
01:59 and make any sense out of it now people
02:03 have been making sense out of it for a
02:04 really long time today in America they
02:08 are trying to devour this country
02:10 destroy rural communities force everyone
02:14 into the cities and then compact the
02:17 city so tightly and install so much
02:19 surveillance and eventually obviously
02:21 the social credit system will will seep
02:24 in here to penalize us you know thx 138
02:30 a crazy first movie that George Lucas
02:35 made all the sudden
02:37 has a path it's very interesting how
02:41 that predictive programming happens if
02:44 you haven't seen that movie you need to
02:45 see it's got Robert Duvall in it of all
02:48 things most of the other actors you
02:51 would only know if you were a very
02:55 sentient person in the 70s this [ __ ]
02:59 helicopter crisis getting added an hour
03:01 on the episode so I'm going to go off of
03:05 one of roses shortest video she's ever
03:09 made it's it's actually about 20 minutes
03:10 on YouTube but she only speaks for about
03:13 15 of the 20 so company I'm gonna use
03:17 some of her points a lot of her points
03:20 and I'm gonna use some stuff that I
03:22 already know about and you folks know
03:25 that I've talked about this a lot and
03:27 I've talked about some other things like
03:28 the Georgia Guidestones which I think
03:29 I'm going to end this episode with just
03:31 in case what you need to understand is
03:35 this is going to be the well this is the
03:37 most invasive amazing horrible
03:41 conspiracy going on on planet earth
03:44 because it's all tyrannical the end
03:47 product the end goal is Buber tyrannical
03:52 it's it makes George Orwell lay down and
03:56 take a nap
03:57 it makes Huxley lay down and take a nap
04:00 they are going to reduce world
04:03 population by about 99 percent in my
04:08 estimations we're gonna be compacted
04:11 into cities you will not be ever allowed
04:13 to go into the country unless you're
04:17 married to some government official or
04:20 aristocrat or maybe you're the fraction
04:24 of a tiny sliver of a fraction of a
04:26 percent of folks that are assigned to
04:28 taking care of the wildlife meaning
04:31 keeping people out but this was hatched
04:34 in 1992 by and signed by a hundred and
04:38 seventy nine nations so there's your
04:41 first piece of actual fact that wipes
04:44 this thing out as any type of conspiracy
04:47 Gorbachev was here in the United States
04:50 of America when they
04:51 at the UN it's a UN program so anybody
04:53 who's ever telling you we should get rid
04:55 of the UN that's why that's one of the
04:58 biggest reasons why and everything that
05:01 Donald Trump has done in America has
05:03 been to counteract this entire insanity
05:06 getting rid of NAFTA turning back on our
05:09 resources ceasing the demon a demon
05:12 ization
05:13 of our resources until we find something
05:15 better and there will be something
05:18 better than coal there will be something
05:19 better than oil but in the meantime
05:22 we've got to turn on what we have
05:23 because the Patent Office has worked
05:25 with the deep state to ensure that all
05:27 things that are clean like Stan Meyers
05:30 engine go see my episode on stay in
05:32 Myers it runs on water and eject steam
05:35 out of the back of your car right he
05:39 wasn't able to get that you know going
05:41 before they killed him in 1998 but their
05:45 goal is to inventory and control all
05:48 land water resources plants animals
05:54 construction production of food and
05:57 energy and of course us which they're
06:01 going to refer to as equity the
06:05 population of the earth itself now
06:08 technically speaking when they did this
06:10 treaty it was called the agenda for the
06:12 21st century
06:14 their cover story about this whole thing
06:16 is sustainable living right and what
06:22 they want to do and what they are doing
06:25 slowly now that you have to know the EU
06:27 is a thousand percent inside of agenda
06:29 21 with absolutely no resistance
06:32 whatsoever it is as if their people
06:34 haven't heard about it which is
06:36 fascinating but they are trying to
06:39 create this notion of community now that
06:44 sounds great right community think
06:47 problem is is that definition of
06:49 community is not what you and I would
06:53 call the definition of community because
06:56 any sentient human being on planet earth
06:59 would think about the neelam the the
07:01 inalienable rights excuse me that you
07:04 get as a human
07:05 being in America we were founded on the
07:10 Republic the Republic as a form of
07:12 government that acknowledges the daily
07:15 above a human being things that can
07:18 never be taken away because you're alive
07:20 because you have a heartbeat the new
07:24 corporation communities which will be
07:27 the institutions that control and define
07:30 what a community is allowed to be will
07:34 not have any of that one of the biggest
07:38 things that that shocked me as a young
07:40 man and I've told the story once before
07:42 was when I went to Barnes & Noble to get
07:45 a book on creating my first corporation
07:48 it is a nice book look beautiful he's
07:51 huge is like a big 8 by 11 thing but the
07:56 very first chapter was trying to get me
07:59 to divorce myself from the value of
08:02 humanity and individualism and surrender
08:05 it to the corporation that I was going
08:08 to be creating and to prioritize only
08:10 one thing profit for shareholders that
08:15 means you know health care isn't
08:16 something they're concerned about the
08:18 quality of living is not something they
08:20 care about which means perhaps the
08:22 salary range how many hours the
08:24 employees work what you're supposed to
08:25 work them to death you know work up to
08:28 the very brink of the law well that's
08:31 what their that's their mo now how does
08:35 the government work right now the
08:37 government works at least it's supposed
08:39 to work and we know that because of deep
08:41 Staters and there's a plenty of them now
08:43 showing all their colors in the United
08:45 States of America we're supposed to
08:48 elect officials through regional voting
08:50 and then that person is supposed to
08:53 represent us when they go to Washington
08:56 DC or our local state legislation or
09:00 community but we elect them and if they
09:04 don't do what we ask them to do or what
09:06 they said they would do which has to be
09:08 congruent with what our desires then
09:11 they are not reelected and someone else
09:13 gets the job because but because they
09:14 love their job they have big money and
09:17 big benefits big retirement
09:18 they want to stay on so they tend to do
09:22 what we like
09:23 inside agenda21 they completely ignore
09:28 all elected officials and they're
09:31 building up these government
09:32 institutions that are appointed hmm what
09:36 are some of those examples well no one
09:38 votes for who runs the FDA the EPA the
09:41 CDC all these big organizations are
09:44 appointed you know we technically don't
09:47 vote for who runs all of our
09:48 intelligence agencies we don't at least
09:51 we vote for the sheriff you know so one
09:55 of the things so actually I should I
09:57 should explain roses background she
09:59 actually was the legal representation
10:01 for California California transportation
10:05 but very specifically she was involved
10:08 in evaluating the value of land which is
10:12 extremely difficult to do because you
10:15 know you don't know what someone's gonna
10:16 do with land
10:17 maybe there's a loyal underneath it
10:19 maybe there's copper underneath it maybe
10:21 it's the greatest agricultural spread in
10:23 your local area so as she continued
10:28 working in this division of government
10:31 she started to realize that there were
10:34 tremendous amounts of restrictions on
10:36 land and she started looking behind all
10:40 of the agencies that were kind of
10:41 manipulating her area of government
10:43 regardless of restrictions are not and
10:47 it started to become apparent that even
10:50 though you own land these federal
10:52 agencies are getting bigger and bigger
10:54 and bigger and they are controlling
10:56 whether or not you can build a home on
10:58 your land now some of you might go well
11:01 that makes a little bit of sense you
11:03 don't want a betelgeuse house right next
11:04 to your house right but we're talking
11:07 about you own 4,000 acres of land which
11:11 if any of you don't know how big that is
11:12 that means you could be if you were in
11:14 the middle of that plot of land you
11:16 couldn't see your borders and in most
11:20 cases there's even a slight bump in the
11:23 land you wouldn't see the edges and you
11:24 want to build a house directly in the
11:26 center of your 4,000 acres I mean no
11:29 one's even going to know you're doing it
11:30 unless they get the permission to
11:32 into your land or fly over you with a
11:34 helicopter that's how private four
11:36 thousand acres is but she gave an
11:40 example in a different video where she
11:42 said that this family that wanted to
11:45 build their house had to surrender part
11:50 of their acreage and donate it to the
11:52 state in order to get the permits to
11:55 build their house whoo it's not even in
11:59 an eminent domain it's extortion I
12:02 dearly hope that family came once this
12:05 is all done and these guys are wiped off
12:07 the face of the planet that that family
12:08 can get their land back because that's
12:10 ridiculous there are cases where people
12:13 went ahead and built on their land
12:16 saying screw that then the state shows
12:19 up realizes that they've built a little
12:22 bit of stuff on their land absolutely
12:24 harmless structures okay they're not
12:26 storing toxic fuel or anything they're
12:28 just building a dwelling and the state
12:31 said you had no right to build that
12:33 house there and now we're gonna charge
12:34 you twenty thirty thousand dollars a day
12:37 until it's all cleaned up and the land
12:39 is restored to the way it was before
12:41 you started building obviously an
12:44 impossibility in most cases so they have
12:47 developed this paradigm of thinking
12:50 called communitarianism and this is the
12:54 division in which they're think-tanks
12:56 dream up new ways of stealing all of our
12:59 rights now if you live in the city sort
13:03 of like I do you be their own or rent a
13:06 house or you're an apartment and you
13:09 don't know this is happening but there's
13:12 been this weird thing that has occurred
13:14 in Huntington Beach where I live where
13:17 these little tiny strip malls are being
13:19 destroyed and they've been there for
13:21 twenty thirty years maybe even more but
13:24 instead of building another endearing
13:26 little shopping center with already
13:29 anchored stores in there because these
13:32 subletters of the people who owned the
13:34 strip mall actually have established
13:36 businesses there are even famous in the
13:38 community and they're literally being
13:39 kicked out but unanimously they are
13:42 building in my opinion some of the
13:44 ugliest structures I've ever
13:46 man put together and call an intentional
13:48 effort but they are building these
13:51 condos with little tiny tiny shopping
13:56 centers in the base and they're not
13:58 strategic resources they're like you
14:01 know ice cream stores and place you get
14:03 your hair cut my haircuts are kind of
14:05 strategic but there's no grocery stores
14:07 or anything that will allow you to fill
14:09 up your house or your condo up above
14:12 with resources but what they have to do
14:14 is put those resources condominiums
14:18 above the structure that's the only kind
14:23 of thing that's being zoned in
14:24 California why because California is a
14:29 region and regions are being pushed as
14:33 hard as they are willing to allow and of
14:35 course again I always tell you guys
14:38 California is definitely 51% red meaning
14:42 conservative to Center I think it's way
14:45 higher than that but the problem is the
14:47 blue the deep state blue has infiltrated
14:50 the state which is why we have more
14:53 feces on the premise of San Francisco
14:58 then you probably have food in people's
15:01 refrigerators Rosa tells the story that
15:03 she's she lives in Sonoma which is sort
15:07 of wine country about a hundred miles
15:09 north of San Francisco and she said
15:12 there's 1300 miles that connects Sonoma
15:15 County residents and businesses together
15:19 but that the Sonoma region said oh you
15:25 know what I don't think we have enough
15:26 money to keep all these roads going and
15:29 so you might believe that first what
15:32 second once you hear the equation of
15:34 their resolution you know it's agenda21
15:39 they voted to pulverize and pick up and
15:44 take away 1,200 of the thirteen hundred
15:47 miles worth of road now when she
15:51 presented that I believe it was 2012 I
15:53 don't know if that ended up being the
15:56 case but that's the ruling back in 2012
15:59 she said look people are going to be on
16:01 dirt roads to get to work to have
16:05 resources brought to their businesses
16:07 you're gonna have to go through a dirt
16:09 road to get to a business all of a
16:11 sudden if you've ever seen your car
16:13 after a dirt road if you're used to
16:16 keeping your car clean in California
16:18 which is what we do here those
16:20 businesses are going out of business
16:22 hence forcing them to move to a compact
16:26 concentration camp called a city so I
16:31 need the beach has had these and they
16:33 all look really strange they look
16:35 bizarre but these these places are being
16:40 torn down these other places are being
16:42 built up now they're not junky the
16:45 apartments aren't bad I mean the
16:46 condominiums aren't bad the business is
16:48 down below aren't bad and if you live
16:49 there I'm sure people aren't upset that
16:53 there's a coffee being downstairs and
16:54 ice cream place downstairs and maybe a
16:57 place you could get your haircut once a
16:58 week that has its value but the overall
17:02 agenda is part of the most unbelievable
17:09 transformation of this planet you will
17:12 ever hear so they have divided up their
17:17 agenda into three main categories of
17:20 thought economy ecology and equity now
17:27 the first two are definitely what you
17:29 think although what they're doing to
17:31 those regions are going to it's going to
17:33 be very surprising to you for those of
17:35 you in Europe you listen up
17:37 this woman explains why Europe is being
17:40 infiltrated by third world countries it
17:46 explains it finally a hundred percent
17:48 with the economy this plan which has
17:52 been done several times in history
17:55 Germany had it in the mid 30s but it was
17:58 serendipitous and Germany to an extent
18:01 there definitely were pressures to make
18:03 them go bankrupt but the first thing
18:06 they do is to instigate poverty to bring
18:12 down wages
18:14 to remove resources to restrict
18:18 everything that you do how much water
18:20 did you use today well you're in trouble
18:21 go to jail Oh have fun feeding your
18:24 family while you're in jail because the
18:26 climate police came around ecology their
18:32 goal is to restrict every single
18:35 resource that we have and you see it all
18:37 over the place was that the third season
18:40 of Goliath talks about the water
18:42 shortages in California and how
18:45 governments are controlling well this
18:48 one little corrupt faction in the
18:49 fictional series but this is what really
18:52 happened in California during the
18:53 drought big corporations were given
18:56 infinite water to make bottled water
18:58 farmers were the second tier and then
19:01 human beings were the last tier
19:04 well profiteering and profiteering first
19:06 human well-being
19:09 for us to be able to water our lawns
19:11 take showers drink water out of our
19:13 faucets if we manage to filter them we
19:17 end up paying all this carbon taxation
19:18 crap while those folks get blank cheques
19:22 of course we want our farmers to farm as
19:24 much as they can but the farmers were
19:27 number two in the priority list but they
19:30 still didn't have enough water to grow
19:32 their normal crops now there are you
19:38 know plants that take a really long time
19:40 to mature for instance olives take a
19:45 really long time I think it's seven
19:46 years for an olive tree to get to its
19:48 prime an avocado tree takes 13 years you
19:51 can start getting avocados off of it in
19:53 a couple years but these things take a
19:55 long time and what if in 13 years the
19:58 state of California orchestrates this
20:01 this water shortage now we do have water
20:06 that surges due to certain seasons El
20:09 Nino seasons we get lots of water and
20:11 then we do have kind of a dry spell but
20:13 we also have reservoirs to help us out
20:15 there's always water under the ground
20:18 but even if you can get to the water if
20:21 the state is sitting there saying no no
20:23 we're gonna give it to Nestle coca-cola
20:27 all these other water companies they get
20:30 first dibs and everything else is a
20:34 super high demand shortage of water they
20:39 literally have professionals who believe
20:41 that we're running out of fresh water in
20:43 the world now part of it's because we
20:46 don't clean the water that we actually
20:48 pump into our homes
20:49 it's and it's been you know about a
20:52 hundred was about 80 years since the
20:55 public water distribution in America was
20:59 finalized in the early 40s where people
21:01 started taking baths every single day
21:03 believe it or not and again when
21:05 sanitization finalized in the early 40s
21:10 the number I was told was 1943 and the
21:13 German lecture at a college a lot of our
21:17 diseases that were floating around went
21:21 away because we cleaned our bodies every
21:23 single day the equity again is us and we
21:29 are to be heavily heavily orchestrated
21:33 the plan is to get us out of the rural
21:35 districts through this either
21:37 eminent domain or that extortion
21:42 technique I told you about or removing
21:43 your roads but they will use whatever
21:46 means necessary now will they come to
21:47 you with guns eventually if you're
21:50 trying to be that farmer holding out and
21:52 it's 50 years from now way before 50
21:55 years they're gonna put guns on the
21:56 ground and if you allow liberals to take
21:59 away your guns you'll have nothing in
22:02 Europe your prime for the takin what I'm
22:05 gonna do fight them off with the shotgun
22:07 and Britain and that's why we have to
22:10 keep our soldiers educated we have to
22:12 keep our police officers educated
22:14 because they swear it off to protect the
22:15 Constitution of the United States and
22:18 when we have people like Hillary Clinton
22:20 going around saying we need to you know
22:22 rip up and throw away this antiquated
22:25 rag from the 1700s or really the 1800s
22:29 there's there's the enemy right there in
22:32 front of your face tear that thing up
22:35 when you got beta oh is it babe a dose
22:38 the other guy running and saying he's
22:40 support gun seizures door-to-door Wow
22:45 the enemy is upon us
22:47 they are absolutely upon us I mean it
22:50 depends if you don't believe in freedom
22:52 an individual thought and the Republic
22:54 and your nail eatable rights well then
22:56 maybe to you this is just part of the
22:58 process but the final goal and their
23:01 plan once they get everyone in these
23:02 concentration camps okay
23:05 super duper overpopulated take the worst
23:08 case of overpopulation in Hong Kong with
23:10 these people living in cages take this
23:12 super duper
23:13 although beautiful Tokyo or people are
23:18 living in cubicles and basically doing
23:20 web work and they never leave their
23:22 cubicle they mean to go in the shower
23:23 and they come back and they sit in their
23:24 cubicle but that's their whole house
23:26 because I got business cubicle they
23:29 sleep on the floors they want to get us
23:32 that tightly packed and then it will
23:35 become the only benefits you get in this
23:38 world will be telling on your neighbor
23:41 that's how you're gonna get a reward if
23:43 you don't tell on your neighbor well
23:46 then you're just gonna live in the
23:47 status quo
23:48 there's your ration here's your food
23:51 shut up I know you're still hungry right
23:52 now you're still thirsty well if you
23:55 work a little bit harder maybe you
23:57 wouldn't be so this and that I know it
24:00 sounds crazy but it's the lightest
24:04 nicest friendliest version of their plan
24:07 that I can give you now she gave an
24:10 example in her presentation to I believe
24:13 New Hampshire I don't know what you
24:16 would call it all their politicians
24:17 their State Building or whatever I was
24:20 very very impressed that they gave her
24:22 time to talk but she said look there's a
24:26 bunch of individuals that welcome your
24:32 back up here there's the Kyoto agreement
24:35 of 1998 which surprisingly we didn't
24:39 sign I mean this deep state was all over
24:42 our country Clinton was president how we
24:45 didn't sign it I don't know but it's the
24:48 first sort of climate change sort of
24:50 thing without actually coining that
24:53 phrase
24:54 but thank God we didn't cite it but they
24:57 want it signed because that's part of
24:59 their it's one of their first volleys
25:01 outside of signing the 1992 agreement
25:04 treaty or whatever this thing is again
25:07 179 countries can you name a hundred
25:10 countries because I can't so what they
25:13 did was they went into every single
25:15 region slash community and got mayors
25:19 and other political officials to agree
25:24 to the Kyoto agreement to agree to a lot
25:27 of other controls which are all agenda21
25:30 based it's so bad that when you look at
25:36 the agenda21 documentation they've got
25:38 the three circles for economy ecology
25:40 and equity which is us right and as they
25:45 intersect in the center there's this
25:47 little region and that's where they
25:48 think everything will be balanced it's a
25:50 standard old graph people have been
25:51 using for years but she started pulling
25:54 up documentation from construction firms
25:57 and other agencies and the first page is
26:01 that diagram a hundred percent its tenth
26:06 amount to saying well the Nazis came
26:08 over here and said hey you should be
26:10 Nazis and we didn't vote for it
26:12 but now a bunch of Mayors have agreed to
26:16 be Nazis and you open up their
26:18 paraphernalia and the first page is a
26:20 big swastika that's exactly what this is
26:24 so when you go to get a permit to build
26:29 your house on that four thousand square
26:31 foot property you might have are you
26:34 talking to an elected official you know
26:40 maybe there's one person here it is
26:41 maybe as a county clerk or whatever
26:43 maybe there's a mayor involved but
26:45 probably not because they're just
26:46 celebratory ribbon cutters at least in
26:48 small cities and so you're usually
26:51 dealing with an appointed agency which
26:55 can take any policy they like now for
26:59 those of you who have never formed your
27:00 own corporation let me tell you how this
27:03 works
27:04 there's some formal steps that happen
27:07 you have to
27:07 pick a name that no one else is using in
27:09 your state or in your in the country and
27:13 I run this big background check to see
27:15 if the name of your company is anywhere
27:17 else you don't collide with somebody
27:18 else who has copyrights and once you
27:21 pass that you pay a little bit of this a
27:23 little bit of that and you have a yearly
27:24 fee in California and then you have your
27:27 corporation you have some shares
27:29 how many shares we can have one share
27:31 you could have a billion shares it's up
27:32 to you but there's something called the
27:35 bylaws the bylaws are rules that you
27:40 make up about how to run your
27:42 corporation it could be how many
27:44 vacation days you have it could be what
27:48 shirts you have to wear I mean you could
27:49 make anything up that you want as long
27:51 as it doesn't break law it can be in
27:54 your bylaws so what these agencies are
27:58 doing that are not elected is they adopt
28:04 this agenda 21 plan which is extremely
28:07 thought-out a nurse as far as I've been
28:10 able to figure out by the time they sign
28:13 this thing in 1992 the amount of
28:16 think-tank work that went into creating
28:17 it in the first place and especially the
28:19 amount of that's happened since then
28:21 with the invention of the Internet at
28:23 least HTTP protocol Internet is vast and
28:26 amazing so it's all ready to go it
28:30 controls our education to this day it
28:32 controls unions it controls corporations
28:36 to this day the bad ones how many of you
28:40 can't believe I mean you can't believe
28:43 the amount of censorship that's going on
28:46 in social media where the left can say
28:49 whatever they want they can they can
28:53 suggest a felony assassination of a
28:55 president in their own country that's
28:58 cool you can do that but you so much as
29:00 insult the left with facts or even just
29:03 present facts you can have your account
29:06 suspended for a week a month in England
29:10 you'll actually have cops come to your
29:11 door and lecture you about you know
29:14 starting you know some sort of
29:16 resistance the police officers because I
29:20 guess in
29:21 I mean correct me if I'm wrong in
29:23 England do the police officers not swear
29:26 to some official document that protects
29:29 the citizens like we do here in America
29:31 right our guys and gals die for the
29:36 Constitution so I don't know how you
29:39 would swear to a document Magna Carta or
29:42 whatever and then go door to door and
29:44 violate everyone's you know god-given
29:47 rights they act like the Secret Service
29:50 over there which we have over here if
29:52 you start saying felony level statements
29:55 online like hurting politician or
29:59 especially the commander in chief the
30:02 president so the other thing they want
30:05 to get rid of is nation-states right
30:08 you're not to be German anymore I'm
30:10 supposed to go over there for
30:11 Oktoberfest but I can celebrate it
30:13 anywhere because everyone's doing
30:14 Oktoberfest but it's not really
30:15 Oktoberfest because the you know multi
30:19 millennium group of people that made
30:22 Germany no longer exists they're all
30:24 deluded I can't go to France and get it
30:27 in a crepe that's made out of someone's
30:31 recipe there's 400 years old because
30:33 they've been wiped off the map convinced
30:36 not to populate and this will happen to
30:40 everybody it will happen to every single
30:43 culture out there but the one reason why
30:45 they want no government boundaries no
30:48 regional boundaries and no community
30:49 boundaries is that they want to have one
30:52 world government one group that is not
30:57 elected it's appointed it's all agenda21
31:01 compliant and they can just pass one
31:04 little ordinance one little law and it
31:07 crosses the entire world I could you
31:11 imagine that imagine all the customs and
31:13 cultures that we have that are
31:14 completely different
31:15 what if they picked a Sharia law one day
31:19 and then picked I don't know something
31:21 from the Constitution the next day I
31:22 mean they wouldn't touch anything in the
31:23 Constitution because it's anti globalism
31:26 it's anti one-world government that's
31:28 why it was created in the first place so
31:30 why Magna Carta was created in like 1000
31:33 AD
31:34 and you ladies out there I know there's
31:36 only about 4% of the women watch this
31:39 show but you're fairly powerful and
31:41 super intelligent women as I have bumped
31:43 into boy oh boy you got a hope and pray
31:49 that Sharia law gets systematically
31:54 removed from Europe and that it never
31:58 reaches America I mean here we are
32:00 teaching all of our young girls to be
32:01 powerful females write everything on
32:04 Hollywood everything on TV is Girl Power
32:06 Girl Power you can do it you could do it
32:08 it's a depopulation algorithm just so
32:11 that you know but you know after you
32:13 have your kids you can do all those
32:14 things as well no big deal women have
32:17 been doing it forever but now imagine a
32:20 Sharia law chapter introduces itself
32:23 into this agenda21 because who the hell
32:25 knows they are importing Arabs into
32:28 Europe and not sophisticated super
32:32 scientists they're giving you
32:33 military-grade refugees males they could
32:38 they'd have years of fighting you know
32:40 half these kids have already shot you
32:42 know probably ten thousand rounds to an
32:44 ak-47 they've probably shot two dozen
32:46 you know RPGs they know how to fight and
32:49 they're not to be underestimated right
32:53 but you can't be gay that's for one
32:57 thing I mean you can just kill a gay
32:58 person no big deal you rid the world of
33:00 a of a virus if your Sharia law if
33:05 you're a woman yeah the guy can kill you
33:08 if he's tired of being married to you he
33:11 can beat you and if you want to go to
33:13 court and say ah he beat me and he
33:15 shouldn't beat me well your opinions
33:17 only half of a man's opinion so you
33:19 better have a witness and if he's a
33:21 beater he's not gonna allow there to be
33:23 more than one person in the room and
33:24 that's gonna be you I don't mean to
33:26 freak you out but I mean that's just the
33:28 truth they now have Sharia law courts as
33:31 I'm told in England they're allowing
33:33 them to try themselves with the Sharia
33:35 laws what if the guy down the street
33:37 likes your daughter and you're not Arab
33:39 but he wants to marry her and either he
33:42 just takes her and the state doesn't
33:44 defend you because that's his way or he
33:47 convinces your kid
33:48 to do it and your kid walks into court
33:50 goes yeah I want to be with this guy oh
33:53 boy you know there's no age limits
33:55 there's no age limits men should just
33:59 remember if you believe in voting and
34:01 it's in its absolute principle form
34:03 forget about the fact that Diebold you
34:07 know voting company is a completely you
34:10 know deep state organization George
34:11 Soros owns I think the majority of the
34:13 company he owns the biggest share you
34:16 know they're gonna cut voters out that's
34:19 their goal and they're already doing it
34:21 some of you might remember that Obama
34:24 before he left
34:25 sign this agreement that handed over the
34:28 vaccine regimen to the World Health
34:30 Organization meaning European sellouts
34:35 and maybe it's not you if you're over
34:37 there but sellouts over there can now
34:39 tell Americans you have to have 60
34:41 mandatory vaccinations in your lifetime
34:44 can you imagine you have to get mercury
34:48 and aluminum in your brain and then
34:52 you're gonna be they're gonna blame it
34:53 on Alzheimer's they're gonna say you
34:54 have a genetic defect in your in your
34:56 family line right now when they gain
35:01 total control if we allow them okay then
35:06 you won't be able to move around like
35:08 you do now you want to go to the town
35:10 next door where you're gonna have to
35:11 apply you're gonna have to have a damn
35:13 good reason to go over there and
35:16 probably visitation with your family is
35:18 super low on the list you're probably
35:21 going to be delivering resources for a
35:24 corporation you're gonna be a trucker
35:26 but they're very there are very explicit
35:29 areas of their documentation that talk
35:31 about controlling all movement of
35:34 everything from resources to human
35:37 beings and the funny thing is my entire
35:40 life they keep giving us this example of
35:43 the Nazis asking for our papers well let
35:46 me see your papers I'll do it for
35:48 Russians too let me see your papers that
35:50 movie attraction the Russian kind of
35:54 rebranding of The Day the Earth Stood
35:56 Still which is fairly entertaining
35:59 there's a point in the middle of the
36:01 film when a guy's asked for
36:02 papers and he doesn't have any and so
36:04 they take them away and book him out of
36:07 police station now the other thing
36:10 that's interesting about the
36:11 individuality element of it is that most
36:15 of us quote-unquote first worlders we
36:18 will see foreign countries dictate jobs
36:22 to their employees our sorry their their
36:25 conscripts right they're citizens which
36:29 will be equity under this program I saw
36:33 a special once where China is getting
36:36 into wine manufacturing they think
36:39 they're going to eclipse two thousand
36:40 years of European winemaking simply
36:42 because they buy the machines I think
36:44 it's absolutely hilarious unbelievable
36:46 but the people working the fields are
36:49 this Muslim group of Chinese folks which
36:54 don't believe in drinking alcohol at all
36:56 so here they are making this wine that
36:59 they're not technically allowed to drink
37:01 but they interview one of the women and
37:04 her you know her teeth looked absolutely
37:06 atrocious at least they weren't knocked
37:08 out completely but the poor woman you
37:12 could tell she's just the biggest
37:13 sweetheart
37:14 a very simple person which is all you
37:16 never need to be in this world and she
37:18 said you know it's really hard she goes
37:21 when I get home at night my back's
37:22 really hurting bad but she goes then by
37:26 the next day I feel better she says I'm
37:27 glad I have a job she says but if I
37:29 could do anything else I'd probably quit
37:32 well there you go
37:33 and we're rewarding these people with
37:36 trade of any kind all right LeBron James
37:42 now in America nobody knows about
37:46 agenda21 at all in Europe they formerly
37:51 had a gathering after the --use birth
37:53 and they got the Euro under control in
37:56 2004 they actually brought the whole
37:58 leadership together and continued
38:01 talking about how they're going to go
38:03 for this new program and again it's
38:05 always sold as one thing and it turns
38:07 into another thing any of you who've
38:11 ever had to go through a government
38:12 agency to get anything done
38:15 you know what it's like getting a
38:18 driver's license getting you know when
38:20 they have this Obamacare we had to go
38:22 through oh my god they lied to you and
38:25 told you in America that you could keep
38:28 your doctor
38:28 I think Obama's on camera saying it you
38:32 know a dozen times if not two dozen
38:34 times you can keep your doctor and keep
38:36 your doctor first first casualty of the
38:41 Obama care plan was you couldn't keep
38:44 your doctor your rates skyrocketed I
38:47 have my friend who lives in Texas
38:50 healthy family just her her husband and
38:53 her kid in Texas had her raise quadruple
38:57 twice and they're paying damn near $1500
39:01 a month for their health care never
39:04 needing to go to the doctor for anything
39:06 but that's how it goes if you if you can
39:11 believe a deep state employee then you
39:14 can believe anything and it's important
39:18 to wake up right so you know I wondered
39:22 and all my buddies at the smoke lounge
39:24 in my circle we couldn't figure out why
39:27 George Soros was paying billions to push
39:32 all of these supposedly Syrian
39:34 immigrants into Europe and you know you
39:38 have to remember he is paying for
39:40 everything he's showing them what boats
39:42 to take what coasts to get off on what
39:45 chain-link fence to go through they're
39:47 given big chunks of cash to get to the
39:49 next stage he paid for the whole
39:51 infiltration it's still happening all
39:53 over Europe you know Italy will close
39:56 this borders and then Spain gets a big
39:58 bunch of them because Spain won't nut up
40:00 and stop them and then if Spain nuts up
40:02 then they'll just they'll just keep
40:03 going up the coast right but until I
40:08 rearview agenda21 s poverty goal I
40:11 couldn't figure it out and this is it
40:15 this is it you've heard probably that
40:19 George Soros has been trying to get a
40:21 civil war in the United States for the
40:24 last jeez I'd say five to ten years
40:28 he's the one paying for all of these
40:30 groups that are like black lives matters
40:32 and antifa and all these groups now
40:35 again all life's matter no one's
40:38 disagreeing that if there happens to be
40:40 a pocket of police police brutality
40:42 somewhere in the world that needs to be
40:44 addressed no one's making anything
40:46 different but when you really look at
40:48 the statistics black on black crime is
40:51 responsible for the majority of all the
40:54 deaths not cops especially white cops
40:57 should there be any cop ever killing a
41:01 citizen without just cause without do
41:05 you know without some sort of formality
41:08 of course not but of course your left
41:10 will say that if you're Capote Lee aware
41:13 of the facts you're you know you're
41:17 completely against everything right if I
41:19 say that climate change is fake which it
41:23 is then they'll brand me as a person
41:26 who's Pro Oil Pro coal Pro natural gas
41:29 Pro there's that another thing again go
41:32 watch my episode on energy it'll be a
41:33 very sobering experience if anyone
41:35 believes that kind of thing we didn't
41:37 choose coal we didn't show his oil we
41:39 didn't choose a nuclear power we didn't
41:41 choose any of that stuff Tesla was
41:43 building a tower from 1917 to 1927 it
41:46 was gonna broadcast energy to everyone's
41:48 house for free and the mechanism that
41:50 was creating the energy was free he got
41:53 paid for the tower but come on easy but
41:57 they had to rip down once JP Morgan who
42:00 was a nothing but a Rothschild proxy
42:03 which is why when he died he only was
42:04 worth two and a half million dollars he
42:08 made sure the energy state of commodity
42:10 something you have to buy in units
42:13 because now they can control your units
42:16 and with this absolute delusional lack
42:20 of science if they can get you to
42:23 believe through repetition that climate
42:24 change is real and that carbon in the
42:27 atmosphere especially provided by man is
42:30 real then they've got someone who
42:33 believes in Santa Claus all day long
42:35 telling people how to live their lives
42:37 but why push a bunch of militant aged
42:40 male Arabs
42:42 from a really war-torn area into a super
42:45 sophisticated ornate Europe because when
42:50 poverty gets to the level that has made
42:54 the Paris writers come out and do their
42:57 thing right they're gonna have a force
42:59 that they just promise something to get
43:03 all these little terrorist cells and
43:04 promise them well
43:06 Sharia law is gonna be the way it is as
43:08 long as you rise up and by the way
43:09 here's a big pile of guns we got for you
43:11 then we had a meeting Korea and Pelosi
43:13 took a little bit of money you can just
43:16 indiscriminately do what you want and
43:18 we've told all the cops to back off and
43:20 because the cops for some reason there's
43:22 trying to they're starting to push back
43:23 now finally and the Paris cops aren't
43:25 helping with the riots that much but if
43:29 the police are indoctrinated enough to
43:32 go to someone's house and harass them
43:34 about a post they put on Facebook what
43:36 it doesn't incite any and violence
43:38 whatsoever but just simply disagrees
43:40 with the state uh-huh be able to stand
43:43 back and watch I don't get out there and
43:45 get shot what do you have that job for
43:48 men now how does surveillance work if
43:52 you wanted to put surveillance into
43:55 watch let's say a hundred farmers in
43:57 Kansas who are living in the boonies
44:00 that'd be really tough wouldn't it you
44:03 have to have like some telescope thing
44:05 and and it'd probably be on someone's
44:07 property it's very difficult to do in
44:09 the rural area but in the city no
44:13 problem it's all over the streetlights
44:15 well you you own all the buildings and
44:17 so you just put them all over the
44:18 buildings so surveillance is going to
44:21 get a gigantic upgrade as soon as
44:24 agenda21 is doing what they're doing now
44:28 I think by by 2008 London had over six
44:33 million cameras downtown and some of you
44:36 might go hey it's great I can jog at
44:38 night and if I do get murdered my family
44:40 can find out who did it okay
44:44 but it's really being incubated over in
44:46 China by the way you know the deep state
44:50 politicians in America and you will find
44:55 this out later
44:56 if you're not a follower of this sort of
44:58 information they have been taking
45:02 secrets and IP intellectual property
45:05 inventions over to China and saying
45:07 here's how it works here's how it works
45:09 you have a problem with that
45:10 f-35 copy you know Biden goes over there
45:13 and gives it to them and all sudden ping
45:14 the problem disappears and now they have
45:17 literally stolen our best fighter plane
45:21 that we have fighter jet that we have
45:24 but they're being given all that stuff
45:26 so that they push it on their own people
45:28 social credit system right they've
45:31 already got turn that on they want to
45:33 incubate it over there get it to be a
45:35 turnkey system such that when agenda21
45:38 reaches its apex it's just like going
45:42 down to the store and buying a router
45:43 for your for your own your home easy
45:47 throw a couple holes right there put the
45:49 camera right there run the wire over
45:51 there boom you're done so what do we do
45:55 because it's really pretty much that's
45:57 that simple we're gonna get to the next
45:58 level of depopulation in a second but I
46:00 want to finish up a plan before we go on
46:04 to the details some of the other details
46:07 one you can expose every single
46:11 collaborator and I would say just go
46:13 watch roses videos and she exposes a ton
46:18 of them and she gives you the formula to
46:20 figure out how your local politicians
46:22 may or may not be in this if you own
46:25 land and you're being extorted if you
46:28 have land and for no apparent logical
46:30 reason you can't get permits to do what
46:32 you want to do like build a house on
46:34 your own land
46:34 then you've identified an agency and
46:38 probably would roll it up to her
46:40 organization I forget the name of it but
46:42 I'll put the link down below and they
46:46 can factor it into class-action lawsuits
46:48 individual lawsuits we need to find out
46:51 who these folks are the other one is we
46:54 probably still have at this very early
46:56 stage in America at least the ability to
46:59 identify props or other financial plans
47:04 that the people have to vote on because
47:05 it's tax dollars paying for it and we
47:07 can vote against those props
47:09 and essentially prevent them from
47:11 starting various programs or in an
47:15 extreme case actually defund one that's
47:18 already in existence so it's important
47:21 that we educate ourselves we educate our
47:23 neighbors and it's actually important we
47:26 educate our kids you may find in some
47:30 cases your children know a lot more
47:31 about this than you do depending on old
47:34 they are you're the parent you know what
47:37 age they're gonna be able to get into
47:40 this information my advice would be if
47:42 you have a fairly smart kid on your
47:43 hands just you know ask them a few
47:46 simple questions about the world and see
47:49 how where they are if your kids coming
47:51 home saying yeah we had to watch we had
47:55 to watch you know Inconvenient Truth
47:58 that morning and this transvestite came
48:01 and spoke to the fourth graders then you
48:03 you have an organization you need to pay
48:05 attention to our goal is true freedom
48:09 right your sovereign rights as an
48:11 individual think about the fact that
48:14 every single massive discovery in world
48:18 history is a single individual having
48:21 the freedom to think one in most cases
48:25 they had the freedom to build up
48:26 individual wealth such that they had the
48:29 freedom to Imagineer something get it
48:33 together
48:33 Tesla is a great example he comes over
48:36 here on a boat he ends up fixing I think
48:41 a DC motor on his way over to Edison's
48:43 place made a chunk of change there work
48:46 for Edison built up his money and at
48:48 home he was perfecting his alternating
48:50 current motor which is what I'm using to
48:52 make this show now to put in perspective
48:55 for the elected and non-elected
48:59 individuals I think one of the numbers
49:02 she put forth was that only 4% of our
49:06 representation is elected and 96 percent
49:11 is appointed that's an average number in
49:14 any country so perhaps what we do is we
49:18 start to increase the amount of
49:20 individuals that we elect
49:22 and you know one of her closing phrases
49:26 which we have definitely heard ourselves
49:29 and we know it to be true but it's
49:30 important to to re state this every once
49:33 in a while which is that the war on
49:35 terror is a war on us as individuals you
49:39 know we was just having a good
49:42 conversation with a close friend of mine
49:44 when we're talking about the TSA
49:46 and I don't know how much thought she's
49:49 put into it but overall she she is sort
49:53 of more mainstream and her thinking
49:55 about the TSA and you know we really
49:56 need the TSA and all that kind of stuff
49:58 and so you know I told her I said look
50:01 Hawaii doesn't have TSA or if they do
50:04 they don't have the scanners you can
50:05 walk through a door Jim we have all
50:08 these crazy events like the Olympics and
50:10 Super Bowls and all these other
50:12 championship games were you know 20,000
50:15 80,000 people are put into a container
50:18 called an arena and we just used the
50:22 door jambs
50:23 and they worked great what's the
50:25 difference between a door jamb and a
50:27 body scanner and someone groping you
50:28 well the door jamb just goes oh this
50:31 person has something that's too big and
50:32 illegal on them and now we need to Pat
50:36 them down great how many nightclubs have
50:38 you gone into and you get you walk right
50:41 through with no problem you know right
50:44 now it's so crazy that you know if I
50:46 have my hair up in a bun in the back or
50:48 just tie it up I don't do the bun thing
50:50 and they got to check my hair because it
50:52 can't see inside my [ __ ] hair are you
50:55 kidding me I have certain genes that I
50:59 wear that have too many pocket layers
51:01 and so it goes off on my pocket and they
51:05 tell me not to wear that those clothes
51:07 or why am i wearing those clothes to the
51:10 airport if I always know they go off and
51:11 it's because I'm a free [ __ ] person
51:14 man somebody recently said I don't know
51:18 who said this maybe you guys remember
51:19 but they said that when they go through
51:21 the TSA they always get the pat-down and
51:25 you know TSA people are just normal
51:26 people they're nice folks they just are
51:29 a little unwell as it might be some of
51:32 them anyway
51:34 sometimes you gotta get a job we should
51:37 give them opportunities to do something
51:39 else with better education right but
51:42 this person they said that when they're
51:43 getting patted down they say this phrase
51:45 every single time which i think is
51:47 brilliant it's a little sassy but
51:50 whatever they say what won't you do for
51:53 money how brilliant is that what won't
51:55 you do for money meaning you're you're
51:57 violating the Constitution of the United
51:59 States because someone's willing to pay
52:02 you for it
52:03 that's what mercenaries are right
52:05 mercenaries are loyal to no one but
52:07 number one and it's cash in the bank
52:10 that they're really loyal to you kill
52:13 for somebody else Blackwater was a
52:15 mercenary group for the United States
52:17 military able to do things we're not
52:19 allowed to do because they're not really
52:20 technically soldiers the Vatican used
52:23 mercenaries to punish everybody who
52:25 didn't believe in Jesus because they
52:27 were there and they were like I didn't
52:28 see this guy anyway let's go over to the
52:31 Georgia Guidestones
52:33 Georgia Guidestones are in Elbert
52:35 Georgia County Elbert County Georgia
52:39 somebody had him built in 1981 which
52:44 makes some old as hell almost 40 years
52:46 old people have spray-painted them I
52:49 think Dynamat dynamited them tried to
52:52 tear them down but they're gigantic
52:54 stones I think a guy even pulled his
52:56 axle off trying to hurt one of these
52:58 things once and somebody from that
53:00 county pays for it the repairs every
53:04 single time but they are for big stones
53:08 look like Stonehenge kinda but they're
53:10 perfectly straight and then the county
53:13 is actually known for quarrying
53:15 tombstones so they have that type of
53:18 rock there in plenty so they're made out
53:20 of tombstone which is so ironic oh my
53:22 god but there's ten commandments on each
53:25 side written in different languages so
53:27 in four sides are able to give you eight
53:29 different languages and then I guess
53:31 around the grounds they have little
53:34 plaques for other languages it's
53:36 supposed to be over 20 and you might
53:38 agree theoretically with two through ten
53:42 but number one is a [ __ ] man
53:45 number one's a [ __ ] because it doesn't
53:49 it's not talking about you and that's
53:51 what you need to understand that's what
53:54 you need to understand if somebody came
53:56 to your door of your house right now and
53:58 tried to kill you
53:59 what are you gonna do are you just gonna
54:02 lay down because you're vegetarian
54:03 you're gonna get your guns have a little
54:06 battle what are you gonna do
54:09 number one is maintain rural population
54:14 at five hundred million and perpetual
54:19 balance with nature something extremely
54:21 close to that if it's not word for word
54:24 now thanks to one of the listeners I got
54:26 my percentages a little better off but a
54:28 500 million yes towards 7.5 billion
54:31 you're over 96% of the world population
54:35 erased gone forever but now if you built
54:41 a restaurant let's simplify the math
54:43 let's just say 500 I'm talking about
54:45 Millions let's just say you built a big
54:48 restaurant you can have 500 people in
54:49 there well do you really want 500 every
54:53 single day do you want 500 on the first
54:55 day before you really have your staff
54:57 trained the point-of-sale machine
54:59 understood just even know how to crowd
55:02 control that kind of thing probably not
55:06 because if you have to maintain it then
55:08 you're gonna have to kill the next
55:10 person that goes over that line so
55:11 you're not gonna fill it up the hole on
55:13 the first batch but let's say they want
55:17 a lot of wiggle room for the next
55:18 several hundred years I'm only a bet
55:21 it's going to be somewhere around 150
55:22 million it's just my total guesstimation
55:25 I think it's a reasonable number that's
55:30 ninety ninety nine percent reduction the
55:34 thing is is those things exist and
55:36 they're another anomaly that people
55:38 don't know about crazy how people don't
55:42 know about that I mean it isn't it isn't
55:45 but in 2005 I wouldn't blame anybody for
55:49 not knowing about Bohemian Grove and all
55:52 the history that we know today
55:53 but in 2019 almost 2020 not knowing
55:58 about these things is
55:59 starting to get really dangerous because
56:03 they have plans and their plans are in
56:04 full effect there's no more waiting
56:07 anymore that's the other thing I was
56:10 almost gonna make this episode called
56:11 the game is on I might still make that
56:14 episode but this is it I mean they have
56:18 infiltrated the all of the politicians
56:21 of the United States of America maybe
56:23 save this new batch we're hoping right
56:26 we're seeing anti agenda21 stuff happen
56:30 and believe me every time president can
56:33 champion and successfully install
56:36 something that's anti agenda21 it's they
56:41 know it's gonna take decades to get that
56:43 stuff ripped out you don't just get a
56:45 new president they say take down that
56:47 wall I got a new president and we're
56:50 gonna demonize coal again and demonize
56:51 oil again we're going to shut down all
56:53 those factories again because the
56:54 population is gonna feel it hardcore and
56:58 that's the beautiful thing about what's
56:59 going on is that we're starting to learn
57:01 right from wrong again now luckily we're
57:05 still in that phase where we could
57:06 continue the bloodless revolution
57:09 we just need to educate each other which
57:14 is why you know probably this season I'm
57:17 gonna make more of these episodes that I
57:19 want to make because it's SuperDuper
57:21 important but who runs the world in 20
57:24 years you know what is it Tulsi Gabbard
57:29 she's the sort of centralist left
57:32 candidate who Hillary saying is a
57:34 Russian agent which i think is hilarious
57:36 just the self cannibalization of that
57:38 group is so funny and watch it all day
57:42 but she's I think 35 36 years old okay
57:48 twenty years ago twenty grit she was a
57:51 teenager twenty years ago that's how
57:53 fast and we can build amazing human
57:56 beings to do good and I don't know
58:00 you know she's got some things I support
58:02 and things I don't support but I'm not
58:04 voting for her but just giving you an
58:06 example because a lot of other folks are
58:08 SuperDuper old and 20 years ago they
58:10 were just evil so you got a teenager in
58:14 when you gonna how long is it gonna take
58:17 before you start talking about some of
58:18 these things right school districts have
58:21 gotten absolutely bananas right I think
58:25 it was Candace Owens that just recently
58:27 interviewed a gentleman who was a
58:30 transvestite for 12 for 10 years and
58:33 this was his decision to not continue
58:36 being that and again as far as I'm
58:38 concerned you can be whatever you want
58:39 just you know there are certain things
58:42 that are appropriate for you know our
58:45 kids and certain things that they just
58:46 need to be allowed to figure out but
58:48 this guy is now on a journey sort of
58:52 well when he saw some some pretty hectic
58:55 things happened in his own community one
58:57 of the big statistics he's very
58:59 concerned about and I think legitimately
59:00 so is that the suicide rate of
59:03 transvestites is 19 times higher than
59:06 normal
59:08 gender acceptance people biologically
59:11 gender acceptance people and again your
59:14 other than the the T on the end your LGB
59:18 they're totally acknowledging what they
59:21 are and they like what they are and they
59:22 like it so much they stick in their own
59:24 team there you go
59:25 same thing but he talked about these
59:28 drag queens reading these books to these
59:31 kids and he said you know this shouldn't
59:34 be done it's nothing against anyone it's
59:37 just you should be allowed to figure it
59:39 out by yourself now I've got close
59:43 friends of mine from high school who
59:45 have gone I think mmm if not completely
59:49 they're going to be complete here within
59:51 the year of their full reassignment
59:53 surgeries these are good friends of mine
59:55 they were good people I've had friends
59:59 in the video game industry who were
60:00 transvestites and the event ended up
60:03 changing their gender so again this
60:05 isn't some slam against individuals who
60:09 want to go their own way but you know at
60:12 a fact I've got you know plenty of
60:16 friends in Hollywood who are gay and
60:18 when I asked them you know kind of what
60:19 they think about the movement they most
60:22 of them I mean one of them one of one of
60:25 the couples I know
60:26 staunch Republicans you know 9/11 is an
60:29 inside job these people are completely
60:31 awake and every every era has its own
60:35 errand I don't mean to turn this into
60:36 some pick on you know some orientation
60:39 conversation at all but a lot of folks
60:43 and while it was spread it around a
60:44 little bit too because I've got black
60:45 friends of mine that are embarrassed
60:47 about the the black lives matter things
60:50 and of course your normal well I would
60:53 say I shouldn't say normal but whatever
60:56 you're biologically accepting humans
61:00 we've been embarrassed for years
61:02 hundreds of years with the wars that we
61:05 fight and the religious battles we go
61:07 against oh no one's immune from this
61:09 kind of stuff
61:09 and we're trying to stop that and in
61:12 most the cases we have stopped a lot of
61:13 that bigotry you know I was trying to
61:16 figure out a way to calculate in my own
61:18 mind of all the media that we ingest the
61:22 entertainment that we ingest the
61:25 political correctness that we allow to
61:27 grow which is anti free speech there
61:30 ever was one the agenda of depopulation
61:36 is the most massive agenda that's going
61:39 on right now
61:39 and they are winning but there are a few
61:43 areas of the world a few countries in
61:45 this world that aren't buying it they're
61:49 multiplying like crazy and there's a lot
61:52 of people that are waking up to that but
61:54 if you have children you've got to start
61:57 the game early you know when I first
61:59 heard about home schooling when I was
62:01 probably in my 20s they didn't have a
62:04 lot of materials to home-school I think
62:06 as well as they do today today it's
62:08 pretty amazing a lot of private
62:09 companies have created educational
62:12 systems for the home that just stomp out
62:15 public education but they've co-opted
62:18 our educational institutions all the way
62:20 up through college any level of college
62:24 to have these professors that make kids
62:27 agree to agendas and agreed to belief
62:30 systems before they can pass the class
62:32 you know an example would be if a kid II
62:36 was gay or a rainbow shirt
62:39 to school every single day well one most
62:43 people who are well balanced human
62:45 beings would just go hey good for you
62:47 man but if one kid or a Maggie hat to
62:50 that same school they face expulsion
62:53 well what does the maggot hat really say
62:55 no is it what does it really say they
62:58 like the president the United States and
62:59 they like his his ad campaign from 2016
63:02 and these guys can't have it and whether
63:08 these professors know it or not their
63:10 agenda 21 s in my school there was a
63:14 teacher named mr. Lawrence who also was
63:17 very active in this church down the
63:19 street which was really hippie Balan was
63:21 interesting he was a full-blown
63:24 communist in my school and would profess
63:27 communism as the supreme way to run the
63:30 country and this was in the eighties man
63:32 before the fall of the USSR but he
63:36 thought communism was great but guess
63:39 what he's in America and he can say that
63:41 because he's got freedom of speech and I
63:44 remember one day his kid came into
63:45 school and wrote the propaganda on the
63:49 blackboard of a different class I think
63:53 though I just remember him writing
63:54 communism on the on the board and I was
63:56 thinking while you're writing that like
63:59 what else you gonna write I think that's
64:01 all he did
64:01 he wrote it on the board and sat down
64:03 and he loved his father and so of course
64:06 his father brainwashed him Christ even
64:09 the Russians don't like communism give
64:11 me a break agenda 21 was real
64:15 it is now college into 2030 same thing
64:20 they want almost 80% of the United
64:25 States of America to be completely
64:28 uninhabited that's their numbers now if
64:32 you go up there to the internets and you
64:34 look up agenda 21 map you'll probably
64:39 get America even if you're in Europe but
64:41 if you need to put put America on there
64:43 and someone has taken all this outside
64:47 ancillary documentation that you don't
64:49 have access to on their website and they
64:52 filtered out everything
64:53 County that's supposed to be zoned for
64:55 non-human habitation and it's more than
65:01 80-percent there's a tiny I think it's
65:03 the last map I saw there's usually two
65:05 colors that are the human zones the most
65:08 popular one I've seen it's the black
65:09 areas which are where the humans are
65:11 living but I showed it to a friend of
65:12 mine last week and it was green so just
65:16 look up the little legend because
65:18 there'll be just one little color that's
65:20 allowed to be human and it's the
65:23 smallest one on the map now let me just
65:26 appeal to those of you who love nature
65:30 imagine you're old enough to be living
65:34 another 50 to 60 years and you love
65:37 nature you love going on hikes you love
65:39 living in the country you'll be removed
65:43 I know it sounds crazy I know it sounds
65:46 nuts but you will be removed never
65:50 allowed to go back out the country I'm
65:52 from that land you know even my family
65:56 in Germany lived in areas that look like
65:59 Kansas with rolling hills you know
66:03 imagine your whole heritage of your
66:05 whole family is just erased and you have
66:08 to live on concrete jungles with cameras
66:10 watching you and boy if you do anything
66:13 weird
66:13 someone's gonna report you because
66:15 they're gonna get a prize for it and
66:18 anybody remembers documentation from the
66:20 Inquisition or the very very real era of
66:27 the Nazis and you can you can argue
66:28 about other factors of what they may or
66:30 may not have done but the one thing they
66:32 did do was round people up little
66:35 patches on their clothing tattoos on
66:37 their arms and ship them off on trains
66:39 so how could they possibly exterminate
66:42 that many people without having an
66:45 absolute uprising well I don't know
66:49 there's a few things the the most
66:52 drastic forms of that sort of plan would
66:55 be to release a virus and then of course
66:59 you only pass out antidote anecdotes or
67:02 anecdotes jokes probably solve the
67:04 problem but antidotes too
67:07 whew and everyone else just has to hope
67:10 they don't catch it help their immune
67:12 systems really really strong and you're
67:15 gonna lose all the children in the world
67:16 and you're gonna lose all the old people
67:17 in the world really fast because they
67:19 won't have the immune systems to fight
67:20 it and whether or not they go that
67:22 extreme I don't know we have the 5g
67:26 Network that's being deployed all over
67:28 the world because we have to have the
67:30 Internet of Things why do you have to
67:33 have the Internet of Things because the
67:34 corporation is telling you you do a
67:35 marketing department that works for the
67:37 corporations telling you that you do now
67:41 maybe in its natural form 5g won't hurt
67:43 us but maybe you just put a little more
67:46 power through those transmitters and it
67:49 becomes lethal who knows you know the
67:53 two most deadly things in the world one
67:55 is a weapon and one is a natural thing
67:57 that could be created I've told you guys
68:00 about this before the weapon is called a
68:03 binary weapon it's two chemicals that
68:07 are considered an A and a B you can eat
68:10 a all by itself and you'll be fine had
68:13 you not eaten a you could eat B and be
68:16 completely fine the second did B mixes
68:19 with a inside the human body you
68:21 dissolve and you die and it ain't pretty
68:26 and pain none of you have experienced
68:31 that kind of pain in your life we can
68:33 only hope it would go very quickly you
68:36 can only hope it attacks the nervous
68:38 system so we literally just close our
68:40 eyes and it's over well we know that
68:43 we've accepted planes that spray [ __ ] in
68:46 the air there are little kids now that
68:49 believe that clouds come exclusively out
68:51 of the back of planes not when I was a
68:54 kid so by accepting that by making sure
69:00 that our water departments are protected
69:02 like Fort Knox which in one case you can
69:05 you can rationalize that but they also
69:07 allow them to put fluoride in our water
69:08 a lot of places on earth
69:11 well you just replace it with the a and
69:13 then the next day it's the B take that
69:16 shower and boy you're gonna be clean
69:19 but the other one you've actually heard
69:22 of before and it's called a protein
69:24 virus and it's what mad cow disease was
69:27 a protein virus is more deadly than
69:32 anything that man I think has ever
69:35 discovered I don't know how easy it is
69:37 to distribute essentially all you have
69:39 to do is eat it and it will constitute
69:42 in your body and eventually wipe you out
69:45 mad cow was horrible because it attacked
69:48 the brain it ate up tissue in the brain
69:50 creating pockets in your brain like
69:51 Swiss cheese and you know made
69:54 Alzheimer's look like an IQ booster what
69:59 a protein virus is so volatile that if
70:03 it even were to be released on accident
70:06 it's worse than nuclear radiation
70:09 it makes Fukushima look like a summer
70:12 spa because you can take a protein virus
70:15 and burn it with the hottest fuel we
70:18 have on earth it turns to carbon ash and
70:23 then you can ingest that carbon - and
70:26 the protein will find its partners and
70:29 rebuild itself in the human body you
70:32 know I'm not a big fear monger on this
70:34 show a lot of people make money by
70:37 making you afraid of everything
70:38 constantly I'm telling you these things
70:41 which a little bit outrageous if not
70:43 entirely outrageous for one reason if
70:46 you ever thought they couldn't do it
70:47 you're kidding yourself you are kidding
70:51 yourself they already know how to
70:54 sterilize this 25 ways to Sunday right
70:56 GMOs sterilized you slowly over time you
71:00 know you know that I had someone
71:02 explained to me they said that the gene
71:06 termination sequence which is in all GMO
71:08 foods gets into the human host and
71:10 immediately causes disruptions with
71:12 those people that are eating it but if
71:15 they have a child completely crafted out
71:18 of GMOs then they have an literally a
71:21 congenital birth problem in procreating
71:25 if they feed their children it's over
71:29 their children will be completely
71:31 sterile
71:32 and that's it so how long does it take
71:35 to put three generations through this
71:37 horrible horrible food mmm probably 60
71:42 years and oh gosh you know look what
71:45 happened man just stop procreating just
71:48 happened but you know it's funny how the
71:50 royal families of the world and the
71:52 banker families of the world and the
71:54 corporate families of the world never
71:57 have any problem squeezing our kids hmm
72:00 and they all eat meat by the way so the
72:04 game has been going for quite some time
72:06 how long is the genic 21 been going well
72:09 since 1992 27 years mm-hmm
72:14 and it was planned before it was
72:17 launched hundred in 79 countries signed
72:21 it in 1992 Wow here's how you do the
72:25 math on that because isn't there over
72:27 300 countries in the world in 179
72:29 countries the deep state by 1992 had
72:33 bought off 179 countries for cash so
72:39 America just needs to rediscover America
72:42 America needs to hold on to the
72:44 Constitution more now than ever you want
72:48 to impress me don't get the tattoo of
72:49 the barbed wire the skull face pulling
72:51 out of your skin get the Constitution
72:53 right there in your arm all ten of them
72:55 in the first ten and that we can work
72:59 with the others humanity is evolved to
73:02 add amendments 16th amendment should be
73:04 scratched out anywhere where a
73:07 corporation can control you that
73:10 apparatus has to be dismantled period
73:14 you as a human being working with other
73:17 human beings should be able to figure
73:21 out watered alienable rights you're
73:23 gonna agree on what protections you want
73:24 to have in place and again common law do
73:26 no harm but if you can't figure it out
73:28 just use that little mechanism and
73:31 what's funny is you know I've got a very
73:33 good friend of mine that once a week we
73:36 have a sit-down conversation for like
73:38 hours we smoke a cigar together and she
73:42 is very different than me on a lot of
73:44 issues you know what's funny we love
73:48 each other to death and we at the end of
73:51 any conversation were you know she'll
73:54 tell me to my face she'll be like I know
73:55 you don't think the same way I do I know
73:57 that you like Trump and I don't like
73:58 Trump and ever done and but she goes I
74:02 know that you want the same thing I want
74:04 and I say it back to her and we
74:07 unequivocally agree I mean it's funny
74:10 any any conversation I have for any
74:12 length of time with someone who's even
74:13 remotely intelligent okay which is most
74:15 people education is the key education
74:21 education education now I even think and
74:24 she probably thinks this about me as
74:26 well I don't believe in climate change I
74:29 don't believe that ice in my glass if it
74:31 melts makes my glass overflow so yeah we
74:35 don't believe the same exact things but
74:38 if we were to if we were to ever get on
74:41 the same page we would just take all
74:43 those [ __ ] claims and put them in a
74:46 laboratory and either I'll be adjusted
74:49 or she'll be adjusted but we'll be on
74:52 the same page in minutes and we'll start
74:55 building an agenda to save humanity
74:57 right in my episode about depopulation
75:02 which is the name of it
75:03 I didn't say population control you know
75:07 there are issues that we have to discuss
75:09 because you know people are gonna be
75:12 able to lean on agenda 21 and their
75:14 mission statements and say but this has
75:16 to happen we have to control how much we
75:19 procreate okay my big statement is China
75:24 goes first
75:25 India goes second South America goes
75:27 third then let me know when America is
75:30 even close to pop in his cap because
75:32 right now if a family has more than two
75:35 children they're probably Mormon or
75:39 they're their the the tiny reservoir of
75:42 people that understand the beauty of
75:43 family so we're depopulating
75:47 automatically anyway I know you family
75:49 on this one whether you agree or not but
75:54 any other information you have boy you
75:57 want to
75:57 create a great thread of comments please
