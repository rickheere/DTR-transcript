00:11 [Music]
00:14 so
00:19 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen tonight i'm coming to you
00:38 in the later hours because i've been
00:41 working on a new script project
00:42 very excited about it been talking to my
00:45 contacts and testing out scene ideas and
00:48 about to hit the hit the words tomorrow
00:53 but today's episode is about something
00:56 that i am going to entitle
00:58 the instant earth theory so let me ask
01:01 you a question
01:03 what if the earth is fairly brand new
01:06 and that most of the history that you've
01:08 been told that occurred
01:10 and most of the artifacts that have been
01:12 discovered to prove that that history
01:14 actually occurred
01:16 were either remnants of a previous use
01:19 of this container
01:21 or simply put there that the idea that
01:24 you are living inside of a movie
01:27 has a bit of truth to it so you're
01:30 probably needing a little more
01:31 clarification on that
01:34 so allow me now i want to make sure that
01:36 everyone
01:37 listening feeling included in this
01:41 but one could actually start this theory
01:44 say
01:45 a day before your birth
01:48 which you think is your conscious birth
01:51 so let me go back
01:52 say 150 years and say what if the earth
01:55 started
01:57 in what is 1870
02:02 1870 that means everyone
02:06 who's alive today would be well within
02:08 this envelope
02:09 but almost everyone has ever lived on
02:11 earth
02:12 never really existed for those of you
02:15 who are into the flat earth thing you
02:16 can bring your model right into this
02:17 conversation
02:19 why do we think it's around no because
02:21 the sun's around
02:22 the moon's around planets i've seen in a
02:24 telescope around
02:27 so it's pretty obvious that we would
02:31 think we live on a round thing
02:32 there's bubbles in water so these
02:36 physical models actually work
02:38 scientifically but maybe they're not
02:39 true
02:40 maybe it's a matrix it could be a
02:42 computer matrix
02:44 it could just be that this is theater it
02:47 could be that we live on a ball but the
02:48 ball is so
02:49 big that our little world is a contact
02:52 lens on top of that
02:54 so we do have this contact lens over us
02:57 which
02:57 is the flat earth model and the reason
03:00 why we do sense a tiny bit of curvature
03:02 every time we do an experiment
03:04 but nothing like the spherical bend
03:07 of the corialis effect that we're told
03:10 should exist it's not due to refracting
03:13 light around a corner
03:14 it's simply because the space we occupy
03:17 is a little tiny compartment on top of
03:20 this much bigger planet
03:23 you know that i'm fascinated to death
03:25 and some of you are too
03:27 with pre-dynastic egypt
03:31 bass discoveries boxes that i keep
03:32 talking about and all this other stuff
03:34 the circular saw marks that we
03:36 absolutely positively see on those
03:38 stones
03:39 bore holes that require at least 6 500
03:43 pounds of
03:45 to pressure a hole in 60 seconds which
03:47 we have proven with scientific method
03:49 now
03:51 stacking 2.5 million rocks into the
03:54 great pyramid
03:56 chambers that go way down into the
03:58 ground potentially
04:00 half a mile into the ground
04:06 there's nothing that explains for
04:09 instance
04:11 where did all the equipment go that
04:13 built the stones
04:16 and if they had steel
04:19 or some harder substance some harder
04:21 alloy
04:23 with diamond bit drills or something
04:25 even stronger than diamonds they could
04:27 cut these
04:28 stones we have seen the proof i will put
04:31 it in the video as you watch this
04:33 as i mention those things you will see
04:35 the video or the picture pop up
04:38 basalt boxes that are utterly perfect
04:41 that were a hundred tons
04:43 of stone after they were carved out
04:48 mitered to in some cases
04:52 to a thousandth of an inch of perfection
04:56 and then polished by hand somehow
05:00 why would there be a society with all
05:02 this advanced equipment
05:03 trying to live inside basically fred
05:06 flintstone homes
05:08 for any reason whatsoever why would they
05:10 build a pyramid that seems to collect
05:12 ethereal winds
05:14 with various uh conductive limestones to
05:16 then project it down into a
05:18 aqua ravine with a you know honeycomb
05:24 plateau when you have the power to turn
05:28 a saw
05:28 so fast they can cut a level eight
05:32 rock a level eight hardness rock
05:35 it makes no sense the card is before the
05:37 horse with any theory that you might
05:39 come up to explain these things
05:42 well what if our creators
05:45 were just experimenting with much
05:47 smaller subsets
05:50 they created a fred flynn stone
05:53 world they just happened to really like
05:56 the pyramids
05:58 they didn't create any phonetic language
06:00 or iconic language at all
06:01 they just put these people out there and
06:03 to see what would happen maybe it was
06:06 just a little disneyland resort maybe
06:08 this is a disneyland resort maybe this
06:09 is a westworld resort
06:12 there's uh this gentleman we've talked
06:14 about several times on the show over the
06:16 course of five years
06:18 mr david ike who definitely has some
06:22 extreme merits in this world i haven't
06:25 seen him talk in a really long time
06:28 but i know that he advances a theory of
06:30 reptiles
06:32 shape-shifting reptiles all over the
06:34 world and he's only doing it through
06:35 deduction not through personal
06:37 experience and he's very clear about
06:38 that
06:40 but now what if a gigantic portion of
06:44 this world
06:45 is some species like that let's just say
06:50 there's just for the sake of argument
06:52 okay about 8 billion people on this
06:54 planet
06:55 i don't think they really know how many
06:56 people on this planet i think the plus
06:58 or minus
06:59 would probably be a billion plus or
07:01 minus a billion
07:03 but whatever 8 billion what if 7.9999
07:08 billion were these other
07:11 beings either
07:14 similar to those who crafted the world
07:17 or perhaps a benign being that was
07:19 created to not really interfere too much
07:22 beyond the parameters of whatever
07:23 experiment we're conducting
07:25 for them for those of you who at least
07:28 went through junior college like me
07:31 and you at least got through sociology i
07:33 ended up taking it twice because i went
07:34 to one college and then
07:36 couldn't carry my credits to the college
07:37 took it again
07:39 i love learning so for me it was like
07:41 totally cool to hear both things twice
07:43 now how many people now i want you to
07:45 reach into your mind
07:47 don't knee jerk a response unless you
07:49 absolutely know
07:50 this was a profound moment for your mind
07:54 but how many of you heard
07:58 that when you're conducting a
07:59 sociological experiment
08:02 and the people that are the subject of
08:04 the experiment understand that they're
08:06 being watched
08:08 they behave differently and so it's
08:11 important if you're going to really
08:12 create
08:13 a good set of result data from your
08:16 experiment
08:17 the people being observed can't know
08:19 they're being observed
08:21 otherwise it changes everything all
08:24 right
08:24 when you heard that did you get a weird
08:27 feeling that oh my god i'm being watched
08:30 douglas adams wrote in the hitchhiker's
08:32 guide to the galaxy when arthur didn't
08:34 met
08:34 slaughty bought foss and he's learning
08:36 about the fact that the world was a
08:37 computer
08:38 to generate the question to the answer
08:40 of life the universe and everything
08:42 which was 42
08:43 he says ah well maybe that explains the
08:45 fact that my entire life i felt like i
08:48 was being watched
08:50 and saudi by fast quickly snaps it and
08:52 says oh no everybody
08:54 everybody in the universe has that well
08:56 obviously a writer named douglas adams
08:57 came up with that idea in a hotel room
08:59 as he's writing this
09:00 incredible radio series that turned into
09:02 a series of books
09:04 because it is something that we all
09:05 think about i used to dream that i was
09:07 in a truman show when i was a little kid
09:09 before that movie was even going to be
09:11 20 years you know 20 years from it's
09:13 being created
09:15 i remember at the age of nine i used to
09:17 have these weird visions of
09:19 if i left a room they were breaking down
09:21 the set behind me
09:23 i had a dream once that i walked too
09:24 quickly into my
09:26 apartment and derby kansas walked into
09:29 the
09:30 kitchen and they were eating sandwiches
09:33 and looking at me like oh [ __ ] he just
09:35 saw me
09:36 and they quickly jumped out of the room
09:38 and put the walls together and then i
09:39 fell asleep and then i went back out in
09:41 the room and it was fine
09:43 as if they could put me to sleep and
09:44 reset it and make make sure he thinks
09:46 that was a dream
09:48 it never happened again so i don't have
09:50 any delusions thank god they must have
09:51 fixed my brain if that happened
09:55 but now think about this isn't it
09:57 interesting that
09:59 if we were so privileged to be
10:02 able to finance any viewer of this show
10:06 to come to a centralized location
10:09 and we all got to meet each other and
10:12 shake hands and
10:13 give each other hugs and just sit down
10:17 maybe i started stokie and we got a
10:19 chance to talk we'd find
10:21 that we have all these like minds that
10:23 we have these deep brains
10:25 and we're deep in all different ways but
10:26 it's still fascinating to let
10:29 one person talk and then the next person
10:31 talks and we're all just in heaven man
10:33 because we're all on the same wavelength
10:36 i'm just the emcee
10:38 that's it but we all meet and we realize
10:42 we have the best weekend a week
10:46 at some club med wherever we end up
10:50 and then we go home and wow
10:54 the difference of living together for
10:56 those seven days or what have you
10:58 and having every cell in our body feel
11:00 like it's turned into a neuron
11:02 that we lived we actually lived
11:05 for those seven days from sun up to sun
11:09 down
11:09 we could find a great conversation among
11:12 all of us
11:13 and we all know that we don't believe
11:14 the same thing someone's going to
11:16 believe very heavily in the bible
11:17 someone's not
11:18 but we still respect each other because
11:20 why we're intelligent
11:22 well we go home and instantaneously we
11:24 would find people that again
11:26 aren't bad people whatsoever we still
11:29 love those other people that we meet
11:30 when we go back home
11:31 not necessarily our family members but
11:34 other friends and
11:35 you know associates and what have you
11:38 but there might be a big difference
11:40 between the quality of conversation the
11:42 quality of thought
11:43 and then kind of subliminally we would
11:46 probably be
11:46 feeling some thematic thing like uh
11:49 well that was my tribe man that was my
11:53 tribe
11:54 i was with my people no matter what we
11:57 talked about
11:57 no matter how mundane or complex it was
12:00 enjoyable
12:01 whether we agreed or disagreed it was
12:04 tolerable
12:05 it was nice we actually had a
12:08 means to disagree in a way that we had
12:10 smiles on our face the entire time
12:12 or we even changed our minds because
12:14 someone had the ability
12:16 to talk without being interrupted
12:20 and it felt good i have friends in my
12:22 life
12:24 who do this to me and when i'm done
12:27 talking to them
12:28 and i go anywhere else in this world as
12:30 much as i love
12:31 my other friends and family and what
12:33 have you there's no one like these
12:35 people
12:37 it's this instantaneous
12:40 intense engagement whether we're talking
12:42 about nothing
12:44 laughing our heads off or really getting
12:46 in deep
12:48 telling a touching story that makes
12:50 either us
12:52 get the klimt or they're telling us the
12:55 story we're getting for clamp doesn't
12:56 matter
12:58 the whole human condition the human
13:01 experience is being
13:02 fully engaged now in a way
13:06 this instant earthling i am trying to be
13:08 as literal as possible
13:11 perhaps there's multiple containers all
13:13 over the surface of this ball
13:15 again a ball so big that it feels flat
13:18 the container i mean when you're inside
13:22 of a uh let's just say it is a
13:24 heliocentric earth
13:25 but you're inside of uh the big football
13:27 stadium
13:29 well it doesn't feel round because
13:31 you're so tiny and it's so huge
13:34 but you could just keep getting it
13:36 bigger and bigger and bigger and adjust
13:37 for gravity
13:39 the gravity algorithm works but it's all
13:41 based on you know
13:44 false pretenses of where we are and
13:46 what's going on
13:47 but we gotta figure it out that's all we
13:49 really need
13:51 what kills me is the pre-dynastic egypt
13:53 thing
13:55 that's what's kicked off this episode in
13:57 my mind
13:58 it's really racking my brain man so
14:02 racking my brain because the evidence is
14:05 so painfully right in our face
14:10 the cart got before the horse and
14:13 appeared to
14:14 function properly the one way i parse it
14:17 in my mind
14:19 is that if machines were built with
14:21 steel
14:23 then they would rot away over the course
14:25 of ten thousand years and i happen to
14:27 believe the pre-pre-dynastic egypt is at
14:29 least
14:32 35 to 40 000 years ago
14:35 because of a bunch of other very deep
14:37 science about that
14:39 era the star alignments with the
14:40 constellations on the ground
14:42 a bunch of other things then it hit me
14:45 that even if we were to find these
14:47 machines it wouldn't make any sense that
14:48 they would live in a stone age
14:50 literally with options
14:54 to create skyscrapers out of that same
14:56 equipment
14:58 flying vehicles there
15:01 would only be a fascination with stone
15:04 perhaps as an art installation or
15:06 something
15:08 but then again there probably wouldn't
15:09 be an abandoned bath salt box
15:11 in the middle of a hallway because they
15:14 wouldn't build them inside the hallways
15:16 in the first place they build them
15:17 externally
15:18 float them in on some anti-gravity thing
15:20 or whatever they're doing
15:22 but no there's evidence that never
15:23 happened either
15:25 there's anomalies like christopher
15:27 columbus quote unquote discovering the
15:29 americas
15:30 but there's already people here okay
15:34 well obviously somebody discovered it
15:35 before we did but then again we now have
15:38 human beings
15:39 on every single plot of land in the
15:41 entire world including hawaii
15:43 easter island it's a little bit easier
15:46 to digest
15:47 the polynesian or excuse me the
15:50 indonesian islands because they're so
15:51 close
15:52 you know you can probably see a lot of
15:53 them and then you see the next one you
15:54 kind of know just keep going in that
15:56 direction you'll find another one up
15:57 there's another little one
15:58 i can survive on that one i can't
16:00 survive on that one
16:02 everyone got eaten by snakes on that one
16:06 with hawaii go check it on a map it's
16:08 far away from everything
16:10 easter island same thing but yet they
16:13 still have inhabitants on them
16:15 okay and then we have different
16:18 shapes and designs of human beings
16:21 different pigment colors in our skin
16:24 you have black and white then you have
16:26 different shades of black different
16:27 shades of white
16:29 then you have the asian cultures the
16:30 native american cultures
16:32 the latin american cultures which you
16:36 know
16:36 removing the conquistadors you at least
16:38 have the pygmies and the peruvians and
16:39 the incas
16:41 the aztecs the mayans
16:45 the aborigines it seems illogical that
16:49 somehow everybody swam everywhere
16:51 it was it also seems illogical that you
16:54 have some
16:54 groups of people like new guinea
16:58 where you've got the really really
17:00 prehistoric man
17:01 in that that's been largely undisturbed
17:04 but they get there in the first place
17:07 how is it that you would have a society
17:09 of completely sophisticated beings
17:11 capable of getting to a particular
17:13 particularly remote location and not
17:15 find panther city there
17:18 twenty thousand years later i mean don't
17:19 you just stand on the shoulders of the
17:21 people that brought you there and you
17:22 just keep going up and your neural neck
17:24 keeps getting denser and denser through
17:26 and breeding with your own people
17:28 someone's gonna get bored
17:30 and find an old screwdriver from the
17:32 ancestors that got there and
17:34 man do something else and figure out how
17:35 this works
17:37 do smart people really travel around the
17:39 world on oceans
17:40 and then not bring all the necessities
17:43 and and
17:43 information that let him get there in
17:45 the first place
17:47 we got pyramids on every single
17:48 continent
17:52 isn't it interesting how and the mud
17:54 flood people
17:55 are very into this but that
17:59 the further we dig down on these
18:01 continents we find stuff
18:02 previous civilizations
18:06 no everybody could say it's just weather
18:08 anomalies and there are a lot of
18:09 solutions to mud theory that way
18:12 but no matter how far we dig down in
18:14 england we find more civilizations that
18:16 were there before us i mean really
18:17 down there deep egypt
18:20 and cairo on the giza plateau
18:23 four stories down is 360 feet
18:27 that's 36 stories in modern day times
18:32 are they just frosting over a previous
18:35 experiment did they go extinct because
18:39 of some issue that they
18:40 over did something and or
18:43 ward and killed each other or did they
18:45 absolutely flub the experiment
18:47 and whoever owns the dome said all right
18:50 yeah that was pretty cool that screwed
18:52 up too man
18:53 do you hope we get the next one right
18:54 yeah it's just like a
18:57 cabin in the woods man there's a reset
19:00 but we believe history exists because
19:02 we're told it exists right
19:04 it's like i mentioned in the history is
19:05 the matrix episode
19:08 it's so true and if anything this could
19:11 be the 101
19:12 and history is the matrix is the 202 to
19:14 this or 201
19:16 to this particular episode it's
19:19 interesting that if i had this
19:20 if i had to prove to you the world
19:23 existed before
19:24 i was born
19:27 i don't think i could prove it to you i
19:30 could definitely
19:32 suggest it to you i could insinuate it
19:34 to you i could take what i've been told
19:35 and pass it to you
19:36 but if i had to personally prove that
19:38 the world exists before me
19:39 and what i mean by that is not the world
19:41 as in the soil and the rocks
19:43 but civilization existed before me the
19:45 only thing i could probably say is that
19:47 i think it takes a man and a woman to
19:48 make me and so there had to be an
19:50 inception point prior to my existence to
19:53 incubate me
19:53 to birth i watched my kid grow up in her
19:56 mom's belly
19:59 all right i've seen it happen to other
20:01 people
20:03 think about the theory of the dinosaurs
20:06 if you
20:07 start the theory of the dinosaurs and
20:08 say 2021
20:10 it seems like a very intense
20:13 paleontology science that is
20:17 absolutely bona fide and it totally was
20:19 real
20:20 all these dinosaurs really existed
20:23 once you look up the history of it
20:25 you'll realize it's all bs
20:28 but the tyrannosaurus rex was a
20:30 fictional being created by a six-inch
20:31 tooth
20:33 found in some rivers supposedly
20:36 you'll find that the first two guys that
20:38 invented paleontology
20:40 had lied so bad that they discovered 136
20:45 dinosaur species and that today modern
20:48 paleontologists say well they lied about
20:50 100 and 304 of them
20:53 but it's real it's totally real and the
20:56 tyrannosaurus rex
20:57 that was totally fake in what 1865 or so
21:01 well you know we actually did discover
21:03 that thing exactly the way that guy
21:05 faked that thing in a museum so now it's
21:08 real
21:09 i will go to my deathbed
21:13 without some super duper frozen
21:16 400 mirror 400 million year old being
21:18 being found frozen
21:20 the point i can touch it and i can see
21:22 it and i can
21:24 be there during its autopsy or it's
21:26 scanning or what have you
21:28 i probably need to touch it i need to
21:32 take a cell sample and look at a
21:34 microscope
21:36 i won't think that these things never
21:38 existed and they were simply inserted in
21:40 time
21:42 as a scam to raise money
21:45 that then became such a profit-making
21:48 business
21:50 that when they found real prehistoric
21:51 animals like a saber-toothed tiger
21:54 or a woolly mammoth
21:57 just blended those two things together
21:59 and said see one equals the other
22:02 but i think it was inserted in time now
22:06 there was a theory
22:08 that uh i think eric dube made an
22:12 episode on that
22:12 that guy's been absolutely absent from
22:14 reality
22:16 if he's anywhere i don't know where he
22:18 is in terms of media that we see
22:22 he did provide some amazing videos man
22:25 he's a big flat earther we did videos on
22:28 telling you where christmas came from
22:29 and all that's just historically
22:31 accurate but he did a great job on it
22:33 but uh he did a theory that um
22:36 we did the dinosaurs which i think he's
22:38 totally right about
22:39 he did one that he said that egypt as we
22:42 know it today was in
22:43 was literally constructed in the 1850s
22:46 or something
22:48 1800s well the mechanical devices that
22:52 made egypt possible as we know it today
22:55 have still not yet been invented so to
22:58 have these masons do it in the 1800s
23:01 and in a really short order of time with
23:03 a lot of people still on the continent
23:06 fighting wars and all kinds of other
23:08 things where there's tons of people
23:09 there
23:11 is hard to believe however
23:14 it's been a long time since i've seen
23:15 that documentary and since he's had his
23:16 channel raced 90 times
23:18 i don't know if any of that stuff's
23:19 still up there he did cross-pollinate
23:23 some really bad data because there are
23:26 pyramids in the world that are very
23:27 sharp
23:28 and very steep and they look like almost
23:31 cones that you would find
23:32 at some construction site although
23:34 they're pyramids with four sides
23:36 and he said see that when they first
23:38 drew the pyramids from egypt they looked
23:39 like these and now the sun they're these
23:41 big fat pyramids and he
23:42 confused two different sites so shame on
23:46 him
23:47 plus some scientists are just horrible
23:50 artists
23:51 and they're doing their best but perhaps
23:54 what
23:54 might have led him into that theory
23:57 is this cart before the horse problem
23:59 with the tools that made
24:01 so many of these rocks and these
24:04 sculptures and these statues
24:05 in some industrialized form
24:09 and he just said you know what this has
24:11 to be built more recently
24:13 or at least with technology that matches
24:15 sort of where we are today
24:18 but the world experts that know how to
24:20 cut stone
24:23 grimace when they're asked okay
24:26 there's the great pyramid now you know
24:29 how it was before it was
24:30 when it was done it had veneered rock on
24:33 it it's got 2.3 to 2.5 million stones
24:36 it's 465 feet tall approximately
24:38 it's got chambers inside that reach out
24:41 the stars
24:43 now if you're hired to do this thing
24:45 what's it going to take oh by the way
24:46 it's on a plateau that's actually taller
24:48 than the pyramid
24:49 oh it's actually an aqua ravine ah it's
24:51 got a big catacomb water thing inside
24:53 and all these hidden chambers underneath
24:54 how much was going to take you to build
24:56 all that and how long is it going to
24:56 take
24:58 they're looking at us going i don't know
24:59 a couple thousand years i don't know
25:02 never done it before looks really hard
25:07 i understand why people think these
25:09 other theories have
25:10 merit we're starting to notice and maybe
25:14 it's just a um
25:16 well i'll give it to you two different
25:17 ways there
25:19 are two explanations of the reference of
25:23 npcs
25:24 in the real world an npc for those of
25:27 you don't play video
25:28 games the acronym stands for non-player
25:30 character
25:31 when you play a video game obviously
25:33 you're real playing the game
25:34 sometimes you'll play games that have
25:35 other real players in there
25:37 there are characters in the game that
25:38 aren't human they're there
25:41 as artificial intelligences they look
25:43 like humans because they've been drawn
25:45 to react you click on them and they'll
25:46 give you a quest they'll say please go
25:48 over there give me that thing and bring
25:49 it back and if you do that i'll give you
25:51 the sword
25:51 which allowed to kill you that thing
25:52 over there blah blah
25:56 so the two definitions that i recognize
25:59 on this show
26:00 is the project mockingbird in pc which
26:03 is
26:04 a news anchor who's been bought off
26:07 by the the black hats
26:11 for project mockingbird launched in the
26:13 1950s
26:14 i remember in a senate hearing and by
26:17 1970 they said they were controlling all
26:19 the top personalities on news
26:22 and that totaled between 750 to 1 000
26:24 people
26:27 so it's real and that's the one you'll
26:30 get in trouble if you post too many
26:32 memes with these gray-faced
26:33 characters they used to block them from
26:35 you i don't think they care anymore
26:38 then there's my definition of mpc which
26:40 i did an episode on
26:42 and it's essentially a fake human
26:45 it's either one of two things we're in a
26:47 matrix and these are just ais that we're
26:49 talking to
26:50 metaphorically and almost hysterically
26:53 we have recreated that within video
26:55 games
26:56 but those are those sort of deer-eyed
26:58 people you talk to
27:00 people you talk to and they can't seem
27:01 to muster more than about 500 words in
27:03 their vocabulary
27:05 they're functional in life they're safe
27:07 in life they do their little robotic
27:08 loops
27:09 but they're not actually real people
27:12 they don't have souls
27:13 they're simply there to fill up the
27:15 space to create a simulated environment
27:17 for the sociological experiment which is
27:20 whatever the hell we're in
27:22 the secondary theory that is what i
27:23 mentioned earlier in the episode which
27:25 is that again it's
27:26 it's westworld westworld in that
27:29 particular case would be a big joke on
27:30 us
27:31 literally the hbo tv series that went
27:34 three
27:34 three seasons 2.8 seasons
27:37 ended horribly started brilliantly and
27:40 adorably
27:42 and that would be the theory that their
27:44 visitors
27:47 they don't interact too much but in that
27:49 particular theory
27:50 the npcs are more like the evil bastards
27:53 that run the world
27:55 it's sort of like when you're young and
27:57 you're on spring break and you leave
27:59 say idaho and you go to fort lauderdale
28:02 and you're like man i'm gonna be a total
28:05 dick in this world because
28:07 i don't live here i'm going home so i'll
28:10 break a window scratch a car
28:12 sleep with 10 girls and get them all
28:14 pregnant i don't care i'm going back
28:15 home
28:16 same thing they're coming here just like
28:19 westworld the show on tv
28:20 where the millionaires went to shoot
28:23 people kill people
28:24 screw people everything in the book and
28:27 then maybe the
28:29 totally crazy tongue-in-cheek one is
28:32 that they're
28:32 reptilians that are simply here to
28:37 look at humans that have more emotion
28:40 because they have an r factor brain
28:43 they're more left brain but now
28:48 what's interesting is this
28:51 this is going to screw with some of you
28:52 don't take this too seriously and do
28:54 anything strange
28:54 with this information now i think
28:58 i have parents that are my parents
29:02 i do kind of look like them
29:06 now i don't remember being born the day
29:08 of
29:09 thank god it might scar me for life
29:13 but now what if my parents were
29:15 engineered to look like me
29:17 and my relatives they were engineered to
29:19 look like me too
29:21 but they've been crafted to give me the
29:23 impression that i was
29:24 born through a womb of a particular
29:27 person
29:28 the reason why your parents or you end
29:32 up
29:32 acting like your parents genetically is
29:34 that they
29:35 are mimicking you or maybe just through
29:38 power of suggestion we end up acting
29:39 like them no matter who they are
29:42 it's not a genetic trigger it's not an
29:44 instinctual trigger it's just mother
29:46 goose triggering
29:47 isn't it interesting what you can prove
29:49 to yourself and what you can't prove to
29:50 yourself
29:51 but before anyone says anything you
29:53 actually overestimate what you can prove
29:55 i can prove that i was birthed out of my
29:59 mother now we happened to catch my kid
30:03 being my kid's grandmother videotaped
30:06 her actually being born
30:08 so unfortunately my child has the video
30:10 of such a thing i don't think she has it
30:11 thank god but
30:13 it was videotaped and i was there when
30:16 it happened
30:19 a lot of our parents were there
30:20 hopefully our moms were there
30:22 but let's uh let's subdivide that one
30:25 more time
30:26 just for the sake of being efficient in
30:28 our theory
30:30 what if those of us who are really alive
30:34 those of us that would meet as a result
30:36 of getting together from the show's
30:38 population
30:40 we're real our family lines are real
30:43 and we're the real ones anyone you've
30:46 ever been able to sustain a long-term
30:48 relationship with that's also a real
30:50 person
30:53 but all the robots you see in cars
30:55 wearing masks by themselves
30:58 they're not real they're there to give
31:00 you a power of suggestion to test
31:02 whether or not you actually
31:04 have a fully developed say concept of
31:07 freedom
31:09 and what if the experiment right now is
31:10 nothing more than to test
31:13 the resolve of what's inside the petri
31:16 dish
31:18 okay hatch the pandemic let's watch what
31:21 happens
31:22 we do this every time at this stage in
31:24 the game
31:25 no one's ever no society as a whole has
31:28 ever risen up
31:29 to fight this ridiculous oppression and
31:32 when they don't stand up to fight this
31:34 ridiculous oppression
31:35 then they're no longer worthy to live
31:38 and poof you go away
31:42 they they mud flood the whole joint
31:45 replace everything knock all the
31:47 buildings down
31:49 hell for all we know they can just wait
31:50 10 000 years for it to happen
31:52 maybe they just run a little acidic
31:55 atmosphere in the sky which melts
31:57 everything away except stone
32:00 so all the tools that made those stones
32:01 are all long gone
32:05 let it settle for a little while just
32:06 like they're baking a cake
32:09 check the radiation levels check the
32:11 acidic levels
32:13 they adjust the experiment and put
32:16 a whole bunch of folks in different
32:18 places this time perhaps their
32:20 aborigines are going to run the world
32:21 this time
32:22 they're going to be the aborigine
32:25 privilege
32:26 and the white people are going to be in
32:28 south australia
32:30 or what is it uh it's south north
32:34 west or east australia right just see
32:37 what happens
32:38 now we're all going to find the
32:40 artifacts
32:42 of previous civilizations if we find
32:45 them in our area we might make the false
32:47 assumption
32:48 that our generation be it
32:51 if you're a particular race or what have
32:54 you
32:55 that your generation created that stuff
32:57 remember the incas found the pre-inca
32:58 stuff
32:59 and unlike other areas of the world that
33:01 try to use syrup
33:02 and steel predecessors that aren't even
33:05 the same racism
33:06 the incas were at least honest people
33:10 to this day they're honest and they say
33:11 you know what that we didn't build that
33:14 we call it pre-inca because we're the
33:17 people who
33:18 found it and we're the people who've
33:20 only lived here as far as we
33:21 know so we call it pre-inca some other
33:24 race
33:26 but they don't even make a claim that it
33:27 was actually their genome that did it
33:30 they don't know and we don't know it's
33:33 nice actually i will
33:34 always always always praise the inca
33:36 people for being truthful about that
33:38 and again maybe it was them maybe it was
33:40 their ancestors but how'd they get so
33:42 reset
33:43 from being able to shave the mountain
33:45 top of machu picchu
33:47 getting rid of a mountain off the top of
33:49 that mountain
33:50 creating a flat plateau and then
33:52 building that amazing thing up there
33:55 but right now we're in this absolute
33:57 booming cycle
33:59 of anthropology and archaeology we're
34:02 finding new things
34:04 and what's really sad about it is that
34:07 well it's actually feeds into this
34:09 theory let me ask you
34:13 i come from kansas center of the united
34:15 states
34:17 all right let's say that i'm digging in
34:19 the backyard somewhere in
34:22 kansas a farmer is doing some you know
34:24 tilling of some land
34:26 maybe they're trying to put new
34:27 irrigation in or something and
34:29 all of a sudden ting ting ting hmm look
34:31 at something down here
34:32 let's keep digging here that's cool
34:34 there's a stone here that seems to be
34:36 cut and wow it's really flat except for
34:38 where i banged it with the saw
34:40 or the the shovel or whatever
34:43 and you start digging and start digging
34:44 and you start finding a hidden
34:45 civilization in the center of
34:47 nowhere then you start finding chambers
34:50 and and there's actually a pyramid down
34:52 there but you gotta
34:53 remove so much earth to see the pyramid
34:56 and you just keep digging and digging
34:57 and digging
34:59 let's say we found that why the hell
35:02 wouldn't you quickly prioritize
35:05 digging out this totally hidden
35:08 civilization in the ground
35:10 and why is it that almost every country
35:12 that finds such a thing especially
35:15 egypt okay they're [ __ ] blocking the
35:18 entire world
35:19 from digging out that place
35:22 why should be top priority
35:26 dig out egypt you could charge a
35:29 thousand dollars a ticket to come see
35:31 that place
35:32 that country would own the rest of the
35:34 world if they just get busy with it
35:36 but no everything's shrouded in secret
35:39 they're digging out a bunch of chambers
35:41 under the paws of the sphinx
35:43 and they put this wooden deck out to
35:44 cover it up when they're not doing it
35:46 making you think they're just doing it
35:47 for your convenience you don't slip and
35:48 fall on sand
35:49 which is what you put down the ground to
35:51 make sure you don't flip and fall on
35:53 slick wood the theory is completely
35:55 upside down
35:57 everyone that tours these folks through
36:00 those areas they're they're always
36:02 bragging yeah
36:03 you know the guy uh brian forrester it
36:05 went down
36:06 those four stories 360 feet they told
36:10 him yeah there's ten more stories down
36:12 below
36:15 okay so it's another thousand feet we're
36:18 at
36:18 1400 feet but the egyptians are the real
36:22 creators of that place created it's
36:26 probably
36:26 some sort of african again
36:30 look at the statues probably black folks
36:33 eventually became the egyptian bloodline
36:36 at some point
36:37 through dozens and dozens of wars and
36:40 takeovers and all that stuff
36:43 but they're always [ __ ] blocking the
36:44 digs
36:46 always why
36:49 well one in egypt i believe at a
36:53 at a fundamental level they don't want
36:55 to lose the genetic possession of that
36:58 land they don't want to prove to
36:59 themselves beyond the shadow of a doubt
37:02 that they didn't actually make any of
37:03 that stuff which is why egypt
37:05 is not a panther city okay whoever built
37:09 the
37:10 great pyramid like i've said several
37:11 times would have had a panther city by
37:13 now something in a stealth shield
37:15 all kinds of flying vehicles you would
37:17 because 35
37:18 000 years ago you were able to build the
37:21 most amazing
37:22 things on planet earth and what happened
37:24 to your brains between then and now
37:26 how did you get so much more primitive
37:29 than these amazing folks that built that
37:31 place because you're not those folks
37:33 plain and simple but
37:37 what if there's something else like
37:40 instant earth theory
37:41 to stop them what if they just
37:43 discovered well
37:44 it's pretty easy like let's just say
37:46 we're two of those folks that
37:48 built this place and they're looking
37:50 down on the sociological experiment
37:53 one guy's a newbie he comes in he's like
37:55 uh well i got a question for you he goes
37:58 yeah what's the question man some old
37:59 guy
37:59 he's already been there a long time what
38:02 do you do about all this stuff you leave
38:04 behind
38:05 what do you mean well you left the
38:07 pyramids behind from the previous
38:09 experiments
38:10 i mean you got machu picchu over there
38:13 at least that's what they're calling it
38:14 and you got
38:15 pyramids of china and turkey and south
38:17 africa and
38:19 why do you how can you possibly leave
38:21 the past there for them to discover
38:24 and the guy goes well you know it's kind
38:26 of fun to watch him try to figure out
38:28 what it is
38:29 it kind of stimulates their mind we get
38:30 to watch their little experiments
38:33 yeah but what if they uh what if they
38:35 dig the place out and figure out
38:36 you know you've got some spaceships down
38:38 there and some other stuff
38:40 well you know we actually control the
38:42 folks that own that
38:44 those uh authority points and we just
38:47 deny them no they can't dig it out
38:50 what if it's just that simple stuff
38:53 sitting right there in plain sight
38:56 revealing the reuse of this container
39:00 for those studying uh the mud flood
39:02 stuff
39:04 which if you haven't studied that and
39:06 you're looking at me like does he say
39:07 mud flood
39:08 what the hell is that there's a small
39:11 small group of folks that are studying
39:12 this you can see several videos online
39:14 some of them are reaching really hard
39:17 because again there's a theory and then
39:19 there's things that can look like the
39:21 theory
39:21 again i've never done a mud flood
39:23 episode directly because i haven't found
39:25 the real linchpin for it
39:27 if you think you've got the video and
39:28 it's something that you follow please
39:30 put it in the
39:31 comments below on youtube or stick it on
39:34 our facebook page
39:36 but the theory is is that the gods
39:40 do this they erase civilizations
39:44 by causing mass floods just paving over
39:47 a previous civilization now the problem
39:50 with the theory is that there's a lot of
39:52 just basic geology and
39:54 and meteorology that explains probably
39:57 95 percent of what i've seen
40:01 for instance there's some mining towns
40:03 in america
40:05 where they happen to build a township
40:08 on a hill in sort of a valley area
40:12 which you know protects you against wind
40:13 if you live inside the valley as opposed
40:15 to on top of the hill
40:17 but as it rains on the hills that don't
40:20 have foliage
40:21 to protect this event from occurring
40:23 there's no grass there's no
40:24 big trees or anything the water will
40:27 sink into the hill
40:29 modify it and over time it slides down
40:32 into the valley
40:33 and if you built a hotel straight up and
40:35 down with a nice flat
40:37 foundation and this continues occurring
40:40 and you had a door
40:41 on the side where the hill goes up
40:43 eventually just over time the mud's
40:45 going to
40:46 build up on that side of the hotel and
40:47 they're going to have to
40:49 you can't go in that door anymore you've
40:50 got to build a door in the second floor
40:51 and get off where the
40:53 the new soil meets the earth right it
40:55 meets the doorway
40:57 so that's very natural but perhaps
41:00 there is something to it because we also
41:04 have these
41:06 bizarre moments in history where we
41:08 believe
41:09 that entire civilizations disappeared in
41:12 the flash of an eye
41:13 something happened to the pre-dynastic
41:15 egyptians on the biggest continent
41:18 on this planet by a long shot
41:23 it's lush at the time it's got a river
41:26 with plenty of fish
41:27 and tropical greenery everywhere
41:31 grain can grow perfectly well in fact it
41:34 does it grows wild
41:35 plenty of livestock in africa there's no
41:38 overusing the resources in africa to the
41:41 point where people are going to
41:43 starve to death which is a very common
41:45 explanation for a lot of things easter
41:46 island
41:47 was said to have gone through that that
41:48 they over
41:51 you know pillaged the place now in the
41:52 easter island that theory holds up 100
41:55 as a theory but they also say that crap
41:57 in south america
42:00 where all the aztec pyramids and mayan
42:02 pyramids and
42:03 inca pyramids and inca stuff they say
42:05 they overdid it
42:07 okay have you seen south america
42:11 i mean outside of a massive pole shift
42:14 way more than just the was it the 23
42:16 degrees
42:18 way more than that civilizations seem
42:22 to vanish from various areas very
42:24 quickly
42:26 and there's no sign of mud flooding
42:28 necessarily
42:30 if so it definitely greened over very
42:33 quickly to hide the sort of artifact of
42:35 such a thing
42:36 it's probably safe to say that if you
42:39 were to go with conventional history
42:42 that man has been on this planet way way
42:46 longer than they said that we've been
42:48 here
42:49 i just looked at a website the other day
42:50 that found a
42:53 steel screw that's probably
42:56 i can't you can't quite get the scale
42:58 from the picture if i were to guess
43:01 it looks like about a two inch dowel in
43:03 thickness
43:04 with rivets and it looks like about
43:06 maybe six inches long
43:08 found inside of a stone that is carbon
43:10 dated
43:11 400 million years ago
43:16 okay well hey if you look at
43:17 pre-dynastic egypt that object actually
43:20 is definitely further back than we need
43:22 it to be but that would suggest that
43:24 there were
43:25 machined parts from the past
43:29 perhaps a bolt fell off the dome and
43:32 sunk into some warm rock or something
43:36 and then just got glossed over
43:38 i've been i've had this thing on my list
43:40 to make an episode on and i don't think
43:42 i can do
43:43 an hour on this without barring you guys
43:45 to death
43:46 without doing a tremendous amount of
43:48 research to try and keep it going for a
43:50 little bit you know at least an hour
43:52 but there are all of these artifacts
43:54 that they have found encapsulated in
43:56 stones around the world
43:59 and regardless of carbon dating is
44:01 accurate or not
44:02 they'll find these things at depths that
44:04 are just
44:05 astronomically against the proverbial
44:08 life cycle right
44:10 remember the reason why we know that oil
44:12 is not a fossil fuel
44:13 is that oil is found as deep as we can
44:15 go but all life stops at sixteen
44:17 thousand feet
44:19 which just is around you know three
44:21 miles
44:22 but the russians have dug you know eight
44:24 to nine miles in the ground there's
44:26 still oil down there because it's a
44:27 natural byproduct of the earth
44:29 crushed methane gas turns into crude oil
44:32 and then we refine off the
44:33 carbon to get to the methane the
44:36 hydrogen
44:38 and we have various octane fuel levels
44:40 from racing fuel down to kerosene down
44:42 to diesel
44:44 and it's just a varying amount of carbon
44:45 atoms and whatever the refinery
44:47 refining process is in the pipe
44:50 what else could instant earth explain
44:54 remember i told you about the the book
44:57 that
44:58 supposedly plato alluded to which is um
45:01 as plato was growing up as a kid he's
45:05 claimed that the elders of his time
45:06 frame spoke of the time before the moon
45:11 the moon was a recent addition
45:14 within the couple generations that he
45:16 existed you know meaning his generation
45:19 a couple generations before him
45:21 they didn't remember having a white ball
45:23 in the sky
45:25 but they were very mystical people
45:27 weren't they and so
45:29 having a moon like if we had two moons
45:32 tomorrow morning in 2021
45:34 holy crap we'd all go get religious or
45:38 something i don't know
45:41 but back then everybody was spiritual
45:44 god was controlling the world or gods
45:47 were controlling the world whether or
45:48 not they were atomistic or pluralistic
45:50 they believed that those kind of things
45:52 occurred
45:57 i still think it's astronomically
46:00 impossible
46:02 more so than the operation of a dominion
46:04 voting machine that the
46:06 moon can eclipse the sun perfectly when
46:09 one the moon's in an elliptical orbit
46:11 and two it's supposed to be arbitrarily
46:14 in the sky an average of 237
46:16 000 miles away from earth and the sun is
46:19 approximately 93 million miles away
46:21 according to modern day
46:23 pop science and yet this
46:26 object is the same exact size in the sky
46:29 on occasion to create a full solar
46:31 eclipse
46:34 i think that's impossible so there's a
46:37 mechanical reality
46:38 in those two things working together to
46:40 create this this effect
46:42 that doesn't make any scientific sense
46:44 plus our moon is always said to be too
46:46 big for the earth
46:47 now they're trying to tell us the moon
46:49 will eventually
46:50 lose orbit with earth and go fly off on
46:53 its own 19 space 1999 journey
46:56 really interesting
46:59 i mean it losing it gaining an orbital
47:03 pattern around earth meaning increasing
47:05 its orbital
47:07 radius from earth's core seems utterly
47:11 ridiculous
47:12 unless we can explain it through ether
47:14 winds
47:16 well if this is an orchestrated
47:19 simulation of reality then everything
47:22 makes sense
47:24 the theory that the moon is a burned-out
47:26 sun
47:27 it simply expired and on a particular
47:31 evening
47:32 as the sun went dark which could be
47:35 blamed on an eclipse back in the old
47:36 days
47:38 imagine seeing the sun flicker out of
47:40 existence i mean who knows how that
47:41 thing might end
47:43 i'm sure those who put it in place
47:46 would know exactly when it's going to
47:47 expire whether it be a serendipitous
47:50 moment that's tracked by some device and
47:52 and the little arm goes off and he's
47:53 like oh what's that on well the sun's
47:55 about to go on we got to put a new one
47:56 in
47:56 uh hey uh sun department yeah we need
47:59 another sun in uh
48:00 in dome four five six three okay we'll
48:03 have it there
48:04 how fast you need it five minutes okay
48:06 good
48:08 and they just have a policy to let the
48:10 other one sit up there
48:12 why is the moon white why does it uh
48:15 lack any composition of earth yet the
48:17 going theory
48:18 among pop science addicts is that
48:21 because the guy created a simulation of
48:23 a gigantic earth killer
48:25 hitting the earth and spinning out part
48:28 of its debris into the moon
48:30 that's the way we believe the moon was
48:31 created which is absolute
48:33 bs okay and the big reason is is the
48:37 moon is so freaking far away that uh
48:40 the simulation that we showed at tv puts
48:42 the moon about you know 10 feet away
48:44 from earth
48:45 in the simulation when if you just think
48:47 of the fact that the earth is about
48:50 let's just say rounding up it's about 8
48:52 000 miles across
48:53 diameter wise and divide
48:57 237 by 8.
49:00 that's how many times you could put an
49:03 earth
49:04 between the earth and the moon the
49:07 moon's way out there man
49:09 by heliocentric pop science
49:14 but if you take a flat earth model and a
49:16 simulation model
49:17 and an instant earth model in a contact
49:19 lens
49:20 perhaps on a bigger ball so we see very
49:23 little curvature when we do all of our
49:24 laser experiments
49:26 thus catalyzing the relative
49:30 theory of where we are being relatively
49:32 flat
49:34 can you imagine that where a contact
49:36 lens on another big ball
49:37 that means heliocentric people are
49:39 partially correct
49:40 and flat earth people are partially
49:42 correct
49:44 was it that picard guy he took the hot
49:46 air balloon up
49:49 looked out his hot air balloon and said
49:51 it looks like a
49:54 a dome with upturned edges
50:00 no a disc sorry a disc with upturned
50:02 edges
50:03 is what he saw out the window perhaps
50:06 all of this gets to be like a 5d chess
50:10 experiment to say okay and let's just
50:13 say
50:13 we'll go back to that conversation
50:15 between two guys
50:17 who are working this place and they're
50:19 just like you know
50:21 longshoremen of the dome
50:24 but one kid's really green now he's
50:27 heard a little bit about this place but
50:28 let's just
50:29 get a job without knowing anything it's
50:30 a hollywood script where i'm using a
50:32 dumb kid
50:33 talking to a smart guy so i can
50:34 exhibition the technology for the
50:36 audience to hear
50:38 and you know he knows about his physical
50:40 composition because he went to grade
50:41 school
50:42 he gets in there at the job and he's
50:43 like okay maybe he's his son talking to
50:45 a father make it a little easier
50:46 so i might get close to but he won't be
50:48 qualified to take a job
50:49 he just simply says dad yep son
50:53 what's this whole thing about like what
50:54 are you guys doing inside this dome with
50:56 all these people in here
50:59 he said well son it's a really
51:02 it's a really deep answer best way to
51:05 describe it is we've got challenges for
51:07 all
51:07 different types of people inside this
51:09 dome
51:11 no matter where they are intellectually
51:13 no matter where they are physically
51:15 both physically as individuals and
51:17 physically geographically in this
51:19 experiment we have challenges for them
51:23 and we have computers and individuals
51:26 that are embedded with them
51:29 to collect the data so let us know
51:32 the kid says well why do you do it in
51:35 the first place i mean what are you
51:36 trying to find out
51:38 he says well we're trying to find out a
51:40 bunch of stuff we have some stuff on a
51:41 list we're trying to figure out
51:44 and we have this whole division that
51:46 tries to find new things that we've
51:48 never discovered before
51:50 to learn about ourselves that's why they
51:54 look like us
51:56 and the kid says well can i go down and
52:01 play around with him then he says well
52:04 only when you get older
52:06 because you have to be trained not to
52:08 reveal
52:10 what's going on because if these people
52:11 knew we were watching them
52:13 they would it would completely pollute
52:16 the experiment
52:17 and we'd have to kill every single
52:19 person inside this dome
52:21 if you reveal what was going on and
52:23 until you can understand and appreciate
52:26 and pass the training where you're
52:28 tempted
52:29 you're tempted by everything in your
52:32 soul
52:33 to give up a secret until you can be
52:36 purified of that process you can't go
52:38 down there
52:38 but i tell you what you can do
52:42 every once in a while we actually
52:46 take these vehicles inside
52:50 and they're invisible to these people
52:53 in most cases what do you mean most
52:57 cases
52:58 well for some reason some of them can
53:00 see us
53:01 and some of them can't but we take our
53:04 vehicles down there and you know what
53:06 they call us when we're inside those
53:07 vehicles
53:08 what dad they call us ufos
53:13 what's ufo stand for unidentified flying
53:17 object
53:19 wow we actually got bases in the bottom
53:22 of their oceans
53:25 that's where we go to to
53:30 to stage individuals that are actually
53:32 going to join the population
53:36 that way they don't see us necessarily
53:38 dropping off new resources
53:42 of course we're always studying the
53:43 health of the dome itself making sure
53:45 the oxygen is good
53:47 the water is where it should be but now
53:50 imagine
53:51 you pop out of the conversation
53:54 and part of the metrics of this entire
53:57 thing
53:57 is to experiment from them to us
54:01 which is basically racially species-wise
54:04 all
54:04 us they look just like us let's just say
54:07 within reason
54:09 obviously we would look a little bit
54:10 different than them because we're
54:12 making sweet love to each other and
54:14 they're doing the same outside
54:17 but perhaps their whole thing or not
54:19 their whole thing but a big part of it
54:20 is
54:22 they experiment with telling us who we
54:24 are
54:26 to see how that impacts our perception
54:28 of ourselves and thus how we
54:30 end up evolving within this experiment
54:34 they practice with a whole simulation
54:36 where
54:38 there's a god it's embedded into the
54:41 religions perhaps even
54:44 jesus christ and every other
54:48 deity of virgin birth death and
54:50 resurrection
54:52 like jesus the 27 or so versions of him
54:56 that have been told in different times
54:58 in different religions and different
54:59 species different
55:00 sorry races they're all real
55:05 those things really occurred this dude
55:08 was real
55:10 why was he able to do all the
55:11 experiments and or sorry miracles and
55:14 things that he did
55:16 because he came with equipment that
55:18 could do that or he understood
55:20 perhaps some greater truth of the
55:22 universe that is all-powerful
55:25 remember when you read in the bible that
55:26 says you know a person with
55:28 infinite faith can move a mountain just
55:31 by willing it to do so
55:34 perhaps that individual is one of them
55:36 our true
55:37 uninhibited unmanipulated unrestricted
55:40 self with pure history and not faux
55:43 history
55:44 is able to do such a thing or perhaps
55:46 like the star trek episode
55:48 i think with um i think it was next
55:52 generation
55:53 where they had that thing where someone
55:55 was pretending to be a deity and it was
55:57 terrorizing these people
55:59 and they uncovered that it was an alien
56:01 using a bunch of equipment from a
56:02 stealth ship in orbit
56:05 but the point is every once in a while
56:08 the gods come down
56:11 they experimented with that the leftover
56:13 history is where we get our religion
56:17 but as more mechanical devices came into
56:19 play to record history more accurately
56:21 like the printing press
56:24 eventually cameras
56:27 they don't do it anymore because it
56:28 would be then deduced and figured out
56:31 of where we are for now it's safe
56:33 because it turns into a fable
56:35 it turns into a fictitious thing
56:38 for a lot of us we still get the message
56:40 we still get the truth and the beauty of
56:42 these religions
56:44 but we don't necessarily know if we
56:46 believe it or not because we don't want
56:47 to be disingenuous to ourselves and
56:48 especially a creator if we happen to be
56:50 face to face at one point in time
56:53 they're studying perhaps those of us
56:55 that figure that exact thing out
56:58 and those that never figure it out and
57:01 there's benefits to both
57:04 the rapper hopson i think it says hopson
57:07 seven where he's walking in the desert
57:09 and he's having a conversation with god
57:12 it's it's one of the most touching
57:14 most powerful rap songs
57:17 i guess you could call it that it's
57:19 amazing it's more than that is why only
57:21 reason why i say it that way
57:23 he's arguing with god a little bit and
57:25 he's saying you know you gave me a brain
57:28 and this brain that you gave me makes me
57:30 think this is all fake
57:31 if it's all fake then what the hell am i
57:33 doing on earth
57:34 and at one point in the middle of the
57:36 song he says i'm [ __ ] done i'm
57:40 [ __ ] done
57:41 with this [ __ ] you need to come down
57:44 here
57:45 and straighten this out from my brain
57:48 i'm tired of this mess you've let the
57:51 devil run the world
57:53 and everyone's lying to me constantly so
57:55 how can i possibly take this religion
57:57 into my heart
57:58 because he did it one point that's the
57:59 first part of the rap he took it all
58:01 into his heart he believed it all
58:02 he took a hit on the chin for being
58:04 religious with his rapper bunnies
58:07 he got persecuted and then he
58:10 through his own intellect and through
58:12 his own research and deduction and
58:13 connections
58:14 decided jesus this is probably fake too
58:18 because nothing in this world is real i
58:20 mean no truths really exist except the
58:22 ones we hold in our hearts
58:24 5d chess 5d
58:28 chess man something for everyone no
58:30 matter how developed you are there's
58:32 something to challenge you
58:33 something to reward you something to
58:35 inspire you
58:36 there's failure and success at all
58:38 levels of
58:39 wealth all levels of spirituality
58:43 you will always in your life empty to
58:46 some extent
58:47 because there's always something that
58:49 you wish you had done that you never did
58:51 something you did wrong that you can't
58:53 write which equals regret
58:57 but it makes you who you are and
59:01 a lot of folks at the end of their life
59:02 will say you know what i didn't do
59:04 everything right i didn't get everything
59:06 experienced that i could have
59:07 experienced i wasn't as dedicated to
59:09 things i wanted that i should have been
59:12 but i wouldn't change a thing
59:16 and why because in the end they actually
59:19 ended up loving themselves
59:22 they ended up loving their lives they
59:24 end up loving every person they met
59:25 and they realized if they had changed
59:28 the price of tea in china
59:30 they wouldn't have met somebody that was
59:32 very important to them
59:34 it's all being observed it's all being
59:36 networked
59:38 now i don't think any of this not that
59:40 this really matters in this particular
59:42 conversation but i don't think any of
59:43 this really negates
59:44 a god by any means or a spiritual world
59:47 or what dreams might be
59:48 which is a playground of the spiritual
59:50 world that we get gifted with every day
59:55 that still might be a mystery for those
59:56 on the outside
59:59 or maybe it's not even a mystery like oh
60:00 yeah well god exists for sure
60:03 it's nothing that they think on average
60:05 some of them figure it out
60:07 but then they turn into hopsin in the
60:09 desert
60:11 tortured by their lucidity
60:14 the fact is in this world and i bet many
60:16 of you
60:18 know and i've said it a dozen times on
60:19 different shows but the more
60:21 intelligence you get the more
60:22 inquisitive you get
60:24 the more isolated you get when you try
60:27 to reach out and share your experiences
60:29 and thus grow your connections and grow
60:33 what you understand about the world and
60:35 let's just say
60:37 again we'll go to the trivial pursuit
60:40 game piece
60:40 the board game right it's the pie with i
60:43 believe at least six slices in it right
60:46 six categories of questions you'll be
60:48 asked
60:50 well you take one of them and you
60:52 research that thing to death
60:54 at the same exact time in a different
60:56 place on earth someone else that you're
60:57 going to meet
60:59 does another pie slice
61:02 and let's say there's not too many pie
61:04 slices but there's more than six for
61:06 sure
61:07 but if we could just bring let's say
61:08 there's 20 pieces 20
61:10 key core categories of being alive
61:15 of making connections if you bring all
61:18 20 people together
61:20 in a deep thoughts university go see the
61:23 store on deepthoughtsradio.com
61:26 we would have the whole perspective of
61:28 the entire
61:30 universe as it exists for us
61:34 and with those 20 pieces connected
61:37 there's an epiphany of
61:38 utter consciousness
61:42 it's almost like the old story of the
61:46 native americans that could not see the
61:48 boats coming in from europe because they
61:50 could not conceive of what a boat was
61:53 the shaman though the more enlightened
61:55 of them all
61:56 who had taken tremendous amounts of
61:59 ayahuasca
62:00 peyote and other hallucinogens
62:04 they could see it because their minds
62:06 were open
62:08 to abstract sight because they had seen
62:11 mother ayahuasca
62:13 they had seen kaleidoscopes swimming in
62:16 the sky
62:16 in broad daylight and so the boat wasn't
62:19 hard
62:20 for them to see and the way that the
62:22 fabled story goes is that the
62:24 shaman would tell the people right there
62:27 you see that thing
62:28 it's shaped like this it's shaped like
62:30 that a shape like this and all of a
62:31 sudden
62:32 the consciousness of an average native
62:35 american
62:36 which would be an average version of us
62:38 went oh yeah
62:40 i see it i didn't see it before and then
62:44 as they continued to visit the americas
62:48 everyone eventually could see the boat
62:52 before it landed so instead of appearing
62:56 like gods out of nowhere when they
62:58 disembarked
63:00 everyone was like waving at him before
63:01 they landed
63:03 all right what if that's the way we
63:06 see ufos as douglas adams alluded to in
63:09 his
63:10 third book ford prefix parks the uh
63:15 the spaceship right next to the
63:17 bleachers at a
63:18 soccer game slash football game for
63:20 europeans
63:22 and he goes and picks up arthur den
63:25 and he says well where'd you put the
63:26 ship and he goes right there he goes my
63:28 god
63:29 you put that thing in plain sight how
63:30 come no one sees it and he goes
63:33 because they uh they can't conceive of
63:35 it so they don't see it
63:38 brilliant utterly freaking brilliant
63:42 what if ufos are flying everywhere all
63:45 the time
63:46 and the only people that even have the
63:49 the inclination to point a camera at one
63:51 or
63:52 say they've seen one of the folks that
63:53 can for whatever reason through their
63:56 serendipitous experiences in life can
63:59 see it they're the modern-day shamans
64:01 there's a real um i was i'm reading one
64:05 of
64:06 graham hancock's book on this sort of
64:08 ayahuasca experiences
64:10 my close friend carla's actually had
64:13 them
64:14 the question is is are you seeing
64:16 something inside your mind's eye
64:18 that is being chemically created in your
64:20 mind
64:22 or are you seeing a real entity that
64:24 just simply exists around us and is
64:26 simply unlocked by the drug combination
64:28 to get your brain to fire in a
64:30 particular way that kisses your soul
64:32 in such a level of detail that you can
64:34 see her
64:36 and i'm going to tell you i think it's
64:37 the latter
64:39 and why is that because mother ayahuasca
64:42 has a name
64:43 if someone claims to have the true
64:45 hallucinate hallucination experience by
64:48 taking this
64:49 substance they all see her
64:53 some of them see her fairly identically
64:55 and some of them see or see her
64:56 differently
64:59 first time i dropped acid and sat in the
65:02 backyard my buddy richard
65:04 you know i said this story several times
65:05 he points up at the sky and he goes what
65:07 do you see
65:09 and i see the sacred geometry symbol of
65:11 life
65:13 in the freaking sky and he goes i see
65:16 the same exact thing
65:18 we even drew it yeah you see that yep
65:21 concentric circles inside of each other
65:24 we were seeing the same
65:26 hallucination ain't that interesting
65:31 now of course someone could biologically
65:33 explain that perhaps by saying that the
65:36 the cellular structure of the visual
65:38 cortex of which we only use five percent
65:41 and is limited to five percent by a
65:43 genetic blocker a protein blocker
65:45 that prohibits our data coming in from
65:47 our eyes
65:48 from crossing over four and a half
65:50 slices of our visual cortex
65:53 i guess it's ten percent right there
65:55 seems to be a reason why we have been
65:57 engineered not to see most of the light
66:00 that we
66:00 ingest hmm
66:05 now it could be way more complicated
66:07 than this
66:08 in terms of our existence
66:11 i'm just going to throw a funny one at
66:13 you some people say they see bigfoots
66:17 and imagine that and people have
66:20 suggested that bigfoots actually live in
66:22 a different dimension
66:23 and only sometimes cross over into our
66:26 dimension
66:27 it's always in the middle of the ozarks
66:28 or something right
66:30 never just happens in other than the
66:32 beastie boy video for triple trouble
66:34 which everyone needs to see they don't
66:36 end up in downtown new york
66:40 interesting and that could be
66:43 that actually doesn't make any sense at
66:45 all obviously in one dimension new york
66:46 could be a forest and the other
66:48 dimension it could be a concrete jungle
66:51 but let me just throw this at you as a
66:54 silly example of a
66:55 bigger concept that might indeed be true
66:59 those who take dmt say that they run
67:02 into
67:03 grey aliens and you get assigned a great
67:05 alien and every time you take dmt
67:07 the same grey alien will escort you
67:09 around that
67:10 that other dimension but that they can
67:13 show up in the room
67:14 there's i read a book on dmt the dream
67:16 molecule
67:17 and it said that people would i think it
67:19 was a woman
67:20 that she said she did it in a living
67:22 room and all of a sudden the room was
67:23 full of grays
67:25 but not like feral grays or but really
67:27 civilized
67:28 living in this same environment that she
67:30 was in and that she got the distinct
67:32 sort of disdain of perhaps like
67:34 aristocratic scumbags that are like
67:36 get that scum back out of here they
67:38 shouldn't be here you know they were
67:39 like get out or out here you know
67:40 because she shouldn't be in our
67:41 dimension
67:42 like angry like this happens every day
67:46 but what if a bigfoot is simply an
67:47 object or i'm sorry a being that's
67:49 living in
67:50 some wild literally in the wild
67:56 place where perhaps because of their
67:57 consciousness perhaps because of a
67:59 mechanism
68:00 some sort of thing that we're doing in
68:02 our world like some
68:04 impulsive energy that wiggles him into
68:06 existence
68:08 he's there you see him you see her
68:11 whatever it is
68:12 and then they managed to get pulled out
68:15 by the dome owners
68:16 oh crap this one's crossed over get them
68:19 out of there okay great
68:20 and so you can't find them but they do
68:22 make footprints on the ground
68:24 people simulate it after they see it
68:26 because they want evidence and proof
68:28 they don't have any let's just say so
68:30 they fake it on the ground
68:32 to get the story to go but the 1967
68:34 footage of the female supposedly
68:36 looks fake as hell to me but you know
68:38 what if it's real
68:40 this would be a fun way to explain it
68:42 wouldn't it
68:44 now i'm going to go back to earth
68:49 and let me suggest a couple things
68:53 now again most of us are absolutely
68:56 positively
68:57 mystified by the fact that every single
69:00 human or as a cork would say human
69:04 who seems to run this place whoever
69:06 becomes a president a chancellor or
69:08 prime minister
69:09 and all of their subjects are all
69:12 evil crazy people that do
69:15 all kinds of disgusting rituals they
69:18 treat us like meat
69:20 they treat us like toys our children
69:22 like toys
69:24 why are they always unanimously that way
69:27 i mean the big boys there's a lot of
69:28 folks underneath that are okay
69:31 but why are they always douche bags
69:35 that don't seem to care about humanity
69:37 whatsoever i mean you never
69:38 find a good leader as far as i'm
69:40 concerned
69:41 anywhere in the world i'm sure they're
69:44 out there but
69:45 you know why are they so rare
69:48 like bigfoot well those could be our
69:51 visitors
69:51 who again are living at a westworld
69:53 thing
69:55 they want to engage in all their
69:57 perverse
69:58 fantasies in our world they destroy our
70:01 children
70:02 because they don't care
70:05 it's not even just a my uh like an r
70:07 factor
70:08 scientist who's like of course i
70:09 experiment on you i must learn this
70:11 right it's not like that at all
70:13 it's a gunslinging
70:16 brothel they do anything they want
70:20 there's no reset for us we just simply
70:22 die
70:24 and you know our soul goes and does its
70:25 thing
70:27 hopefully they can't control our souls
70:28 oh my god could you imagine
70:31 oof you'd be trapped in this prison
70:33 planet
70:34 holy [ __ ] it'd be bad and then there's
70:37 the other tier
70:39 which is your more quiet folks
70:42 that may be in control the only time
70:46 they interact with us
70:49 is when they need to nudge us this way
70:51 nudge us that way
70:54 but perhaps they don't do much at all
70:57 and they make sure the guests don't get
70:58 too crazy
71:00 because again compared to westworld if
71:02 this was the case
71:03 this is more like paintball you go into
71:06 paintball and you get shot once
71:08 and they hit you and the ref goes yep
71:10 you're hit
71:11 get out you got to hold your hand amount
71:14 you know no one shoots you anymore and
71:15 you walk to the edge of the game and you
71:17 have to wait till the game's over to go
71:18 back in again
71:19 sort of a birth death resurrection thing
71:21 right
71:23 so you can't have in our world some
71:25 crazy nut
71:27 that pushes the button and launches a
71:29 nuclear war and kills the whole dome off
71:31 that's not allowed
71:33 but say someone actually achieved that
71:35 level of power
71:36 and wanted to do that and so the dome
71:39 owners got to come in and spank some uh
71:42 spanx some guests out of their
71:45 annual pass let's just put that way i
71:48 think that the more that you study the
71:50 world
71:51 and again you bump up against these
71:54 these pre-dynastic rocks in egypt these
71:58 stones that have been cut to a level of
71:59 precision
72:00 that today's engineers would literally
72:02 cry
72:03 if they were forced to make this thing
72:05 accurate otherwise they were going to
72:06 die
72:06 their family was going to get
72:07 slaughtered because they know they can't
72:08 do it but they know
72:10 in their heart of hearts that supposedly
72:14 a civilization 30 40 50 000 years ago
72:17 did do it and they're like oh christ
72:20 well how the hell do these people do it
72:21 and i can't deal with modern equipment
72:24 once you start seeing those things
72:28 there's just an impossibility that you
72:32 start feeling
72:33 well how's that even possible how is it
72:36 possible that all these
72:38 rocks exist that prove a whole
72:42 slew of historical evolution in
72:46 engineering
72:47 right think about it how
72:50 this is subtract the pre-dynastic
72:52 knowledge
72:54 and say when was the first diamond bit
72:56 circular saw ever used
72:58 in human history i don't know the answer
73:00 to that when's the first time
73:02 someone could borrow a hole in a level 8
73:04 piece of granite or
73:06 limestone 12 inches down inside of a
73:09 rock in less than 60 seconds
73:12 when was the first time we ever did that
73:13 in modern day history
73:16 well then how the hell was you know
73:18 let's just say let's just say for
73:20 instance it was 1950 or something like
73:22 that
73:23 we're pretty sure that this technology
73:26 ceased to exist
73:28 about the time the pre-dynastic era
73:30 ended which would have been
73:32 potentially again 30 to 40 to 50 000
73:35 years ago
73:35 and so we're talking about another 30 to
73:38 40 000
73:39 years that must take place before the
73:41 first circular saw exists
73:43 that can cut a level eight rock so
73:47 you take pre-dynastic rock let's just
73:48 say we can finally say
73:50 you know we can't because they're gonna
73:52 they protect this information
73:54 keep telling you everything's 3200 bc or
73:57 whatever
73:58 let's say we know that this thing was
74:01 created in
74:02 35 000 bc or more
74:06 then we have to dial back another 50 000
74:09 years roughly
74:10 to get to enough time for man to evolve
74:13 up
74:14 naturally to find out this equipment and
74:16 for some reason the equipment's gone
74:18 for some reason a society that that
74:20 seemed to have the
74:22 ability to create stone to look just
74:24 like humans just like
74:26 lions just like jekylls with rib cages
74:28 and everything
74:30 they lack the ability to transcribe in
74:33 language
74:34 either relief in a rock or a papyr or a
74:38 painting on a wall
74:39 any of these other devices that made
74:41 their world possible
74:44 and again they chose to live literally
74:48 in a stone age not the typical
74:51 neanderthal stone age but building all
74:54 of their
74:55 homes temples hospitals
74:59 power plants tombs the mastabas
75:03 all out of stone they're like big stone
75:05 too it's crazy
75:07 what's nuts about it is that when you
75:09 see the size of some of the stones that
75:10 they
75:11 carved on average to create not only
75:14 giant stones within the pyramids
75:16 but the but the stones that create these
75:19 these caverns and the ground
75:21 they're much bigger than the stones that
75:23 were in the pyramid
75:25 and there's plenty of other locations
75:27 i've shared with you that have
75:28 100 ton rocks but the doorways are still
75:33 for about a six foot person on average
75:38 okay why so big bro
75:42 what was your what was your goal there
75:44 man
75:45 do you have stone envy from some other
75:46 civilization
75:48 was it a presence attack on anyone that
75:51 came to visit you
75:53 why so big man and why
75:56 dig into the ground in the first place
75:59 was it because it was
76:02 naturally friendly in terms of
76:06 temperature say it was cooler in the
76:09 summertime
76:10 because in the equator again i don't
76:12 think the pyramids will ever cover with
76:13 snow
76:14 it just doesn't happen in the location
76:16 of the earth
76:18 tilt or no tilt and whether or not you
76:21 believe
76:22 that the uh poles have actually done
76:25 violent switches were again what was
76:28 that
76:28 the 1392 map shows the antarctica
76:31 as a continent without any snow on it
76:34 okay
76:35 well that would suggest that man existed
76:37 at that point in time
76:40 and the things did perhaps snow in egypt
76:42 i just think that regardless of what you
76:44 believe
76:45 no one built pyramids in the middle of
76:48 the snow
76:48 so if it was covered with snow and ice
76:50 and icebergs and all
76:51 that kind of stuff and they simply
76:53 didn't build there at that time
76:56 and regardless of how massive and
76:58 formidable those pyramids are
77:00 a glacier could knock those things over
77:02 in two seconds
77:03 right we got glaciers that are miles
77:05 thick man
77:06 it would literally crush those rocks
77:08 down to sand
77:11 well they seem to be fine don't they
77:13 there's the theory of the ice ages which
77:15 i dislike
77:16 very very much in their totalit
77:19 totality of their theory to be wiping
77:22 off the entire planet so instead of mud
77:24 floods it's like ice floods you know
77:26 whatever
77:28 i think that's a convenient way to ins
77:30 to install an intellectual barrier
77:33 from reaching beyond the ice ages to
77:35 discover anything
77:37 man will say ice age and it's just like
77:40 saying um
77:41 some sort of thought police thing to say
77:44 you're not to think beyond this point
77:46 but what if that narrative is simply
77:48 inserted by the dome owners to create
77:50 such a mental
77:51 frailty in man and folks like
77:55 us who think past those things
77:58 we literally say that didn't happen
78:01 to that extent sure sure yeah
78:04 glaciers exist today and glaciers roll
78:06 rocks and we see the
78:08 similar rocks in different places on
78:10 earth so we always attributed to
78:12 ice as if no other methodology could use
78:14 it and
78:15 to the extent that these rocks couldn't
78:17 be moved around by other means to give
78:20 an illusion
78:22 those rocks that we blame on ice ages
78:24 could be created
78:26 billions of years ago and simply be
78:28 right there
78:29 and then you misinterpret them and
78:31 associate them with other rocks that are
78:33 more recently created
78:34 to create a single theory that the whole
78:36 world was
78:37 rolled over by glaciers all the way down
78:40 to egypt of course
78:42 absurd there is in my opinion
78:45 we're so quick to jump onto
78:49 answers for mystery questions
78:53 and then we lock them down because we
78:55 don't want to think anymore
78:57 that's painful thinking painful thought
79:00 process
79:02 i forgot who said it but i might have
79:05 been someone like a steve jobs or
79:06 someone
79:08 but they said
79:11 you know that the amount of frontiers in
79:13 technology
79:15 had really come to a very intense point
79:18 at one point where we know there's more
79:21 well we know
79:22 technically speaking there's infinite
79:24 frontiers for technological discoveries
79:26 and advancements
79:27 but we also know that there's moore's
79:29 law where we have limitations to how far
79:31 we can take any one invention
79:33 and exponentially improve it before we
79:36 run into a threshold where
79:38 mere mass of the universe and energy
79:42 organization
79:42 universe will limit us from going any
79:44 further without massive advancements and
79:46 all the technology that moves electrons
79:49 or other things right
79:51 and i got a little discouraged by that
79:53 because once someone tells you that
79:55 there's a limit
79:56 and you believe it which at the time i
79:58 did you tend to kind of give up
80:00 on trying within those regions because
80:02 you're accepting another man's
80:04 fatigue as your own inspiration
80:09 you don't want to do that you want to
80:11 stay alive
80:12 stay vigilant you want to be like jack
80:15 parsons
80:16 who wants to go into outer space at a
80:19 time when no one had ever
80:20 left the atmosphere
80:23 right 1914 the dude's born
80:27 the wright brothers were doing a little
80:28 bit planes were getting up there but man
80:30 we were nowhere close to leaving
80:32 lit atmosphere we were nowhere close to
80:34 getting to an unoxygenated
80:36 level of atmospheric altitude
80:40 but he still figured out a way to do it
80:42 because he wasn't going to give up
80:44 now we don't need his satan worshipping
80:46 in our life but uh
80:48 shy of that let's just use our human
80:50 minds and
80:51 get creative i think there are
80:55 an infinite amount of frontiers to
80:58 conceptualize
81:00 so many of the unanswered questions that
81:02 we have simply accepted
81:04 so many limitations that we adopt
81:07 you know equations like e equals m c
81:09 squared is utter
81:10 poison for the mind it tells you that
81:14 you can't go faster than the speed of
81:15 light
81:17 well boy if you believe that don't even
81:19 try
81:20 it's like the patent office telling the
81:21 wright brothers that you can't fly so
81:23 we're not giving you the patent
81:25 what do i always tell you guys whatever
81:28 you practice is what you're good at
81:31 period that's why a lot of perversion
81:34 starts in this world
81:35 so make sure you police what you
81:37 practice
81:39 ingesting a bunch of propaganda makes
81:41 you really
81:42 a surf to the propaganda you become a
81:44 stockholm
81:45 syndrome to the propaganda and i know
81:48 that we're in an age where propaganda is
81:50 mostly political
81:52 but many people who watch the show
81:53 religiously understand that it is in
81:55 every corner
81:56 of reality they're always trying to shut
81:59 down your mind
82:01 and part of it starts when you're a
82:03 child because your parents believe that
82:04 you don't have the intellectual capacity
82:06 to conceive of anything complex and so
82:10 they satiate you
82:12 a lot of parents don't know the answers
82:14 to things because they're still unknowns
82:16 to the entire universe
82:17 but instead of imbuing a child with the
82:20 notion of
82:21 well you know what we really don't know
82:23 but maybe that's something that you
82:24 could
82:24 go find out and the kid's like seven
82:27 years old
82:28 going okay dad give me the books
82:31 all right son daughter do it
82:35 i'll help you i'll help you find as much
82:37 as i can and maybe we'll just go find
82:39 some people that are
82:40 current experts at this that have open
82:41 minds and well
82:43 we'll ask them the very magical question
82:46 which is
82:47 well if we wanted to
82:50 advance the theory of potentially moving
82:52 mass faster than the speed of light
82:54 where might you go if someone gives us a
82:57 good answer we'll follow that path
82:58 if they give us the cliche answer we'll
83:00 just put a little x over their name on
83:02 the sheet and say
83:03 of no help to our future endeavors
83:06 so the final question which i have
83:09 proposed in different episodes from time
83:10 to time but not for
83:12 several years is the following
83:16 what if we prove we're inside this
83:18 instant earth experiment
83:20 a flat earth which is simply a petri
83:23 dish on top of a bigger
83:24 round ball or whatever
83:28 what if we discover that they exist and
83:30 we prove it
83:31 and we teach the rest of the world that
83:33 that's the case
83:35 revealing the proof maybe it's some
83:37 experiment someone could do in their
83:38 kitchen
83:40 maybe it's something to do on a saturday
83:42 afternoon looking at the sun
83:43 who knows there's something that reveals
83:47 that it's there that we're indeed inside
83:50 of an experiment
83:51 then what happens do they come get us
83:56 do they come get us do they kill us all
83:59 what happens are we graduated out of the
84:02 dome individually
84:03 or they come and get us and say okay
84:05 dude that was pretty good you figured
84:06 this out
84:07 all right well don't [ __ ] it up for
84:08 everybody here we're spending trillions
84:10 of dollars on this whole thing or
84:11 monetary units of our kind or whatever
84:14 putting a lot of time in this
84:16 you get to leave you gotta leave you
84:19 gotta go
84:21 and you have some mysterious death or
84:22 something or you vanish
84:24 you know there's been so many people
84:25 that um
84:27 you know said they they left notes
84:29 behind and they told their families that
84:30 they were going to
84:32 get on a spaceship and take off and
84:36 a lot of the profiles these individuals
84:38 are they were they were ingenious people
84:42 maybe they figured it out maybe they're
84:45 simply selected
84:47 maybe a bunch of the alien visits that
84:49 we have where people get probed and all
84:51 this other stuff
84:52 where supposedly our dna is stolen to
84:55 make babies
84:57 oh maybe they're trying to figure out
84:58 where we are genetically
85:01 they just come get a little bit of
85:02 sample from us
85:05 don't know it's interesting though isn't
85:07 it
85:08 hopefully this was a fun little
85:09 experiment for your mind
85:12 and hopefully you saw that there are
85:15 potentially a limitless amount of
85:17 branches that come off this theory
85:19 regardless if they actually associate
85:21 with my my overhanging
85:24 assertion that this might be an instant
85:25 earth creation
85:27 relative to our timeline
85:31 it'd be interesting to find a moment in
85:33 history
85:34 where all the stars aligned
85:37 where we could actually sense that it
85:40 was a logical point where this could
85:42 have all started
85:44 what would that mean well
85:47 just a point where perhaps society isn't
85:52 littered with magellans crossing oceans
85:55 perhaps where evolution as as far as
85:58 man's concern seemed to flatline
86:01 meaning it was a good point to start
86:04 be a fun movie wouldn't it be a lot of
86:07 work man
86:07 but it'd be fun in the end if you could
86:08 pull it off someone mysterious you know
86:11 someone senses all this data and
86:13 he's living a torture life and he's
86:16 torturing his family with it like close
86:17 encounters and then eventually
86:19 he finds it he finds the wall of the
86:22 dome or whatever and
86:24 it's nothing like he thought he sails to
86:27 antarctica instead of being a cold
86:30 ice barrier which is what you and i
86:32 believe is down there
86:34 because a lot of folks haven't been
86:35 there actually
86:38 had the chance to pass messages to a guy
86:40 that actually flew over
86:41 one of the edges and my good friend
86:44 nicole actually did a tour down there as
86:47 a geologist
86:50 but perhaps they took her somewhere else
86:52 you know who knows
86:54 but they find it and they get out
86:58 and i think that would be actually a
86:59 great act one instead of
87:01 the final act of the film and then the
87:03 movie is them being on the other side
87:05 and
87:06 if you had the guts to write that then
87:08 you'd probably sell your script pretty
87:09 fast
87:10 and then for whatever reason at the end
87:12 they want to go back in
87:14 because they realize they don't belong
87:15 on the outside
87:17 so they engage in some maybe some highly
87:20 experimental mental reconditioning so
87:22 they don't remember being on the outside
87:24 and they no longer lust for that
87:29 that vision of the outside you imagine
87:31 that
87:32 but if you had a fantasy of being in
87:34 some simulation of your own
87:37 you get a copy of the universe and you
87:40 think that's what you want
87:43 and you get into that world and for
87:44 maybe even a few hundred years maybe
87:46 even a thousand years you have a really
87:48 good time
87:49 but eventually you realize that living
87:51 in god mode
87:52 where you get to control everything it's
87:54 your little instance of the universe not
87:56 hurting anybody
87:58 but you realize it's fruitless
88:01 like the twilight zone about mind over
88:02 matter you put it all back the way it
88:05 was
88:07 because that is truly the divine formula
88:11 and you realize and appreciate like so
88:13 many kids who want to rebel against
88:14 their parents until a certain age
88:16 when they realize their parents actually
88:17 do know something
88:19 they go back for advice they go back for
88:21 help
88:23 same thing they go back inside the dome
88:26 recondition not to lust for that ever
88:28 again that would be one of the
88:29 experiment
88:30 finales which is to say okay i'm never
88:33 going back in here because i figured it
88:35 out
88:36 but it's important that when i go back
88:38 in to the real universe
88:40 that at no point do i have that thought
88:43 you become the
88:44 the host inside westworld that doesn't
88:47 look like anything to me
88:50 and you love the minute the minutia of
88:52 the universe it's rewarding and
88:54 wonderful
88:56 the simplicity of the formula is the
88:58 brilliant part of the formula
89:01 [Music]
