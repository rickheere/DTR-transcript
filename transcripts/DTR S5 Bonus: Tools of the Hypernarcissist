00:28 me
00:30 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen
00:33 i am not sure exactly where i'm going to
00:35 er this episode because
00:36 we're right on top of the tesla episode
00:38 at this point
00:41 if you've seen the title it's probably
00:42 um
00:44 a little confusing or you're kind of
00:46 like
00:47 what's this all about this is a phrase
00:50 that a good friend of mine who smokes on
00:51 this patio with me
00:53 weekly not uh by daily
00:57 said and um
01:01 i said dude wait one second let me write
01:03 this down
01:04 because this is fantastic
01:08 and this episode is going to be about
01:09 sort of the diseased minds that we have
01:12 today i don't necessarily like doing
01:15 these episodes but
01:18 i thought that it would um be a tool for
01:21 us to use
01:23 to talk about the tool that they use
01:26 and it's called the the tools of hyper
01:28 narcissism
01:31 my good friend has been as
01:34 as his own in his own words he goes i've
01:36 been studying narcissism
01:38 for months if not years now but recently
01:42 really looking into it
01:45 and he said this brilliant word of hyper
01:47 narcissism which just means
01:49 super duper narcissism right
01:53 and he gave an example something that
01:55 really happened in his life
01:57 and i think he utterly nailed it and i
02:00 mentioned it to a close friend of mine
02:02 and um got the reaction that i had
02:06 from her and so i was like all right
02:08 we're making an episode about this one
02:11 he had a family gathering
02:14 with his parents he's about my age his
02:17 parents are much older
02:19 they're all settled in enjoying their
02:20 life and he has a
02:23 family member that came over and brought
02:26 her dog younger mid-20s
02:30 girl brings her dog from her house
02:34 to his house with uh their parents and
02:37 stuff it's actually the whole event
02:38 happened at his parents
02:41 and the dog uh
02:44 was barking constantly anytime someone
02:46 left the room and then walked into the
02:48 room the dog barked
02:50 extremely annoying of course there's two
02:53 types of parents ones that actually do
02:55 their job ones that don't
02:56 there's two types of pet owners ones
02:58 that raise their dogs
03:00 and ones that don't ones that think that
03:03 you know the most annoying children are
03:04 the
03:05 funniest things in the world and other
03:07 ones realize that if they don't gain
03:08 some
03:10 etiquette in this world they're not
03:11 going very far
03:14 so he turns to the relative and he goes
03:17 is this gonna
03:18 is this dog gonna bark every single time
03:21 someone walks in the room
03:24 and then the
03:27 what we call the social justice warrior
03:31 or the triggered girl
03:35 uses the dog and
03:38 flies into hysterics apparently for real
03:42 and just you know how dare you the greta
03:44 line right
03:45 greta uses this too she uses her own
03:47 tool
03:48 of hyper narcissism
03:52 and then he had to like fight back in
03:55 the conversation say you know you're not
03:56 going to talk to me like this
03:58 in my parents house man you're a junior
04:01 i'm a senior
04:04 and what's with the notion that you can
04:06 just bring a dog over to someone else's
04:08 home
04:10 we have valuables all over this house
04:12 it's not a pet house
04:13 it's not a dog house we don't know what
04:16 your dog's gonna do
04:17 it's a huge assumption on your part to
04:20 bring
04:20 your dog and even though it's the cutest
04:22 thing in the world to you and
04:24 nobody dislikes dogs you just don't
04:27 bring over your dog from your house to
04:29 someone else's house without checking it
04:30 out
04:31 maybe they did have a dog maybe that dog
04:33 would hate that other dog and eat it up
04:35 maybe they have cats and you bring a dog
04:38 over and the cats are going to get all
04:39 traumatized and ptsd then that's not
04:41 even a joke
04:43 the cats could interpret it completely
04:44 horrible that they brought over
04:46 a killer who knows we don't we don't
04:49 know how to talk to cats right
04:52 and he said you know it's just one of
04:54 these tools of hyper narcissism
04:57 she was trying to use her dog which
05:00 generally most people don't have any
05:02 problem with dogs this is a small dog
05:04 it's not some ferocious pit bull or
05:06 something
05:07 but she's trying to leverage the dog in
05:09 the conversation to just simply win
05:12 in the conversation to create like a
05:16 kind of a warm fuzzy object that you
05:18 can't criticize
05:20 so this person if they take it wherever
05:22 they take it
05:23 you can't see anything in their mind
05:26 the narcissist minds and the hyper
05:28 narcissist mind
05:30 you can't say anything and isn't that
05:33 the world today
05:35 greta thundberg right
05:39 the most unfortunate genetic accidents
05:41 on planet earth greta
05:44 she's being manipulated by george soros
05:46 directly and all of his handlers
05:49 either she is one of the most conniving
05:51 little girls on planet earth
05:52 meaning she is actually intelligent or
05:55 she's
05:56 being exploited for her total lack of
05:58 intelligence
06:00 dragging around her climate change thing
06:02 around the world
06:04 saying ridiculous lines in public
06:08 and let's just say you believe in
06:09 climate change and you're very angry at
06:11 me saying this well let's just back up
06:13 on that real quick
06:14 a little digression here for your
06:17 righteous triggered mind
06:19 greta's employers are the ones that
06:21 decided
06:24 what power sources we use in this world
06:27 they chose oil they chose electricity
06:30 generated by
06:32 nuclear power plants coal plants no one
06:36 seems to have a problem with
06:37 hydroelectric but then america isn't
06:38 allowed to build hydroelectric anymore
06:40 because somebody infiltrated the
06:42 legislation in 1973 and banned them
06:45 so all the ones that exist can continue
06:47 going like hoover dam and that kind of
06:48 stuff
06:49 we can't build anymore utterly absurd
06:54 what do we get we get crappy
06:57 solar panels and crappy windmills
07:02 wind farms do they work sure
07:06 are they efficient not really they
07:08 aren't it's better than nothing
07:11 but we've got all kinds of machines that
07:13 do amazing things we have these wave
07:15 machines that can we can put off the
07:16 coast
07:17 but if we would just get real with
07:20 electricity
07:21 go back to tesla's tower drag it out of
07:23 the sky for nothing
07:25 right we wouldn't need any
07:28 stuff build a geothermal plant properly
07:32 we wouldn't need any of this stuff if
07:34 you built it properly
07:37 but the hyper narcissist
07:41 how many times have you seen someone
07:43 post something in social media that says
07:46 if you love jesus
07:49 you'll share this post hyper narcissism
07:55 you gotta stop your day now
07:58 and re-share someone else's post
08:01 or you don't like jesus it's sort of
08:04 what they're saying
08:05 and there's every flavor of that if you
08:07 don't like the military or if you like
08:08 the military you'll share this if you
08:10 like this little kid if you want this
08:12 kid not to die of cancer
08:14 then you'll re-share this post
08:19 it's it's just awful
08:23 awful human behavior isn't it
08:28 but isn't it interesting that once that
08:30 pattern was taught
08:31 to a bunch of morons they do it
08:33 constantly
08:35 right it's not just you know it's it's
08:37 well in my feed it'll be that one person
08:39 that does it all the time
08:43 and i wonder how many people actually
08:45 repost it i mean it's really just kind
08:47 of a first
08:48 day rookie move of a social media
08:51 wannabe you know
08:55 but look at all of the hype the tools
08:58 that they've created for their hyper
08:59 narcissism
09:01 covet is the tool of a hypo narcissism
09:04 you can't cure covid
09:08 with hydrochloroquine and
09:11 uh zinc and a z-pack even though it
09:13 works 100 of the time
09:15 you're not allowed to say that because
09:17 they have to hang on to their
09:19 their suffering right
09:23 one of the things i mentioned in my
09:24 cancer episode is that
09:26 one of the obstacles i never knew
09:28 existed was that some people just want
09:30 to die
09:31 of whatever they've got they want to
09:34 leave the world it's sort of a passive
09:37 suicidal methodology
09:41 they're friends i've had an
09:42 ex-girlfriend of mine who literally
09:46 bottled up the suffering of her good
09:48 friend who had breast cancer
09:50 forbid her friend from hearing any cures
09:53 of any kind for that particular instance
09:56 because she wanted to bottle up the
09:58 tears of her friend
09:59 and put it all over social media
10:01 constantly to have a bunch of
10:02 conversations about
10:04 you should feel sorry for me because my
10:06 friend over here is dying of
10:07 breast cancer it's the
10:12 you know munchausen by proxy situation
10:15 except it's a friend
10:18 unbelievable
10:21 the one girlfriend listened to me cured
10:24 her friend
10:24 stage four six months to live literally
10:27 got the six months to live thing
10:31 um and i took it to the next club i said
10:33 look this one
10:34 cured her friend who's way off way worse
10:36 off than your friend
10:38 but boy that that other one was just
10:40 right up there right when her friend
10:41 died it was just
10:42 a post post post post
10:46 she turned her friend into a tool of
10:48 hyper narcissism
10:50 pay attention to me because this other
10:52 thing's occurring
10:54 how upset do you think greta would be if
10:56 she'd ever ever like everybody did
10:58 everything that she said
11:00 overnight climate change is resolved
11:02 somehow
11:03 and she never got to get in front of a
11:04 camera and she had to go to school for
11:06 the first time in her life and actually
11:08 learn something
11:09 a 15 year old christ almighty got
11:11 t-shirts that are older than
11:13 greta but the world's out of control
11:17 and you know i think that i think the
11:20 real um
11:20 issue that we're dealing with or one of
11:22 the major issues we're dealing with is
11:25 in the past
11:29 we didn't have so many mentally ill
11:31 people
11:33 and so we didn't have to fix everybody
11:35 we didn't have to ask anybody to change
11:37 their behavior much
11:39 you always have one or two in your town
11:41 or whatever your family
11:42 whatever but you know it's sort of like
11:45 you're not messing with
11:47 the rest of the world you're just
11:48 walking down the sidewalk
11:50 talking to somebody that's not there
11:53 we do what we can to help so people
11:56 again don't want to help
11:58 it's annoying because now we have
12:02 armies of mentally ill people and it's
12:05 so
12:05 efficiently
12:08 [Music]
12:09 executed at this point that it seems
12:12 like there's something in the water
12:14 doesn't it
12:15 and it's almost an agenda is in the
12:17 water it's so bizarre it's like
12:19 they just watch too much news too much
12:22 fake news
12:23 propaganda and i think that
12:27 you know why i made an episode about
12:29 being offended
12:31 the world was which was just like five
12:33 years ago
12:35 the world was still messed up and all
12:37 these things that we're discovering
12:38 today that are messed up or
12:39 were in you know full swing without
12:42 anyone getting caught
12:45 but i said you know one of the things
12:47 about being offended
12:50 is the extortion of emotion out of other
12:54 people
12:55 if i can convince you that you've
12:57 offended me in the traditional sense of
12:58 the
12:59 non-lucid person then i get to
13:03 you know get something out of you i mean
13:06 how many times you've been in a
13:07 relationship right
13:10 and you said something wrong you did
13:11 something wrong you weren't where you're
13:13 supposed to be
13:14 whatever you screwed someone over in the
13:16 relationship
13:17 and then that person is hurt obviously
13:20 by your behavior they're mad at you as
13:22 what's really the case
13:24 they're sad that you're not who they
13:26 thought you were
13:27 your word doesn't seem to mean much at
13:29 that particular point
13:32 and depending on how you apologize and
13:33 whatever some people
13:35 um maybe it's through a two-step process
13:40 randomly to solve the problem like the
13:42 person was just going to eat it and move
13:43 on and then either leave you
13:45 or stay with you and go okay well they
13:47 just do this weird thing but one person
13:49 said let me take you to dinner i'll make
13:51 it up to you take you to dinner i'll
13:52 make it up to you i'll give you a back
13:53 massage i'll make it up to you make it
13:55 up to you
13:56 and then it was like that was really
13:58 nice the dinner was really good the back
13:59 massage was really good or whatever it
14:01 is right
14:03 and they're like if i get offended again
14:06 i get to get all that again and so what
14:09 they do
14:10 is they turn into a big soft shell
14:13 crab and anything that happens to them
14:15 hurts them
14:18 and that's when you'll find out who the
14:19 other dude's made out of or the other
14:20 girls made out of
14:23 because you gotta tame that let me tell
14:26 you
14:28 but sadly society has been rigged
14:32 to respond to triggeredness right look
14:35 at all
14:35 and it's happening at the corporate
14:37 level this this cancel culture
14:39 thing is way way bigger i think than
14:43 most human beings realize
14:47 by a corporation you know deciding to
14:50 remove a show from tv
14:52 because it has stuff from the past
14:55 that's offensive today because today is
14:58 just like
14:58 ridiculous right
15:02 it teaches society how to behave and if
15:05 you think that a corporation is actually
15:07 moral you are so lost
15:11 in this world and i'm always saying that
15:13 in
15:14 the first person sense because i know
15:16 it's not you
15:18 but you're going to repeat it like that
15:19 because there are people that you know
15:21 they think that apple computer for
15:23 instance is a big
15:25 moral company google
15:28 who's literally censoring free speech
15:31 trying to make sure that um
15:35 you can't get curative copied they're
15:37 making sure you can't facebook
15:38 mark zuckerberg is now de facto
15:43 giving malpractice medical advice
15:47 because he won't acknowledge the actual
15:50 hardcore evidence
15:51 of hydrochloroquine to people
15:56 so let's just say someone would have
15:57 lived have they taken this
15:59 medication which is a 500 milligrams
16:02 every two weeks
16:04 can fix you in under 10 hours
16:07 for people that are about to die come
16:09 back to life from this stuff
16:11 unbelievable but you get facebook and
16:14 google who owns youtube
16:15 making sure you can't see it and
16:17 twitter's right there too old jack
16:22 so now they are engaging in utter
16:24 malpractice
16:26 and their crutch is going to be they're
16:29 going to blame the cdc
16:32 now for those who don't live in america
16:33 we have 50 states over here i'm sure
16:35 you're aware of that
16:37 we have a state ohio it's sort of in the
16:40 center
16:41 to uh northeast area a little tiny state
16:45 they banned hydrochloroquine and then
16:48 they unbanded
16:50 now what do you think it took to unban
16:52 it ban it
16:54 evidence that's what
16:58 the politicians in ohio
17:01 talked to an attorney most likely and
17:02 the attorneys went
17:04 you're going to be on the hook for
17:05 everyone who dies of this
17:07 who didn't get hydrochloroquine if they
17:09 get it and they die of it you're
17:11 absolutely absolved from it because it
17:12 was their choice but if you tell them
17:14 they can't take it they can't buy it
17:18 responsible for the death i mean just
17:21 think about it
17:22 that's probably 25 million dollars ahead
17:25 minimum
17:28 but now let's take a little bit deeper
17:29 because there is a slightly deeper
17:31 method to this which is
17:34 you would think that one plus one
17:35 equaling two is something that a hyper
17:37 narcissist couldn't change in your mind
17:40 but it the fake media the
17:44 absolute deep state corporations which
17:45 are every major corporation it's a brand
17:47 that you know in your mind it's a deep
17:49 state corporation unfortunately
17:52 all of them nike doing their ridiculous
17:54 commercials microsoft uses
17:56 the world's biggest devil worshiper
17:59 child eater
18:00 as one of their sponsors on one of their
18:02 commercials which they had to take down
18:03 once
18:04 everybody who knew her background said
18:06 what the hell is going on
18:08 you've got a child murderer in your
18:10 commercial
18:14 right okay
18:18 science would probably be
18:22 the category of mathematics right one
18:24 plus one equals two
18:27 in 1984 the book they had an individual
18:31 who was being told that
18:35 there were five things there was only
18:37 four and kept pushing and pushing and
18:39 pushing trying to get this guy
18:40 to a level of cognitive dissonance they
18:43 can't process reality
18:44 that they're willing to look at four
18:46 things and say there's five
18:48 and they got you broken they know they
18:50 broke your brain
18:52 like almost forever broken because you
18:55 cowered it down
18:56 and they recreated that in a star trek a
18:58 next generation episode with
19:00 lights the car didn't break
19:03 because picard's an og
19:07 but they want to break picard today so
19:10 science which is supposed to be an
19:12 absolutely provable thing
19:15 has been utterly compromised
19:18 the unbreakable has been broken
19:22 stuff you can't prove is um now
19:26 the way it was the big bang right the
19:30 big bang
19:30 is still being passed around as real
19:32 science
19:34 based on something called gravity which
19:36 and even in wikipedia and all the
19:37 science books
19:38 the word phenomenon is in its definition
19:43 how many of you are into paranormal
19:44 stuff
19:46 and you go talk to a quote-unquote
19:48 scientist and laugh in your face
19:51 and you go why are you laughing and then
19:52 well that's just like you know
19:54 supernatural natural printer like
19:56 supernatural phenomenon so that's not
19:58 real science that's crap
20:00 you know the basis of your
20:03 entire model the universe is based on
20:06 the word phenomenon
20:08 so you do it too
20:13 at least i'm working with stuff i've
20:14 seen you know a paranormal person will
20:16 work with
20:17 radio waves or cameras or spiritual
20:20 experiences that they've had
20:23 at least they got something practical
20:24 they've seen through the camera
20:28 a scientist will tell you they knew how
20:29 the universe was created with no
20:31 evidence whatsoever
20:33 and all they do is they tell you that
20:35 the stuff that you see in the sky
20:37 got there by a fake situation
20:41 they tell you that the model of the way
20:43 things are moving in the universe
20:45 is doing a certain thing that it's not
20:46 doing and then they tell you
20:49 how many of you know about you know
20:52 presentations that are manipulated to
20:55 make it feel one way or the other
20:58 hold back a little bit of truth push a
21:01 little truth
21:02 and then do a spin a contextual spin on
21:05 the data
21:07 the tools of hyper narcissism couldn't
21:10 be more
21:12 prevalent today
21:16 people trying to leverage things against
21:17 you
21:19 and you know the whole thing about being
21:21 triggered
21:22 it's it's like a dirty word now right
21:25 because it usually is attached
21:28 to someone who is mentally ill usually
21:31 now we all get triggered i guess
21:34 anything that makes us go from one state
21:36 of consciousness to another state of
21:38 consciousness
21:39 that's a trigger if something happened
21:41 that moved you across those two
21:44 chasms science
21:48 which is interesting
21:52 well it's led by a bunch of actors isn't
21:54 it some of them have degrees in
21:56 pertinent science some of them have
21:57 degrees and completely
21:59 irrelevant things how many times you
22:03 hear someone say
22:04 [Music]
22:06 you know you're talking about something
22:08 you figured out
22:09 you wouldn't research a specific fact
22:11 about something
22:12 and you used either official or not
22:14 official science to get it
22:17 and someone will say well do you have a
22:19 phd in that
22:21 like no jerk off but i went and
22:24 researched it from the specialists
22:27 you could even have a relative a father
22:28 a mother a brother
22:30 a wife a husband whatever who has the
22:33 phd has 10 20 30 years experience in it
22:36 maybe even retired in it at 40 years
22:40 and they'll go yeah that's that yeah
22:42 okay you sure oh yeah totally man
22:44 let me show you let me take out the
22:45 backyard and show you something working
22:47 right
22:47 and then you pass that around and
22:49 someone throws out that thing
22:52 well how many personalities in
22:57 quote unquote science like bill nye the
22:59 douchebag guy
23:01 he's trying to tell kids we don't have
23:02 two genders oh
23:05 well some people listen to that and then
23:07 just go
23:08 he's a science guy he knows well does he
23:10 have a degree in it no but he's the
23:11 science guy he's on tv
23:13 he wouldn't be on tv if he wasn't
23:14 totally true
23:17 so that's interesting right you don't
23:20 need any real background
23:23 for that dude but you're absolved
23:25 completely from any truth you can't have
23:27 any truth because
23:28 you can't possibly research something
23:32 i mean it's almost as bad as you know
23:34 looking at the atomic weight of
23:35 something
23:36 in a periodic chart of chemistry
23:40 and just quote what you're seeing in a
23:42 graph and in this image right this
23:44 diagram
23:46 and someone will say well do you have a
23:47 phd in chemistry well then you don't
23:48 know anything about
23:50 you know uranium or something right and
23:52 you're like
23:53 really it really because i just read it
23:55 off no no
23:56 you have to have someone skilled to read
23:58 that off the paper otherwise you're
24:00 interpreting it wrong
24:03 the tool the fiber narcissism
24:08 the racist thing why
24:12 are they blowing this up in 2020
24:15 well it rationalizes riots it
24:17 rationalizes tearing apart cities
24:20 cities that are run by a certain group
24:22 of politicians that always seem to
24:23 destroy their cities
24:25 well if they get a bunch of riders to
24:26 destroy the city then they can get a
24:28 bunch of federal funding to fix their
24:30 city
24:31 which fix which funnels a ton of money
24:34 into these corrupted politicians
24:35 you know city politicians of big cities
24:38 are almost
24:39 categorically massively corrupt
24:43 there was some i think it was i think
24:45 the number accurately is six billion
24:47 dollars was invested in san francisco to
24:49 fix the homeless problem
24:51 they barely spent 10 million and
24:54 all that money got distributed to all
24:57 the politicians in san francisco
24:59 one guy goes to prison for it
25:04 and maybe there's pending cases don't
25:05 know so they blew all the money
25:08 buying their assets right and even if
25:09 you go to jail you could have purchased
25:11 assets and filtered them and give them
25:13 away
25:13 imagine you give your daughter a bentley
25:16 because you've now funneled 10 million
25:18 dollars
25:18 to your personal account you buy her a
25:20 house you buy
25:21 your kid this all this other stuff
25:23 you're giving it all away but then you
25:25 go to jail
25:26 well you've given the property away it's
25:28 no longer that person's property
25:30 but it's actually stolen property
25:33 because the money was stolen
25:35 well they know this and they just go to
25:36 jail and do their time and their kid
25:38 gets to keep everything
25:41 so you can see where someone would uh
25:42 it's like suicide bombers
25:45 how to how does a suicide bomber exist
25:47 well somebody
25:49 says okay i'll blow myself up for the
25:51 sake of allah or whatever
25:53 movement they're doing and uh someone
25:56 will give their family
25:58 enough money to live for the rest of
26:00 their lives for you killing yourself
26:02 they don't live in you know palacious
26:05 mansions or anything
26:06 but in their standard of life it's the
26:07 best life you could live
26:10 they got bought off they sold their soul
26:12 literally
26:14 the racism is something that the
26:17 elitists love
26:18 the deep staters love because it's this
26:20 nebulous thing
26:23 can't prove that you are can't prove
26:24 that you're not i mean i suppose you
26:26 could prove you
26:26 that you are you could say some stuff
26:29 but if you're not saying anything
26:30 i'm not good to prove you're not but
26:33 someone gets to walk up to you and call
26:35 you
26:35 a racist what is that even
26:39 what is it is it a cultural thing is it
26:41 a pigment of skin thing
26:44 what if you're not racist towards the
26:45 skin color but you're racist towards the
26:46 culture
26:48 you're still a racist i don't know
26:49 probably i think if you have a beating
26:51 heart
26:52 uh one political group will say that you
26:54 are
26:55 but it takes one to know one doesn't it
26:59 the thing is is i think that
27:03 and you know my kid was saying this to
27:05 me
27:06 yesterday that uh you know at 25 years
27:11 old
27:12 but there's this advancement in the mind
27:15 literally chemically where you start to
27:17 gain
27:18 true self-awareness and
27:21 self-preservation you start to gain that
27:23 forever concept in your mind and i will
27:26 definitely say that that's
27:27 probably about the year that for me it
27:30 it definitely became super defined to me
27:32 which is why the military loves to put
27:34 soldiers in at 19 to 23 to fight wars
27:37 because they're not questioning any of
27:38 their orders now some folks stay in that
27:41 gear their whole life and they'll do the
27:43 craziest stuff
27:46 so think about all the protesters that
27:49 we have today the majority of them fit
27:51 between
27:52 whatever the youngest age they are to
27:55 about 25
27:56 that's pretty much most of them the ones
27:59 that are over 25 are
28:00 the underdeveloped there was a
28:04 philosopher named kenneth burke
28:06 and i mentioned him a couple times a
28:07 long time ago
28:10 my stepfather wrote a book about him
28:14 for his phd thesis but one of the things
28:17 that kenneth burke
28:18 came up with and refined it's been in
28:21 the books forever before kenneth was
28:23 born
28:23 but he's super duper refining which is
28:25 scapegoat theory
28:29 and scapegoat theory is
28:33 facilitated by these tools which is
28:38 something in my life sucks and so
28:40 instead of taking responsibility for
28:42 myself gonna find someone else to blame
28:45 for
28:47 and that also adopts as a substrate the
28:50 grass is greener theory
28:53 well they're living a perfect life and
28:54 i'm living a horrible life
28:56 let's go get their stuff the more that a
29:00 society allows their people to suffer
29:03 the more that that group that mob starts
29:06 to build
29:08 and when they start interacting with
29:10 each other and meeting each other
29:12 then you get this systemic mental
29:14 illness
29:16 because you know the
29:19 the slightly insane people are meeting
29:22 absolutely insane people and they're
29:25 looking for tools
29:26 well what else can i [ __ ] about and
29:28 complain about and it's some of it's
29:30 subconscious they don't even know that
29:31 that's what they're doing
29:32 and some are like yeah okay well how do
29:33 we get these people how do we get them
29:35 well you know we do here's what's wrong
29:37 with them
29:38 as if they're like you know throwing
29:40 rocks in a glass house and it's just not
29:42 breaking any windows it's hilarious
29:44 right
29:47 i was watching an interview between
29:49 herschel walker and diamond silk
29:54 herschel's like he's known donald trump
29:55 since 1983. he's like man i've had
29:57 dinner with this guy two dozen times
29:59 not more he goes i can understand the
30:02 guy being racist wanting to meet a
30:03 famous basketball player but he goes
30:05 over and over and over the guy would
30:08 slip if he was like a total racist right
30:11 and then he said you know i think we're
30:12 listening too much to the young people
30:14 about how to run our world
30:16 and the dimension came in i don't know
30:18 how old they are
30:21 i think they're younger than me for sure
30:23 but uh they're like yeah
30:24 you know it's like we got a fifth
30:26 person's been alive for 15 years telling
30:28 us how to run the world barely knows
30:29 that you know
30:31 where their navel is and you know where
30:33 the
30:34 how to communistic leaders have risen up
30:37 through time i have a friend of mine
30:40 who's a
30:42 pretty decent expert on the holocaust in
30:44 general and the
30:45 rise of hitler
30:48 and let's just go straight up to the
30:50 point where people are being put on
30:52 trains
30:52 okay stop there don't worry about what
30:54 happened afterwards
30:56 it's very important but all of the steps
30:59 that hitler took
31:01 building up his his tools
31:04 of hyper narcissism why is germany
31:07 messed up
31:08 why is this why is that now what he
31:10 ended up doing was using either
31:12 valid or invalid reasons to charge his
31:15 people up to just go do what they could
31:16 have done
31:17 without the hyper narcissism without the
31:19 tool without the blame game without the
31:21 scapegoat
31:24 now scapegoating typically shows up in
31:27 our life
31:27 as a a psychological experience between
31:31 you and somebody else someone else is
31:33 blaming you
31:34 for their problems happens all the time
31:36 in long-term relationships
31:38 and it's not to say there's not a little
31:39 bit of truth in something but
31:41 you can't live life like that right
31:44 you're on this journey together every
31:47 day you make decisions
31:49 every day that someone suggests that you
31:50 should do something and you agree to go
31:52 along with it either passively or
31:54 actively
31:55 you're making that decision too if you
31:58 use tax software for instance to do your
32:00 taxes but
32:01 year after year people complain that
32:03 that tax software did their calculations
32:05 wrong
32:05 and they ended up owing the irs more
32:07 money and they got put in jail or
32:09 something and you continue to use that
32:10 tax software
32:11 it's not their fault it's your fault for
32:14 choosing their crappy software
32:16 thank god turbotax works really well
32:21 but the second stage up from the
32:24 psychological scapegoating
32:25 is the sociological scapegoating and
32:28 that
32:28 is the mob rule super duper dangerous
32:32 thing
32:35 what i have found because i've pushed
32:37 the envelope a little bit in this last
32:39 30 days as a complete experiment my
32:41 friends don't need well
32:42 my acquaintances don't know that i'm
32:45 conducting any experiment on them
32:47 is that you know there are people that
32:49 post on social media that immediately
32:51 remove all dallas to whether or not
32:53 they're abject morons
32:55 just they don't know anything about what
32:56 they're talking about it's evident
32:59 they walked into the room in the last
33:01 six months and then they're
33:02 suddenly a political activist suddenly
33:04 they're microbiologists
33:06 suddenly they're virologists right i've
33:09 studied virology for 35 years
33:12 actively seeking articles on a routine
33:14 basis
33:15 reading about stuff techniques
33:18 of determining what's what now i might
33:21 be reading complete crap
33:23 if the theory is corrected viruses are
33:26 merely a toxic output of the cell due to
33:28 malnutrition
33:29 then only half of the information is
33:32 correct
33:33 meaning the cause isn't the cause but
33:36 the
33:36 effect is the effect the indication
33:38 right
33:41 but i've been pushing the envelope on
33:42 these people
33:44 and i flat out told them i said look one
33:47 particular case
33:52 this woman um who's part of my hometown
33:55 um just keeps
33:58 cutting and pasting fake information
34:01 from fake news outlets
34:03 into her thing and she once it's a it's
34:06 her tool
34:07 of hyper nurses narcissism she posts it
34:10 because she feels like
34:12 i'm going to seem so smart i cut and
34:14 pasted it from an official source of
34:17 truth
34:17 so you can't even see anything against
34:19 this i win
34:22 that's her goal that's her insecurity
34:25 winning seeming intelligent perhaps
34:27 maybe that's one of our goals
34:30 so in order to stress test my theory
34:33 about her
34:34 i stressed her out and i said look
34:38 this is a kind of thing that somebody
34:39 posts who hasn't been anywhere in the
34:42 world
34:43 hasn't done anything amazing hasn't you
34:45 know
34:46 accomplished the impossible has never
34:48 met a billionaire and had it
34:49 let alone half a dozen of them and had
34:52 conversations about how the world works
34:54 been deep deep deep in
34:57 [Music]
34:58 i guess you could say secret things
35:02 this is why you post this kind of stuff
35:04 i said you've
35:05 obviously just entered the room five
35:07 minutes ago and just running your mouth
35:09 like you've
35:10 been signing brzezinski your whole life
35:11 and you work for five or six presidents
35:13 and you know what's going on
35:14 you have no clue what's going on in the
35:16 world your posts are proof
35:18 you're absolutely positively asleep
35:23 and the result of the stress test was
35:26 nothing changed and you know that's the
35:28 case these idiots
35:31 post stuff because they don't really
35:34 care
35:35 about what they're really doing to the
35:38 world
35:39 because it's all about them
35:42 and you know i borrowed this from
35:46 little britain the comedy series and the
35:48 uk on bbc which is
35:49 it's already off the air they did three
35:51 seasons one in america
35:53 and it's brilliant they had this i
35:54 mentioned this once before but it's
35:56 pertinent here
35:58 it's two guys and one of the guys in
36:01 real life
36:01 is gay and he's he's hilarious kind of
36:04 he was a really chubby guy
36:05 back in the day he's kind of up and down
36:06 his weight now but he made this skit
36:08 called the only gay in the village
36:11 and it was a bold skit because in real
36:14 life he is gay
36:15 and he comes in and he's in a town where
36:18 he believes there are no other gay
36:19 people
36:20 he dresses like in this rubber outfit
36:22 you know it's like this loud crazy color
36:25 and he comes in and he's just it's just
36:27 wild what he looks like and so he comes
36:29 into the bar
36:30 and he keeps saying over and over again
36:33 that he's the only gay in the village
36:34 kind of hyper narcissism is his tool was
36:36 to wear this outfit
36:38 and just be the most special person in
36:41 the room because he's the only gay in
36:42 the village
36:43 and then the way he turns his own script
36:45 because he writes his own skits and he's
36:47 he's the actor and it was that there's a
36:49 ton of gay people all over the place and
36:51 they
36:51 would walk up to him and ask him if they
36:53 wanted to go if you want to go
36:54 you know shag in some hotel and of
36:57 course
36:57 he's uh he also plays the character that
37:00 he's never really had an experience yet
37:01 so he's a super
37:02 expert gay guy he's never had any
37:04 experiences and all these big burly
37:06 dudes come up to him and he's like oh
37:08 no i can't do it you know and
37:11 so i mapped that to the only democrat in
37:14 the village
37:16 you know the only person that swallows
37:18 all the stuff from mass media
37:21 still right we are years and years and
37:24 years into compilation videos of all
37:26 these newscasters saying the exact same
37:28 thing
37:29 on a particular day because they all got
37:31 the same script
37:32 through their email from some
37:36 shadow source i mean no one can really
37:38 explain it
37:39 essentially the most centralized news
37:41 organization in the world is ap reuters
37:44 again i think 2004 or so reuters about
37:47 ap
37:49 okay reuters was founded and funded by
37:52 the
37:53 rothschilds in the mid-1800s okay
37:57 you know so i i want to make that
38:01 distinction because i want you and your
38:02 brain
38:03 to consider for a second that these
38:06 individuals don't really care if you
38:08 live or die
38:09 due to covid they don't really care if
38:12 you
38:13 are a racist or not a racist if climate
38:15 change is real or not real they don't
38:17 really care
38:19 the whole exercise in social media is
38:22 for them
38:23 to seem intelligent which is a bizarre
38:28 psychosis that
38:31 develop some people and i mean i know
38:34 someone in their 70s okay
38:37 that is a family member of mine
38:41 that has a phobia
38:45 a massive ridiculous phobia
38:48 of being perceived as not intellectual
38:52 and not intelligent and it's just
38:55 it's their own problem inside themselves
38:58 and
38:58 if this person had never said anything
39:03 then no one would ever assume any
39:05 different they'd be like oh yeah she's
39:06 really smart
39:07 he's really smart he's great whatever
39:09 like no one will ever say anything but
39:11 they have this
39:12 fear as they get older that they should
39:15 be smarter
39:16 they realize they didn't read a lot of
39:17 books they may have gone to college and
39:20 may not have gone to college and it's
39:21 okay i don't have a degree
39:23 but i could probably teach most the
39:26 classes that i'm interested
39:28 in i do you know i do teach some of the
39:30 classes i'm interested in
39:32 although 2020 has been really dry on the
39:35 teaching
39:35 level there's the old line you know i
39:39 use it all the time in the show but it's
39:40 the old shakespearean line
39:43 one doth protest too much
39:47 and that is that if you are protesting
39:49 about everyone else being a racist
39:52 you're probably just telling the world
39:53 that you are and you're really feeling
39:55 guilty about it
39:57 and so it deflects away from you if
40:00 you're that person
40:01 from anyone else noticing but it starts
40:04 to become really obvious at one point
40:08 all the politicians in america that have
40:10 been there for 40 plus years
40:14 they've been there they've been in
40:15 charge for 40 years
40:17 unable to fix a single thing saying that
40:20 now the newcomer
40:22 is the reason why everything is still
40:25 the same that same way in the bad areas
40:28 that it's been their entire term their
40:30 entire
40:32 30-40 year term there's no change
40:36 that's exactly their goal that's what
40:39 they're told to do
40:42 the only change that we ever see
40:43 consistently from government is the
40:45 decline in the citizens
40:48 rights and the citizens employment
40:51 earnings savings quality of life
40:54 it's all going downhill but what's funny
40:57 is
40:57 is if somebody reads a brochure
41:01 these idiots online let me read a
41:03 brochure
41:04 that says the exact opposite of what's
41:06 exactly occurring
41:09 they will tell you that we live longer
41:11 that we're healthier
41:13 so not true the only thing that's
41:15 probably true
41:17 is that we have a lot of methods today
41:19 that we didn't have
41:20 medically to keep you alive after
41:24 your shorter life begins you got
41:27 respirators and keep your life
41:28 technically
41:30 pretty much forever right we can keep
41:31 you iv
41:33 with all the nutrients your body needs
41:34 and this machine will breathe for you
41:37 and just keep it alive forever i mean
41:38 whatever ailment you have
41:40 as long as you have the organs they
41:41 didn't get destroyed in some accident
41:43 you can stay alive forever until your
41:46 body expires
41:48 oh that's progress the
41:52 you know it's funny because people want
41:54 out of this um
41:56 cage that we're in in 2020
41:59 and so what has become apparent is that
42:02 every single
42:03 regiment has been handed down by the cdc
42:06 to keep us
42:07 supposedly healthy from catching this
42:09 cobit is actually going to produce
42:12 the most unhealthy human beings on
42:14 planet earth wearing a mask
42:16 reducing your oxygen which is toxifying
42:19 all your cells
42:20 another word for toxification of a cell
42:23 is
42:23 cancerous cell i experimented with a
42:26 mask i put it on my face and just
42:28 sat there and tried to breathe
42:31 unbelievable
42:33 lack of oxygen was just a crappy little
42:35 surgical mask that still has
42:37 it still wasn't like sealed on my face
42:40 and i still couldn't breathe i was like
42:42 unbelievably i had
42:44 way more than 35 reduction in my oxygen
42:47 going into my mouth or my nose excuse me
42:50 i even tried my mouth it was just awful
42:53 just awful so you want to have cancer
42:56 you wear that thing every single day all
42:59 day long now if you have to wear one
43:01 i suggest just as quick as you can pull
43:03 it off your nose
43:04 do so it's nuts man and then it's not
43:07 really doing anything besides
43:09 keeping some tyrannical bunch of bs
43:12 going
43:12 right so you're not really standing up
43:14 for anything there people you know
43:17 but i understand sometimes you just
43:19 gotta do it right
43:21 the other one was a hand sanitizer hand
43:24 sanitizer
43:25 is just destroying your immune system
43:29 right you need to be exposed to what's
43:32 in the world otherwise the world will
43:33 eat you up
43:34 and you have to build immune system
43:37 and antibodies against stuff by catching
43:41 it
43:41 it's just the law of the land man
43:44 the other one's social distancing well
43:46 you know think about psychologically
43:47 what that's doing to you
43:50 it makes you live in fear and fear is
43:51 another big ingredient of cancer
43:54 huge ingredient cancer and the last one
43:57 was staying inside all day
43:59 right shelter in place or whatever don't
44:02 go out in the sun
44:03 don't go outside fear fear fear fear
44:05 fear
44:06 well the number one cause of death
44:10 in a covid patient is a complete
44:12 depletion of vitamin d
44:15 and sun is the only way you really ever
44:17 get it i know you can believe in
44:19 supplements but you're just blowing
44:20 smoke up your lazy ass
44:22 you get outside get some freebie sun
44:24 it's great for you
44:25 there's a reason why people who are tan
44:28 seem more attractive to us and seem more
44:30 healthy
44:31 because they historically over time as
44:34 we have genetically
44:35 made it with each other over thousands
44:37 and thousands of years
44:40 we know that when someone's got sun
44:41 they're healthier
44:43 and the white pasty person isn't
44:46 sorry man i know there's traditions in
44:48 the world in japan the women aren't
44:50 supposed to get any sun they put white
44:51 makeup
44:51 over their white skin to seem even more
44:54 white
44:55 hey maybe they've figured out some weird
44:58 genetic code where that works up there
44:59 but
45:00 most people need something
45:03 but of course all those four regiments
45:06 are used as a toil
45:07 tool of hyper nurses narcissism right
45:12 you're not allowed not to believe
45:14 because then you don't supposedly care
45:16 about humanity
45:17 or the person you're talking to that's
45:19 what all the rage fits are happening
45:21 online
45:23 it's gross it's just utterly gross you
45:27 know
45:29 what they're not doing and this is what
45:30 people who are stuck inside or they
45:32 stuck in this
45:33 game are starting to fight back they're
45:36 starting to use logic they're starting
45:37 to think
45:38 for themselves because the state's not
45:40 thinking for you well
45:42 right no one's ever told anybody hey
45:45 don't eat a bunch of sugar
45:48 don't eat a bunch of you know stuff
45:50 that's gonna make you unhealthy
45:52 get good rest don't be fearful get out
45:55 in the sun
45:56 you don't have to get with other people
45:58 you don't have to wear a mask i'm in my
45:59 backyard
46:00 i could be out here in there any i can't
46:02 even see anybody
46:03 i can hear them but they can't see me
46:05 whatever i mean i'm getting everything i
46:07 need right
46:10 social interaction super important to
46:12 your soul
46:13 super duper important you will go
46:15 mentally insane
46:17 if you don't have exposure to other
46:18 human beings unless you are
46:21 utterly super duper conditioned to not
46:24 do that
46:25 and that's why you know nasa and the air
46:28 force
46:28 and all the all the all the branches of
46:30 military train people for survival
46:34 to be able to psychologically handle
46:36 either no interaction with the human
46:38 being
46:38 or minimal reaction or interaction with
46:41 a very small group of human beings which
46:43 would be your fellow astronauts or
46:44 somebody right
46:47 i think what's interesting is when
46:50 my friend had the experience with the
46:51 dog
46:53 he pushed back
46:56 she pushed back and then he pushed back
47:00 again
47:00 and then he said it pretty much ended
47:02 the protest ended
47:04 now the dog was still there nothing you
47:05 can do about that it's not the dog's
47:07 fault the dog's just the dog man
47:11 but i think that in the most cordial
47:14 manner
47:16 we have to start telling the people
47:18 closest to us
47:20 not random strangers we can get you know
47:22 somebody
47:24 up in your face that you're just not
47:26 gonna
47:28 respond anymore to that you're not gonna
47:29 react to that anymore
47:31 you're gonna delete the trigger that
47:33 they're trying to provide to you
47:37 because they need to know that game is
47:38 over
47:40 and i think what would be and my i think
47:42 my buddy
47:44 used the term to his family member
47:49 of hyper narcissism what's interesting
47:52 is they're trying to demonize
47:54 the narcissist they're trying to
47:56 demonize anything that isn't
47:57 narcissistic
48:01 and what's really acidic about it is
48:04 that they will
48:05 demonize and misconstrue
48:08 empathy right
48:12 there are people in the midwest of the
48:14 united states of america
48:16 who probably don't know anyone or
48:20 if you could count every one they know
48:22 of a non-caucasian
48:24 race on two hands
48:27 less than ten but they will try to carry
48:30 this
48:32 this um
48:37 this you know suffering flag for this
48:39 other
48:40 situation in which they know very little
48:42 about
48:43 you know if you would ask them what the
48:45 other race wants as their demands that
48:47 would fix their problems they have no
48:48 clue
48:49 because they haven't spent any time in
48:50 those families i can't even say i would
48:52 be qualified
48:54 you know my methodology would be to work
48:56 with them and say i'll do whatever i can
48:58 to empower you for whatever fixes you
49:00 think
49:01 you need now some things are really
49:02 blatant
49:05 but they want to claim a beautiful thing
49:07 which is empathy
49:08 a dying frame of mind in the united
49:11 states of america at least
49:14 and they want to claim that that's what
49:15 they're doing but they turn
49:17 that into what i used to call and i have
49:19 an episode on this i believe in
49:21 season one called the dagger of goodwill
49:25 and i wrote this poem a long time ago
49:27 about the dagger of goodwill
49:31 and essentially says that the poem
49:34 starts that that i should have memorized
49:37 but i don't
49:38 but it is that someone takes every
49:40 quality of your character
49:43 and forges a dagger with it
49:46 the sharpness of your character the
49:48 sturdiness of your character
49:50 everything that's wonderful about you
49:52 becomes a dagger
49:54 and they're forming it out of your being
49:56 and as soon as you turn around
49:58 boom they stab you in the back with it
50:01 and this can be a bunch of different
50:03 things metaphorically anyone has ever
50:05 trusted someone else in a relationship
50:09 they will use it to cheat they'll use it
50:11 to steal your stuff business partners
50:13 bad friends all that kind of stuff
50:17 so take your great thundberg for
50:18 instance right she might she might say
50:21 something like well don't you care about
50:22 planet earth
50:24 yeah doesn't mean i endorse your 15 year
50:28 old version of reality
50:30 your absolute void of science
50:34 your absolute unwillingness to look at
50:36 the facts
50:38 your total lack of knowledge of your
50:39 employer george soros
50:41 who's literally the antichrist on earth
50:45 you know but then you have these
50:49 sort of i used to call them professor
50:52 positives
50:54 it was still a good term for them but
50:56 they're hardly professors
50:59 but there was this other thread on my
51:02 facebook which i
51:03 dabbled into a little bit but it's two
51:06 guys
51:06 that know each other one is like a
51:09 really innocent guy
51:10 whose lives are pretty straight life no
51:13 bad rumors about the guy or anything do
51:15 anything wrong
51:16 he is tired of the hate
51:21 and so what he's trying to do is take
51:22 everything that cognizant people are
51:24 hating like a george soros and trying to
51:28 start the conversation with well how
51:31 could he be such a bad guy
51:34 there's no research on it his only
51:36 research was to read
51:37 george soros's wikipedia page i mean
51:39 this is literally what he posted on his
51:41 on his thread and he's bailing out a guy
51:45 you know who's just beyond amazingly
51:48 evil in this planet
51:52 george will be happy if the day he dies
51:56 99 of the planet has died just the
51:58 second before he dies
52:00 that will that will be his opus
52:02 contribution to the world well at least
52:04 i killed most of them
52:06 that's not even an exaggeration he's a
52:08 huge supporter of agenda 21
52:10 huge supporter and so i posted i said
52:14 i posted something very very kind of
52:16 metaphorical and i said look
52:18 you really want to do your research
52:20 because a tiny bit of research into this
52:22 guy will reveal who he is and you'll be
52:24 ashamed
52:26 later that you ever post posted support
52:30 for this guy
52:31 i don't care what party you're from or
52:32 whatever he is not of any party
52:35 he is of like pure darkness right
52:39 he had to wake up looking like that guy
52:41 you'd feel the same way probably
52:45 but who came to the defense
52:48 of both situations both george shows and
52:51 this guy
52:51 doesn't know who george is a very good
52:54 friend of mine
52:55 at least he was we're still friends we
52:58 were really good friends at one point
53:02 and this guy makes a habit he spends his
53:04 whole day on facebook bailing out
53:06 every like agenda 21 agenda even though
53:10 he has no idea what gender 21 is
53:12 probably would call it a conspiracy
53:15 and his background
53:19 is he had a tough childhood but he
53:22 learned
53:23 sort of you know the stealing is okay as
53:26 long as you need it
53:28 he in the bay area when we were in the
53:30 gaming business
53:31 got fired from every single company he
53:34 was ever a member of
53:36 he behaved so badly at a party for my
53:39 company
53:40 electronic arts that he wasn't allowed
53:42 in the building
53:43 just because of his behavior he slept
53:47 with
53:48 prostitutes constantly he didn't need to
53:52 but he just did he would be dating women
53:55 at the same time to sleep with all the
53:56 prostitutes they have no idea that when
53:58 she then they leave the house he's got
54:00 at least one woman coming in to spend
54:02 all his money on prostitutes right
54:06 we have a mutual friend who's a super
54:09 good guy
54:10 aaa human being who has this soft spot
54:13 for this
54:14 guy and constantly gives him
54:16 opportunities and even brought him in as
54:18 a partner
54:19 for his game company four guys were
54:22 brought in as partners well this dude
54:25 didn't have any money the other guys had
54:27 to put in cash my buddy put in cash
54:29 and paid for the other dudes quarter
54:32 percent
54:33 of the company
54:36 who destroyed the company that guy
54:39 he just stopped working one day he
54:42 destroyed
54:43 a multi-million dollar company that was
54:46 making
54:47 absolutely name-brand games destroyed
54:50 them
54:51 even my buddy who's an idiot to trust
54:54 him in the first place but he's such a
54:55 good guy
54:56 that's why he did it he said yeah
54:59 so-and-so screwed up the company all my
55:01 other partners hate him
55:03 and he missed a cycle because he had to
55:06 cover for his buddy didn't find any new
55:08 work next year boom
55:09 gone i mean people relocated to
55:12 las vegas from the bay area to be a part
55:15 of this company
55:16 moved their families bought houses and
55:18 this one guy
55:20 who has a routine history of this
55:23 horrible behavior
55:25 destroys the company and then to make
55:28 matters just put a cherry on top of the
55:31 awesome horribleness of this dude
55:33 he's a nice guy he's just still
55:35 irresponsible
55:37 my buddy gives him another chance with
55:39 another startup
55:41 completely tainted completely tainted
55:44 didn't do anything
55:47 so okay what's the quality of the human
55:50 being running around online defending
55:51 all these crazy agendas that are
55:53 destroying the world
55:55 a guy who destroys the world
55:58 wants to make destroying the world okay
56:03 because that's what he does that's what
56:04 he's an expert at
56:07 and what's really really strange is that
56:10 they find weak people good people
56:14 but really weak-minded people
56:17 who will incessantly support them no
56:20 matter how badly they perform
56:22 i mean the guy could have cheated on it
56:24 could have slept with his wife and
56:26 he'd find a way the other dude find a
56:27 way to explain his brain well he
56:28 probably just needed to have sex and
56:30 it's only that one time or no dude it
56:33 was for a year
56:33 well it was probably just for that year
56:35 you know it's just like bail out bailout
56:37 blank check blank check right
56:40 so i find that it's interesting that
56:42 either your these people and my
56:45 my facebook feed are complete nimrods
56:47 about
56:48 how the world works and they cut and
56:50 paste or they're people that are the
56:52 most
56:52 devious evil people now i hope my
56:56 my buddy changed but it doesn't change
57:00 the fact that he's now dedicating his
57:01 money and his time
57:03 to making sure the world burns
57:07 because that'll be his game he knows how
57:10 to make the world burn
57:11 it makes him feel comfortable
57:14 but i can't shake the fact that it's it
57:17 all goes back to every post
57:21 is a tool hyper narcissism
57:25 it's to erase or to bring down the bell
57:28 curve
57:29 of excellence of integrity
57:34 down to be evil
57:37 because as long as we're all evil that
57:39 guy is an
57:41 expert right um what's interesting is
57:45 imagine like i've i've been privy to
57:49 films where darker subject matter
57:52 was a part of the film was part of the
57:54 script
57:56 and the people writing it just found it
57:59 elusively interesting because you know
58:02 some people just have to write new bad
58:03 guys it's like okay we have to come up
58:05 with a really bad guy
58:06 i'm not a super bad guy or bad girl
58:09 so i'm gonna go consult with people that
58:11 have made
58:13 life dedications out of
58:16 studying the people who are bad and
58:19 maybe even
58:21 in some cases as we know hollywood is
58:23 all moving to foreign countries now
58:25 right they are
58:28 bad themselves and so they harvest it
58:31 out of these people
58:32 well these people now go from being
58:35 imagine you had some secret celebrity
58:38 who's a total
58:39 child trafficker pedophile everything
58:41 horrible
58:42 sacrificer blood drinker adrenal chrome
58:45 consumer and they have to hide it they
58:48 have to hide it constantly right because
58:50 it's illegal and it's the worst crime on
58:52 planet earth
58:52 period okay and then say someone wants
58:56 to make a documentary
58:57 about that craziness to expose it or
59:00 something well this person could come in
59:02 pretend like it's third-person
59:04 information or second-hand information
59:05 but it's actually their experience
59:07 and now it's like oh my god i'm famous
59:09 for being evil
59:12 what's the joker movie all about the new
59:14 one
59:16 joaquin phoenix man amazing actor
59:20 this is nothing against him but he
59:22 played the new one and he just
59:23 was it's it's a horrible movie i don't
59:25 know why i made so much money i watched
59:27 it twice it was
59:27 awful second time worse than the first
59:30 man there was no there was no heath
59:33 ledger moment in the whole thing
59:35 at all there's no gary oldman movie
59:38 moment where like he's chewing on a pill
59:40 and the professional and that's acting
59:42 man that's a really good script
59:46 but it all goes down to where this nut
59:48 bag
59:49 commits this incredible crime on tv and
59:51 we'll try to destroy it for you
59:54 and uh the city riots and everyone's
59:58 wearing clown outfits
60:01 and he is now gone from sociopathic
60:06 killer you know mentally insane guy
60:10 who's got this laughing medical
60:14 condition which was that was probably
60:16 the worst acting i've ever seen joaquin
60:17 ever do
60:19 he's one of the finest actors and i just
60:21 thought he didn't he it's almost like he
60:23 thought this was stupid too he's like
60:24 trying to laugh and just wasn't working
60:26 but anyway
60:27 turns the bad guy into the good guy
60:32 interesting interesting predictive
60:34 programming for everybody right
60:37 what i don't know is
60:40 i'm just thinking out loud here but when
60:42 i was young
60:44 my grandparents i only knew three of
60:47 them
60:48 but they never felt insecure about who
60:51 they were
60:52 you never even heard those words and
60:54 someone might say yeah well back in the
60:56 old days they didn't talk about their
60:57 emotions well that's that's a true
60:59 statement
61:00 but just look how happy they are you
61:01 know they're happy in their skin they're
61:04 confident their skin
61:05 just being unconfident was not even a
61:08 consideration the spectrum of emotion
61:12 my hometown had a very common
61:16 evolution for old couples for most
61:19 you know most of america the man is
61:22 slightly older if not much older than
61:24 the woman
61:26 and the guy dies first
61:29 and so the women live much longer and so
61:32 we had a town full of
61:35 i don't know what the percentage was
61:36 probably not high but of women
61:38 past a 75 a bunch of them were single
61:42 or widowed i should say because their
61:44 husbands had passed
61:45 and they all networked together they all
61:47 knew each other they all grew up
61:48 together
61:50 and they networked their coffee or their
61:52 bridge games or whatever they're doing
61:55 and some of them miss their husbands of
61:58 course
61:58 and they mourned their husbands every
62:01 day
62:02 you know and some of them had
62:05 kind of put the morning aside they had
62:07 done that
62:08 part and they would select certain times
62:11 of the year
62:12 a birthday or something to go visit
62:13 their grave or whatever
62:15 but the rest of the time they were
62:16 having a good time with what they had
62:18 which was everything they ever needed
62:20 and everything they ever wanted
62:22 and today look at the preoccupation
62:27 of the kids today it's
62:31 sick it is so sick man
62:35 there used to be the the funny line in
62:37 the 90s
62:39 which was uh how do you know if
62:41 someone's a vegan
62:42 and this is uh because they'll tell you
62:46 veganism and vegetarianism is
62:50 a gigantic tool of hyper narcissism
62:54 if you feel compelled to ask someone if
62:57 they are
62:57 and to make sure you tell them that you
62:59 are right after that it just is
63:02 so if you're doing that and you're vegan
63:03 and you're vegetarian i'm going to
63:05 suggest maybe you lighten up
63:07 you just be who you are you know
63:10 it's almost i'm going to give you a
63:11 ridiculous analogy but it's i want you
63:14 to attach these two as absurd
63:17 because there's lesser ones that you can
63:18 attach to that are more accurate
63:21 but do you walk up to a random person
63:25 as these vegans and vegetarians do and
63:27 go do you masturbate every day
63:30 what what yeah do you masturbate every
63:32 day because i do i masturbate every day
63:34 do you masturbate every day
63:35 and it's like whoa was there a club i
63:37 forgot didn't get invited to that this
63:39 is something we were
63:40 actually talking about in public you
63:42 know what
63:43 your whole regiment with your body is
63:46 your business man
63:47 and more power to you don't hurt
63:49 yourself
63:51 but how you eat for god's sakes why is
63:55 that an
63:55 issue that anyone else needs to know
63:57 until you go to dinner
63:59 or until you want to date that person
64:01 you want to date the person well you
64:02 better get to know how they do their
64:04 thing
64:05 but why is it that certain things are
64:07 just this big virtue signaling thing
64:10 well you know why someone asked you
64:12 about vegetarianism and veganism
64:15 they have this dopamine
64:18 one arm banded dump in their body that
64:21 they're better than you
64:24 just do it i support you with whatever
64:26 you do
64:27 i think you're going to be very
64:28 unhealthy eventually but whatever
64:31 you know but what's nice about it is i
64:33 can be your friend
64:34 no matter how you eat and you start
64:37 getting that thin plasticky
64:39 skin you start getting massive it's not
64:41 even wrinkles man it's like you're
64:43 you're almost like a like a
64:46 supermarket plastic bag with bones in it
64:49 eventually right and you're like oh man
64:50 it's not great
64:52 i don't know i eat meat every day look
64:54 at my face man
64:56 i'm 50.
64:59 we all know people that are sick
65:00 constantly
65:03 i just mentioned this one in a episode
65:05 recently but
65:07 they can get in that situation as well
65:10 hypochondriacs
65:13 it's it's uh you know some of it is to
65:15 extort the motion of sadness and
65:17 attention
65:19 really bad idea
65:22 because you're abusing your body in
65:23 order to extort that
65:26 yikes man the point of this episode is
65:30 that
65:30 we're now starting to identify
65:33 the bad habits the super duper
65:37 mental bad habits
65:40 that are destroying people's lives
65:43 and as they are able to reach out to
65:45 other people and infect their
65:47 consciousness
65:49 other people's lives as well they're
65:50 doing harm to other people
65:53 one of my buddies pulled out of social
65:55 media about a year ago i think
65:57 and uh you know i think about you know i
66:01 wouldn't have any social media if i
66:02 didn't have this show
66:03 period and because i do have it i can't
66:06 stop from looking around every once in a
66:07 while and just dropping
66:09 hopefully some helpful little phrases
66:10 here and there but i don't post much
66:12 but entertainment just want to make
66:15 people happy
66:16 you know that's why the show exists
66:18 hopefully you guys dig it right
66:22 but one of the uh so let me just take
66:25 this
66:25 into a slightly different benefit if we
66:28 can
66:28 raise consciousness of the hyper
66:31 narcissist
66:33 one we have to start figuring out where
66:35 we can say this
66:38 because we need to make sure we say it
66:40 accurately don't overuse the concept
66:42 because boy if you can say it accurately
66:44 guess what starts to happen
66:47 we know that we have this great
66:49 awakening that just has occurred
66:51 and is continuing to just build up steam
66:54 i mean more and more people are waking
66:55 up every single day it's a beautiful
66:57 beautiful thing
67:00 but now that is external information
67:04 that we're learning to learn how we have
67:08 an opinion about
67:09 potential things human trafficking
67:14 being a giant one right political
67:16 corruption another giant one
67:19 agenda is to destroy the world
67:20 population another one right
67:23 okay the next one that we typically do
67:27 very quickly after waking up and finding
67:29 out that we've been fed a bunch of
67:32 malarkey as uh joe biden's modern
67:34 phraseology would say
67:37 is that uh we learned about our health
67:39 we learned that we've been consuming
67:41 products that are extremely bad for us
67:43 and so that we change our entire
67:44 regiment of how we
67:46 you know no no aluminum underarm
67:48 deodorant no fluoridated toothpaste
67:50 all the way up to no processed foods no
67:53 sugar substitutes all that stuff
67:54 right be careful with rf wave don't put
67:57 your phone up to your face very often
67:59 okay but now i think the next
68:03 trend that needs to occur is for us to
68:06 identify
68:08 behavioral defects that have become
68:12 popular they have become
68:16 social addictions expose them
68:20 and make that the next wave of awakening
68:23 because imagine we made everything
68:25 that's uh
68:26 but you know it kind of happened a
68:27 little bit the triggering was
68:29 was like a real popular thing about two
68:31 years ago when it started blowing up
68:33 then it turned into cancel culture
68:36 and i've got celebrity friends of mine
68:38 that survive
68:39 off of their television royalties
68:42 okay but they were in sketch comedy
68:44 shows
68:45 in the 90s that if you were to pick
68:48 apart every single sketch
68:50 well one of the actresses made fun of an
68:52 asian woman
68:54 almost every episode was a reoccurring
68:55 character well one person
68:58 would make fun of um being gay one
69:01 person would make fun of
69:02 being black and they're even black doing
69:03 the episode you know and so everybody
69:06 can step in and say
69:07 you know what that show has about 60
69:10 percent
69:11 massively offensive stuff with our with
69:13 our
69:14 you know snow flaky culture that we have
69:16 today you got to pull that show off tv
69:18 it should never arrogant because all
69:20 these bad habits of
69:22 making fun of people promotes racism and
69:25 instead of actually
69:27 revealing it as
69:30 sort of an exhaust pipe to the ongoing
69:35 you know challenges of mixing cultures
69:37 because we're mixing cultures now right
69:41 we're going to shut off the exhaust
69:42 valve we're going to build up
69:44 tension because there's going to be no
69:46 place to release it
69:48 while we're still trying to figure out
69:50 well okay i'm from america you're from
69:51 mexico you're from china you're from
69:53 india you're from
69:54 an arab world and we're all going to
69:57 start living together now and
69:58 working it out well you have chickens in
70:00 your backyard that are
70:02 you know four roosters and i don't wake
70:04 up to a rooster or i'm living in
70:05 huntington beach you know
70:07 there's just there's just differences we
70:08 have to figure out
70:10 so if we can make light of it through
70:11 comedy it's a good thing
70:14 but it's funny that all these liberal
70:16 folks that i know
70:18 i know i i'm afraid there's a cop show
70:21 okay what if police
70:22 defunding police is is just suddenly you
70:25 know
70:25 anything police on tv right kindergarten
70:28 cop got pulled out of a
70:29 movie theater with portland oregon
70:31 because it has cops in it
70:33 okay we'll pull the shows off tv that
70:35 have cops in them
70:36 and watch people lose billions of
70:39 dollars
70:40 every decade in royalties and gross
70:43 revenue
70:44 towards commercials that run on
70:46 syndicated shows
70:49 okay so you can see that tidal wave you
70:51 know go up
70:53 what's really fascinating though this is
70:54 gonna be a little a little off topic but
70:57 we're here and i'm
70:58 finishing up the stick here i think most
71:01 of you know that uh
71:03 the last uh 10 minutes of an episode
71:06 just goes wild card
71:10 but i can remember we were talking about
71:12 this the other day
71:14 we have a filipino guy and two white
71:17 guys
71:17 on the patio and we're talking about
71:20 sort of the racism
71:21 well it's definitely a racist
71:24 category of behavior but you know in
71:28 america we fought uh
71:30 world war one to korean war and
71:32 vietnamese war
71:34 and one of the trends that happens in
71:35 these wars is that the military
71:39 has to create a lexicon of hatred
71:42 for the enemy they just do it every
71:44 single time
71:45 right the jerry's the uh
71:48 which were the germans we had the the
71:50 japs which were japanese people
71:53 um it was a [ __ ] was a vietnamese person
71:56 which i probably was used during the um
71:59 i would think the korean war and so they
72:02 use all these things and of course the
72:03 arabs of something about camels or
72:05 whatever right okay
72:07 so i grew up as the
72:11 old terms were dying right jerry had
72:13 already died
72:15 because that was world war ii must have
72:16 died in the 50s or 60s somewhere right
72:19 but i was watching are you being served
72:21 and there was a german
72:23 episode where it was themed in german
72:25 and somebody said i'm not wearing an
72:26 outfit of a jerry
72:28 because this guy in the show was uh in
72:30 his 70s and he
72:32 uh lived through the world war ii so
72:33 that's that's he got that lexicon he
72:35 can't let go of it right
72:37 when i grew up in kansas uh one of the
72:40 phrases i only realized in the last
72:41 couple years
72:42 that was going on was [ __ ]
72:46 we didn't have any japanese people that
72:48 i know of in my hometown
72:50 but we also didn't have any ill feelings
72:52 towards japanese people because we
72:53 didn't
72:54 we never met one you know how can you
72:55 hate somebody you never even met right
72:58 and of course japan's all fun and cool
73:00 now it's just like
73:01 the world came together really
73:03 beautifully
73:04 and now people are trying to use the
73:07 little bit of tension that's there to
73:08 create this
73:09 huge thing with some legitimate
73:12 situations that catalyze that from time
73:14 to time of course
73:17 but look at jerry lewis
73:21 um the master mckee comedian of all time
73:24 right
73:26 um jerry lewis's true story i probably
73:30 will do an episode on the guy
73:31 because uh he definitely molded a good
73:35 part of my life with it the reruns of
73:36 his movies when i was young
73:38 but that dude did an asian character
73:42 and you know he wore these dentures to
73:45 make him
73:45 have black teeth he wore big black
73:48 horn room glasses and he wore this wig
73:52 and maybe he was awake i don't know his
73:53 hair is really black anyway
73:55 he's a jewish guy but he did this
73:59 character that became super famous all
74:01 around the world
74:02 and i missed it i still have never seen
74:03 the movie that i know of in my lifetime
74:06 it just doesn't appeal to me just him
74:08 looking like that character even as a
74:09 child was like me
74:11 whatever doesn't doesn't appeal to me so
74:14 in the last 100 years because of us
74:19 increasing our travel obviously the
74:21 internet now
74:22 beautifully informs us about beautiful
74:24 places all around the world
74:26 we now want to travel to places that
74:28 before we had words to criticize them
74:30 without even knowing them
74:32 i'd love to visit vietnam they'd be
74:34 incredible i've seen the most incredible
74:36 locations they probably don't want to
74:37 live there
74:39 i'd love to visit tokyo they're gonna be
74:41 amazing right
74:43 so they're these
74:46 we're in a we're in a good place
74:50 to get along right so
74:53 part of what i think the young people
74:55 today don't realize
74:57 is that just just a few decades back
75:00 there was a bunch of stuff carried over
75:02 from war
75:04 you know really old people in my
75:05 hometown i mean one of the things i've
75:07 heard several times
75:10 is it grandmothers and
75:13 oh i should put it on the women only but
75:15 i should say the grandparents
75:17 for some reason it's always a
75:18 grandmother because she lives the
75:20 longest is why this
75:21 tends to be a grandmother's story
75:24 i'm just being honest about the stories
75:25 i've heard none of my grandparents
75:28 did this and i'm almost i'm surprised
75:32 i'm very proud that they didn't but
75:35 in the midwest you definitely people
75:37 have lived in little tiny towns their
75:38 whole life
75:40 never been anywhere never met anybody
75:43 and they would use
75:44 derogatory words towards other races
75:48 and which here's the good news to the
75:50 story
75:51 their grandkids who are my age
75:54 were embarrassed and
75:57 uh one of my close friends in huntington
76:00 beach
76:01 he said that his grandparents used to
76:04 use his grandmother used to use the word
76:06 it was really strange
76:07 and i'm not sure it was used in any like
76:09 massively contextual
76:11 super negative way but the word was used
76:14 and the by this by the time the
76:18 grandkids came around they they're like
76:20 wincing at the word like well come on we
76:22 don't we don't say that anymore
76:23 we know those people you don't and maybe
76:26 you should lighten up a little bit you
76:28 know
76:31 but i don't think that any grandkid ever
76:33 said anything to their grandparents
76:35 i think they just kind of went okay well
76:38 that's your generation i get it
76:40 too bad but whatever we're in a good
76:42 place now
76:44 and so you know
76:48 i think that with the current writing
76:51 situation
76:52 that's going on right now you know the
76:55 one thing that no one wants to say
76:57 but i'm gonna say it because it's part
76:59 of the problem something we need to fix
77:01 is that let's say that you know we've
77:03 had these blm rights in america
77:07 okay so what are those rights built out
77:09 of well you actually have the
77:11 indigenous race of the movement which is
77:13 the black race and then you have
77:16 the statistics are now starting to come
77:18 out where you've got more white people
77:20 in those riots than black people
77:24 and of course protests we all support
77:27 right a lot of good information coming
77:29 out of the protest a lot of good
77:30 communication going in the protest i
77:31 went to the one huntington beach
77:33 it was all peaceful kind of i mean some
77:36 tear gas as they blocked the highways
77:37 and there
77:38 the cops have got to free up the highway
77:40 but you know for the most part no
77:42 no writing no windows were broken even
77:44 though everything was boarded up it was
77:45 really sad
77:48 because everything didn't everything
77:49 stayed cool
77:51 but what people are now saying in the
77:54 press
77:54 and in people my friends
77:58 don't we don't really get into it so
77:59 it's not something that's part of my
78:01 circle of conversation but what i'm
78:04 hearing
78:05 is that that the press
78:09 really focuses on what the blacks do at
78:11 the
78:12 riots and not what the white people
78:14 doing at the riots
78:16 the ones where they damage a bunch of
78:18 things and so
78:20 there's still a bias within the liberal
78:22 media if you really read between the
78:24 lines of who's good and who's bad in
78:25 these protests
78:27 who the pictures are taken of and the
78:28 pictures aren't taken up
78:30 it's interesting they always try to
78:31 focus because in the end
78:33 what they're trying to do is to develop
78:36 a bunch of really
78:37 bad images of black people to fuel the
78:41 fire
78:42 towards the black people to say okay
78:44 this is really going to mess with all
78:46 those racist white people
78:47 boom boom boom boom boom just making
78:50 like one side's doing it
78:52 when a bunch of the stuff in seattle and
78:55 portland's all white people
78:57 just just walking down the street
78:59 hammering windows right
79:01 white people white people provocateurs
79:03 of george soros in a lot of cases
79:06 and then there's just that whole thing
79:09 where people have been
79:12 victims of police brutality
79:15 had no fault of their own didn't do
79:17 anything wrong literally no crime
79:19 whatsoever
79:20 got roughed up they are black
79:23 and so when they see those these events
79:25 occur it brings up
79:27 the worst moments of their life
79:30 and they're angry understandably angry
79:33 and they're trying to find some closure
79:35 but
79:36 someone comes by and just drags a
79:37 screwdriver right down their wound and
79:40 rips all the stitches off and just
79:42 opens their heart up and steps on it
79:46 the real question is is any of this
79:47 stuff really fixing anything
79:50 not really there's a giant
79:54 group of uh folks that i follow on
79:56 twitter
79:58 who are black and they are monitoring
80:00 the situation
80:01 and what's interesting is i've seen a
80:03 bunch of people turn to religion
80:05 and double down and because they're
80:08 really seeing biblical stuff
80:10 occur um when blm posted that they
80:14 weren't for the nuclear family
80:16 and they wanted your kids to be
80:20 trans kids or sex change kids a bunch of
80:24 you know with the black community in
80:26 america i don't know about your
80:27 your community they're very religious
80:29 and they're very knowledgeable
80:31 about the bible and so look at that
80:33 stuff and so
80:34 in my personal experience watching
80:36 conversations having conversations
80:40 you know online i am seeing maybe just
80:43 because of the filter of
80:44 whatever is happening mostly on twitter
80:47 i'm seeing
80:48 the black community almost categorically
80:51 reject
80:52 the blm movement not the problem but the
80:55 movement because of their loyalty to the
80:57 democratic party
80:59 with all the funds going straight to the
81:00 dnc i mean unbelievable right
81:04 gnc has been charged last eight years
81:06 before this last president nothing
81:07 changed
81:08 you know all of a sudden now they've got
81:09 all the fixes
81:11 unbelievable right but i've got friends
81:14 that are so
81:14 angry personal friends of mine that are
81:17 so angry about police brutality
81:20 but they're massively religious i could
81:23 quote the bible to you all day
81:25 it's a very entertaining wonderful
81:26 experience
81:28 when i say hey look this particular
81:30 movement
81:31 is against everything that you're for
81:35 the cognitive dissonance circuit turns
81:37 on
81:40 and they just it's like you know
81:43 just like the hosts in westworld it
81:46 doesn't look like anything to me you
81:47 know they don't see it
81:49 mentally ill because of the ptsd
81:53 from these real experiences makes it
81:55 impossible for them to deal with
81:58 the contradiction in their own belief
81:59 system
82:01 their own support system it's
82:04 not healthy so
82:08 i thought it was a brilliant statement
82:09 by my friend and i think it's uh
82:12 potentially worthy of a catalystic
82:15 moment
82:15 uh just a term hyper narcissism but
82:18 especially
82:20 tool of a hyper narcissist
82:24 to really get people to understand and
82:26 what's kind of funny about the word
82:28 hyper narcissist
82:29 is that you're talking about i guess you
82:31 could say a big word
82:32 right a big intelligent word what is the
82:36 goal of all these people that don't know
82:37 anything
82:38 they research nothing and know
82:39 everything what's the goal of
82:41 of all their posts seem intelligent
82:44 and i think it would be just oh it's
82:46 it's almost ironic
82:48 that to
82:52 make them aware of what they're doing
82:55 you use a word
82:56 that is almost makes them potentially
82:59 salivated the notion of being able to
83:01 use it
83:02 against somebody else because that's
83:04 what they do and they go okay
83:06 i got a new game for you you want to
83:08 really make change in the world oh yeah
83:10 you want to be important oh yeah you
83:12 want to seem intelligent oh totally
83:13 that's my main goal in life because i so
83:15 fear i'm not intelligent
83:16 all right here's a new one for you champ
83:19 it's called the tool
83:20 of hyper narcissist it's what you just
83:23 did
83:24 online it's what you just did it's what
83:26 you do all the time
83:28 now if you really want to seem
83:30 intelligent
83:31 one knock it off two look for it
83:35 look for the pattern and once you see
83:38 that pattern all over the world
83:41 all of your other liberal friends all
83:43 your other snowflake friends
83:44 are doing all these posts online the

85:17 i will tell you that much
85:18 cigars cost money and this stuff takes a
85:21 lot of time
85:22 the more i have to set aside for
85:24 research
85:25 the better that's why this tesla
85:26 episode's taken almost three months now
85:28 because
85:29 i'm working on a billion things trying
85:31 to generate cash
85:32 plus the season six intro i've now
85:35 ingested
85:36 probably four books on tesla probably uh
85:41 25 documents that he created
85:44 and so it's probably going to be a
85:46 two-parter just so that you know
85:48 i've kind of decided to go ahead and
85:49 release this right away
85:51 we have an all-new remastered season one
85:54 on its own channel and we have a store
85:56 so those new stuff will be in the store
85:59 right before fall
86:00 but i'm building another store for
86:02 another thing so
86:04 it's just boy it's just only so many
86:06 minutes in the day right
86:08 but until next time take care of
86:09 yourself and someone else
86:11 and i'll see you in the next deep
