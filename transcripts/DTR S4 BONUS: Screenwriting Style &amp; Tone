00:00 [Music]
00:31 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:33 deep thoughts
00:35 another summer 2019 bonus episode this
00:40 is not typically what I was planning on
00:41 putting into a bonus episode because
00:44 it's gonna have a lot of good content
00:45 and hopefully but then if it sucks I
00:47 could blame it on a bonus episode and I
00:49 can just turn it off so I just finished
00:51 a film and I'm starting on a new one and
00:57 the new ones gonna be way more complex
01:00 than the previous one very science
01:04 fiction very in the future hopefully
01:08 really entertaining but it's very
01:11 complex and so I thought I would go over
01:16 something they call those two things
01:20 beat your style and your tone
01:23 now I've discussed this with other
01:25 episodes and it is something that's like
01:28 I don't know who I would name as being a
01:37 master at this besides someone like a
01:40 Tarantino type writer you don't have to
01:45 like his films but you have to
01:47 acknowledge that this dude has style and
01:49 tone down and he probably has more style
01:52 than tone other films have beautiful
01:56 tone which I'm gonna define as its
01:59 overall sort of spiritual frequency as
02:02 you watch the film know again Tarantino
02:06 has amazing talents and I'm not making
02:10 this whole thing about him but he just
02:11 came to mind as I'm freestyling here but
02:14 if you're a writer especially a film and
02:16 this is going to be more for film some
02:18 of the things I've said in the past
02:19 could be used for for novels and you
02:23 could use this
02:24 I suppose for novels and this could go
02:26 for TV obviously and you know there are
02:29 dozens and dozens and dozens of amazing
02:31 writers all over the world sadly they
02:35 don't make a lot of videos so you don't
02:36 get a lot of their information and if
02:38 they do they charge money in a college
02:40 and I support them a hundred percent
02:43 doing that because their talents are so
02:45 refined and so amazing that they earn it
02:50 they should get paid for what they do
02:52 and I have paid some of them you know
02:54 for these online video things I mainly
02:57 stick with Robert McKee he has a website
03:01 called story log and he is an amazing
03:05 teacher but he is also very he's very
03:10 brutal in his methodologies and he sees
03:14 it clearly and sometimes he sees it so
03:16 clearly that he explains that only in
03:18 one way and I suppose if you were his
03:21 friend and you sat down he would if you
03:23 had a hard time understanding any one of
03:25 his concepts he probably smoothed it out
03:27 for you but you know he's gonna pick his
03:28 way to to make it happen what's cool
03:32 about the screenwriting series /
03:35 playlist on YouTube or key word it on
03:38 another service is that I'm coming at
03:41 this over and over again a bit like I do
03:44 with the moon missions right we go at it
03:46 from different angles and hopefully if
03:48 you didn't get it from a previous
03:51 episode maybe the next episode will be
03:53 the one that really clicks for you but
03:57 what am I talking about here well if you
04:01 get into screenwriting what's
04:02 interesting about it is again just like
04:05 I've mentioned all my other episodes
04:06 there are the fundamental mechanics of
04:09 writing that you have to master first I
04:13 mean you have to get to your first level
04:15 of master meaning if it was this was
04:18 some sort of martial arts this would be
04:19 your first black belt and then there's
04:22 like you know infinite degrees of black
04:24 belt well in writing there are infinite
04:28 belts for your understanding of how to
04:32 craft the story first obviously
04:35 developing some sort of premise which is
04:36 your framework what are we doing here
04:39 where are we what time are we who who
04:40 are your main characters what's going on
04:42 here
04:42 what is the mechanics of what you're
04:45 doing and then of course you have to put
04:49 the story inside of
04:51 this this frame to make it mean
04:55 something to someone if I showed you a
04:58 race car and it's a beautiful race car
05:01 it's got a you know it's right out of
05:03 like cannon ball it's got some blown you
05:08 know 429 Hemi
05:10 it's got flush seats it looks awesome
05:12 paint job it's whatever car you want it
05:15 to be and I show it to you and I said
05:17 what do you think about that and you're
05:19 like man that's great but then you look
05:22 at me and eventually we just stare at it
05:24 so long you look at me and you go well
05:26 what's it for what do you do with it ah
05:29 that's what the story introduces itself
05:32 and I say yeah you know what we're gonna
05:34 do with this and he's like what you and
05:37 I are gonna get in this thing we're
05:39 gonna cross the United States except
05:42 we're gonna go back in time and it could
05:44 be 1975 but we have the spoiled
05:48 mentality of 2019 and you're gonna see
05:51 how amazing this country was back in
05:53 that timeframe and then that's the setup
05:57 when you go straight into that we pop
06:00 out 1979 and we start bumping into Hells
06:02 Angels and all kinds of crazy other
06:06 factors in conflicts and we get chased
06:09 and we bump into ac/dc
06:12 touring from Australia you know whatever
06:16 and the story develops I fall in love
06:20 with someone you've fallen over someone
06:22 there's a story but now there's two
06:27 sides of this episode I want to get into
06:29 I don't really have a terribly organized
06:32 in my mind I thought about this about
06:34 five minutes ago
06:35 but they'll tell you that your style is
06:42 really recognized in two different ways
06:45 there is a style that the audience will
06:48 recognize when you see a Tarrant
06:50 Tarantino movie and what is that style
06:53 it would be the dialogue between samuel
06:56 l jackson and john travolta in a car
06:59 discussing what mcdonald's is like in
07:02 europe
07:05 the Grand Royale discussion that style
07:09 of communication runs throughout every
07:12 single Tarantino film no matter what
07:16 film he writes his dialogue is
07:19 captivating interesting you are dying to
07:23 hear people talk from a Nazi talking and
07:28 being really just creepy as [ __ ] as he
07:31 lights a cigarette or whatever with his
07:33 lighter and and he's just everything's
07:36 this orchestrated thing the two guys
07:40 talking about what's in a suitcase the
07:43 brother has style but then there's a
07:46 second tier of the style but the
07:50 audience doesn't see and this is being
07:54 very literal here and that is the way
07:56 that the script is written in which the
08:00 agent the studio received it and read it
08:05 and was so captivated by its masterful
08:07 writing that they escalated a piece of
08:11 paper up to the point of spending ten
08:16 fifty a hundred two hundred million
08:18 dollars on a production they brought
08:21 together hundreds of people if not a
08:23 thousand people to make a phone think
08:26 about your average luc besson film how
08:28 many people work on his films how much
08:30 money he spends was that valerian I
08:35 can't find the number of how much money
08:37 he spent on that movie no one will say
08:40 and he won't admit it it looks like they
08:42 spent gobs and money on this film so
08:45 that's script regardless if you like the
08:47 film the script had to be powerful
08:50 enough to get made think about James
08:52 Cameron making his avatars now he's
08:54 totally in control of his role because
08:56 he made damn near infinite money off his
08:59 films he's the to top grossing films in
09:01 the world avatar and Titanic right style
09:06 is something that's really rough to
09:10 acquire and what's interesting about
09:13 that is that it started sort of harkens
09:17 back to that conversation I think
09:18 about 1994 and Steve Jobs is being
09:21 interviewed on a sofa and he was being
09:23 interviewed about Bill Gates and he
09:25 still hadn't resolved his emotions
09:27 towards Bill at that time luckily he did
09:29 before a company you know before the
09:32 century was out they had resolved their
09:34 differences but he just said I don't
09:37 think Bill has any style windows doesn't
09:40 have any style Apple products have style
09:44 the next computer has style and either
09:47 you born with it or you're not now I
09:50 don't know if that's true in terms of
09:54 being born with it or not I have a fear
09:59 that it's not a matter of being born
10:02 with it it's a matter of being raised
10:04 with it and what's interesting is is it
10:11 is a very strange thing because I
10:14 remember where well I'll leave you to it
10:21 two segments the second experience I add
10:25 and I'll give you the first after the
10:26 second for very specific reasons my
10:29 father has style it doesn't matter if he
10:34 didn't make a billion dollars in his
10:35 lifetime or whatever but my father has
10:37 style man he knows what clothing looks
10:41 cool and you know he looks sharp and
10:43 tough and you know not tough in a
10:45 insecure way but just really just you
10:48 know Tom Hardy in a suit you know I mean
10:53 that kind of like damn that looks cool
10:55 you want to emulate that you look at a
10:57 really badass car you you know the
11:01 various my father loved Macintosh stereo
11:02 equipment back in the 70s and there's
11:04 just no denying that that that that
11:06 stereo back in the 70s was beyond
11:09 cool-looking everything we had just
11:12 looked cool my father listened to music
11:15 that I think had that upper echelon of
11:19 enlightenment you know your Pink Floyd's
11:22 you like deep purple so people that were
11:26 groovin with all the rest it's not that
11:28 he disliked anything in-between it's
11:31 just some
11:32 snuck out and some became his favorites
11:35 you know Kraftwerk and Queen and Led
11:38 Zeppelin just the best of the best
11:42 it had style when I saw Tron like I said
11:49 1982 I looked at that movie and my mind
11:53 was blown for every single reason in the
11:57 book from the from the overall tone of
12:00 the movie which we're going to get into
12:01 the style of the Sid meet artwork and
12:07 the möbius what artwork but Syd Mead
12:10 stuff hit me in my soul it was something
12:14 to do with like the Legos of God as what
12:17 Sid uses to build all of his designs Sid
12:21 is pure concentrated futuristic style
12:25 that guy could take a paperclip and
12:28 redesign it and it will look better and
12:31 it will look cool and it will look like
12:33 it came a hundred years from the future
12:35 because he has style now the other thing
12:39 just just because I hate saying things
12:42 like you're either born with it or not
12:43 because you might figure you're not born
12:45 with it and then you might give up there
12:47 might be techniques to stimulate this
12:49 there might be techniques for you to
12:50 evaluate this I was born with a really
12:55 old soul and I'm not telling you that to
12:58 do like some backhanded boasting and
13:00 he'd you understand that the reason why
13:02 I know I was born with a really old soul
13:04 was I didn't like being a little kid I
13:07 just thought everything was stupid I
13:10 just thought oh my god you know like
13:11 singing I've told you this many episodes
13:13 if you're a long time listener but
13:15 nursery rhymes just gag me to death
13:18 I you know I dig some of my I dug some
13:21 of my toys you know but as soon as like
13:25 Legos camera I was like yeah now we can
13:27 build something that kind of looks
13:27 sophisticated at least but I always dug
13:31 the adult things around me I wanted I
13:34 didn't want to do what they did to be a
13:36 grown-up necessarily I didn't want to be
13:38 grown-up like physically grown-up I just
13:40 in my brain I was content me in three
13:42 you know I just
13:45 I was ready for Syd meet you know the
13:51 minute I was born it was interesting I
13:53 was drawn to things that were very
13:57 stylish the the films that I ended up
13:59 falling in love with ended up being cult
14:02 classics right I fell in love with Tron
14:03 but traumas panned when it came out
14:05 Disney this is hilarious backstory
14:08 Disney is president after Tron was
14:11 released he wasn't there when it was
14:15 approved and put together but he was the
14:17 president shortly after it released he
14:19 tried to have all of its material all of
14:21 its source burned and one of these guys
14:24 who worked on it found a guy burning the
14:27 original materials of the film and a
14:30 barrel behind a warehouse and he's like
14:32 what are you doing this is my film I
14:35 don't know I've just been told to burn
14:37 this I don't know what it is I hadn't
14:39 even seen Tron so he said stop burning
14:41 the goddamn film I'm gonna bring my car
14:43 around and we're gonna stick it in my
14:44 car so the guy made four or five trips
14:46 and got it all saved they lost most of
14:50 the artwork and now they're running
14:51 around yelling at people who worked on
14:53 the film do you have the artwork and it
14:54 was like no maybe you burned it you
14:57 idiots like don't blame us for not
14:59 having the archives you know but Blade
15:02 Runner another great film everybody
15:05 panned it the Harrison Ford hated being
15:07 on the film because he didn't like being
15:08 cold and wet he didn't like the way that
15:10 Ridley Scott directed this has all been
15:12 resolved but it stood the test of time I
15:17 remember walking around for 20 years
15:19 after that film released and going well
15:22 haven't you seen Blade Runner what the
15:23 hell is that
15:24 I don't know but now it's like it's the
15:27 bomb film amazing the sequel [ __ ] okay I
15:33 just can't even tell you the music's
15:35 fantastic a lot of the special effects
15:37 are the only places where you see Blade
15:39 Runner or you type scenes because the
15:41 visual effects studios understood Blade
15:44 Runner and understood what the camera
15:45 should where the camera should be placed
15:49 and how the scenes should look you know
15:52 they preserve the style but the director
15:55 of that film he couldn't light a scene
15:58 enough
15:59 right unbelievable my opinion of course
16:03 but I fear that this programming for
16:06 style which is important in your script
16:09 is it's it's a requirement to really get
16:14 noticed when you write and you'll work
16:17 on at your whole life you will work it
16:19 on to her whole life but you will hit a
16:20 sweet spot where people start noticing
16:21 it
16:22 my co-host from MK ULTRA radio a show
16:26 that's now gone very few people know it
16:30 but he is a novelist he's not he's
16:32 dabbled in screenwriting quite a
16:34 successfully now but we met in our
16:37 creative writing class and his style was
16:41 and is so I don't think he writes
16:44 anymore but he is same master novelist
16:47 he makes Stephen King lay down and take
16:49 a nap with one sentence your mind is so
16:52 utterly blown and fulfilled
16:55 I used to taste him pull out scripts
16:57 when I got a new girlfriend and plus one
16:59 of his scripts I said I got to read you
17:01 one of these stories my buddy Kyle room
17:02 and I just read four or five sentences
17:05 and these girls would just look at me
17:06 like who's writing this this is like get
17:09 a little excited about the Kyle's
17:10 writing style so there is again there's
17:14 styles within the action and the setups
17:19 of your scenes and then there's the
17:21 prose the dialogue obviously you can be
17:26 probably if you're more apt to write
17:28 real stylish the stylistic prose the
17:32 dialogue you probably be forgiven for
17:35 not writing tremendously interesting and
17:39 optimized action but I'm gonna go
17:42 through this with you guys so that you
17:43 understand how meticulous this could be
17:46 because this should be fun if you're a
17:49 writer it's because you have to be
17:50 you've got stories falling out of your
17:52 brain and you're just trying to save all
17:54 your children you have to get these
17:58 stories up because even if you write a
18:00 film and it doesn't get made but you
18:03 wrote it it's there for time for the
18:05 annals of time you mean I get paid for
18:07 it or whatever but if you care about
18:09 your children you care more about them
18:11 existing and being healthy
18:12 that you making some money off of them
18:14 right like these parents that try to
18:16 push their kids into so you know
18:17 celebrity pastimes so if they can make
18:20 money off their children that's it may
18:24 work but it's not the right way to raise
18:26 a kid most likely now we've we've had
18:28 Tiger Woods we've had Mozart because
18:31 parents do this and they're not
18:33 necessarily mean poor Mozart died
18:35 penniless but Tiger is probably pretty
18:38 happy his father forced it on him and
18:39 there's millions of people who went
18:41 through this who aren't necessarily
18:43 technically household words but they
18:45 have the same story the same beginning
18:48 the same childhood but let's break it
18:51 down I'm gonna start with the action
18:55 side of things and your script because
18:59 there are words that make people feel
19:02 certain ways I try to use them on this
19:05 show now the benefit that I get is that
19:09 I get to talk and use my voice tone my
19:13 attack and decay my beginning middle and
19:16 end inflections on how I say things to
19:20 either make you excited make you maybe a
19:22 little upset
19:22 or to calm you down and make you want to
19:24 go to sleep but when you hand in a
19:28 script you're not there to read it and
19:30 there are people that will read a script
19:33 and get very little from it because they
19:34 don't read scripts that often they don't
19:36 know how to put their personal spin on
19:40 things and so you need to help them
19:43 figure out how to read your script and
19:47 tones gonna play a huge role in this and
19:49 tones really where you get the curves
19:50 and things but if any of you've read a
19:53 book like Catcher in the Rye and then
19:56 you've read a Tom Clancy novel or just I
20:00 would say a regular novel you know
20:02 there's a gigantic difference and how
20:04 they're written one book is cussing up a
20:07 storm so badly the book gets banned all
20:09 over the place
20:10 and one is telling an old-fashioned
20:12 story okay depends on what you're into
20:16 maybe you want a real gritty Stephen
20:18 King novel from the 80s 70s or 80s or
20:21 maybe you want them what is it bridges
20:24 over Madison County or whatever it is
20:26 a real warm sort of Norman Rockwell
20:29 style and tone so the way I'm going to
20:33 present this to you with an action
20:36 between style and tone is that it sort
20:40 of goes in a I think a coarse brush
20:44 style and a fine brush tone one of the
20:50 physical ways I can describe this to you
20:52 is to say if you had someone that builds
20:54 something out of wood or steel and it's
20:59 a particular object that needs to
21:00 perform a function perhaps a table of
21:02 some sort well you know a table has to
21:06 find a way to hit the ground stand up to
21:08 waist level and provide a surface for
21:11 people to do things on eat on whatever
21:13 you're gonna have a six foot five guy
21:15 put his elbows on one side and you need
21:17 to make sure the table doesn't fall over
21:18 that's why many folks have stuck with a
21:21 four legged object the some will figure
21:23 out a way to make a pedestal directly in
21:25 the center that is so perfectly balanced
21:28 but you could damn near stand on one end
21:30 of it and you won't topple over so
21:34 looking at the table from afar and say
21:37 you stare at the table from 20 feet away
21:38 in my opinion the first element that you
21:43 will notice is what you call or what I
21:45 call style how is it constructed do the
21:50 legs go straight down have a curve in do
21:53 they curve out what color is it you know
21:56 if you made it out of wood is it
21:57 finished would you know is it is it four
22:00 or five different wood sets of darks and
22:01 some lights
22:02 does it have wood and metal in it who
22:05 knows you know when you look at IKEA
22:08 furniture there's a style to IKEA
22:10 furniture put together perhaps you
22:14 create an overall frequency which you
22:16 might call your tone but when you get
22:19 closer and closer to the table you will
22:22 see if there really is a style or tone
22:26 or is it merely function with very
22:30 little form if you got up close
22:34 to the table and you realize that it's
22:36 been rounded off in really beautiful
22:39 ways you see the craftsmanship in it if
22:42 it's made out of steel its brushed steel
22:44 it looks amazing
22:46 perhaps there's even some shots keys in
22:51 the table that have nothing more than
22:54 just a cosmetic aesthetic feature to it
22:57 it's something to give you an emotion
22:59 perhaps you thought it was all made of
23:01 wood or or steel and when you get up to
23:03 it they've inlaid special glass very
23:07 special glass perhaps it looks like
23:08 beach glass some polished beautiful blue
23:12 almost looks like a crystal surface
23:14 perhaps they embed a backlight on it so
23:17 it lights up like some futuristic bar if
23:21 somebody said I I've designed my house
23:24 to use a bunch of retro 50s furniture
23:28 well one in the 50s your living room is
23:31 made out of like four or five decades
23:33 just you know but let's say that you do
23:36 the standard mistake that most people
23:37 make when they make 50s period films or
23:39 forties period films that said to set
23:42 designers run off and just specifically
23:44 say nothing in this room if it wasn't
23:45 made in the 40s because making a 40s
23:47 film not realizing in the 40s you've got
23:49 a radio from 1930s you've got a commode
23:52 or some you know dish furniture that's
23:56 made in the 20s and it just goes back
23:58 you know 30 or 40 years if you have a
24:01 very recent room but that's the style
24:04 that's the constraint of what could be
24:07 put in your space the words that you
24:10 might choose but type of language you
24:13 might use might be better suited for
24:17 your style do you swear in your action
24:20 or you really Frank and it feels like
24:23 I'm getting this story off someone that
24:27 is in a bar I just was traveling I got
24:31 really tired I was walking and I found a
24:33 saloon and I walked in and I'm just
24:34 exhausted so I'm sort of captive to my
24:38 own exhaustion and I sit down on a bench
24:40 in a dark corner
24:41 sunlights beaming through the window
24:44 it's high noon it's hot out a little
24:46 cooler inside I got the windows and the
24:48 door
24:48 his open breeze is going but I can smell
24:52 somebody somebody else is probably
24:55 sweating like me had bathed in a couple
24:59 days
24:59 but they look eccentric and they notice
25:02 me and you make a salutation how you
25:08 doing man what brings you out here and
25:11 he starts to tell you a story and beyond
25:13 your expectation he tells you a story
25:16 that is unbelievable the reason why he's
25:20 theirs he's running from a posse or he
25:24 just robbed a bank or he time-traveled
25:27 whatever but he's a gritty guy and he's
25:29 just given tea because he has no more no
25:31 more energy to polish his language he's
25:36 just maybe he's at his end of his rope
25:38 it's like I don't even know what's gonna
25:40 happen to me I don't even know if I'm
25:42 gonna make it till tomorrow maybe I'll
25:44 blow my brains out maybe I'll get hunted
25:45 and killed whoa it's a different type of
25:49 story than you expected it has a style
25:53 initially and over the course of
25:56 ingesting a particular style the whole
25:59 experience has a tone you meet a person
26:04 maybe they're really gentle they have a
26:07 beautiful voice in a nice place maybe
26:11 you've had sort of a cranky day or an
26:14 uncertain day and however this person
26:16 speaks to you just makes you feel better
26:20 well when you're sitting down face to
26:23 face eating every second of their
26:24 dialogue they have a style they're
26:27 communicating with you using it right
26:31 but after you leave or spend time and if
26:35 you itemize a certain length of time
26:38 it's putting off a tone an overall
26:41 feeling a frequency of the experience
26:45 but it's not just the dialogue is it
26:49 which is why I want to start with the
26:51 action the metaphysical in the room of a
26:54 true real-life experience if you take
26:57 the example I just gave you and I light
26:59 it up a little bit more
27:02 you're in a desert it's hot it's windy
27:05 it's like a dust bowl clouds of smoke
27:08 are blowing by there's just dust piles
27:10 and a tumbleweed bounces off your leg
27:12 every few seconds and in the distance
27:16 you can barely make out what you think
27:18 might be a mirage but it's a building in
27:20 the middle of nowhere with an old lazy
27:22 sign on it this is saline and you're not
27:26 even sure it's real you're not sure that
27:29 it's open functional if anyone's been in
27:32 it for a hundred years you just don't
27:34 know
27:34 your feet hurt in your shoes Ben your
27:38 boots he's pretty sure your some of your
27:41 feet if blowing through your soles and
27:44 you're just dragging dirt up into your
27:46 shoe but you're not sure it's just one
27:49 of those moments where your
27:50 consciousness is flickering you're so
27:53 tired and thirsty and maybe hungry maybe
27:57 you lost your hunger because you've been
27:58 out there for so long and you get up to
28:01 the door it's not even closed and you
28:06 can just walk in and you can't believe
28:08 it's open and you walk in in to your
28:11 total surprise there's four or five
28:12 people in there and one's a bartender
28:15 there's no waitress and everyone looks
28:19 up at you and you think like for sure
28:21 you're gonna be considered an invader
28:23 this isn't your place
28:25 you're a random no man why would they
28:27 fear you but no one does just looking at
28:32 the grid on everyone's face maybe a scar
28:35 on someone's body you know that they
28:37 believe no matter what you're throwing
28:39 down they can handle you so you pay your
28:44 respects with a nod all you want to do
28:47 is get off your feet but you have a few
28:51 gold pieces in your pocket and you
28:55 wander up to the bar and you're pretty
28:59 sure they don't sell any water so you
29:02 get the next best thing at this point a
29:06 little bit of whiskey might take away
29:07 the pain feed your body with sugar
29:10 whatever it is you grab your drink
29:14 and just like trying to pick a urinal in
29:16 the bathroom you don't want to stand
29:17 close to anybody if you don't have to
29:20 don't want any trouble
29:22 thought one little lone seed off in the
29:24 corner and it's dark which is exactly
29:27 what you want and just stepping on hard
29:32 wood planks make your knees ache you lay
29:36 down your order
29:38 bartender pulls a little shot glass
29:41 pours you a little splash you put your
29:46 gold piece on the bar and you know it's
29:50 worth way more than a single drink and
29:51 so does he so you can zyou the bottle
29:54 it's half-empty you grab it and you
29:59 wander over to the corner and you sit
30:02 down every single piece of sand you
30:06 crushed under your boot sounds like a
30:08 sonic boom in that room all eyes are on
30:11 you and all you want to do is curl up in
30:15 a ball and drink your drink and have
30:18 nobody know you're there that was a very
30:22 smooth example of what should probably
30:25 have a little bit more style but you see
30:28 the story right if I'm telling that
30:31 story I just gave it to you in a modern
30:33 language format but what I might need to
30:37 do is quite frankly in real life if I
30:40 hadn't read a Western book either
30:44 written very authentically to the
30:47 language and the actual vocabulary of
30:50 the time maybe I need like a West like a
30:53 sorry a dead wood has a beautiful style
30:58 to it all the dialogues phenomenal and
31:00 if you're writing some of that dialogue
31:01 in a particular way with a particular
31:03 Sensibility you might start writing your
31:06 action to feel like this manuscript was
31:08 pulled out of that time frame well I
31:10 don't feel like it's a treasure map you
31:13 don't get silly with it but you probably
31:16 want to start using some language that
31:19 would feel like you're actually in that
31:23 time form depending on what time frame
31:24 were talking about and
31:27 I haven't told you really what the place
31:29 looks like inside of I maybe I did such
31:32 a good job describing that it's better I
31:35 don't pick things to take away your
31:38 imagination as once I start explaining
31:41 everything I'm removing perhaps a better
31:44 story in your mind directors will
31:48 eventually get scripts to decide whether
31:50 or not they want to make them agents are
31:53 supposed to have the same skill set of
31:55 the directors in terms of imagining the
31:57 basics of how the script by be realized
32:00 whether or not an audience would feel
32:02 the way that the writer wants them to
32:04 feel more style you have the more that
32:09 you're going to accurately paint in the
32:12 mind of the reader prior to getting
32:14 anything on film what could be put on
32:19 the silver screen but our character
32:21 wanders over and sits down in the corner
32:24 sometimes it's very useful to think
32:28 beyond the obvious and to note something
32:32 that would be happening that the average
32:36 writer or person wouldn't note the fact
32:41 that his feet might have you know been
32:44 so out there in the desert that has worn
32:47 through his soles that first split
32:49 second we see him look down at his boot
32:53 and there's his foot coming right
32:55 through his boot I'm he's screwed he
32:57 needs some new boots no matter where he
32:59 goes he's gonna look funny with half of
33:01 his footing and out of the bottom of his
33:02 boot the fact that his body hurts little
33:08 nuances that means something that tell
33:11 way more than you've actually told if
33:18 you have a guy coming out of a desert
33:21 and he has all these ailments then
33:25 you're going to imagine how did this
33:27 person get there in the first place when
33:30 the show from HBO carnival starts Nick
33:34 stalls character eventually right in the
33:36 very beginning of the film has to bury
33:38 his mother
33:40 and when the carnival shows up randomly
33:44 to see what's going on and one of them
33:47 comes out to see him and they all come
33:50 out to help him as he's trying to bury
33:53 his mother in this horrible windstorm
33:55 they noticed he's got a chain around his
33:58 ankle he's been in a chain gang which I
34:02 believe they did film when he's inside
34:03 the house trying to take care of his mom
34:06 well that's a whole back story and you
34:09 know what that back story has never
34:10 explained as far as I remember I just
34:13 started watching it the other day just
34:14 for the hell of it I've seen it five
34:16 times it's just this masterful man but
34:20 it adds dimension to your character but
34:22 if you're going to set something in the
34:25 the dustbowl of America in the 1930s
34:28 there was a way that they spoke and your
34:31 script should probably reflect that when
34:35 I wrote the movie for kou :
34:36 I my initial treatment which was like a
34:42 full blown script but I wrote it in a
34:43 very fairytale fashion on purpose to see
34:48 how flowery I could make it and from
34:49 that era without getting to sort of
34:55 overachieving you know and it wasn't
34:59 until I saw like 11 and my method of
35:03 telling the story that I realized okay
35:05 I've seen zero and I've seen 11 so now I
35:07 need to pull it back to a solid eight
35:09 and a half nine in the way that I'm
35:11 going to borrow language that would be
35:13 sort of spiritually in the style of
35:16 perhaps how their language might have
35:18 been more primitive or more spiritual
35:22 again you're talking about human beings
35:24 that would have probably believed a lot
35:26 of things that we don't believe today
35:27 and we never really know what people
35:29 believed in 2500 BC but go back to our
35:33 bar in the middle of nowhere in a time
35:36 frame that we're unsure about this could
35:39 be the apocalyptic future like a
35:41 gunslinger series out of Stephen King or
35:45 [ __ ] man it could be somewhere in the
35:47 1850s you don't know and that's
35:52 intriguing
35:53 and that style of writing to leave a
35:55 little bit of empty space is alluring
35:58 the less you know about something the
36:00 more you're interested in it your movie
36:04 star or your singer or musician I should
36:08 say who is doing it tell all constantly
36:11 constantly in People magazine constantly
36:14 taking you know 12 interviews a year if
36:16 not 24 interviews a year you're not as
36:20 interested in that person as you are
36:22 someone who's very secretive Stanley
36:25 Kubrick was very private when he learned
36:27 the press lies after an interview and
36:30 says whatever they want to send claims
36:32 that they've quoted him Prince had the
36:36 same exact experience they also happened
36:39 to be the masters of their art the top
36:42 of their varies onra and so the more
36:45 mysterious they were the more society
36:48 wanted to know and that became a
36:51 marketing mechanism for Prince and a
36:54 curse for someone like Stanley Kubrick
36:56 we just wanted you to see his films he
36:58 didn't want you involved in his personal
37:00 life but the more time passes in your
37:04 scenes in your sequences the more you're
37:08 going to give off this constant
37:10 frequency
37:13 and that little chant of the words that
37:19 you use as long as you have a style
37:21 which is a constraint on the language
37:23 that you're going to use in your script
37:25 for that particular script it's going to
37:29 develop a frequency that we know as tone
37:32 and that's my designation of it and that
37:35 is so very important how many of you
37:38 seen stranger things
37:40 stranger things constraint themselves as
37:44 constrained themselves excuse me to the
37:47 80s and the the brothers that do that
37:52 show they understood the 80s
37:56 exceptionally well which is kind of
37:57 interesting because I think they're at
38:01 least half a decade if not a decade
38:02 younger than myself which means they
38:04 were literally born
38:05 into the first year of the 80s and maybe
38:09 I'm wrong about that but they they
38:11 understand the 80s beautifully I just
38:14 started season 3 which kind of prompted
38:16 this episode and I will tell you by the
38:18 second episode of stranger things season
38:21 3
38:23 there's an amazing recreation of the 80s
38:26 and it's funny because it is a
38:28 recreation not only the the actual
38:31 events of the 80s that I experienced as
38:33 a kid myself but the the sort of Fast
38:36 Times at Ridgemont High feel of like the
38:39 Sherman Oaks mall that has a tone so
38:43 it's sort of a caricature uptick of what
38:46 it used to be as masterful writing
38:51 masterful directing the set design is
38:54 just spot-on it makes me feel over and
38:59 over and over as I'm watching it second
39:01 to second like they teleported back to
39:04 the 80s and did it it's really amazing
39:07 besides everything being HD you know but
39:10 they're doing amazing job on that show
39:12 now there'll be different requirements
39:15 for your style and tone some of it may
39:19 not ever surface in your script your
39:21 junior writer of lead sooner than later
39:24 going to be more of a expert writer and
39:26 then a master writer but let's say you
39:28 pick something that's very sort of
39:30 modern-day 2019 you're handing it in
39:34 it's a story about 2019 and it's really
39:37 about the human condition let's just say
39:39 some romance between two people some
39:42 event that is very none you know
39:45 fantastic in terms of explosions and
39:48 spaceships coming from somewhere or
39:50 timetraveler some crazy you know
39:52 paranormal thing it's just a beautiful
39:55 story well in that case your only style
39:59 would be to keep it as real as possible
40:02 to not say things that people don't say
40:05 because let's face it if you're a writer
40:07 we write things that we never say like
40:11 Robert McKee said he goes only [ __ ]
40:14 used to word utilize he says that in his
40:16 class that gets funny
40:18 he obviously is not talking about
40:20 technical documentation but technical
40:23 documentation is not screenwriting
40:25 screenwriting is the real-life portrayed
40:29 perhaps in an artistic way in the
40:32 science fiction piece I'm about to write
40:34 here I'm going through the actual scene
40:36 design right now it's a script I've been
40:38 working on for 20 years in the
40:40 background it's going to need a very
40:45 specific style but more importantly it's
40:49 going to need an extremely specific tone
40:51 I need to control within my action and
40:56 especially my set description of each
41:01 scene because there's gonna be a lot of
41:03 exotic locations in this and I need to
41:06 work quickly because I don't want to
41:07 lose a giant portion of my page economy
41:11 which is 120 pages two descriptions of
41:16 the environments I also don't want to
41:18 bore anyone so if I'm taking a moment
41:21 out to say this is the reason this is
41:23 the way this room looks this is the
41:25 design of the room the finishes where
41:28 the lighting is to make sure that IP
41:31 need your brain what I'm seeing in my
41:32 head I gotta make it quick
41:35 one of the classics things that people
41:37 will figure out when they're trying to
41:39 determine their style is one you have
41:43 the style of the narrator and you are
41:47 narrating the script between prose
41:50 between the dialogue breaks one of the
41:54 toughest things you learn and have to
41:56 learn over time is making sure every
42:01 character feels like a different person
42:03 but they don't all communicate the same
42:06 way on the easier ways to do this is to
42:12 give each character some specific words
42:15 that aren't abused but only that
42:18 character uses those words and I'll just
42:22 give you a little trick secretly you
42:26 repeat those words in an interval that's
42:29 farther than about far enough apart and
42:32 their dialogue breaks but no one notices
42:35 it's repeated consciously but they
42:37 subconsciously link those words are
42:39 phrases to that character the more you
42:44 can separate your characters the more as
42:46 a reader you will feel phenomenal or
42:51 you'll make the reader feel phenomenal
42:52 in the experience because without trying
42:55 they will feel like these characters are
42:57 very separate beings and if you're
43:03 starting out you might actually get a
43:05 little broad stroke with this technique
43:09 and create sort of a caricature of your
43:10 characters you can always tone back
43:12 right you can go to level 10 or 11 and
43:14 tone it back but you make a character
43:18 that is sort of flamboyantly one way for
43:24 instance in Star Trek up until the well
43:28 you go next generation up til Enterprise
43:30 at Enterprise they balanced it out a
43:32 little bit and I actually appreciated
43:33 this but in enterprise a next generation
43:37 or sorry in next generation starting at
43:39 87 you had this character Riker and
43:42 Rikers entire purpose is to be the
43:45 conflicting force he loses his cool more
43:49 often and they did a good job making him
43:51 usually very justified but he will tell
43:53 you go F yourself pretty quick if you're
43:57 doing something he thinks is not for the
44:00 greater interest of the ship but now
44:04 think about Picard Picard was this
44:07 British refined in real life he's a
44:10 refined actor so they wrote the dialogue
44:12 really in sync with a lot of the acting
44:14 he had done and from his I think his
44:16 movie debut in 80 81 or 83 or whatever
44:21 Excalibur was made but he was always the
44:26 voice of reason the voice of deep wisdom
44:29 counselor Troi she was the empath she
44:33 was the mother she was always the one
44:35 with the soothing perception of what's
44:37 going on then data data was absolutely
44:42 as monotone as could be and he simply
44:45 stated
44:45 fact is often easy pop possibly could
44:48 and sometimes to an extent the people
44:51 when okay okay you can stop talking
44:52 outright Worf coming in as a Klingon
44:56 absolutely a warring race to die in
45:00 battle was the Honorable way to go and
45:03 they were always trying to seek that
45:05 story arc to the end of their life
45:08 beautiful individual stylistic design
45:13 and as a writer of that show obviously I
45:17 never wrote for that show but it must
45:19 have been easier to distinguish what
45:23 each character would say because the
45:26 differences in their very character
45:28 design was so distinct and that's what
45:31 you want as you are perfecting this
45:33 thing we call style within the prose of
45:36 your character now when you get into
45:38 like Voyager you have characters that
45:45 are subtly different in some cases you
45:50 have maybe two nice guys and with two
45:53 nice guys talk Wow how do you keep them
45:55 apart from each other how do you make
45:56 them feel like they're different well
45:59 there's gonna be constraints on your
46:00 character one character would always do
46:02 this and the erika other character would
46:04 never think about doing that so there's
46:06 personality differences that create this
46:08 distinction the define your style
46:13 you wouldn't think about a rubber ducky
46:15 being in the movie star wars would you
46:17 that would be a blatant error in the
46:20 universe of Star Wars
46:22 well that blatant example of it being
46:27 completely wrong should give you the
46:29 guiding principle in your mind of how to
46:31 find those distinctions and you're more
46:35 subtle differences between characters
46:37 one of the tricks I use when writing my
46:42 scene setups and then my action is I
46:46 tried to think of someone even if it's
46:48 faceless not an actor but some of you
46:52 might want to pick an actor or pick some
46:55 personality maybe you have an Orson
46:56 Welles in mind who's telling your story
46:59 maybe it's Morgan Freeman's telling your
47:01 story
47:04 whoever keep that character in mind
47:07 give that narrator a constraint to
47:12 define what would be said how will we be
47:15 said over time you know that if Orson
47:20 Welles read any book to you especially
47:22 like the old classics Tom Sawyer or
47:26 Charles Dickens novel it would feel big
47:29 and amazing just his voice and the way
47:32 he would read it to you would be
47:33 phenomenal well hand the same books to
47:37 Robin Williams and have him read it to
47:38 you maybe a whole different experience
47:40 wouldn't it even if the words are
47:45 constrained on the page just their
47:48 delivery would make it completely
47:49 different but that's not the way it is
47:52 they in your script will choose the
47:55 words they're reading what actually took
47:58 place and then they're turning to you
47:59 and paraphrasing it in their own
48:01 language and over time you're going to
48:04 get a Orson Welles tone that hopefully
48:07 is your goal if that's what you're
48:08 looking for now I am making this episode
48:12 because what I'm about to head into is
48:14 going to be heavily constrained by or I
48:19 should say excuse me
48:20 the it's success will be determined
48:22 almost ultimately by obviously me
48:27 putting together good premise and a good
48:28 story I'm going to assume I can
48:31 accomplish those broad stroke
48:36 requirements of writing this particular
48:37 script but in the end it is going to be
48:41 utterly digested or thrown into the
48:43 trash based on my style and tone that
48:47 I'm defining about what I'm writing so
48:51 let's talk about the so let's do a quick
48:55 review when you're talking about the
48:58 style of your action and your scene set
49:02 up because your prose are going to be
49:04 determined by the constraints you have
49:06 on your characters as we just defined
49:08 that's a little bit easier not always
49:11 completely easy but
49:13 the place where people get I think
49:15 confused and where I was confused for
49:16 for a decade at least was how do I make
49:21 my scene set up and my action I have a
49:26 particular constraint let me just throw
49:29 this at you haven't you heard someone
49:30 speak who you think is articulate and
49:33 for whatever reason the words that they
49:36 pick are not too big to exhibition a big
49:39 vocabulary they're not trying to brag
49:44 passively by using giant words they just
49:48 sound comfortable it's almost as if in
49:53 my opinion a good well articulated
49:55 person let's put that way will be
49:57 someone who touches synapse in my brain
50:02 that want to be touched you know if
50:04 you've ever had a massage where people
50:07 will get into a certain area your neck
50:09 or whatever between your toes or
50:10 whatever it's just like oh man and the
50:13 reason why it feels good in my opinion
50:14 is that no one has touched you there
50:16 perhaps ever if ever they've never done
50:20 it in the way that it's being done that
50:22 makes you just melt and that's what I
50:25 think a good I should say a well-written
50:29 passage or someone who's speaking well
50:32 feels like and then you start hearing
50:37 your perhaps classic movies where
50:40 someone is you know portraying a cowboy
50:43 from the past a lot of Twilight zones
50:44 have this beautifully done it's usually
50:47 not the main character there's the old
50:50 Twilight Zone where the the cowboy comes
50:54 back to this town it's almost exactly
50:58 that scenario I gave you at the
50:59 beginning of this episode reads but
51:01 except it's nighttime he's coming into
51:05 this town the town has a really funny
51:06 name I can't remember but it's like you
51:10 know happy town or nice built or
51:12 something like that but he goes to the
51:13 bar and he's his rough tough cowboy very
51:17 famous actors in every single slot but
51:19 he comes in he's fairly well articulated
51:21 but he's got a few words that he
51:22 stumbles on that gives him that cowboy
51:24 feel but as he comes
51:27 to the bar he's got a whole spread of
51:30 guys in there they know him and he's
51:31 supposed to have been tracking down this
51:33 guy and killing him but he never got to
51:35 him and when he finds out the second he
51:37 comes in the bar is that the guy he's
51:38 been tracking and trying to kill or grab
51:43 and bring home Dead or Alive
51:44 is already dead and he's out in a
51:45 graveyard and so they kind of they kind
51:49 of grief him a little bit and say oh you
51:51 didn't get him and you know he thought
51:53 you were really tough you know and so
51:56 the script goes on with they're trying
51:58 to challenge his manhood and whether or
52:00 not he would go out visit the graves I
52:02 bet you won't go visit his grave and the
52:05 story's not completely important in this
52:07 but each character in that bar is
52:11 written brilliantly from absolutely
52:14 broken English - I think there's a drunk
52:18 there's a kiss-up mayor who just talks a
52:21 million miles a minute and he's just
52:23 trying to kiss your ass as much as
52:25 possible and then there's this rough
52:27 tough sort of Wild Bill dude is the main
52:31 guy who's just he's tired he doesn't
52:34 want hearing his crap and he last thing
52:36 he's going to put up with someone
52:37 questioning his manhood I don't know if
52:40 rod wrote that one he probably did but
52:43 rob was a rod serling was an absolute
52:45 master at distinguishing characters but
52:49 one of the words I want to stick into
52:51 your mind because it is a word that I
52:54 find is more accurate in its application
52:57 of writing to achieve this style didn't
53:03 any other word I can put in your head
53:05 and if you're in a writing block
53:08 situation about how to massage the words
53:11 of a particular scene set up especially
53:14 your scene set them or the action that
53:17 is taking place is romantic and I don't
53:23 mean romantic and a love affair sort of
53:26 love story romanticism but there should
53:29 be something romantic about how you are
53:33 putting the words on paper what words
53:35 you're choosing and what I find is the
53:38 more you loosen your grip
53:40 on what you're trying to do the more
53:42 magic just flows out of you it's almost
53:44 as if you were sharing your body with
53:46 some other celestial being that is a
53:48 master writer and you know if you were
53:52 to share if you're to be possessed let's
53:54 just say by some ghosts and they said
53:57 look just stop trying to control your
53:58 body I'm going to script on paper a
54:02 message and they're pemon ship if you
54:05 don't mess with their penmanship you
54:06 don't try to control the hand you just
54:07 relax it you just ride along with it
54:09 it's gonna be the most masterfully
54:12 written script easy to read beautiful
54:15 flowery amazing scripts but the more you
54:18 try to push on top of it starts getting
54:20 scribbly and there's two hands trying to
54:22 control one hand at one time a lot of
54:24 times if you loosen up that's when this
54:27 romantic flow will start to occur and
54:30 what what starts happening is is that if
54:34 you've ever been taught how to dance
54:35 formally you put one hand on the
54:37 shoulder you hold your hands out and
54:38 you're trying to do some malt or
54:40 something any type of step the more you
54:43 try to control the situation you're
54:44 stepping on the other person's foot but
54:47 the more you just relax
54:48 Konnor soul the rhythm of the person who
54:52 knows how to dance the music itself
54:55 flows through you and it's almost as if
54:58 you were born to do it and it comes out
55:01 beautifully and you may even experience
55:03 this which is very interesting you might
55:06 feel like you're losing your
55:07 consciousness a little bit while it's
55:08 occurring and then you'll come back to
55:11 it later and he'll be like god I wrote
55:14 that last night I was in the zone baby
55:18 sometimes you'll be hyper in the zone
55:20 and it's exact inverse experience you
55:23 know every single word to write and it
55:26 seems as if you are like building a wall
55:30 out of bricks and you're laying down the
55:32 cement and the bricks and you're a Mason
55:34 and you're just flying along as you're
55:37 putting this wall together and when you
55:38 get done it is the best work you've ever
55:41 done in your life and the next morning
55:43 you remember every brick you put in
55:46 place you're like damn I'm good you can
55:49 have a day like that in a script and
55:51 then the other day
55:52 you're just clunking along like you
55:53 don't know how to
55:54 walk and chew gum at the same time but
55:57 then there's another advanced element to
56:01 doing either one of these things which
56:03 is something you need to be aware of
56:06 there is style fatigue tone fatigue and
56:13 your script which is why as Robert McKee
56:17 will teach you again you gotta his book
56:19 story just go look up the book called
56:21 story by Robert McKee in cke he is my
56:26 teacher and I hope he'll be your teacher
56:28 as well I say get the book on audio and
56:31 just listen to it to the point you can
56:34 recite it yourself
56:35 but he teaches you about the gap and I'm
56:39 not trying to give you a repeat of a
56:40 lesson I've taught a couple of times of
56:42 different episodes but it's important in
56:43 this discussion
56:44 gaps are things that essentially put
56:50 obstacles between your character and
56:52 what your character wants to do at the
56:57 beginning of your script your gaps might
56:58 be really tiny little things they wanted
57:01 a character's waking up really tired and
57:05 there's this whole ritual of like
57:07 literally just pulling themselves in
57:10 they hit the clock they pull themselves
57:11 out of the bed bedroom they're just
57:14 barely able to brush their teeth they
57:16 haven't gonna screw it they're gonna try
57:18 to comb their hair yet because they're
57:20 not really awake only one eyes open the
57:21 other ones winking and then they get
57:23 into the kitchen and they know they need
57:25 their coffee to wake up and it's gonna
57:27 wholly light up your character and they
57:30 get the little filter out and they put
57:32 in the coffee maker and then they open
57:33 up they get the bag of coffee and they
57:35 pour and only like two drops come out
57:37 and it's not enough to make coffee and
57:39 they're like son of a [ __ ] and without
57:42 saying a word you know that that
57:44 character wanted to make coffee needs to
57:46 make coffee to get this story going and
57:49 if you've ever had a morning like that
57:50 you see a guy having a morning like that
57:52 in a script and you feel it you Impa
57:56 thighs now you're involved in the story
57:58 oh man I've had a morning like that why
58:01 what's gonna happen next and of course
58:02 you go some outrageous thing or whatever
58:04 you're trying to do but let's say this
58:06 script goes
58:08 from that little coffee making
58:10 incidentally perhaps The Hitchhiker's
58:11 Guide to the galaxy where Arthur dents
58:13 just waking up trying to brush his teeth
58:15 before a bulldozer shows up outside and
58:18 tries to knock his house down to make
58:20 room for a bypass of which he's totally
58:23 unaware of freeing any ends up lying
58:28 down in front of a bulldozer and his his
58:33 smoking jacket or his robe or whatever
58:35 it is and he's just trying to stop his
58:36 house from getting torn down he has
58:38 darted you with the guy about what do
58:40 you think you're doing knocking down my
58:41 house things like well hey it's all been
58:43 posted in the posted up at the City Hall
58:46 or whatever and he just starts arguing
58:48 with the guy in the gaps get bigger
58:50 eventually Arthur Dent within the hour
58:54 is on a spaceship earth has been
58:56 destroyed and I was running around with
58:59 a guy named Ford Prefect who's from the
59:01 constellation Betelgeuse wondering what
59:03 he's going to do with the rest of his
59:05 life and the story goes on and on and on
59:12 it's just the gaps get bigger and bigger
59:14 and bigger
59:16 well these gaps and the overall
59:19 structure of a basic screenplay they're
59:22 your friend when it comes to fatigue
59:24 time now I gave you the example about
59:27 picking an actor who might be reading
59:29 the script to you in your mind you're
59:31 just sure you're just really the type of
59:33 stay that's all you're doing you're
59:35 transcribing the words that you're
59:36 hearing out of the universe but if you
59:40 have scenes that are mundane but
59:42 important and funny
59:44 setting up this guy trying to make
59:45 coffee but you know that like guardians
59:48 of the galaxy maybe five seconds later
59:51 he's going to be on a different planet
59:52 shooting lasers and wondering why he got
59:55 there because something crazy happened
59:57 to him you were going to have a style of
60:00 telling the low impact scene and the
60:02 style of telling a high impact scene and
60:05 you're probably going to have maybe
60:07 three to four different species of
60:09 scenes that you're going to write and
60:11 your style is going to determine how
60:14 those things are written what words are
60:17 you going to use
60:18 you've probably heard if you've studied
60:20 any screenwriting with so
60:22 over in an action sequence where you
60:23 need the reader to feel like things are
60:26 speeding up you have to choose really
60:29 small words that way they read but that
60:32 data and then it starts going faster
60:34 because a little three to five letter
60:36 words no big words in an action scene
60:39 try not to do that but down let me give
60:41 you an example you're gonna have
60:45 something like The Matrix happenin
60:47 you're in a matrix action scene in your
60:49 script there's gonna be a super fast
60:51 dialogue scene where everything's being
60:53 set up very quickly if you didn't want
60:55 those cliches scenes with the guys
60:57 putting all the guns on his body and
60:58 tightening his belt buckle and combing
61:00 his hair and put the sunglasses in and
61:03 he goes that gets in a gunfight and
61:06 that's going pretty quick but you want
61:08 to start bullet time
61:10 everything's slowing down or Neil leaned
61:12 back and moved out of the way of all the
61:14 bullets but you want to slow things down
61:17 for that because you're slowing it down
61:18 inside the camera for the audience and
61:21 so maybe you start widening your words
61:23 it's a whole different vocabulary when
61:25 you want to slow down the reader and as
61:28 soon as the bullet time is over what do
61:30 you do you speed it back up by using
61:32 shorter words but you're going to pick
61:34 your words extremely careful now let me
61:39 give you a little trick about words let
61:43 me give you an analogy you're driving
61:46 down the street main thoroughfare of
61:49 wherever you live or there's lots of
61:52 cars all the time if you see a bunch of
61:55 mundane cars bunch of cars between the
61:58 price of maybe fifteen thousand dollars
62:00 and say twenty five thousand dollars
62:03 American and all these little cars pass
62:06 you probably don't notice them probably
62:10 don't notice them at all later comes the
62:12 Lamborghini McLaren a Ferrari all
62:18 top-end models all tricked out with the
62:22 full packages custom paint jobs the
62:24 rotors have special colors in and the
62:26 terior looks wild there's interesting
62:28 people in the cars or maybe you can't
62:30 see in the car are you gonna notice this
62:34 car is more than all the other cars
62:36 obvious answers yes all right
62:41 your words are exactly like these cars
62:44 little teeny tiny words will never be
62:48 remembered by individually by the reader
62:52 they're there to communicate an idea and
62:55 communicate it quickly if you need the
62:58 reader to slow down and start to notice
63:03 some very specific descriptions that you
63:05 have you're literally slowing it down
63:07 maybe it's a wide shot in your screen
63:09 screenplay you don't want to necessarily
63:10 say wide shot you start using bigger
63:15 words and perhaps easy to pronounce
63:18 words that have a little bit more
63:21 implication to them they're a little
63:23 more flowery they're little bit
63:25 multi-dimensional words if I use the
63:28 word ubiquitous hmm that's a fairly
63:31 interesting word
63:32 some people never seen it written on
63:34 paper before if I start using that I'm
63:38 starting to set the scene for you
63:40 something in the scene is ubiquitous so
63:42 I don't think I've ever used that word
63:43 in any of my scripts but if you would if
63:45 we did it'd be very strategic that word
63:48 is sitting out there like the Holy Grail
63:49 is sitting out there like a treasure I
63:52 want you to notice this word because I
63:55 want you to apply this word in its
63:56 meaning
63:57 maybe it's multiple level meeting
63:59 meaning to what we're doing here that's
64:03 obviously a more advanced technique but
64:07 you may need that in your quiver sooner
64:10 than you think and even if you never
64:13 pull out that golden arrow out of your
64:15 quiver just knowing it's there will make
64:20 you understand how to use all the other
64:21 type of arrows you have in your quiver
64:22 all the other words that you use in my
64:27 science fiction script that I'm about to
64:29 indulge myself in for a couple months
64:31 here I'm gonna have to describe very
64:34 specific sets like I said because
64:38 they're extremely important to how this
64:41 entire experience will feel to the
64:43 reader and hopefully if it ever makes it
64:45 to the silver screen how it will appear
64:47 but now I know people like Sidney
64:50 all over sure these amazing production
64:53 designers and I know they're burdened
64:56 with reading the script and translating
64:58 it into a visual art first a storyboard
65:01 then the very specifics of how these
65:04 rooms are designed and I know if I were
65:07 to be talking to them as the director I
65:11 know how to make words extremely
65:16 informative to their minds but not
65:19 constraining to the point where they
65:21 can't design because I put something
65:23 very specific in then that they need to
65:24 ask me a question about I can put in
65:27 colors and tones and surfaces I can talk
65:30 about whether or not their sharp edges
65:32 or smooth edges what if I told you that
65:34 there's a room that houses you know 10
65:40 futuristic machines they're duplicated
65:42 something's got a factory going and
65:43 those machines aren't supposed to exist
65:46 but I say somehow there are no sharp
65:52 edges in this room at all absence of a
65:56 absent of an edge you know something
65:58 like that then now their mind is
66:01 thinking in smooth turns well where are
66:03 edges in rooms well a six walled room
66:06 has corners as the wall meeting the
66:09 floor the wall meeting the ceiling and
66:12 if I tell that reader slash production
66:16 designer slash director that there are
66:18 no straight edges anywhere in this room
66:21 then they start to envision like a
66:25 well-honed chamber it has been
66:29 meticulously designed perhaps we don't
66:32 make rooms like that because it's really
66:33 difficult so if there were a room like
66:35 that it would probably be in the future
66:37 when machinery can pull that off now
66:41 we've been dealing with the fairly
66:43 esoteric notions of the texture of a
66:47 word as it makes your tongue flip around
66:49 inside your mouth that will create a
66:52 tone and you have to determine for your
66:55 language what is going to be considered
66:57 an awkward word or an easy word doesn't
67:01 matter how many syllables it has if it
67:02 runs over smoothly
67:04 then the whole experience is a smooth
67:06 experience it's a very warm place you
67:09 know they designed Mickey Mouse's body
67:12 to be very very soft because corners and
67:18 sharp edges are what cavemen feared the
67:21 most because if you jabbed yourself on
67:23 one of them bumped him with your elbow
67:25 we didn't have hospitals you could go to
67:26 or stitches you could get that could be
67:28 a fatal cut you walk through some water
67:30 and you dive caiman doesn't understand
67:32 any of that stuff he just knows if I
67:33 break my skin I've got to really take
67:36 care of that if I could die so smooth
67:39 edges and smooth surfaces are always
67:43 warm the bosom of a mother is a smooth
67:46 thing he said the two ears of Mickey
67:48 Mouse were designed to look like the
67:49 breasts of a woman I don't know if they
67:51 really intended on doing that but that's
67:53 definitely how it feels in the end isn't
67:54 it Alexis when the Lexus first came out
67:58 the car the back end of the car was
68:00 supposed to be the back end of a woman
68:02 smooth subliminally soft so you would
68:07 feel comforted by it so that's the
68:11 metaphysical properties of the words
68:14 that you choose that are important but
68:17 now there are fairly literal on point
68:20 things you can use which is colours I
68:23 wants to ask my agent I said like do you
68:26 get many scripts that talk about the
68:28 music playing in a scene because I feel
68:30 kind of silly saying that music a
68:33 particular you know other than something
68:34 very blatant like someone's putting
68:36 music in the you know point of the
68:37 jukebox and this song is playing and it
68:39 those lyrics apply to what we're doing
68:40 it's different but sort of a musical
68:43 score note he says yeah you know what it
68:48 does happen more often than you would
68:50 think it doesn't happen a lot in a
68:51 particular script but if you're having a
68:53 feeling that you think we need to feel
68:55 then go ahead and put it in there we'll
68:57 just read past it and if we feel like it
68:59 as a value we'll leave it in there if it
69:02 doesn't we'll have you pull it out but
69:05 there's tone of music one of the ways
69:09 you can study how scripts are written
69:12 it's very interesting is to look at the
69:14 subtitles of your favorite show on TV
69:17 subtitles are you know the words that go
69:19 underneath just in case you haven't
69:21 turned that on in your lifetime okay
69:23 well you'll see things important
69:26 brackets excuse me which is a lot of the
69:28 you know says ether no music is playing
69:30 and uh well maybe that's something you
69:33 throw on your script if you want to
69:35 really control the way this feels to
69:39 movies which I'm not a giant fan of the
69:42 stories but I will say that the the
69:44 music and the scoring is as impeccable
69:47 as it gets would be Tron Legacy and
69:49 Blade Runner 2049
69:51 I just recently watched rewashed Blade
69:53 Runner 2049 and I had to take a phone
69:57 call in the middle of the movie was
69:59 being shown up my um
70:00 smoke shop we bought the DVDs so we
70:04 could see it in 4k but I had to take a
70:06 phone call outside I remember I was on
70:08 the phone call and I was hearing the
70:09 score inside and it was just amazing the
70:14 textures whoever did all that work
70:17 really nailed it you know it's hard to
70:19 beat Vangelis from the from the 1982
70:22 version but if you want to hear perfect
70:24 music you know just listen to the
70:25 soundtrack of Blade Runner back in the
70:27 day but the new one is beautifully
70:31 updated I would give the guy an A+ now
70:35 I've never read the script for 2049 but
70:39 I don't know maybe that person in
70:40 Hampton Fincher decided to put those
70:42 little notes in there to kind of control
70:44 the way you're thinking about things
70:46 someone needed to tell the director it
70:48 was a new are genre that he blew apart
70:51 with like 2008 lights and half the sets
70:56 but whatever as I said before I'm making
71:00 these episodes because I want to see
71:03 great things happen in television now
71:06 the pay services are phenomenal HBO
71:09 stars Amazon Prime they're really coming
71:12 up with some treasures and you know they
71:14 have a lot of junk in there as well but
71:17 you know whatever it's someone
71:19 attempting to make their dream come true
71:21 what might become an exercise of this
71:24 particular episode if you're an existing
71:27 writer and I don't care how professional
71:30 you are
71:31 let's say you have a script that you
71:34 wrote people read it never got bought
71:37 never got option never got made you
71:40 might take what's in this episode blow
71:43 the dust off of it reread it just read
71:46 it sitting in your backyard like I am
71:48 right now and keep notes write write all
71:52 over the damn thing and say wow I told
71:54 the story but I really didn't have much
71:56 of a style at this early point of my
71:58 career go back and rewrite the thing go
72:03 back and rewrite it if you want to be
72:05 really extreme about it open up in a
72:08 nice iMac type monitor you know lansky
72:11 monitor which is all the monitor these
72:13 days but the old one on the right put
72:14 the new one on the left and low on and
72:17 left is blank and just retail the whole
72:21 thing retail the whole thing from from
72:23 scratch and you'll be amazed how much
72:27 new stuff will occur to you new twists
72:29 things you missed I highly recommend in
72:33 order to get this polish to work is you
72:36 have to I've got a buddy of mine who's a
72:39 famous writer and Hollywood very
72:41 accomplished accomplished director etc
72:45 and in his past time he he turns wood
72:51 and this wood takes the crates like
72:58 vessels he turns what I mean late turns
73:01 it and carves it down and he taught me
73:03 how to do it and I've helped him do it
73:05 and I don't have the equipment of my
73:07 house to do it so I always had to visit
73:09 him to pull this off but he and I spent
73:11 several years doing this together but we
73:14 have to get this big old chunky log
73:17 which is metaphorically your concept and
73:20 then we have to do all the course
73:23 chiseling literally take the bark off
73:26 the thing you know you try to chainsaw
73:27 most of it off but then eventually it's
73:29 got this big clunky thing and you have
73:31 to figure out where your Center is and
73:32 we're gonna how you're going to cut this
73:33 thing and use these big-ass chisels
73:35 gigantic ones and you very carefully
73:38 chisel off the thing as you turn it and
73:40 you start to get it into its general
73:42 shape and you flip it around and you
73:45 the inside again very coarse but it's
73:50 wood and as you're turning wood if
73:52 you've never done it before
73:53 logs contain tremendous amounts of water
73:56 if they're fresh and the wood is just
73:59 splattering water all over the wall it's
74:01 splattering you with it usually have to
74:03 wear it like a you know like almost a
74:06 butcher's outfit to keep the water off
74:07 your your clothing and you're just
74:10 covered in shavings and you know usually
74:13 one of us chisels and the other one of
74:15 us is sweeping out the stuff at the same
74:17 time and then we have to put in
74:21 wheelbarrows and toss it in the back and
74:22 then we have to literally use a leaf
74:25 blower and blow it all outside it's
74:26 quite a process but you can't finish the
74:29 vessel the first day you can't because
74:33 something happens to it it dries and
74:37 when it dries it warps and so you have
74:40 this beautiful symmetrical vessel at
74:42 first and then over you have to put it
74:45 in a special bag that absorbs water it's
74:49 a very thick bag with some padding in it
74:51 and it's designed to suck the water into
74:53 the bag and you put it on a shelf and
74:57 he's got hundreds of these things
74:58 stacked on the shelf
75:00 and it warps like crazy and it just sits
75:03 there for a year and they're all
75:05 numbered and dated right so we know
75:07 which one's ever been up there and
75:08 sometimes leave them out there for two
75:09 years and you pull it out of the bag and
75:13 it's all twisted turns dry as a rock
75:15 it's hard as cement and you put it all
75:19 back on the lathe and now you may
75:23 initially use some of the bigger chisels
75:25 but over time you start going down to
75:27 your finer chisels and you just
75:29 beautifully home this thing I was best
75:32 you can
75:32 Yury bore out the inside and you thin it
75:34 to as much as you possibly can because
75:36 when you first put it in the bag it's
75:37 pretty thick because it's gonna warp and
75:39 twist you're gonna need that girth to
75:42 work with the vessel and then what do we
75:46 do we sand it and the sanding takes
75:49 forever but that's where the magic
75:51 really comes in the overall tone of the
75:56 vessel starts to show up
75:58 and then we might stain it and then we
76:02 polish it and then it's done and it is a
76:06 work of art that that process of putting
76:12 it away in the bag is sort of a
76:15 heartbreaking experience when you do it
76:18 because you just worked your butt off
76:20 getting it to that initial shape and you
76:25 can't do anything about it you have to
76:28 wait a year you have to it's a natural
76:31 biological process of pulling out the
76:34 water but boy the satisfaction you get
76:37 when you get to go through the final
76:39 stages and usually it you know the
76:41 sanding can happen others six months
76:42 after you kind of bore it out and get it
76:44 all cleaned up after its dried maybe you
76:47 haven't made the decision about how you
76:49 want to actually stain this thing you
76:50 want to think about it a little while
76:53 maybe you're gonna in late two different
76:55 vessels they might in on each other it's
76:57 all kinds of options you can do your
77:00 script is the same thing when you're
77:04 writing unless you are an absolute
77:07 super-duper professional and sometimes
77:11 you don't have the luxury of having what
77:13 I'm about to say and the gentleman who
77:15 wrote force awakens for the Star Wars
77:17 franchise he if you watch him in the
77:19 making of he'll tell you you only got a
77:21 year and a half to write this
77:22 unbelievable rebirth of one of the most
77:25 massive franchises to exist in film
77:27 history maybe the biggest saga ever told
77:31 in film and you can see the paint on his
77:34 face because I usually take two years to
77:35 write a script and I only got a year and
77:37 a half and you know there was a design
77:39 by committee going on at the same time
77:41 so his input was obviously most likely
77:44 severely hobbled because they tried to
77:47 grab every demographic in the world and
77:48 put it in the script policing every word
77:51 that he said all of his prose but
77:54 sometimes we get too close to our
77:56 scripts too close and we no longer can
78:00 register consciously our style our tone
78:06 as a writer you will get to a point
78:09 where you can see your whole script in
78:11 one second
78:12 it's just like an image that's worth a
78:17 thousand words or ten thousand words or
78:19 a hundred thousand words so you have to
78:22 put it away for a little while go on to
78:25 another script that's why I'm usually
78:27 writing two scripts at once and then
78:30 incubating a third so it ones in scene
78:34 outline mode and the other two are
78:36 usually in some form of dialogue or full
78:42 writing mode what I wrote kou :
78:45 I was done in 2011 and you know the the
78:54 project went cold because chris
78:56 hemsworth got the huntsmen reboot or the
78:59 excuse me huntsman sequel by himself and
79:01 his agent basically said you can't be
79:03 playing a bunch of these kony and kind
79:05 of characters and so they basically
79:06 chose the huntsman over this project we
79:09 were working on which was his concept to
79:11 do and so that whole thing told the
79:15 whole thing dried up
79:16 he'll never I don't think he'll ever see
79:18 that script in his lifetime the the the
79:20 new one I did so I blew the dust off the
79:22 thing two years ago actually about a
79:25 year ago I guess and I spent last year
79:28 rewriting it from scratch I mean gutting
79:32 scenes throwing things out putting new
79:35 things in and I really really I just
79:37 personally one of my child to be fully
79:39 grown because I had written it hastily
79:41 and you know I was embarrassed actually
79:45 when I got back to the version I put
79:46 down but the thing we pitched to the
79:48 studio's was a treatment thank God only
79:52 a few people ever saw the script but I
79:54 rewrote this thing and I think it turned
79:56 out extremely well I introduced new
79:58 characters
79:59 I had a characters that I introduced
80:01 beautifully wrote a few scenes for them
80:03 intended them to make it to the end of
80:05 the script and I completely forgot them
80:07 so I went back and totally re-engineered
80:10 them i sat pacing in my living room for
80:13 hours debating one page of dialogue
80:18 because it was that important to me and
80:21 I literally in the prose I had
80:25 I mean had God's talking to men and
80:27 trying to be trying to pass on an
80:30 extremely important turn in the script
80:32 and it was heavy but I got done with it
80:38 and handed it in to my agent and I told
80:41 him I said look this is just something
80:42 on the side here that I want you to see
80:44 that I can write this different style
80:45 and it's based on me researching lore so
80:48 that shows another talent of mine blah
80:49 blah blah not really handing it in to be
80:52 pitched anywhere although apparently a
80:55 lot of people want to make this script I
80:56 mean they want to make the story not my
80:58 script but I had it in the you know had
81:01 it finished and it's been finished for
81:04 probably a good 10 months now and what
81:08 was interesting about it was about a
81:11 month ago it dawned on me that I had
81:14 missed a very very powerful scene that I
81:19 just completely didn't conceive of and
81:23 the scene I can actually share it with
81:25 you is that coo : is like a a Jesus type
81:29 character 2,500 years before Jesus as
81:32 I've said a few times and other
81:33 screenwriting episodes so he's a demigod
81:36 he has a father who's a God his mother
81:38 was like a Mary but she was the sister
81:40 of the king
81:41 so she's born through the virgin womb of
81:44 a young teenage like a 14 year old
81:48 sister of the king and so again this
81:51 that's why I tell you all the time that
81:53 the virgin birth arc is all over the
81:55 place before Christ ever existed the
81:57 worst rumor to exist to this with that
81:59 way so I tell this whole story where he
82:02 is banished to Alba which is Scotland
82:05 roughly he gets trained by this woman
82:09 lady Sackhoff and he gets he fetches his
82:13 boon he figures out how to master who he
82:15 is she's a mistake she runs him through
82:17 all the tests
82:18 she selfishly uses him to dominate her
82:23 own agenda in the end she loses her
82:26 whole empire because of what she
82:29 believes to be her selfishness with with
82:31 his powers and so eventually he's sent
82:34 back home to defeat the Queen
82:38 meb who was now in a total brawl to take
82:41 over all of Ireland she has effectively
82:43 taken over all of Ireland the king is in
82:46 hiding and he has to come back and take
82:49 the whole place back and through all of
82:53 your perceived and this is a story
82:55 that's told you know I had to adhere to
82:57 the overall big touchpoints that he wins
83:00 you know he basically takes back Ireland
83:03 but there's a point in this story where
83:05 a very sad thing occurs which I won't
83:09 share just in case this thing ever gets
83:10 made be standing with the king and he's
83:13 just honestly he's had a horrible life
83:16 he's had a wonderful life and a horrible
83:18 life but mostly horrible but he knows
83:21 who he is he's got all those powers he
83:23 was unable to stop this really this
83:25 really unfortunate incident from
83:26 happening where someone dies so he's
83:30 standing looking at the pyre with the
83:32 bodies burning on the wood and it sort
83:35 of burned all the way down now and he's
83:37 standing with his king and he's just
83:38 burned out he's like you know he doesn't
83:40 want this life anymore he doesn't want
83:41 this battle anymore he just wants to get
83:43 married have kids and live a normal life
83:46 he has his lover back this girl that he
83:50 fell in love with when he was a kid
83:52 before he got banished he came back he
83:55 reunited with her things are kind of
83:58 looking up he's got one more battle to
83:59 go he doesn't want it he fears all he
84:04 frees he'll die and the scene I had
84:07 forgot to put in the script was at some
84:13 point he should meet his mother his real
84:16 birth mother because he was taken from
84:19 his birth mother and given to a farmer
84:20 to be raised because they weren't sure
84:23 if he was an almond or a blessing and he
84:26 turned into what they think was a home
84:28 and that's why he got banished because
84:29 he has this thing that happens to him
84:31 because he's half god and half man but
84:35 it dawned on me I got so close to the
84:36 script I'd forgotten this pivotal at
84:39 least this touching amazing scene that
84:42 the mother of this boy because now a man
84:45 had never been able to even touch the
84:49 cheek of her own son
84:51 it's a very touching scene I haven't
84:54 written it yet on paper but I've totally
84:56 written it in my brain but she's an old
84:59 woman now
85:00 and I'm not sure you know exactly how
85:02 I'm gonna make him react to it because
85:05 he's estranged from her
85:08 he doesn't seem to walk around missing
85:13 her because he never knew he had a mom
85:14 in the first place really so that's how
85:18 close you can get to a script and miss
85:19 something beautiful which is why I got
85:22 to put these things away and pull them
85:23 out and reread them it's your writing
85:27 you should probably enjoy what you write
85:30 if your story's worth telling and you
85:33 read it again and it sounds like crap
85:35 like my experience well write it again
85:39 when you go to your grave and be like
85:42 well at least my children have been
85:44 manicured beautifully and maybe someone
85:47 will find them and maybe someone will
85:48 make them wouldn't it be nice most
85:51 parents want their kids to get married
85:53 and have kids
85:54 if you leave your kid with a lopsided
85:56 face maybe that won't happen No so get
85:59 in there and straighten everything out
86:00 give them the best chance they have to
86:02 flourish by pouring your heart and soul
86:05 into these things if you are a writer
86:08 I'll just bumper it with some principles
86:10 here that I go by and I apply this to
86:14 all things that people say that their
86:16 passions are all about if you're a
86:20 writer you don't need anyone to tell you
86:23 to write
86:24 you don't need fame or money to write it
86:27 is just something you have to do I enjoy
86:31 making these shows a lot it's so
86:34 multi-dimensional why I love these shows
86:36 the byproduct that is probably the most
86:40 rewarding is one of you watching it and
86:42 enjoying it and letting me know it's
86:45 cool I don't necessarily make the shows
86:48 for you as much as I love your reactions
86:51 to them I make them because I have to
86:52 these are concepts that I want to share
86:54 with the planet when it comes to writing
86:56 I have had a very difficult journey
87:00 getting people to actually teach me
87:02 their tricks
87:03 and even teachers covet some people hold
87:08 out to sell you their services because I
87:10 got to make a living
87:11 I understand that trust me I respect
87:14 that but I think that out of all
87:18 professions and I'm gonna loop back on
87:20 this passion thing in just a second
87:22 you're gonna feel better if you share
87:25 everything you possibly can
87:27 again if ten years from now one of you
87:30 sells a film and I get to go watch it
87:32 and you sent me a little email and you
87:34 say dude I was packing groceries when I
87:37 first heard your episodes on
87:39 screenwriting and I got into the art I
87:42 followed your your suggestions I went
87:45 and got my keys stuff and a few other
87:47 people's stuff took a course online or
87:49 whatever maybe went back to college to
87:50 learn it but I cranked out this film and
87:52 it got made I probably don't even care
87:56 if I like the film or not I'm just gonna
87:57 feel so happy that you got your dream
88:00 that I'm going to relish in it it's
88:03 gonna be fantastic
88:04 so that's sort of why I'm putting these
88:06 things out there no one's gonna look at
88:10 this thing oh that guy's an expert it's
88:12 not gonna do that
88:12 I'm just dude on YouTube whatever it's
88:16 not important to me but you know I have
88:21 said several times in other episodes
88:23 especially the I think one on how to be
88:26 an artist if something is your passion
88:29 again I should be able to go to your
88:32 house your dwelling your domicile and
88:35 find your passion everywhere if you're a
88:40 painter then the art on your wall as
88:44 much as you might enjoy putting up
88:45 someone else's creation should have your
88:47 creation all over the place you should
88:48 surround yourself at least your latest
88:50 gallery if you paint so much that you've
88:53 got hundreds of stuff well I want to
88:55 share it with the world sell it off
88:57 brighten someone else's day but it
89:01 should be everywhere around you whatever
89:02 it is you do maybe technically it's all
89:06 throughout your hard drive you know I
89:08 don't print my scripts out and put them
89:10 on my walls of course but if you looked
89:13 around my house you would find printed
89:15 scripts
89:16 here and there I don't print my stuff as
89:18 much as I used to I probably should
89:21 I hate printer technology just all the
89:26 cartridges that dry up inside the thing
89:28 you haven't even used your printer yet
89:29 it's like I'm out of ain't kids like I
89:30 only print it two pages yeah well I
89:32 evaporate while you're not there give me
89:35 40 bucks it's like feeding this little
89:38 monster right think about how your
89:42 writing develop styles some people write
89:48 the same kind of thing all the time and
89:50 so like a Tarantino even though he's
89:52 jumping around between World War two and
89:54 the 1800s and modern-day gangster films
89:57 the brother has a style and you know if
90:00 if someone put him I'd see two minutes
90:05 of prose from a movie dialog and you
90:09 showed me 20 minutes of random films and
90:12 you told me this secretly one of these
90:16 is a Tarantino film I'll probably stop
90:18 you in 30 seconds ago that's the one and
90:21 then someone is trying to mimic that guy
90:22 and copy his style as long as every
90:25 writer is being true to their own style
90:26 I'm gonna see a Tarantino film in two
90:28 seconds and hope that's him and I'll be
90:31 right and you would be able to do the
90:32 same thing I'm sure so in the end I
90:36 think that you want that capability with
90:39 your audience that they can see and feel
90:42 what you've written Steven Spielberg
90:46 used to have a tone and between Close
90:50 Encounters poltergeists Indiana Jones
90:54 they had this polished on them that was
90:58 just special of course John Williams
91:01 helps quite a bit all the production
91:03 designers help but this is back when
91:05 Studios used to keep employees for 30 40
91:08 years and everyone had their style and
91:12 they could homogenized their employment
91:15 together and go well I take it to this
91:17 stage and then that person takes it to
91:18 the next stage and then the director
91:20 takes it to that stage and then
91:21 post-production takes it to that stage
91:23 and it all feels like a universal
91:24 picture looks like an MGM picture and so
91:28 that used to be why
91:30 films were fantastic and everybody's
91:33 subcontracted out and so things feel
91:35 weird discombobulated that's why you can
91:40 have a great looking film a great
91:43 sounding film but the story is atrocious
91:46 we played Blade Runner 2049 and some
91:49 guys walked out of the hole walked out
91:50 of the middle of film we were two-thirds
91:52 through the film and one of the guys is
91:55 very intelligent just said you know man
91:58 I can't figure out what the hell's going
91:59 on this film I'm out of here
92:00 poof walked out the door another guy
92:02 just walked out because he's bored to
92:03 death you can make something look great
92:06 sound great special effects can be great
92:08 that story sucks
92:10 everyone is just as bored as if you've
92:13 spent $2 on the production remember the
92:17 Blair Witch Project I never saw the film
92:20 all the way through they grabbed a lot
92:23 of people because the story was good it
92:25 was freaky it was weird it's produced in
92:27 a weird way how many old old indie films
92:32 turned into absolute cult classics story
92:35 was good that's all you need remember
92:38 that old stage play the gin game with
92:42 the husband and wife that played the two
92:43 roles story was so rich the whole thing
92:46 happened on a set that was on stage
92:49 filmed that was the movie and it was
92:54 just two people playing gin rummy on a
92:56 fold-out table with fold-out chairs but
92:59 the dialogue was so unbelievable you had
93:03 a tone to the whole experience as it was
93:05 over but each second to second to style
93:07 was so good the grumpy old man was
93:10 constantly getting frustrated because
93:11 the old lady was just he taught the old
93:13 lady how to play the game and she
93:14 immediately just starts kicking his ass
93:15 and he just keeps blowing up and in real
93:18 life they're husband and wife which
93:19 makes it even better but she was sweet
93:22 and round and soft and sharp and jagged
93:24 and you know aggro do you want to create
93:28 those kind of characters individually
93:31 you could pull a character out of a out
93:34 of a film or two characters out of the
93:37 film and just between the two of them
93:39 think about pulp fiction I probably
93:43 can watch two hours of just Samuel
93:45 Jackson and John Travolta driving around
93:49 in a car making stops and just talking
93:52 I bet Tarantino could write that script
93:54 and I'd be totally mesmerised and watch
93:56 it over and over and over and buy it the
93:59 more beautiful you make your experience
94:00 the more people want to see your film
94:02 over and over again and the key Jim with
94:05 that in the studio is they see asses and
94:08 seats they see people buying the rental
94:12 they see people buying the actual
94:14 digital version of it to download and
94:16 it's something they can sell off to
94:18 Netflix every six months or whatever for
94:21 free on Netflix you know with your
94:22 subscription but Netflix will pay them
94:26 ten million dollars to have the film in
94:28 their feet because overall it will
94:30 generate subscriptions that will pay the
94:32 money back
94:34 that's where you become an economic
94:36 benefit to the studios and everyone in
94:39 the food chain it is a business do not
94:42 forget that but if you write a great
94:46 story and you stay true to yourself the
94:49 business will arrive you don't want to
94:52 become a musician because you want to be
94:53 famous you want to become a musician
94:55 because music is what you do the fame
94:59 and the money that will come with it
95:01 don't worry about it so anyway I hope
95:04 you felt this was useful to you love to
95:08 hear your comments if you've gone
