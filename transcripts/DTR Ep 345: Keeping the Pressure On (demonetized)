00:00 [Music]
00:34 good afternoon evening morning ladies
00:38 and gentlemen I am finally up during the
00:41 daytime outside because it's not raining
00:45 cats and dogs is supposed to start
00:47 raining around two o'clock it's about
00:50 nine o'clock in the morning here sorry
00:52 for all the microphone bumping sounds I
00:54 can't hear any microphone bumping sounds
00:56 for those of you haven't recorded before
00:58 so I might bump this thing and I don't
01:00 hear it so I try to keep that from
01:03 happening today I thought we'd just make
01:08 an episode called keeping the pressure
01:10 on and the goal of this episode is to
01:16 talk about the various areas where we
01:18 are starting to apply pressure due to
01:20 the Great Awakening and it's having an
01:25 effect it's having a real good effect so
01:29 what are some of the examples of the
01:31 effects that we're having on what we're
01:34 going to traditionally call the deep
01:36 state a deep state really means means
01:42 several things of course it's the
01:43 banking cartel at the very very top of
01:45 the pyramid and all their satanic
01:48 sociopathic psychopathic horseshit that
01:50 they do to corrupt their children and
01:52 society and hurt our kids to literally
01:56 feed their you know Fountain of Youth
01:58 and their get their rocks off it is then
02:04 the layers that report to them because
02:08 they're ultra scumbags
02:09 that'll take a paycheck to completely
02:13 spite themselves right so you have in
02:17 the past we've had government people
02:19 still a ton of Democrats who are still
02:22 doing it still some Republicans doing it
02:24 Europe I have really no clue I think
02:27 anyone who's for the European Union is
02:29 suspect I think anybody who's against
02:32 brexit is suspect anyone who's for
02:34 Ireland and Scotland having anything to
02:36 do with the Great Britain or you you
02:39 know the UK in general or so there's a
02:41 cut-off there and I can never remember
02:44 it reporting to the Queen
02:47 but that way they're potentially same
02:50 problem same problem with Canada anybody
02:52 wants to be reporting to some [ __ ]
02:54 monarchy is definitely suspect anyone
02:59 who hangs out with as I always say the
03:01 spirit cooking lady your lady gaga's who
03:05 I don't know what the [ __ ] is up with
03:07 this chick I mean I don't know her
03:09 personally but I know that she's into
03:12 that [ __ ] Katy Perry's into Satan
03:14 Satanism friend of mine kid asked Miley
03:17 Cyrus if I want to be just like you what
03:20 do I do and the chick said get into
03:22 Satan
03:24 she's married to a Hemsworth I just
03:27 can't imagine that family being that
03:28 deluded but you know women will do it to
03:31 you sometimes Robert De Niro all these
03:34 people hanging out with these scumbags
03:37 so I think you feel me you know and then
03:40 you have your indoctrinated citizen who
03:42 researches nothing knows everything and
03:44 I get so goddamn frustrating right it's
03:50 almost as if it's like okay unless
03:52 you've done some form of research I mean
03:54 some form of research unless you're
03:58 gonna ask me a question about research
03:59 and how to go get some better
04:01 information or you want to have a
04:02 download session don't even talk don't
04:05 even [ __ ] mention your opinion unless
04:08 you're mentioning it from the press from
04:09 the perspective of saying I'm not
04:12 talking to you guys but you know you
04:13 talk to these people but the idea is you
04:16 know you can say hey my opinion before
04:18 research feels like this and it's like
04:20 oh that's really valuable aside from
04:23 that you know there's very little
04:26 authority whether then maybe a
04:28 scientific Authority say well I
04:30 graduated from college in this and and I
04:33 use this math every day in chemistry or
04:35 an architecture and it seems to work
04:37 great and any time we negate the
04:40 education structures fall bombs explode
04:44 you know it's a bad thing so you've got
04:45 okay good you have awesome Terkel
04:48 knowledge that's great but this episode
04:51 is about keeping up the pressure how
04:53 many of you love the idea that NASA is
04:58 [ __ ] pineapples man
04:59 and it's really really interesting
05:02 because JPL gets to sit on the sidelines
05:04 that basically take no criticism because
05:05 the only thing anyone ever says is NASA
05:07 we say JPL Jack Parsons laboratory
05:11 friend of Allison Aleister Crowley
05:14 father Barbara Bush but they keep
05:17 announcing horseshit oh we're going back
05:21 to the moon we're gonna go back to moon
05:22 tomorrow we're building a [ __ ] moon
05:24 base you know the only thing they
05:26 haven't said at NASA in the years that
05:30 I've been alive is that we've already
05:31 built a base or some other big [ __ ]
05:34 lie right of course they said they
05:36 landed which they never did at least
05:38 between 69 72 look at the deep state
05:42 attack Cuban on we're gonna talk about
05:45 cueing on a little bit maybe I'll lead
05:46 off with that dude first but it is
05:50 fantastic the way this guy has got these
05:53 people scared shitless I don't even know
05:56 if they know if he's real or not on the
05:58 deep state side think about every single
06:01 executive who's maybe in their 70s today
06:04 they've been writing that gravy train of
06:08 utter ignorance in the world where
06:10 nobody understood banking nobody
06:12 understood their scams their
06:14 boom-and-bust cycles of the orchestrate
06:16 no one was able to get the real history
06:19 of how these things have ever gone down
06:22 right the intentional retraction of
06:25 currency in 1929 the calling on all the
06:29 loans to say you owe us this money right
06:31 now and we know you can't borrow it so
06:34 whatever that note is that covers that
06:36 asset that shit's ours now
06:39 right the Rothschilds and the pay sewers
06:43 and the sex gothe burg and the Hapsburgs
06:45 they've all been able to hide until
06:49 recently last 15 years or so it's
06:53 awesome right so there's a lot of people
06:56 that just are nervous at that age
06:58 bracket because the jig is up I mean
07:00 they have tons of money but they also
07:02 know it was all ill-gotten gains and so
07:04 they're just kind of hoping they can
07:06 hide in the world and die before they go
07:08 to [ __ ] Gitmo well let's start with Q
07:11 because
07:12 what a [ __ ] weird phenomenon that
07:15 that whole movement is the queue anon
07:17 movement on one level it is the most
07:20 elating situation that mankind has had
07:25 in probably 250 years since the 1770
07:31 since literally the last bullet was
07:32 fired during the Revolutionary War in
07:35 America I mean I'm only speaking from
07:37 American's standpoint I do apologize to
07:39 my European listeners or other locations
07:42 but we have a reversal it would seem in
07:46 the attitudes globally as a results of
07:49 queuing on I mean queue and ions all
07:51 over the yellow vests about every single
07:53 one of them but a lot of them there's
07:55 all these protests all over the world
07:56 and Iceland and England and Scotland
07:59 it's like you name the country someone
08:01 has stood up with a queue one on banner
08:03 so tell me this is fake right I mean you
08:10 know it's it's what I think so when I he
08:13 just posted you know he was quiet for a
08:14 long time and he just started posting
08:16 again thank God and he said you know our
08:18 time to be in the public is once again
08:21 here and he posts all these random
08:26 photographs from looks like China could
08:28 be Hong Kong could be some other
08:29 location and then and this is where I
08:33 started to see something I haven't seen
08:34 before because I keep trying to parse
08:37 queue and on on the level not that it
08:39 matters tremendously but whether or not
08:43 the dude is fake whether or not he's
08:45 doing a [ __ ] cold reading or [ __ ] warm
08:48 reading a cold reading just to kind of
08:50 refresh your guys is if you sat down to
08:54 have your fortune read and you kept your
08:58 mouth shut you kept your expressions
08:59 sterile no one ever talked to them about
09:01 you before you went in the room but even
09:03 know your name I can't really determine
09:06 your age you gave them no information
09:09 you even sat behind some confession
09:12 booth it's just random picking very
09:16 stereotypical emotions that someone
09:18 might be going through they will
09:21 literally look at the time of year if
09:22 you came in during Christmas they would
09:25 think that you are
09:26 potentially suicidal because if you had
09:29 a family you would be talking to them
09:32 usually only talk to a psychic when you
09:34 want to hear a solution so there's all
09:36 these formulas that they know that
09:37 you're doing then the warm reading is is
09:41 you give them information and then boy
09:43 they're [ __ ] experts men experts and
09:46 those of you who are decent in
09:47 conversation with another human being
09:49 you're also a warm reader as well
09:50 you're empathetic to other people and so
09:53 you're able to to predict what's gonna
09:57 be said next right so what a Q do he put
10:00 out a bunch of photographs of just
10:03 random [ __ ] you know virtually no
10:07 intelligible dialogue around these
10:09 photographs it's a bunch of like [ __ ]
10:11 code ring horseshit you know F 30 22
10:15 packet download upload utter that's like
10:17 why even post that [ __ ] dude
10:18 because he says he's talking to his
10:20 other QQ members it's like really okay
10:23 highly unlikely okay but then what did
10:26 he do every single time he posts an
10:29 image he has the choice of turning on a
10:31 750 post reply from the public here
10:37 comes the warm reading well let's just
10:39 see what the [ __ ] they think about this
10:40 thing and he took a clock at 17 or hers
10:43 actually sorry was 7 o'clock and you
10:49 know trying to say it's 17 all this
10:51 other stuff so he gets all this
10:53 information and people are implying
10:55 things and wondering things and you know
10:57 there's a woman getting in a car and one
10:59 of the shots and they likened it to one
11:01 of the Asian senators that we have our
11:05 House reps I don't know what the hell
11:06 this woman is and so then the guy can
11:09 jump off on that right he can get into
11:11 this situation now maybe the guy is
11:12 fully legit and these are super [ __ ]
11:14 important things but a good friend of
11:17 mine made a really good point and she
11:20 said because she hadn't really gotten
11:23 into queueing on she's an extremely
11:25 brilliant human being and she said why
11:28 would this guy give away a bunch of
11:30 Intel ahead of time ever even insinuate
11:34 anything that's about to occur because
11:36 that shows their hand and if they're
11:39 really trying
11:40 win this battle why would you ever do
11:42 that now maybe the answer is simply to
11:46 get this awakening going such that the
11:48 world is participating because a
11:50 president and an Intel committee and the
11:53 military if they did it completely by
11:55 themselves it may look like a coup it
11:58 may look like a really negative thing
12:00 and then all the pedophiles and crazy
12:02 people
12:03 the bankers and all these [ __ ]
12:05 scumbags could spin it in a way that
12:09 Trump looks like he's being a dictator a
12:12 real dictator and by queue releasing the
12:15 sort of the bowels of the deal we're
12:18 kind of we now have rationales as to
12:20 what's going on
12:22 what's also very interesting about the
12:24 queuing movement is that for any of you
12:26 who have ever been online in you know on
12:29 YouTube for the last 20 years or since
12:30 it was really formed you have a
12:35 community of very interesting people
12:36 right every type of person in the world
12:39 is online right the people that seem to
12:42 be making money
12:43 I shouldn't actually say that but they
12:46 are making money these individuals who
12:49 are really reporting on the queue
12:51 movement and doing a really exceptional
12:53 job reporting on it
12:55 I think the pursuit of truth is probably
12:56 my favorite queueing on channel the
12:59 dudes great highly recommend that guy
13:02 he's funny and he's probably one of the
13:05 best best personalities online to read
13:09 to you an article because a lot of these
13:10 guys will just scroll through articles
13:12 like if Q references some post somewhere
13:16 this guy is quick he reads accurately he
13:18 doesn't transpose words but these people
13:21 like the pursue deters guy I don't even
13:23 know what his real name is he super
13:27 intelligent super articulate he isn't
13:31 spinning things he's just reading he
13:34 does his research he gets into things I
13:37 think most of time his first pass on a
13:40 series of posts from Q are the most
13:42 accurate interpretation and he's doing
13:44 this [ __ ] real-time which is really
13:46 phenomenal but he's so up on everything
13:48 that he really keeps his ducks in a row
13:51 so the Q and a movement
13:54 has power as a live-action role-playing
13:56 exercise as real as I've always said I'm
13:58 sorry I sound like a little bit of a
14:00 little bit of a broken record one you
14:02 have to understand you people are
14:03 joining the program but to something we
14:06 need to remember when we can we hear
14:08 that cliche crap it is interesting
14:11 though that I will say that depending
14:14 how on how old you are
14:16 Kuban on either sinks in it makes sense
14:19 immediately because it's almost like the
14:21 words are being crafted and orchestrated
14:25 in a way that the younger generations
14:28 we're just sitting there going oh yeah
14:31 okay that's that's exactly what I wanted
14:33 to know thank you
14:34 again we're still going to debate
14:35 whether or not anything is true
14:37 thank you that really helps out and
14:39 again if Q is a LARP created by people
14:43 that run fortune okay and the rumor is
14:45 the fortune is run by the United States
14:47 government and if that's the case then
14:48 this dude's probably very legit he is
14:51 either a PSYOP or a real deal right so
14:55 what could he be if he's a LARP if he's
14:57 a LARP than what he's doing is he's
14:58 reading the news very intelligently and
15:01 piecing things together and creating a
15:02 fictional story or sort of an insinuated
15:05 this is probably what's going on in the
15:07 background
15:09 however he has proofs right he has
15:12 things that have occurred Donald Trump
15:14 last night just posted the great
15:16 awakening of the United States of
15:17 America well when you go to 4chan it's
15:19 for dot or for CH dot he gets or calm
15:23 whatever and then it's the great
15:25 awakening was where Q's whole posts
15:28 headquarters originally started all
15:33 right I mean there's all kinds of things
15:35 people but you know there was this other
15:38 thing that Ruth Ruth Bader Ginsburg the
15:44 [ __ ] skeleton that we were propping
15:48 up it's like we stole a [ __ ] prop out
15:50 of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland and
15:52 then we're just putting it in the
15:53 Supreme Court and pretty no attention to
15:55 this [ __ ] thing that's not even human
15:57 anymore he did really heavily [ __ ]
16:00 insinuate that the chick had died and
16:02 then this morning he posted well watch
16:04 how the mass media will say that we said
16:07 that
16:07 she died that we used the word death in
16:10 quotes right and it's like yeah you did
16:11 you [ __ ] said she was dead I mean
16:13 that's exactly what you insinuated which
16:16 is why the whole [ __ ] internet
16:17 exploded when she was dead so he does
16:20 that too and but you know what maybe
16:22 there's value right you know poor Alex
16:27 Jones this guy I I don't know I don't
16:31 know how this guy is in court for
16:33 something that seems like a hoax
16:35 why doesn't he push all the Sandy Hook
16:36 evidence into discovery and defend
16:38 himself right but you know we're
16:42 questioning his legitimacy cue said that
16:45 he was a Mossad agent or at least
16:47 insinuated probably you know what every
16:49 guy keeps his one [ __ ] foot out of
16:51 every piece of truth I didn't say that
16:53 well you know technically I didn't say
16:54 that you know say you did [ __ ] say
16:56 that [ __ ] you know that's the thing
16:58 about cue that [ __ ] just bothers me
17:00 it's like stop being one of those guys
17:04 right well technically I didn't say yeah
17:08 yeah okay dude you called me an [ __ ]
17:13 well technically some parts of the world
17:16 like [ __ ] anyone say whatever dude
17:19 what alex is going down the tubes they
17:22 are trying to ban his vitamin supplement
17:24 thing which is something I never like to
17:27 see him sell in the first place but I
17:28 know he's got to survive whatever but
17:30 the guy is just being cut off and gagged
17:32 it's unbelievable but what's clear and
17:35 this is where we have these issues right
17:37 and this is why I like to correct my
17:41 mistakes as quickly as possible either
17:43 in future videos or taking a video down
17:44 or redoing a video you know Alex lies
17:47 and he calls his organization Infowars
17:52 which i think is interesting well what
17:54 if you were fighting an information war
17:56 hmm I think you'd have to lie every once
18:00 in a while wouldn't you and so there's
18:02 this weird sort of catch-all that this
18:08 information exists in order to
18:10 manipulate your enemy you make them
18:12 scatter you make them think that you are
18:14 where you're not and you just you know
18:17 essentially you come at them from all
18:18 sides it's like an apparition that keeps
18:20 showing up no matter where
18:21 you run in your house and butt your butt
18:23 the apparition only really exists in one
18:26 area of your house but they can make you
18:28 believe that it there everywhere I think
18:31 anyone in the Q realm would have to play
18:33 that game now in terms of Alex Jones I
18:37 seriously don't know why the guy threw
18:40 down so hard on cue so quickly and he
18:43 was just right away because this is all
18:45 [ __ ] and I talked to the guy talked
18:47 to cue or I talked to the cue team and
18:49 you're like oh really
18:51 and they cues like nobody is
18:54 representing me I am this is the only
18:56 place that I post I don't talk to anyone
18:58 else there's no other voice for me now
19:00 some people would say Joe em on either
19:03 Instagram or Twitter I think it's
19:05 Twitter who's posting all these JFK
19:07 voice look-alikes or sound-alikes videos
19:10 that are basically the whole queue
19:11 movement that's not absolutely true but
19:15 it's safe to say Alex didn't talk to
19:16 anyone in the queue team and hey
19:19 outrageous claims require outrageous
19:22 evidence right and it's interesting how
19:26 it all coincided with his demise he came
19:30 down against cue really hard
19:32 said he was fake and then kaboom social
19:36 media CEOs did something that's
19:39 basically unconstitutional they said no
19:43 more free speech on our service ok so
19:45 what's the difference between me being
19:47 on Facebook and posting something again
19:52 we're not talking about obscene vulgar
19:54 or you know snuff films and stuff that's
19:59 illegal right but just expressing your
20:01 opinion based on Intel based on whatever
20:04 conversations you've had with people
20:05 nothing illegal with that and they
20:08 censored him so what's the difference
20:10 between that and selling a house and
20:11 saying oh I'm gonna sell this house for
20:14 this price but not to any of those brown
20:17 people right those yellow people and
20:19 there's red people well that's against
20:21 the law in America you can't
20:22 discriminate when you sell a home it's
20:25 an equal opportunity thing it's stamped
20:27 on every single piece of real estate
20:29 that ever comes around right so why is
20:32 that enforceable over there and not
20:34 enforceable
20:35 in the normal realm of things right yes
20:38 it's a private company bla bla bla but
20:40 when you put yourself out there is a
20:42 public utility that's free no cost
20:45 you're in the realm of freedom of speech
20:47 you want to charge money for it
20:48 Oh make your own rules and you got to
20:51 pay to be behind the door okay but the
20:54 cue a non movement is keeping the
20:56 pressure on these people and it's
20:59 beautiful because I mean whoever thought
21:01 this thing up is ingenious because
21:04 either they knew that well I was for
21:08 this way I'll give you a good example
21:11 what have I been trying to do this whole
21:12 this whole show since 2015 what have I
21:16 tried to do I've tried to wake everybody
21:18 up try to make them think try to offer
21:22 every piece of wisdom and intelligence
21:24 that I've either gathered from other
21:26 people which is the majority of it or
21:28 I've deciphered and gathered or what
21:30 have you maybe some stuff I've
21:31 discovered because I want the world to
21:33 be a better place and I want everyone to
21:35 be empowered to do whatever the hell
21:36 that they want to do and to know right
21:38 from goddamn wrong right and to stop
21:42 allowing these people to you know soften
21:46 your edges when it comes to crime okay
21:50 so what do I have 3500 listeners god
21:53 bless every single one of you but look
21:55 at Qs movement I don't know if the guy
21:58 had a YouTube page
21:59 he would have millions and millions like
22:02 tens of millions of subscribers the guy
22:05 would blow any celebrity subscription
22:08 count on YouTube I would imagine or any
22:11 other service the guy posts a post and
22:15 we get 750 replies right okay so that's
22:19 over in because then it limited it
22:22 rejects all the replies well 750 is done
22:25 and like I don't know 3 minutes 2
22:27 minutes 3 minutes that's how many people
22:30 are watching and responding quickly
22:31 people are preparing their posts ahead
22:33 of time for anyone that says anything
22:36 remotely intelligent in those posts it's
22:38 phenomenal now why they don't go in and
22:40 knock out shitty posts I don't know you
22:44 have like a guy that will just replies
22:45 with like the number 4 it's like knocked
22:47 that [ __ ] post out of there so
22:49 post a bunch of porn [ __ ] in there knock
22:51 that post out let someone come in who's
22:53 got something to say right but the big
22:56 thing is about fortune and a Chan is
22:57 it's a the last location where the
23:01 freedom of speech truly exists and it's
23:03 true it's they don't stop you man
23:05 it does look like they prune the the
23:08 porn out of there eventually because
23:09 what what a movement you've got porn
23:13 right next to I mean it's not like
23:14 contact porn but it's like nude people
23:17 all kinds of weird memes and stuff but
23:19 anyway this dude created if that's for
23:25 this way if he was fake
23:27 he's more brilliant than if he was real
23:29 because the movement is so absolutely
23:31 gigantic now it is the single most
23:34 successful social media thing that's
23:36 ever occurred if it's fake now if it's
23:39 real then there's legitimate reasons why
23:40 people are interested because the Intel
23:42 is actually correct as cryptic as it
23:44 might be it's correct it is predicting
23:46 the future it would seem how let's just
23:50 do a little thing here how I don't know
23:54 I want to use the word terrified but how
23:56 [ __ ] mind blown was Makran to see the
24:00 yellow vests protests all over France
24:04 especially Paris right and how
24:09 unbelievably mind-blown was this guy
24:11 when he looked at the back looked at
24:13 photographs of these people because he's
24:15 hiding in some [ __ ] probably some
24:17 island in some other location when he
24:19 sees photographs of Cuban on on the back
24:22 of yellow vests on the front of yellow
24:24 vests people holding yellow are holding
24:26 banner signs with queue on it the
24:29 capstone the I capstone pyramid with the
24:32 big [ __ ] pair of scissors jammed in
24:34 the eye with Q on the pyramid you know
24:37 like we're crushing you that's power
24:41 dude you talk about pressure holy [ __ ]
24:44 that is like what could I do in the
24:47 backyard of my house here to Creek that
24:50 kind of pressure nothing right I mean
24:53 something would have to happen somewhere
24:55 right but they probably gagged the
24:56 channel kick me off look through honey
24:58 you said something about this and then
25:00 so your hates B cheer the [ __ ] out of
25:02 here right
25:02 I'm trying to get on this service as
25:06 someone sent me called Brighton it's a B
25:09 righ t EO n I think that they will not
25:13 reply
25:14 they've got Alex Jones up there they're
25:17 really looking for that super shock jock
25:19 stuff I was gonna say [ __ ] but
25:21 whatever they really I don't know I'm
25:24 trying to get them to understand look
25:26 not everything that's on your channel on
25:28 your little side here has to be this
25:31 alex jones thing you need just
25:34 straight-up shows that make people think
25:36 right so I've had a couple people
25:41 suggest that to me and I just I always
25:43 have to say look these organizations are
25:46 not as legit as you think right so when
25:49 they don't reply at all I tend to think
25:53 there's just another deep state [ __ ]
25:55 condom out there pretending to be
25:57 rebellious you know so we'll see if they
26:00 reply apologies if they ever do take us
26:04 on I'm holding out for Kim comms new
26:07 platform that dude is legit and he's
26:11 suffering the slings and arrows of the
26:13 five eyes in New Zealand
26:15 and he's not a perfect human being but
26:18 that makes it more knowledgeable in my
26:20 opinion I don't think he engages in the
26:23 crap that they do right so let's look at
26:26 NASA let's move over NASA just keeps
26:31 well put this way because of my interest
26:34 in NASA for probably the last I mean I
26:37 would say I have been actively looking
26:40 at everything NASA since the internet
26:42 boomed right but again before them
26:46 you know I a s--t college classes in
26:49 astronomy and without taking a [ __ ]
26:51 note I got more than a hundred percent
26:53 in the class right and that's because I
26:56 study everything that they do I mean you
26:58 know before 1995 without the internet
27:02 just right there and knowing how to
27:03 really get into it you know Google
27:04 didn't exist so we had Alta Vista and
27:06 Yahoo and all the originator originators
27:08 the OGS of the internet you know it was
27:12 like there was you know everyone was
27:13 moving their analog data to the internet
27:16 or the
27:16 digital data to the Internet was gonna
27:19 take a really long time and so it took
27:20 another 10 years to 2005 before we
27:23 really just were able to search on
27:24 things right but I can tell you right
27:27 now by having that history with with
27:29 NASA they're freaked out
27:33 they are just flooding the internet with
27:37 all these interviews with these you know
27:40 these astronaut actors they're trying to
27:44 push out as much ISS footage as they
27:46 possibly can and thus they have tons of
27:50 [ __ ] mistakes the guy that flies by
27:51 on a [ __ ] harness oh really
27:54 we had a big harness there and instead
27:56 of coming out and saying this is the
27:58 funny part instead of coming out and
28:00 saying oh yeah we do have a harness
28:01 system in there because it's dangerous
28:04 just to be a free-flowing body inside
28:06 the fuselage of the ISS they went with
28:10 what I don't see anything what are you
28:12 what are you seeing right well the guy
28:13 does the Ford flip and then the guy
28:14 grabs the guy's wire on his pants I mean
28:17 these [ __ ] are busted so [ __ ]
28:20 busted it's ridiculous the guys that do
28:22 the interviews with a little um
28:25 guardrails that they put their feet in
28:27 at the bottom and they're moving all
28:29 over the place they're moving all over
28:31 the place
28:31 and a stationary well it's not
28:34 stationary but it's it's according to
28:36 their relative speed it's completely
28:38 stationary they're moving the exact same
28:39 speed as the fuselage of this ISS right
28:43 I'm using fuselage I know what the hell
28:45 you call the tube otherwise but it looks
28:48 like they're in a vomit rocket all right
28:51 now vomit rockets if you go and rent one
28:54 or you know you're in a trip on one
28:56 they're much shorter than most likely
28:57 what these guys and gals are doing
29:00 inside whatever unit they're doing I
29:02 mean who knows how the hell they're
29:03 pulling this off but by everyone
29:06 accusing NASA of the fraudulent stuff
29:10 that they're actually doing again for
29:12 all we [ __ ] know I mean I'd only be
29:13 defending these people but you know
29:15 technically speaking they could have
29:16 secret [ __ ] everywhere but I think
29:19 that's really unlikely because if you
29:21 had the secret base up there and that's
29:27 one thing that bart sibrel started doing
29:29 was started kind of
29:30 defending NASA at having all these
29:31 [ __ ] Armageddon space stations they
29:34 don't know how that [ __ ] [ __ ] give me
29:35 a break two things would happen if they
29:38 could get to the moon with a secret
29:39 space program and if they had a separate
29:45 you know literally he Bart just pulled
29:47 the [ __ ] plot out of Armageddon with
29:49 Bruce Willis and said that that was
29:51 probably what's going on it's like what
29:53 are you a double agent you know you use
29:57 your movies to get us interested I Love
29:59 You Bart but you know like I would never
30:00 [ __ ] repeat that again if I were you
30:02 that they're out there floating around
30:04 with some other [ __ ] Space Station
30:05 okay so there they got wires on dudes
30:08 and augmented reality [ __ ] we can
30:10 totally see okay and a lot of it
30:12 submitted that's not proof we got guys
30:15 disappearing as they go down the hallway
30:16 and pull themselves through a door jam
30:18 and they've got a real space station
30:19 somewhere why take that risk
30:22 get these people up in a real [ __ ]
30:24 space station and do it to it right I
30:26 don't buy that and if they could get to
30:29 the moon they would build all the sets
30:31 they would terraform that place to look
30:33 exactly like it did and all the fake
30:35 photographs so that when they pen could
30:38 build something they could actually make
30:39 it there and get to the Van Allen belts
30:40 and no one's done and puking their guts
30:42 out and turning into a fried piece of
30:44 toast they get there they land they go
30:46 see guys look there's the flag there's
30:48 all this [ __ ] and it's a full replica
30:50 it's like a Civil War Reenactment right
30:52 someone uh he was Daniel or somebody
30:55 sorry there's a couple of you I don't
30:57 remember your names off the bat and some
31:00 of you I don't know how to pronounce
31:01 your names on the lock facebook group
31:04 but someone posted a satellite that had
31:07 crashed under the ground was fully legit
31:09 in a kind of a wheat field or a hay
31:12 field and it's a satellite attached to a
31:16 weather balloon there's cops there's
31:19 farmers and people looking at it no
31:21 one's touching it but it clearly has a
31:26 solar panel system on it now again these
31:30 things could be launched for very
31:31 temporary purposes it could be you know
31:34 it's not if it wasn't the size of the
31:35 Hubble telescope people or the you know
31:37 famed Hubble telescope but keeping
31:41 pressure on them is making them act
31:43 very quickly and I just don't think in a
31:45 government bureaucracy of even deceit
31:47 that they have the ability to have a
31:50 committee meeting get together and
31:52 create the cover story for it right
31:55 there's something you need to know about
31:57 Hollywood that is as I understand it
32:00 very very similar to the government and
32:02 that is that no one wants to be
32:04 responsible for anything that fails when
32:08 the top brass realizes that they really
32:11 don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing
32:12 right and so what'll end up happening is
32:15 someone will be I've had this described
32:18 by a very close friend of mine and
32:21 mentor who knows what he's talking about
32:24 all right he's seen this happen for 40
32:27 years of his life but he said that when
32:30 Studios started to get rid of all the
32:32 talent and start pulling all these
32:34 people that want to star [ __ ] people
32:36 write which means I want to know the
32:37 parties and stuff no film backgrounds no
32:41 writing backgrounds they just couldn't
32:43 find a hit film if they needed to I mean
32:45 literally if your life depended on it
32:47 they would be dead at the end of the
32:48 exercise and so they've they pushed all
32:51 the talent out made them all contractors
32:53 which made fifty percent of them leave
32:55 the industry because they're not good at
32:58 constantly auditioning for parts in
33:00 movies like the crew and cast they're
33:02 just not that kind of person there's a
33:03 but they're fantastic once you put them
33:05 on a salary right and so the studio
33:07 started spending way too much money
33:09 because when you come in as a consultant
33:10 you spend too much money on those
33:13 resources right that's why you bring
33:15 someone on to salary them to give them
33:18 you give them stability in their income
33:21 but you don't give them the big giant
33:22 construction salary right which is you
33:25 might only work six months out of the
33:26 year so I need to pay you double so you
33:28 got money for twelve months of your
33:31 expenses right but the chena command
33:34 goes something like this as soon as the
33:37 movie comes out and it's a piece of [ __ ]
33:40 like a really bad one like solo where
33:44 loses Disney millions tens of millions
33:47 of dollars right they want heads to roll
33:52 but obviously the very top studio heads
33:55 the guy who's the CEO of the studio
33:57 probably his number one below that I use
34:00 his was a lack of a better reference
34:05 they want the underlings
34:07 to hang for it and because everyone down
34:10 below the top has seen this occur these
34:12 seen people's careers just disappear
34:14 overnight that has have lone Ian Lee
34:17 trained them to never try to take
34:19 responsibility they always try to pay
34:21 the tech play the technicality game of
34:23 why didn't say to do this you know I
34:25 mean I supported this other person but I
34:27 mean I wasn't the decision-maker on this
34:29 particular process so I can keep my
34:31 distance as a technicality from the
34:33 accountability of the whole thing
34:35 well government is exactly the same way
34:38 a bureaucracy is the same way no one
34:41 wants to be the reason why everyone is
34:44 in a perilous situation which in the
34:46 case of NASA JPL and all other
34:48 associated SpaceX and everything would
34:51 be don't be doing stupid [ __ ] that's
34:53 gonna get us caught and then if it's the
34:56 very best they can do but it's not good
34:58 enough what do they do you have this
35:01 crushing pressure from us to say look we
35:04 know that fate that that those moon
35:06 missions were completely fake you've
35:08 said you've lost the schematics you've
35:09 lost the footage you've lost the rocks
35:11 you've lost absolutely [ __ ]
35:12 everything that is the proof this
35:14 happens bart sibrel did an amazing job
35:16 making a movie called astronauts gone
35:19 wild where none of the astronauts can
35:21 sink and not synchronize their stories
35:22 but there they're in the same craft
35:24 they're in the same limb together and
35:26 one guys in his backyard and a tiki bar
35:28 thing and so the dudes in his art studio
35:30 and they completely contradict each
35:33 other was there any sound in space or
35:35 was any sound in the limb when you roll
35:36 a knee uh uh one guy goes no there's no
35:38 sign of space because he watch 2001 a
35:40 Space Odyssey because he was never in
35:43 space his buddy is sitting in the
35:45 backyard going oh yes absolutely
35:46 deafening that guy actually has the
35:49 science right because you've you had an
35:50 oxygenated cabin with the 10,000 pound
35:53 thrust [ __ ] engine right below you
35:54 yeah you need ear protection dude so us
35:59 keeping the pressure on these
36:00 organizations is causing them to react
36:03 and react faster
36:05 then the brachot bureaucracy is actually
36:07 set up to handle now they may actually
36:09 you know hear people like me talking or
36:11 they might just see their problem like
36:13 oh man our triage sucks right for when
36:17 we have one of these exposure situations
36:20 we can't respond fast enough and when we
36:22 do respond fast
36:25 we fail it's always been NASA's thing
36:28 right the whole space shuttle Challenger
36:30 explosion that was a January 28th 1986
36:34 that was them being pressured to launch
36:37 that vehicle at like 39 degrees
36:40 Fahrenheit that morning in Florida right
36:43 I think the coldest launch was somewhere
36:45 in the upper 60s and it had so many
36:48 failures that the thing just barely got
36:50 into space right really got out of you
36:52 before exploding or something right what
36:54 you didn't of course and so this is what
36:58 the episodes about what other pressures
37:01 are on well like I said I think the
37:05 bankers are under excruciating pressure
37:08 in America the federal reserve banking
37:11 system is finally completely and utterly
37:13 exposed I think most people understand
37:16 now who are paying the slightest bit of
37:18 attention and that maybe still below 50%
37:20 but who knows I understand it's a
37:23 private for-profit bank they understand
37:25 our money is fake based on nothing some
37:28 people are now starting to understand
37:30 that our national debt this [ __ ]
37:32 thing people talk about all the time
37:34 it's fake when you have a debt to a loan
37:37 shark and the loan shark goes to jail
37:39 you don't along your own anyone any
37:41 money effort so the second that Trump
37:43 commandeer is the Federal Reserve which
37:45 is there's a rumor that he already has
37:46 and he backs it by gold which is
37:49 something we've also supposedly
37:51 commandeered then we have a real
37:53 currency all of a sudden it's limited it
37:56 has value and it's not compatible with
37:58 all other fiat currencies in the world
38:00 sorry guys you're gonna have to do the
38:02 same thing but what has been the trend
38:05 for the last 400 years less to 50 at
38:07 least a bunch of people fled to this
38:09 continent unfortunately displacing the
38:12 Native Americans but in recompense for
38:16 our
38:17 ancestors or the predecessors we made
38:21 the most free region of the world that
38:24 is associated with the rest of the world
38:27 so the Native Americans were also very
38:29 free but they weren't associated with
38:31 Europe right and so now we have a global
38:33 participant called the United States of
38:35 America which is still largely
38:37 completely screwed up and needs to be
38:38 fixed right but if we pull this off if
38:42 this Great Awakening is real that's
38:44 quoted by the president United States
38:45 last night on Valentine's Day 2019 then
38:51 shit's gonna change it's gonna get
38:52 better once again but we've got to put
38:54 safeguards in at every single level
38:56 every single citizen United States needs
38:58 to say there will never ever ever be
39:00 fiat currency ever again and we will
39:03 never get our money from some other
39:04 [ __ ] country we are going to tax the
39:07 corporations and not the people so when
39:11 you get your check in the mail which
39:12 will be smaller than the one
39:14 proportionately that you've been getting
39:15 at least it's all yours there's no more
39:18 like a pending threat in April 15th
39:21 right what's the other big giant
39:24 pressure bubble that's going on it's
39:27 called fake news it's awesome fake news
39:32 baby we now understand the elders of our
39:37 generation who even a hundred years ago
39:41 the United States of America we had
39:43 senators and other journalists warning
39:47 the world look man the Hearst
39:49 Corporation is the yellow journalistic
39:52 group that is so powerful that they made
39:55 that they made the world figure error
39:57 made the world believe excuse me the
39:59 sixteenth Amendment was ratified by all
40:01 50 states which it wasn't that gave us
40:04 the IRS they gave us fiat currency that
40:07 rewrote the tax code such that the the
40:09 corporation stop paying anything through
40:11 loopholes and deductions and it all came
40:14 to us the people something that is
40:16 absolutely technically illegal due to
40:19 the way the Constitution is written if
40:20 you have variable tax brackets on a
40:23 portion tax it's illegal and why was it
40:26 written into the Constitution because
40:27 that's what they were doing in Europe
40:30 okay but now we say right now due to
40:35 Cuban on probably more due to queuing on
40:38 anything else it was already in place
40:40 before queueing on came aboard way in
40:42 place but we were saying deep state deep
40:44 state deep state I came on board again
40:48 around 2005 and the Bilderberg Group was
40:52 starting to get cracked by old Alex
40:55 Jones who made movies who had a little
40:57 tiny outfit didn't broadcast 24/7 and a
41:01 little more consistent I'm still nuts I
41:03 mean like I don't mean nuts isn't crazy
41:05 but just he was really rambunctious in
41:07 his episodes because that's just the way
41:09 he does is as his attorney says in his
41:12 divorce lawsuit or divorce settlement
41:17 with his wife it's a character that he
41:18 plays alright a man he's not the first
41:22 all the way I'm not playing a character
41:24 just so you know I won't be able to use
41:27 that defense I mean do I walk around
41:29 sunglasses smoking cigars all day no but
41:32 when I'm in my backyard this is what I
41:33 do but we say deep state now it's a now
41:37 part of our nomenclature as a society
41:40 well that's huge what is the deep state
41:43 I mean even if your definitions are
41:45 completely different if we put 10 people
41:46 in the room and they wrote down their
41:47 definitions I think other than someone
41:51 blowing it off as a conspiracy theory
41:53 which that that opinions gonna just sink
41:56 like a you know an anchor we all know
42:01 it's a cabal something that we were told
42:03 was never in existence because you
42:07 weren't supposed to know now if you guys
42:10 study a dude named Ted Gunderson some of
42:14 you probably are familiar with this work
42:15 just look it up he was an FBI agent I
42:18 guess an FBI chief that had 700
42:22 employees under his command here in
42:24 Southern California
42:25 he said he lived in most places in the
42:27 United States except for the New England
42:29 area but this dude uncovered the
42:33 gigantic satanic pedophile ring that has
42:38 been supported by members of you
42:41 corrupt members I should say within our
42:44 intelligence agencies within the
42:45 government political local law
42:47 enforcement you know again it's just one
42:49 or two people in these inner areas is
42:51 all it takes man and you know you and
42:54 it's very good it's a very important
42:55 distinction to say that let's say that
42:57 there was a corrupt cop it's in some
42:58 satanic human trafficking thing it's too
43:04 easy to generalize that on top of all
43:05 the other cops you have to understand
43:07 that that one cop or a couple or
43:09 whatever would go into a building with a
43:13 bunch of other police officers who would
43:16 kill him on sight if they ever knew that
43:20 that cop was doing the things that he
43:22 was doing or involved in those types of
43:24 things and there's females as well as
43:25 males so we need to make that
43:28 distinction and we need to help those
43:30 officers be supported in whistleblowing
43:33 in incarcerated individuals that are
43:36 perhaps their bosses we have to listen
43:39 when they when they present information
43:42 we don't want to be a mob but we don't
43:44 want to just run in and say oh we know
43:45 people are doing this so they say that
43:47 you're doing this I'm gonna feel better
43:49 if someone is punished we can't do that
43:52 right but every single time the word
43:55 deep state makes it into the an article
43:59 some sort of segment on television
44:02 another YouTube video
44:03 somebody social media posts all these
44:05 are different outlets another
44:06 conversation with another human being
44:08 that puts pressure on them now think
44:13 about it it used to be that what they
44:16 would do is hide inside their secret
44:17 societies all right they can't hide
44:21 anymore can they were they gonna go
44:25 let's say Google which is now the
44:27 de-facto [ __ ] you know threshold of
44:30 reality has Google Maps Google Earth and
44:34 there's some you know there's a host
44:36 island somewhere that have been raced
44:39 off the map right so for a while those
44:42 places could be a little retreat and of
44:44 course that people start disappearing
44:46 then people are gonna start looking and
44:48 so I don't think that's even occurring
44:50 do I think those organizations exist I
44:53 mean those locations yeah
44:55 I think they exist I think there's
44:57 something I've been calling billionaire
44:58 Island for a long time all these people
45:01 that are about to pay their dues for
45:05 junk bonds for investing in the airlines
45:09 was Steve Fossett Steve Fossett was that
45:12 guy he's one of like Richard Branson's
45:14 the other dude who got inside of a
45:16 balloon hot air balloon lifted capsule
45:21 very detailed it's like a house that
45:25 floated right and they went around the
45:27 world and I can't remember if both of
45:30 them succeeded or none of them succeeded
45:31 I can't remember but Steve Fossett then
45:33 disappears flying a special stunt plane
45:36 I think it was over Colorado or
45:39 something like that but I don't know I
45:41 can't remember I shouldn't say but his
45:43 buddies went out looking for him and
45:44 they couldn't find him couldn't find him
45:46 for a couple months and then all of a
45:47 sudden they found the remnants of a
45:50 plane and a little bit of DNA on the
45:52 dashboard and no body no skull no
45:55 nothing they said that Steve Fossett was
45:59 involved in the put options on American
46:01 Airlines and United right before 9/11
46:03 through the Deutsche Bank which means
46:06 they bet on the stock going down which
46:08 it did and so they made a [ __ ] ton of
46:10 money off 9/11 and it was never
46:12 investigated by the FBI or the CIA or
46:15 any of those organizations just should
46:17 have protected us from those individuals
46:18 hmm Ted Gunderson has information about
46:21 that too Ted Gunderson died in 2011 from
46:25 all the systems that won contracts when
46:27 one is poisoned by arsenic so they think
46:30 that they got rid of him through arsenic
46:32 and I you know I don't know what the
46:33 magic number is for 2011 for him because
46:36 he had been giving you know multiple
46:39 speeches all over the world for hours
46:42 and hours and hours the the the
46:45 excitement about listening to Ted is
46:46 that you'll watch a one-hour interview
46:48 and hit so packed with real data with
46:51 real you know resources and sources and
46:54 what-have-you and then you'll look at
46:57 his feed like all the speeches that he's
46:59 given that are on YouTube and they're
47:00 like two hours three hours four hours
47:02 anyway oh I want all this information
47:05 but I need a day just to sit and do
47:07 something else you know
47:08 carve wood while I'm listening or
47:09 something right but I just I know that
47:12 most of you understand this but if
47:14 you're new it's important that you
47:17 understand the power of these words the
47:20 power of your posts one of the things
47:23 that cue is you know got us hip to is
47:26 the power of a meme right memes are
47:32 amazing memes have to be harvested by
47:36 these social media 5i organizations that
47:39 all need to go to [ __ ] business by
47:41 the way every goddamn one of them but
47:45 they harvest these things by hand and
47:46 then they mark them as don't let this
47:48 through don't let this - don't let this
47:49 tree and the reason why they're not
47:50 letting it through is the meme has so
47:52 much empirical truth in it that they
47:55 don't want to wake up that sector in
47:56 your brain to go oh yeah there are
47:59 something called NPCs which are bought
48:01 off mockingbirds journalists who went
48:04 through like Anderson Cooper went
48:06 through the CIA to do his internship and
48:09 then came right back online I mean you
48:12 know on-air guy makes over a hundred
48:15 million dollars a year he's already a
48:17 Vanderbilt grandson so he's got more
48:18 money than God doesn't need a single
48:21 [ __ ] dime right I mean technically
48:23 speaking you never know what the the
48:26 real numbers are for any of these
48:27 empires that used to be but technically
48:30 speaking if they didn't squander the
48:31 money the Vanderbilt organization he
48:33 could be as rich as Trump all by himself
48:35 right he used to have a brother that
48:38 died when he was 21 so that just leaves
48:40 him hmm when I first started the show
48:44 well actually when I started MK ULTRA
48:47 radio which it's funny I was thinking
48:50 about this the other day I thought that
48:52 sounds really devious you know it sounds
48:53 like were part of the system by making
48:56 the name that and it was me sitting in
48:59 my office of my game company
49:01 my buddy wanting to do a podcast and our
49:07 target was to undo we put we said what
49:11 it was our slogan it was well learn the
49:14 rules that rule you that was when I came
49:16 up with and then he said putting the
49:20 mind back into mind control that was
49:21 Kyle
49:22 line which was awesome and so this you
49:25 know MK ULTRA radio was cool it was kind
49:27 of like let me use their their
49:29 clandestine secret projects to get your
49:32 attention but we're gonna pull you into
49:33 a place where you're gonna be able to be
49:34 awakened by the information and then I
49:38 just did deep thoughts radio I don't
49:40 even know why I picked that but I did
49:42 but one of the things I used to get a
49:44 lot from people was what can I do I
49:46 really want to help I really want to
49:48 help this awakening and honestly in 2014
49:52 when we had the radio show it was hard
49:56 to answer that question other than I
49:57 mean we would say look you got to get
49:59 educated first you need to do your
50:01 research so that you speak this from
50:03 your heart and it's not some I heard
50:06 these two guys on the online saying
50:08 stuff like none of that works you can't
50:10 say that about me either unless I'm
50:11 giving you my wisdom that I learned from
50:13 other people and you're like oh he had a
50:14 really neat idea about parenting or
50:16 something you can take my word for that
50:17 and judge it for yourself but when I'm
50:19 talking about NASA or something factual
50:22 outside of my own life you need to
50:25 verify that information but I used to
50:28 remember the the the emotions I went
50:32 through was something like this I'd see
50:36 someone type that and so I would be
50:38 replying back giving my little piece of
50:41 advice you know get get educated
50:43 spread the word pop up a BA alright but
50:47 what I'm feeling inside back in 2014 in
50:49 probably 15 was Jesus we could really
50:54 lose this game
50:56 they have so much power and so much
50:59 corruption the White House is full of a
51:02 guy that wasn't born in America whose
51:04 father's some Indonesian [ __ ] sex
51:06 cult dude and his successors going to be
51:11 Satan herself right just watching one
51:15 presidential election after another
51:17 after another and it didn't matter if it
51:19 was right-wing or left-wing weekend you
51:21 know that September 11 day with the
51:24 right-wing guy and then we got all the
51:25 socialism and Welfare with the left-wing
51:28 guy it looked bad and now I don't feel
51:32 that way at all in fact I think that
51:35 I've said this to folks I mean it was
51:38 one of these things one of the decisions
51:39 to not attempt to keep MKULTRA radio
51:43 going was one the radio station got
51:46 bought and so that format was changing a
51:48 little bit but they still wanted our
51:49 shows
51:50 I used to furnish this show to them but
51:53 then it just the whole management
51:54 structure changed I think the guy I used
51:57 to work with to get my episodes to him
52:02 he's still there but anyway the main
52:05 thing was that so many people started
52:07 waking up so quickly in 2015 and 16 that
52:11 I thought man we don't have to do this
52:12 anymore I mean we don't have to do it we
52:15 want to but we don't have to and world's
52:17 gonna be okay which is why I created
52:19 deep thoughts radio because I was like
52:21 let's go after fun [ __ ] you know aliens
52:22 and and how to grow up and how to be
52:26 successful I would be creative how to
52:27 run a business just all those things
52:29 that that I call the the uncle you never
52:32 had sort of thing because this is the
52:34 way I view it and so that's sort of how
52:38 this all evolved right there's been
52:42 folks this would be a tiny bit of a
52:44 repeat but we're talking about pressure
52:46 you know folks I have friends who might
52:48 listen to coast to coast to him art was
52:53 an art bell it's the other guy I forgot
52:57 the guy left to coast to coast and went
52:59 off and created his own thing those
53:01 subjects like they never used to touch
53:03 current affairs that I know of I used to
53:05 listen to that dude for years the
53:08 various hosts and it was always just fun
53:10 crazy weird [ __ ] again it I think it was
53:12 a it may still be a training ground for
53:15 SIOP agents to say how well can you lie
53:18 a real time we're gonna you're able to
53:21 bring a script to introduce your case
53:23 introduce your fictional story and then
53:26 you need to take calls and be able to
53:28 lie real time let's just make it a
53:31 practice ground not that close to coast
53:33 am is personally aware of that or trying
53:36 to make that occur but they that George
53:38 Noory guy he knows probably 99% of his
53:42 guests are lying through their [ __ ]
53:43 teeth 24/7 but it's entertainment so
53:45 whatever right so I wanted to create a
53:49 Ledge
53:49 version of that sort of thinking in deep
53:52 thoughts to create sort of this I don't
53:57 know I mean I hate to say about the sort
53:59 of awakening enlightenment bubble you
54:01 could be in such that when you start
54:04 having conversations with their spouses
54:06 with your kids your own daily thoughts
54:09 when you're talking to random strangers
54:10 trying to talk to strangers that you
54:12 were scared to talk to in the past that
54:15 this information starts to manifest in
54:17 you and then you start to just like
54:19 training wheels you get rid of the
54:21 training wheels and you go off on your
54:23 own okay so I think that hopefully I put
54:30 together enough information over the
54:32 years and there's so many episodes that
54:34 unless you got in really early you've
54:37 got a really long Netflix marathon
54:40 session to do with deep thoughts which I
54:42 hear every once well in the comments
54:44 which is just heartwarming and
54:46 flattering and really cool so before we
54:49 close off I want to throw one last area
54:54 at you and it's different than all the
54:55 rest which is why I wanted to segment it
54:57 away from the other ones the other ones
54:58 are dire absolutely dire that we
55:01 continue the pressure in those those
55:03 particular areas but the other area to
55:06 keep pressure on relates to it relates
55:11 to us in a slightly different way which
55:13 is education and science science is
55:17 turning into this face faith based
55:19 religion and how are they capable of
55:23 doing that
55:24 mm-hmm how is it possible you think well
55:27 science is supposed to be their
55:30 scientific method and you're supposed to
55:31 be able to prove whether or not what
55:33 you're saying is true or false
55:35 but we are so packed full of [ __ ]
55:37 right now it is unbelievable right I get
55:41 the hair out of my face I think it was
55:44 Jill from our of YouTube
55:46 she's like man think you could comb your
55:49 hair it's like Jill I am usually awake
55:52 maybe I don't know 15 minutes before I
55:55 start recording for at least a third of
55:57 the videos today I got off went got
55:59 breakfasts before I started recording
56:01 here but back to the subject here we
56:05 know science is now in air quotes
56:07 because it is largely completely
56:10 fraudulent and I mean I never ever
56:13 thought that it would be so easy to
56:16 create an utter fraudulent paradigm of
56:19 college degrees that are based on
56:23 complete [ __ ] right for those of you
56:27 who are new let's just do a super fast
56:29 recap if you think the e equals
56:32 mc-squared has any bearing on reality
56:35 think again sure and I'm studying my
56:40 Einstein slaughter videos so just brace
56:43 yourself man probably this week and I'll
56:46 get that one recorded this guy was
56:50 stealing [ __ ] left and right man energy
56:52 conversion happened nearly that those
56:55 theories happened I think a little over
56:56 a hundred years Weissach Newton had a
56:59 little quote which I'm gonna put in the
57:01 episode against Einstein but those were
57:03 old concepts right but the equals
57:06 mc-squared
57:07 formula of which I don't think Einstein
57:09 really truly ever understood how he ever
57:11 got to that formula I actually read some
57:15 I research and I'll get this clarified
57:16 but they said that he never really came
57:20 up with that that you know obviously he
57:22 was shitty at math how the hell could he
57:23 come up with that formula but it limits
57:25 you from traveling the speed of light or
57:27 faster that's a bunch of crap the Big
57:29 Bang is a huge [ __ ] joke dark matter
57:31 was invented because the Big Bang
57:32 doesn't work and so they created this
57:34 other line of [ __ ] and physics
57:36 itself completely
57:37 implodes at the moment of the impact a
57:41 moment of the explosion the fact that
57:44 we're not allowed to look between our
57:45 legs and determine what gender we are
57:47 Bill Nye the douchebag shilly
57:50 [ __ ] guy right went around
57:52 having talked about gender in the 80s
57:55 and 90s as being very simple to [ __ ]
57:58 calculate now runs around trying to tow
58:01 the globalism deep population confuse
58:04 your kids from knowing how to [ __ ] and
58:05 have kids and he's got all this other
58:08 layer on it right but now we
58:12 have faith based science we have faith
58:14 based religions and now you can identify
58:16 away from your gender but when you ask
58:19 someone you know what gender they are
58:21 they're talking about being you know a
58:23 loaf of bread and all kinds of other
58:25 weird [ __ ] right
58:27 that's not gender that's your mental
58:32 identification of what you are in lieu
58:35 of being a human being if you're human
58:38 then you have a gender and it's binary
58:40 unless you're a hermaphrodite you get
58:42 both what you do so this is where your
58:49 kids are getting [ __ ] up this is where
58:52 your kids get stifled again go get a
58:57 full degree in electronics electrical
58:59 engineering and just keep your ear you
59:04 know open to see if anyone mentions
59:06 Nikola Tesla they'll teach you all of
59:10 electricity in fact they teach an ode
59:13 methodology of electrical movement
59:16 positive and negative when actually the
59:19 flow of electricity is cathode negative
59:21 to positive so you learn it wrong and
59:24 then they tell you in the mid stride oh
59:25 there's this cathode thing as well and
59:27 they'll teach it to you in chemistry in
59:28 electronics physics sometimes right but
59:32 one of the reasons why I've been a
59:33 little cynical openly in this season's
59:38 episodes about religion is that it is
59:42 the problem as well as it's the solution
59:46 morally speaking you learn morality from
59:49 religion I've asked people of all ages
59:53 okay from 80s when the 80s down if I
59:56 knew someone there was an idea to ask
59:57 them to is there any other where else
60:01 would you get morality besides religion
60:04 you can only say you got it from a
60:07 person who was probably religious or had
60:09 religious parents or grandparents okay
60:13 it is always coming from religion so
60:16 there's a value there we have to
60:18 maintain we do otherwise we're gonna
60:21 loose all these [ __ ] st. mystic
60:23 people taking our kids and
60:26 killing them and eating them and
60:27 injecting them and all that kind of
60:29 stuff into themselves right that's gonna
60:32 get worse
60:32 we need morality this gender
60:36 identification thing is a way to break
60:38 morality at the very foundation of your
60:40 child's life now let me clarify here
60:43 because a lot of people think that we're
60:45 attacking LGBT when we put our foot down
60:48 gender not at all a gay person likes the
60:52 same gender that's the point right
60:55 someone who's even transgender well
60:58 they're trying to get to the other
60:59 gender they want sexual reassignment
61:01 because inside they feel different but
61:04 they feel like they're the other gender
61:05 right I got a friend of mine who's going
61:09 through this he's he's 1,800 miles away
61:15 so I don't get to see him every day but
61:16 I've worked with a couple folks that did
61:17 this I know if they actually did the
61:19 reassignment but what if they do they're
61:22 still on planet Earth two feet on the
61:24 ground LGBT is all good all right and
61:26 I'm not trying to kiss up I want people
61:28 to understand that forcing gender on
61:30 people the way that we know what is
61:33 biology is a heterosexual and LGBT thing
61:38 obviously it's alien uh to those of us
61:41 who feel comfortable with our preference
61:43 for attraction and our gender between
61:45 our legs you know we have an easier path
61:48 than the other folks right but
61:51 identifying is all this crazy weird [ __ ]
61:53 that you know again the diaper boy who's
61:56 in his 40s being raised by some other
61:58 crazy wack [ __ ] family wants to
61:59 change his diapers for how long is that
62:01 gonna last you know seriously but the
62:03 pressure we're putting on I'll give some
62:07 shoutouts to the Flat Earth folks the
62:09 Flat Earth folks got an Hill deGrasse
62:11 Tyson to come out and give us two
62:12 completely opposing models of the world
62:15 it's no longer a sphere which is what
62:17 the blue marble shot the fake blue
62:19 marble shot from Apollo 17 captured
62:22 supposedly all [ __ ] faked [ __ ] up
62:25 red see that was fixed later on
62:28 seriously right but it comes out and
62:31 says it's an oblate sphere which means
62:33 it's swollen at the equator okay and
62:37 then he comes out and says well
62:39 it's actually pear-shaped but then what
62:42 he does because he has all these people
62:44 that are nervous about the fact that
62:45 they can't prove what shape the world is
62:47 right he does this mic droppin thing on
62:50 his show and boy they feel victorious
62:53 it's like when someone posts the thing
62:54 about bart sibrel getting punched in the
62:57 face by Buzz Aldrin they're so excited
62:59 that bark got punched in the face
63:01 now maybe Bart was a little heavy-handed
63:03 with the astronauts and blaming them
63:06 it's not like it was their idea for any
63:09 there's no way that the astronauts came
63:14 up with this idea now if I was an
63:16 astronaut and I believed in God which I
63:19 I'm not an astronaut but I do believe in
63:21 God yeah I would hold a little press
63:23 conference and [ __ ] all those other
63:25 people go ahead and take my pension you
63:27 [ __ ] because I'll get a
63:29 GoFundMe that'll blow away my pension
63:31 for telling the goddamn truth so buzz if
63:33 you're listening I know your oldest [ __ ]
63:35 cough it up buddy cuz you're gonna go to
63:40 God and you're gonna say well you know
63:41 and you know you know what was happening
63:43 they were threatening me and my pension
63:44 and God's gonna go you know what I knew
63:47 it was fake too I knew it was fake from
63:50 the moment you faked it and I'm not the
63:52 person you need to tell that it was a
63:53 fake the people that you needed to tell
63:55 you no longer have access to why don't
63:59 you step over there in the [ __ ] line
64:00 now you can be in heaven whatever you
64:02 want but you're in the [ __ ] line fact
64:03 that a that's gonna be kind of glowing
64:05 on your forehead for the next thousand
64:06 years that's a reminder that you didn't
64:11 live up to the basic morality that we
64:14 have on the planet that you were blessed
64:16 to be a part of and you got to be a hero
64:18 the whole time right and it goes for all
64:20 the other astronauts right cough it up
64:22 guys
64:22 we'll put we'll put bronze statues in
64:25 every goddamn City for the first person
64:28 that starts telling the truth and those
64:32 particular organizations that are
64:33 stealing tens of millions of dollars a
64:36 day from us right the CERN Hadron
64:40 Collider you know for three out of the
64:44 four colliders in fact actually four out
64:46 of four all had big bang objectives
64:48 really
64:50 I find it almost impossible to believe
64:54 that any person with half a [ __ ]
64:56 brain continues to believe that [ __ ]
64:58 but they probably do
64:59 they're pure left brainers they can't
65:01 see the world abstractly like it really
65:03 exists and so of course everything is
65:05 the thing on piece of paper you want
65:07 money for your research well go lie
65:09 somewhere about [ __ ] climate change
65:11 or the Big Bang or some other [ __ ]
65:12 piece of [ __ ] II science that doesn't
65:15 work out so this last segment here on
65:18 science and education is a couple fold
65:21 the pressure you have to keep on and by
65:25 the way our Facebook group talked about
65:26 pressure that's fun and interesting and
65:29 it's just I am I have to say I have
65:32 become a member of several Facebook
65:34 groups over the years and then become
65:36 unmemorable and I never would have
65:38 imagined that the one for deep thoughts
65:43 would have been the most interesting
65:45 group on Facebook I've ever been a part
65:47 of I will say my buddies other page
65:51 Vincent futsuka page if you're following
65:53 the q and on thing they have a really
65:55 good feet as well so that's some crazy
65:57 [ __ ] that gets posted over there what's
65:59 nice about ours is that we don't take
66:00 each other tremendously serious and if
66:04 we have opposing theories like you know
66:08 people lecture me all the time when you
66:09 know the world of globe right it's like
66:11 okay well I'm an expanding earth guy so
66:13 yeah I think it's round I do I keep
66:16 trying to you know come up with a
66:18 physical model as to how on earth that
66:20 would ever be flat I can't do it because
66:23 of the way I believe that the universe
66:24 is held together by ether no I don't
66:27 think that the world is flat because I
66:28 see a bubble and water round there's
66:30 only one rule book of physics in the
66:33 universe there's not two okay so you
66:36 don't get to have a a pole gravity
66:39 that's still listed as a phenomenon but
66:41 these people will feel so [ __ ]
66:43 superior to you I swear to Christ blows
66:45 me away I got family members to get up
66:47 my ass about you don't know anything and
66:50 I was like really really so you have no
66:53 scientific background at all zero you've
66:56 done [ __ ] like negative 10 research
66:59 on anything scientific in your [ __ ]
67:01 life but because you read this article
67:02 somewhere your god
67:03 damn expert really really and the thing
67:07 that you [ __ ] believe in is called a
67:09 phenomenon in the textbooks
67:11 well what's faith in what's phenomenon
67:13 right but individuals that have to rely
67:18 on faith to explain all of the written
67:22 material that they have organized
67:24 themselves to worship and in the case of
67:26 Christianity I would reference the Bible
67:28 again Bible has tremendous brilliant
67:32 stuff in it we need to know the cause
67:34 and effect models that are in the Bible
67:36 all the parables are fantastic but the
67:38 actual literal story of who was who and
67:40 who was born and all that kind of stuff
67:42 and maybe it is based on some history
67:45 there the world flood and Noah [ __ ]
67:47 took everybody in a boat no I don't
67:51 think so okay just think about it for
67:53 one [ __ ] second and stop this goddamn
67:56 cartoon [ __ ] reality that is making
67:58 it possible to allow other things to be
68:02 cartoon realities where it really really
68:04 matters right hey I can drive down the
68:06 street and during the apocalypse the guy
68:08 next to me believes that Noah took all
68:10 the [ __ ] you know monavie each you
68:13 know two of each on this boat and then
68:15 survived forty days and forty nights was
68:16 there a huge flood yeah there's probably
68:17 a huge flood several times don't let
68:19 that [ __ ] piece of I don't know
68:22 incidental sort of mathematical data but
68:30 make you believe in you know fiction
68:32 right when you read the comics do you
68:33 think those [ __ ] cartoons really
68:35 exist somewhere they don't it's there
68:37 for entertainments there for education
68:39 perhaps but this is how science with air
68:43 quotes is happening to our world well I
68:46 don't have to research anything they
68:48 said BIGBANG's ad where I worked and I
68:50 got faith in scientists why cuz I got
68:53 faith everywhere else in my life you can
68:57 believe in God in the most incredibly
69:00 powerful impactful scientific way
69:03 spiritual way metaphorical way and you
69:06 never have to worry about faith you
69:09 don't when I think about my definition
69:12 of God in my brain
69:14 against all my bias opinion of course
69:16 it's sort of a ever changing apparition
69:20 of possibilities there's a central
69:22 consciousness somewhere in the universe
69:24 it's really bright if I go next to it
69:27 it's just the whole universe itself you
69:31 know the interesting idea that God might
69:33 be George Burns walking around in a
69:35 human body yeah it'd be kind of cute but
69:38 I think you'd be taking that farm just
69:40 to make me feel more comfortable with
69:41 him
69:42 maybe we're all God maybe we're in some
69:44 damn simulator inside some computer and
69:47 so everything can be possible maybe it's
69:49 a manifest reality from all of our
69:51 consciousness agreeing as to what this
69:54 universe is it could be anything I have
69:58 some faith that when I die a lot of this
70:02 information will be accessible but then
70:04 I take advantage of it and put it into
70:06 my system and carry to the next soul I
70:08 don't know the greatest philosophers the
70:11 greatest minds of the entire world both
70:13 female and male have all come to the
70:17 when they go into institutions when they
70:19 go into these self searching moments in
70:22 their lives they come out immediately
70:26 and say to the world declaring with
70:28 great pride and intellectual
70:30 enlightenment that they know nothing
70:33 that's what they learn that's the first
70:35 thing you learn is that you knew nothing
70:37 before you started your journey and then
70:40 the rest of your life is to learn what
70:44 you need to learn what you're interested
70:46 in what you think matters right hey I
70:48 would definitely love to know everything
70:51 about the universe up to a point right
70:54 is it is it a I mean the thing that I've
70:57 been parsing in my brain at night when I
70:59 go to bed is well I believe in ether o
71:03 wins it's just like water around a
71:05 bubble behaves exactly the same but
71:08 still are we in a finite container am i
71:11 in a memory bank and some computer I
71:13 don't know is it just my consciousness
71:15 that's making this one law that I can
71:18 kind of keep in the back of my soul
71:21 computer simulating everything that's
71:24 going on is that why there's only one
71:25 form of
71:26 mathematics that rules the universe
71:28 because that's all I can particularly
71:29 conceive of and you can conceive of a -
71:33 which is why we're all in it
71:34 right isn't is it important that we
71:37 constantly have these popular heroes to
71:41 take on all of this stuff to basically
71:44 tell us well this is the way it is okay
71:46 I feel better now I'm gonna go focus on
71:48 my career and my family and myself to
71:51 have a better life but perhaps maybe
71:54 maybe that's the best way to do it
71:56 believe it's the Big Bang because you
71:58 really don't give a [ __ ] and if you were
72:00 to really contemplate the infinity of
72:02 and is something that just simply exists
72:06 there was no beginning there is no end
72:07 maybe that's too much for the brain and
72:10 then we lose track of the now right I'm
72:15 in an episode that I I try not to
72:17 contradict I think it was in season 2
72:20 it's called the answer and which is
72:26 funny because the clothing I wear all
72:28 the time in the show which looks
72:30 pathetic because I was at the same thing
72:32 we're the same over I have like three or
72:33 four jumpers i hoodies or whatever we're
72:35 not jumpers my grandfather wore jumpers
72:38 is the band called diantha which means
72:41 the answer and but the whole point of
72:44 the episode of the answer is to
72:46 essentially say we need to live the life
72:48 that we have and so many people forget
72:50 that for all the people and in antifa
72:54 running around they're not living their
72:56 life they're living some globalist
72:58 George Soros brochure so there are tools
73:02 and they're not living their life so
73:03 when they get to the end of their life
73:05 if they were to continue on that path
73:07 which I don't think any of them will I
73:09 think we're gonna see a lot of we're
73:11 gonna see a lot of history specials 20
73:14 years from now where the antifa people
73:16 are going to be crying into the camera
73:18 and apologizing to the entire world very
73:20 similar to the way that white people did
73:23 the same thing after they realized they
73:25 were racist racists during segregation
73:28 days back in the 60s and the thing that
73:31 MLK Martin Luther King liberated us from
73:33 they're going to be like
73:34 cuz there's that video there's that it's
73:36 special where that white woman she was
73:39 the young girl and she was yelling at
73:41 the first black students that were
73:43 coming into her high school and just
73:45 horrendous obscenities racist things and
73:48 she woke up finally and realized that
73:50 she was being played by the racist
73:53 culture that she was living in very
73:55 embarrassing for her and she'll never
73:57 shake that off again there's no one
73:59 alive that I know of in the United
74:01 States of America who killed a Native
74:05 American to make it possible for us to
74:08 live here all those people are dead most
74:10 was people most of us aren't related to
74:11 anyone who ever did anything like that
74:13 but if he had if he had in your lifetime
74:17 killed someone and believed a club
74:19 killed a Native American and you believe
74:21 the whole [ __ ] thing which is
74:25 ancient calling people savages right so
74:27 that near bring their animals and so
74:30 that you killed them because you're
74:31 ridding the world of like savage beasts
74:33 or something like that it was all a PR
74:35 game that people bought well if you had
74:38 done that you would live your whole life
74:40 feeling like [ __ ] we don't want that we
74:43 don't want regret right regret is a as a
74:49 negative emotion that you usually can't
74:51 purge in your entire lifetime that's why
74:53 it's called regret so what I want to do
74:55 is suggest that you keep a little
75:00 pressure on yourself to cleanse yourself
75:04 of the indoctrination that we all
75:06 inherited and there's no reason to feel
75:08 bad about it just clean yourself out as
75:11 I've said in dozens of episodes you push
75:13 everything you ever thought was true or
75:15 false just like a hoarder house out into
75:17 the front lawn and then you reorganize
75:20 your house which is your brain your soul
75:23 you bring a piece of information back in
75:25 you look at it with your newfound
75:26 information you either put it on the
75:29 true pile or the false pile or the
75:31 bigger pile which is probably the maybe
75:33 one right in the middle and understand
75:35 that you have this thing that you're
75:36 interested in solving because if you're
75:39 not interesting and interested in
75:40 solving it well then let it go with the
75:41 trash outside and disappear maybe it's
75:44 not important anymore maybe it was super
75:46 important when you were 17
75:48 but now you're 47 you're like I like
75:50 that I don't care but I think the Great
75:52 Awakening in and the I think that you
75:55 know I mean the success of this show is
75:58 based on all of us being tremendously
76:01 interested in everything now we want to
76:03 know where the giant human beings on
76:06 earth do Bigfoot's exist
76:08 are aliens real did Roswell really
76:10 happen what is area 51 you know what is
76:13 all this stuff how deep does the deep
76:16 state go did the PEI sewers the French
76:18 monarchs really escape to America and
76:21 set up the the what is it no it's over a
76:24 few quadrillion dollars 1.7 quadrillion
76:28 dollars and a trust that has now been
76:31 supposedly seized or could be seized at
76:33 any minute to pay the world's debts off
76:35 right who knows we're all interested so
76:39 we pursue information I don't have the
76:42 magic formula for waking people up to
76:47 education outside of yourself so I think
76:50 that the very first thing that you can
76:52 do and you do do especially if you're an
76:55 avid listener of this show is that you
76:58 are reengineering your mind you're
77:00 you're putting up blockades for bad
77:04 information and then you're taking those
77:07 little tiny input zones where you were
77:10 skeptical or completely unaware of truth
77:14 and you're honing that passage out
77:16 you're making that tunnel bigger and
77:18 you're turning it into a huge entry into
77:20 the into the palace and the temple that
77:22 is your body and your soul right that's
77:26 beautiful
77:27 we need we need to do that a lot now
77:30 since I'm riffing and I'm still going
77:33 here you know there is a desire a
77:37 natural desire to tell other people
77:40 about what you've learned and it is
77:43 probably the one true bane of our
77:46 existence when you come into the truth
77:48 movement one you're trying to police the
77:51 information that you get to have the
77:52 highest level of integrity and as I
77:54 always say truth predicts the future and
77:58 everything else is [ __ ]
78:00 by future I just mean the next events in
78:02 your life doesn't have to be some
78:04 Nostradamus thing about who's gonna be
78:06 President or something like that but if
78:07 I said look if you eat a bunch of fatty
78:12 foods and never exercise you're gonna
78:14 get overweight when you become
78:16 overweight it stresses all the organs in
78:18 your body and therefore you live a
78:20 shorter life so if you're totally cool
78:22 with that that's great you may die a
78:23 very painful painful death a prolonged
78:27 painful death which most people want to
78:29 avoid and so if I tell you that piece of
78:32 information and you say ah I'm gonna
78:34 test that and you eat pies every day and
78:37 you know it's McDonald's McDonald's
78:38 McDonald's or whatever and you find
78:40 yourself what should I just I got shapes
78:42 I never had I didn't know my ass could
78:44 get that big okay now that's the truth
78:47 okay he said this would happen and
78:49 that's what happens you know sometimes
78:51 it's not that cut and dry I understand
78:54 but now with us being able to say
78:56 there's a deep state okay so everything
79:00 that's going on in the world and has
79:01 gone in the world for a particular
79:03 number of millennia have been controlled
79:06 largely by this deep state through all
79:07 their secret societies which I think
79:09 were very fragmented in the past and
79:11 then have colluded together because
79:14 that's the way they survive right we can
79:17 now filter what we think is history and
79:20 say well you know that came out of that
79:21 book and that book is published by a
79:24 european book publisher which is owned
79:26 by a deep state corporation well I'm
79:30 probably getting filled full of crap
79:31 right by us saying fake news well geez
79:36 that's an easy one right almost
79:38 everything they say is a lie right and
79:41 again Fox News for anyone who believes
79:44 at that place is the truth center I
79:46 think they have per capita more anchors
79:49 that are interested in the real truth
79:52 but whoever is their editor who puts
79:54 [ __ ] on the front page of their website
79:55 is most definitely still serving the
79:58 deep state and they still are a fake
80:00 news organization I think in order to
80:03 have the fake news label lifted off of a
80:05 news agency or any any magazine
80:08 newspaper or website TV whatever TV
80:11 channel
80:12 there's there has to be a complete lack
80:15 of fake propaganda such that we you know
80:19 we can trust what they say all the time
80:21 science science in my opinion gets
80:29 really suspect when the science and the
80:31 method and the belief systems that we
80:33 put in place start to create incredible
80:37 limitations in the minds of children
80:39 which then manifests into the minds of
80:42 adults which then manifests into an
80:44 inability for us to innovate ourselves
80:46 away from all of our controlling
80:49 apparatus now if I may in vid 2 word so
80:53 again if they say you can never travel
80:55 the speed of light within how the hell
80:57 you ever gonna leave earth you can't you
80:59 really can't we're gonna have to I mean
81:00 who the hell would want to sit in some
81:01 [ __ ] you know spaceship for four
81:04 years I mean that's if you're traveling
81:07 to be like to get to the nearest thing
81:08 in space which may not have anything
81:09 inhabitable
81:10 right nobody wants that limitation but
81:13 if you believe that's a limitation you
81:15 won't attempt to invent anything that
81:16 would circumvent that limitation if you
81:20 believe in there's something from
81:21 nothing algorithm of the universe which
81:24 is the most ludicrous goddamn thing I've
81:26 ever heard of my life just at face value
81:28 just let it sink in most of you know
81:30 that if you're common listeners okay a
81:33 bunch of inert nothingness became
81:35 something really right though but it
81:38 ain't nothing cuz the Big Bang had
81:40 everything inside this you know
81:41 singularity and it popped and randomness
81:44 and yada yada mmm-hmm
81:46 again everything on planet Earth that is
81:49 alive is beautiful everything as crazy
81:53 as it might look here and there is still
81:54 a gorgeous amazing thing and there seems
81:57 to be rules about things that have life
82:01 right the only two major differences
82:04 that we acknowledge today is that we
82:06 have plant life which metabolizes its
82:09 resources differently than vertebrae
82:11 life and single-cell you know bacteria
82:14 but proteins are alive
82:17 viruses are alive and they have
82:19 different compositions most of us do not
82:21 believe the Sun is alive or the earth is
82:23 alive
82:24 I say us which probably doesn't mean
82:26 anyone of us we sort of think well you
82:29 know if something has the beginning
82:31 middle and end
82:32 it has a gestation behavior we like to
82:36 say that all things that are alive have
82:38 consciousness we have proven beyond a
82:41 shadow of a doubt that all plants have
82:43 consciousness they understand who is in
82:47 the room with them they can identify one
82:49 human being different than another human
82:51 being they know a mean human being and a
82:54 good human being this has been proven
82:55 beyond the shadow of a doubt okay so
83:00 vegetarians if you're trying to eat
83:02 vegetarian is beating a vegetarian way
83:05 for a moral reason well then you better
83:09 be eaten air or sunshine because you're
83:13 not morally solving any problems by
83:17 eating the oldest form of life on this
83:19 planet sure an apple does fall from the
83:22 tree perhaps that is the it's what Steve
83:24 Jobs used to do is say I'm only gonna
83:26 eat things that bear fruit as soon as it
83:28 falls off it's gonna die on the ground
83:29 so why not I eat it and then you stop
83:32 processing meat proteins and your
83:34 pancreas goes pop and you die an
83:37 excruciating death way before your time
83:39 I think I just came up with one little
83:44 other area and I know this episode's
83:46 goin long but I've been told I could
83:49 make three-hour episodes and people will
83:50 dig it but I think the other area with
83:52 that we're keeping pressure on is
83:54 medicine and the medical industry as a
83:57 whole
84:00 someone posted a beautiful meme that
84:03 essentially said you can't tell a woman
84:05 that she has the right to choose
84:07 especially these [ __ ] satanic
84:09 Democrats who say that you can kill a
84:10 child at nine months simply because
84:13 it'll be a little bit of an
84:14 inconvenience to your vagina and then
84:16 tell someone they have to take a
84:18 vaccination otherwise they can't go to
84:19 school they can't work at a hospital
84:23 they can't engage in other jobs unless
84:26 they have vaccinations hey it's my body
84:30 right I should be able to get clean
84:33 water with no medicine in it I should be
84:36 able to breathe air without [ __ ]
84:38 it sprayed from planes by the way today
84:41 they sprayed like absolutely crazy and
84:44 supposed to rain at 2 o'clock and it's
84:47 it's 10:40 in the morning and it's
84:52 almost clear blue skies now but when I
84:55 started this episode there were tons of
84:56 clouds over there
84:57 so we'll see if they show up in a few
84:59 hours here a lot of us are figuring out
85:01 that you know basic medicines like
85:03 vitamin C b-17 cure cancer right
85:08 again if you do catch cancer you do have
85:11 to become as close to a vegan as
85:13 possible to starve the cancer and at the
85:15 same time you need to take medicines
85:17 that help your immune system destroy the
85:19 cancer you just do go look up the
85:21 Gershon technique I think there is a
85:24 misnomer this is what I'll close with I
85:26 think there's a misnomer that the the
85:29 people that are serving the deep state
85:31 somehow have all of the mechanisms of
85:33 the deep state I'm still not convinced
85:39 what do I mean by that well you have
85:42 people dying of cancer which means that
85:45 they supposedly well they look like they
85:48 believe all of the stuff that the
85:50 oncologists say take chemotherapy
85:52 chemotherapy is the thing like ATZ that
85:55 kills people that come in with a benign
85:58 condition which is hiv-positive the ATC
86:01 kills you in a couple years if not one
86:03 year right you want to see some
86:05 fascinating stuff go look up the the
86:07 virologists who discover that there's no
86:10 link between this specific virus known
86:13 as HIV and this mysterious bunch of
86:16 [ __ ] which is your T cells dying off
86:19 and then of course you you die of
86:22 whatever the what they said was if
86:26 you're HIV positive and you die of
86:27 pneumonia then you died of AIDS if
86:29 you're HIV positive and you die of the
86:31 flu when you died of AIDS so you're
86:33 really dying of these other things
86:34 because your t-cell counts all screwed
86:36 up real simple don't do drugs don't do
86:40 heroin don't do coke don't do meth don't
86:42 take any poppers or some you know what
86:45 is it whip it's that used to back in the
86:46 old day I saw a video the other day this
86:48 lady [ __ ] coked out of her mind in a
86:51 front seat
86:52 Cardon whippets and she had gone down
86:53 the street and wrecked into all these
86:55 cars and this really nice guy is
86:56 interviewing or are you okay your bath
87:00 salts and all that [ __ ] that stuff
87:02 destroys your t-cells that's why you're
87:04 dying of an immune deficiency problem
87:06 because of drug use they tried to make
87:08 it sound like this mysterious disease
87:12 which doesn't exist
87:13 do your research okay is traveling
87:18 through needles no it's the [ __ ] drug
87:20 that's traveling through the needle
87:21 that's killing your t-cells AZT kills
87:25 you it just kills you it was banned in
87:27 the 60s because it was killing everybody
87:29 and they pulled it back out and pushed
87:30 it back out into the public and we're
87:32 selling everybody a toxin again if
87:35 someone can produce okay the
87:38 peer-reviewed scientific paper okay that
87:42 scientifically links the HIV virus to a
87:46 very specific t-cell destroying other
87:50 virus then we can actually have this
87:53 condition that what they call AIDS
87:55 anyway I think you feel me keep the
87:58 pressure on people because it's working
88:00 I can't wait for the day that I retire I
88:04 don't know a hundred episodes out of
88:06 this show because they simply don't
88:08 matter anymore that everything has been
88:10 corrected for and that the remaining
88:13 episodes keep us on the straight and
88:15 narrow such that we don't have to have
88:17 these negative conversations every once
88:19 in a while about what's wrong with the
88:21 world we can just talk about what's
88:22 right with the world when we could talk
88:24 about information that we discovered and
88:25 how fun it is to say oh my god you know
88:28 Eric Dollard made electricity travel 11
88:31 times the speed of light in the basement
88:32 of his borderland series out of the 80s
88:35 right go looked at a borderland
88:39 Eric dollar DOL lar D experiments and
88:44 look up his longitude longitudinal knows
88:48 it's a transverse wave and longitudinal
88:50 wave circuit that he built in the
88:52 basement and he proved right in front of
88:54 your face the electricity can be
88:55 configured to travel far faster than the
88:58 speed of light I'll leave you with that
89:00 if you haven't been to deep thoughts
