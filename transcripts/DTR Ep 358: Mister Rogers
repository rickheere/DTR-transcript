00:00 [Music]
00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:36 gentlemen you know a lot of times I
00:38 record at night because it's only the
00:40 the only time I have to record maybe
00:44 it's gonna rain the next day or whatever
00:46 hopefully doesn't rain on us tonight
00:48 tonight I feel utterly compelled to
00:50 record a very interesting reason this
00:54 documentary came out on mr. Rogers for
00:57 those of you who don't live in America
00:59 I'm sure you still know who he is but he
01:02 was a gentleman out of its Pittsburgh
01:06 Pennsylvania
01:07 he created a he created a show for kids
01:11 at a time when society was struggling to
01:15 understand human development but never
01:17 really stopped to figure it out at least
01:19 in the modern age quote unquote there
01:22 was a lot of study going on in the 1950s
01:25 about child development and this guy
01:31 Fred Rogers he he figured out what no
01:37 one else had figured out which is that
01:39 television was doing its thing and it
01:44 wasn't necessarily doing a good job
01:48 talking to children because of all the
01:51 research being so cutting-edge in the
01:53 50s at least the research wasn't being
01:57 boiled down for parents and being taught
01:59 to kids so that when they become parents
02:01 that become great parents and they raise
02:02 great kids so I watched this show as a
02:05 kid I watched Captain Kangaroo first and
02:08 then eventually mr. Rogers it having
02:13 watched this documentary which I want to
02:16 say to you guys moved me as deeply as I
02:20 can be moved because what are we trying
02:24 to do on this show I say we for all the
02:27 reasons I've noted in previous episodes
02:29 but if you're sort of a fan of this show
02:31 then there's probably two tracks that
02:33 you're following - maybe some obsessive
02:36 moon thing I hope you'll keep listening
02:40 I hope you clicked anyway my theme of
02:44 this show is always rebuilding society
02:46 from the
02:46 roundup in a way that was mr. Rogers og
02:51 principal way back in the day in the
02:53 late 60s leave since 1967 was his first
02:55 show now if you're a truther you're
03:00 tired of being lied to and you're simply
03:02 looking for methodologies to develop a
03:05 protocol for life you're trying to
03:08 correct all of the things that have been
03:11 presented to you as truth that have
03:13 essentially done you harm what happens
03:16 when you get told an untruth well it
03:19 fills up space in your mind and it
03:20 misguides you mr. Rogers MO was
03:24 essentially to do a couple different
03:27 things to the kids he gave them the most
03:31 powerful message which is that you're
03:33 special besides our aside from the fact
03:37 that you may or may not do anything
03:40 extraordinary or have done anything
03:44 extraordinary yet in your life you are
03:47 extraordinary and special because you
03:49 exist I mean he was a very religious man
03:53 so his message came from the divine
03:58 creator to you you wouldn't exist if you
04:02 weren't special why create you if you
04:05 weren't special do the adults he was
04:08 trying to help them understand look
04:10 within the the world of a child it is
04:15 probably a more intense than the world
04:20 of an adult because as an adult you have
04:22 a fair amount of things that you have
04:24 learned through experience that will
04:28 give you context for what is happening
04:30 things that are scary especially you
04:36 know how to deal with unknowns you have
04:37 a protocol to deal with them but when
04:39 you're a child you feel like you're
04:42 supposed to know things and when you
04:45 don't know things well it's scary isn't
04:47 it what's underneath your bed what's in
04:51 that closet what was that sound why is
04:55 an adult angry why is an adult
04:58 potentially harming
04:59 you when I look at this documentary you
05:04 have a gentleman that worked for I guess
05:10 you could say a little over 30 years to
05:13 try and gift society with a methodology
05:19 both for the young and for the old sadly
05:24 I think the only messages it really came
05:26 across were to the kids who were luckily
05:29 us now he held an optimism and an ideal
05:34 belief that we are good people
05:38 until we are taught otherwise and I
05:42 think every single one of us knows that
05:43 that's true it's been nearly two decades
05:47 since this man passed and we know that
05:51 the world has become ever vicious ever
05:56 evil with individuals well I would say
06:03 this with things like the queuing on
06:05 movement the cult of wake up and think
06:08 for yourself with a cult that says this
06:12 is evil and this is good the cult that
06:15 says look inside yourself and simply
06:20 acknowledge what you already know is
06:22 good because we have this little silly
06:25 gnome or this silly notion that doing no
06:32 harm to others is a great idea Fred
06:36 Rogers being a religious gentleman said
06:40 you know he will his philosophy as noted
06:43 by his family and friends was to love
06:45 your neighbor and love yourself and
06:48 that's a great idea but we know that
06:51 people are being indoctrinated into the
06:54 divide as they have missed the message
06:58 about themselves that he tried to
07:00 transmit to kids on his show they are
07:06 lost and they're disingenuous they're
07:08 The Forgotten kids of the world
07:12 they've gone through this meat grinder
07:14 that is the world and they're still
07:17 young they have the majority of their
07:20 years left when they suddenly realize
07:24 wow the same working out I did what I
07:28 was told and it didn't work out now I
07:31 want my government to pay for everything
07:33 in fact I just want things that I see
07:37 other people have because it hurts so
07:39 much inside that they have it and I
07:41 don't as I watched the documentary I see
07:46 this incredible incredible human who
07:50 could have easily just looked at into
07:54 the world and said geez this place is so
07:56 dark and so evil and there's so many
07:58 people against his agenda he could have
08:02 given up at any point in time and said
08:04 well you know the voice of one it was
08:08 potentially not enough to make an impact
08:10 on people even though we had the
08:12 audience of most likely tens of millions
08:15 of people I'm going to bet before he
08:18 passed away he probably was viewed by
08:20 damn near a billion people if not more
08:23 individual souls over the years but
08:26 definitely a few hundred million I don't
08:29 know the numbers 1967 and he took some
08:33 time off at one point then he relaunched
08:35 his show he felt this incredible burden
08:39 to bring light to the world to give as
08:43 many real-world examples to kids the
08:46 parents were terrified to discuss with
08:50 kids I was shocked to find out that even
08:54 before I was born when Bobby Kennedy was
08:57 assassinated 1968 he covered an episode
09:00 where he playing his little Freddie
09:03 puppet the little tiger dude he asked
09:07 the question what is assassination I
09:10 mean the guts on this guy and the wisdom
09:14 of this guy I would probably tell anyone
09:18 I know if you were my closest best
09:22 friend in the entire world I would tell
09:25 you
09:26 we need to resurrect this guy in our own
09:30 soul and take the tact that yeah we need
09:36 to rediscover the genius of this man and
09:40 like he said there are a lot more of him
09:43 in this world than we actually are
09:45 willing to acknowledge and I obviously
09:48 think that's true it's why I've said it
09:50 several times on my show lesson that
09:52 profound statement by me by any stretch
09:54 but it's a good reminder every once in a
09:56 while for us to hear it
09:57 I debate we're calling what to call this
10:00 show part of me just wants to call it
10:01 mr. Rogers I think that'll gain a few
10:04 more eyeballs be kind of funny this
10:08 dude's gonna cover mr. Rogers need the
10:11 moon hoax dude is do the guy that swears
10:15 a lot in his episodes yeah sorry in
10:18 honor of him we won't swear in this
10:21 episode for those of you been in the
10:24 truth movement for any number of years
10:25 or for those of you who are like a Top
10:29 Fuel Drag Race car and you've only just
10:32 awakened you would be able to attest in
10:35 a court of law with a lie-detector test
10:38 attached to your every extremity but
10:41 it's a very very tough path at times the
10:45 first struggle is your own awakening
10:50 it's a birthing process it is so much
10:54 like neo coming out of the matrix it's
10:58 uncomfortable physically it's tormenting
11:01 mentally the more that you become
11:04 informed about things or at least
11:06 informed about the things that perhaps
11:09 are wrong and you don't have the answers
11:12 yet because you haven't been out enough
11:14 or the information where you're waking
11:15 up is very sparse it's a very isolating
11:19 event and what I think is absolutely
11:23 interesting and fascinating and ironic
11:25 when you watch this documentary mr.
11:28 Rogers I saw through Amazon Prime on HBO
11:30 I suggest you get a copy this watch this
11:33 I don't know where it is get it get it
11:35 and watch it it's an extremely isolating
11:40 evolution in mankind because the sad
11:45 fact is that the majority of the
11:46 population in the world is asleep and I
11:51 think that certain cynical people who
11:53 come into this movement as merely an
11:55 observer and not a participant my
11:56 believe that we say those things to
11:59 somehow pat ourselves on the back to put
12:01 ourselves up on a pedestal of
12:02 intellectual enlightenment so that we
12:05 may feel superior to others if you watch
12:09 the mr. rogers documentary and you got
12:12 all the way to the end there's a couple
12:15 closing shots of his face as he
12:17 especially does a public service
12:20 announcement about the events of 9/11
12:22 which is sadly one of the last things
12:25 that he got to observe in this world I
12:29 don't think the face did you see on him
12:32 at the end of the tour of his life is
12:35 anything remotely associated with
12:38 feeling superior it is a face of oh my
12:47 god
12:48 I just spent 30-plus years of my life
12:52 succeeding in a region of human
12:55 development that was extremely important
12:57 to only see it unraveled by acts of
13:03 terror on that same Society so this man
13:09 potentially ended his life not knowing
13:11 whether or not what he gifted society
13:14 with would remain now imagine that as an
13:21 example
13:21 I'm said in my backyard and for some
13:24 freak of nature this particular show
13:27 where to get some broadband distribution
13:32 I had the same juice that that guy had
13:35 in the way that I do it right not the
13:39 children but to adults his game was
13:41 children he understand kids on a love
13:43 understood kids on a level that was
13:47 angelic amazing
13:50 and that documentary should jerk your
13:52 heartstrings several times if you
13:55 understand even the most remote sense of
13:58 the insecurities that a child can have
14:01 feeling insignificant tap potentially
14:05 having parents that never say those
14:07 little words I love you and here comes
14:10 this guy that looks into your soul as a
14:13 child and he smiles a smile that that
14:17 child desperately needed and in an
14:21 instant all the damage of perception
14:24 that child may have been affected in
14:26 being in an isolated world is mended he
14:30 gave them the tool chest to leave his
14:33 presence and remain intact and as they
14:37 ran into issues they used his tool chest
14:39 to fix themselves
14:42 now often I will do a show about a
14:46 controversial area of our human
14:48 development where in the end of the show
14:51 I have to admit to you I'm not sure how
14:53 to fix it
14:54 and the thing I always gravitate to
14:57 which is sort of a a low hanging fruit
15:02 methodology is to say education
15:06 obviously it's true it's sort of a
15:09 cliche nowadays in the truth movement
15:12 but it's obviously a cliche that goes
15:14 back as far as man is understood the
15:16 concept of education of passing
15:18 knowledge through some form of
15:20 communication but let's just say this
15:24 show gets his circulation there's still
15:29 more dark forces out there than us who
15:33 exist which is you and me to be able to
15:40 correct for all things that are out
15:42 there pushing against us trying to
15:46 create human suffering and human divide
15:49 when I look at that documentary which
15:54 beautifully documents between the forces
15:58 that were dominating the airwaves which
16:00 is 99.999
16:02 cent of everything on television and
16:04 then a show like his which again is not
16:08 really meant for adults although I
16:09 didn't really realize how multi-layered
16:12 his intent was he was just a drop in the
16:17 bucket and I drop in an ocean filled
16:22 with consumerism with every level of
16:27 indoctrination that tears apart
16:28 society's worshipping war sex anything
16:33 to appeal to your sort of low-hanging
16:37 fruit in life right we can get this
16:39 really easily
16:39 I think Prince and his love sexy album
16:43 has a song called positivity and one of
16:46 his final choruses and the songs it's
16:47 more hard to love than it is to hate I
16:54 never wanted to believe that was true
16:56 and I made an episode on it and a
16:58 positivity way back in season one it was
17:00 barely watched go figure but I think
17:05 it's sadly true we are now at a point
17:09 when the truth movement it's its main
17:12 archetypal theme is that we start to
17:17 realize that the struggles that we have
17:19 endured our entire life depending on how
17:23 old you are but I guess if you're born
17:27 in the last hundred years you're
17:28 probably in this camp is that a lot of
17:30 the suffering and the pain that you've
17:32 gone through that you wouldn't be proud
17:33 of right there's some pain and suffering
17:35 that's very formative and important and
17:39 it builds up resistance that a lot of it
17:42 was unnecessary it was orchestrated
17:46 designed and unleashed on mankind in
17:51 this episode I'm hoping the following
17:55 mr. Rogers stopped his show after doing
17:59 numerous episodes in order to make a
18:03 show for adults and I saw a few clips
18:09 that they put in this documentary I had
18:11 never seen the show in my life but he
18:14 found that it was very difficult to a
18:16 dinner
18:16 fire with adults because the biases are
18:18 already installed we have simply turned
18:24 becoming an adult into shutting off our
18:27 minds shutting off our souls sanctioning
18:33 our love sanctioning our complete
18:36 spectrum of humanity when you're born as
18:40 a child something of which he remained
18:43 absolutely intact in his own psyche
18:46 dependent no regardless of what age he
18:48 was he knew how to kneel down to a child
18:51 look them eye-to-eye and connect with
18:55 them on a level that was instantaneous
18:57 and absolute and the evidence is in
19:04 hundreds of video interactions that he
19:06 had with children and regardless if the
19:11 child had a disability or was completely
19:15 intact physically and mentally
19:18 it was the even playing ground for that
19:20 guy he connected absolute for all kids
19:29 on this show it's obviously a very adult
19:31 theme show for me life is goes something
19:37 like this I believe that we are utterly
19:42 and completely gifted with all the
19:44 answers to all the questions that we
19:46 might possibly be able to conceive all
19:49 of the solutions for the needs and the
19:52 wants that we have are accessible and to
19:58 the degree we keep an open mind and then
20:00 exercise that mind and open it and thus
20:04 gain more vision / enlightenment then we
20:10 have a lot more tools at our disposal so
20:14 the master of humanity on a adolescent
20:18 level found it nearly well I wouldn't
20:22 say impossible but definitely more
20:24 difficult quantifiably more difficult to
20:28 connect with adults
20:30 so I'm hoping that perhaps this venue of
20:33 this particular show might be able to
20:36 get a little deeper than he was able to
20:38 get because I built my platform on
20:40 communicating with adults right I
20:42 thought about calling this episode you
20:44 know what we're doing here and I don't
20:47 necessarily mean in the universe and
20:49 reality but what we're doing on this
20:50 show one doesn't have to look any
20:54 further than our Facebook page to
20:58 realize there are a bunch of amazing
21:01 people with amazing souls they're just
21:05 like mr. Rogers soul and we are
21:08 desperately trying to figure out the
21:12 thing the thing to say the way to behave
21:16 to take something that's important yet
21:21 complicated and boil it down and boil it
21:24 down and refine the words so that when
21:28 we say it to another human being
21:29 regardless of what state of perhaps
21:32 denial they're in hostility that they're
21:34 in any stage of the kubler-ross effect
21:39 they're able to hear us in a very deep
21:43 and meaningful way such that they can
21:46 start their own journey sort of that
21:49 spark that goes into Frankenstein to
21:51 give him life we don't have the key to
21:57 get out of the matrix if it is one and
21:59 so we are stuck being the hacker neo
22:03 within the matrix to pass around memes
22:06 and videos and funny interesting
22:10 acquisitive posts so that perhaps we can
22:13 jog the soul of another human pain being
22:15 to say look it might not be the way you
22:19 think it is or the complete inverse
22:24 which is sort of Mister Rogers take
22:26 which is to say it's just like it was
22:29 when you were a kid you've just been
22:32 convinced by indoctrination or the
22:34 chatter and the chaos around your life
22:40 that you are subjugated
22:43 you are a slave to evil that it gets to
22:48 choose first you get to choose second
22:52 it'd be like if you were an endangered
22:54 servant somewhere and a bunch of food is
22:57 made every day but your evil evil
23:00 overlords get to pick all the good food
23:02 first and they get to fill their belly
23:04 way beyond their need and you get the
23:09 scraps on the floor and they throw down
23:11 a little bone with some meat on it it's
23:16 the theme of the Pixar movie bug's life
23:20 it is the theme of you know the last
23:26 part of three amigos that caught that
23:28 comedy with Martin Short Chevy Chase and
23:30 Steve Martin the poor Mexican village
23:33 that gets overrun by l'a WAPA when all
23:35 of his men and they go and they take
23:37 everything that's great cluding the
23:39 people the women and you get what's left
23:41 I don't know about you but I'm tired of
23:45 that game but at the same time I don't
23:53 think that if we gave mr. Rogers every
23:57 resource he ever wanted would he have
24:00 ever gone in a violent way any type of
24:04 Joe Cronan manner any Orwellian manner
24:08 there are a lot of ways to educate
24:10 people and we now do to social media
24:14 have been able to engage in infinitely
24:16 more methods than we ever have before
24:18 written word video meme we still talk to
24:26 each other's human beings hopefully in a
24:31 silly way although I think this isn't
24:33 silly at all we owe it to people like
24:36 Fred Rogers
24:37 to not forget what he was trying to do
24:42 he took it
24:45 35 years and he had to lay it down
24:49 because he got sick but he gave it his
24:52 all during those 35 years
24:56 he is one of many who have done such a
24:58 thing and we owe it to him and I think
25:04 ourselves and if you believe in a God
25:08 for the Almighty to pick up that torch
25:11 and keep going to add our special access
25:16 to human beings to the formula some of
25:20 you will be amazing with children you
25:22 have access to children if I was running
25:26 I have a I should say this I have a
25:27 former associate of mine whose husband
25:30 ran a daycare center he does to this day
25:34 and if I were that guy if I had seen
25:38 this documentary and I had I had not
25:41 already fluently understood what mr.
25:44 Rogers was trying to do it would change
25:46 the rest of my interaction as an
25:51 overseer of kids to be as much like that
25:55 guys you could possibly be I mean the
26:00 dude wrote the PlayBook on how to
26:03 interact with kids and give them
26:05 self-esteem
26:07 now they ended the documentary with the
26:14 the sounded like the Fox morning crew
26:19 and I was extremely disappointed here
26:22 this I've always told you those guys are
26:23 no better than anyone else in fake news
26:25 but they they completely misinterpreted
26:30 his message in his intent and whether
26:32 they were essentially trying to blame
26:34 all of the Millennials on mr. Rogers
26:36 because he simply said you're special
26:38 right now you're special without
26:40 accomplishing anything extraordinary
26:43 this is something he clarified speaking
26:46 to the last college that he spoke to
26:50 they said that he developed entitlement
26:52 and kids because he told them that they
26:54 were special but they didn't have to do
26:55 anything to be special that they were
26:57 simply special now that's not what the
27:00 dude was saying you'll hear me echo the
27:04 other theme and many of my episodes but
27:07 not with such a cynical
27:09 it's fun to become something that you
27:12 want to become whatever that is right
27:15 but I don't want to digress into the
27:17 specifics of how to do something and all
27:20 that in this episode what I want to
27:22 reinforce for an hour is the theme of
27:26 this dudes life because I think it is at
27:30 the very core of what we're trying to do
27:34 and what we now affectionately call the
27:35 great awakening but even without a great
27:39 awakening we need to be doing this every
27:43 single day to each other and to
27:45 ourselves so that we can get out of this
27:48 rat race of reporting to evil overlords
27:53 but to allow them to rinse base in our
27:55 mind and write the protocols the bylaws
27:59 and the matrix code inside of our brains
28:01 to adopt and adhere to their evil ways
28:07 when 9/11 happened I had this really sad
28:14 epiphany at some point I don't know what
28:17 year it was probably five to ten years
28:19 afterwards of all the people I still
28:25 have this I still have this feeling of
28:27 all the people that just crossed the 911
28:30 line in their life having lived a full
28:32 wonderful life bringing enjoyment and
28:37 self-esteem to others happiness to
28:40 others in any way shape or form
28:42 and they cross that line they see this
28:44 event occur and due to health reasons
28:46 age what-have-you
28:49 they passed away on the other side what
28:54 must they have thought on their deathbed
28:57 about where the world was going we have
29:03 a moment in time that I have always said
29:06 is going to be a very short window
29:08 before the evil figures out how to close
29:11 that window and they will not only close
29:14 that window but they will close it by
29:17 removing it paving
29:20 for it and then erasing the notion in
29:23 all men's minds the windows exist and
29:27 they will take control of your children
29:30 and they will indoctrinate them away
29:33 from any belief the freedom even exists
29:36 they will redefine freedom as the lowest
29:40 possible form of existence on this earth
29:44 but now the world is a complex place
29:46 isn't it well let's just say that
29:49 America and I I do apologise to anyone
29:53 listening outside the country I didn't
29:54 mean to make this the pro-american thing
29:57 only here but it's good to think about
30:01 this just as a 350 million person
30:03 movement just for one second you can use
30:06 substitute your own country or wherever
30:10 you live your country figures are
30:11 completely out you become completely
30:15 enlightened the themes of Mister Rogers
30:18 are taught to your children and everyone
30:20 ends up very balanced there are no evil
30:23 overlords in your government and your
30:25 banking in your consumerism holidays
30:29 reduced to this moment where people
30:31 actually enjoy being with each other as
30:33 the primary gift the Stevie Wonder said
30:37 in his song I wish we were just happy
30:40 for the joy the day would bring because
30:43 sometimes they wouldn't get any gifts at
30:44 all I often will mention the little
30:49 statement of skin in the game
30:53 it was the maiden voyage of MKULTRA
30:56 radio where my co-host Kyle said you
30:58 know we have essentially come to the
31:00 point in our lives where we feel like we
31:01 got to have some skin in the game and we
31:03 started that show and everything was
31:05 horrid we had a bad president about
31:08 administration the military anyone who
31:11 was good for for decent peaceful
31:15 interpretations of human existence on
31:18 this planet were forcibly retired while
31:21 those that serve the evil overlords were
31:24 given their positions we're no longer in
31:28 that hopeless world
31:32 we're in a good state a good opportunity
31:35 not only are we able to figure out what
31:38 to say
31:39 but now there's an infinitely greater
31:41 group of people who are listening so
31:46 that's why we have to figure out what we
31:49 want to say what's important I have made
31:53 over 350 episodes if you really count it
31:56 it's 375 you go for all this special
31:59 reports there's a few that are turned
32:03 off
32:04 especially reports that are that is but
32:09 I'm still going there's still more to
32:11 say it's still more parts of society we
32:14 have to dissect and analyze I talked for
32:20 an hour an hour and a half two hours and
32:24 for you diehard listeners you know I'm
32:27 just scratching the surface half the
32:28 time just reading you the syllabus of
32:32 the semester long course at a gigantic
32:36 college of life but what I find
32:40 brilliant about mr. Rogers is that he
32:42 boiled it down to some pretty basic
32:44 things now I do want to make a
32:48 distinction because I haven't made this
32:50 distinction in the past I could probably
32:51 make an entire episode on this subject
32:53 matter but you know there there's this
32:59 debate in the upper intellectuals of at
33:05 least the circles that I travel in as to
33:08 whether or not one is to feel what is
33:13 right first and then act versus to act
33:17 and worry about your feelings later I
33:21 don't know about you but in my life when
33:25 I have taken action without analyzing my
33:28 feelings first
33:29 getting a sense of perspective of my
33:31 actions actually being either
33:33 appropriate or inappropriate I have
33:36 failed almost categorically in that
33:39 behavior and when I take some time off
33:42 for maybe a moment of great frustration
33:46 and think it through and sometimes it's
33:49 a lot longer than you want to analyze it
33:51 you feel like you need to take take
33:53 action because time is of the essence
33:56 when you think it through you typically
33:58 make the best judgment you can possibly
34:00 make again sometimes we just have things
34:04 that happen and we simply have to make
34:05 that choice really quickly at that point
34:08 the best thing I can do is to disengage
34:11 my my direct consciousness feel the
34:15 universe gives me a frequency of either
34:18 truth truth or or caution I should say
34:26 and I just let something natural happen
34:29 and sometimes that works as well now
34:33 what's interesting for this guy is that
34:34 he was able to anthropomorphize his
34:36 personality into puppets that he used on
34:39 his show now for me personally the
34:42 puppets side of the game sort of freaked
34:44 me out a little bit because it was just
34:45 a little strange I don't know why I
34:48 think that the I remember the the
34:51 appearance of the puppets kind of
34:52 freaked me out a little bit was a kid
34:54 that was interesting but now after I
34:57 watched the documentary and realized
34:59 that these things had different
35:00 personalities that all contradicted each
35:02 other - to highlight the discussion I
35:07 now think that he was more brilliant on
35:12 his first show than most people are on
35:14 their last show who tried to do these
35:15 kind of things Bruce Lee used to say
35:19 this thing about being like water in his
35:23 fighting style because water was fluid
35:25 water took the shape of anything that it
35:28 was poured into and so he said in his
35:30 fighting style you must be dynamic
35:33 enough to be like water I think that's
35:36 brilliant
35:37 there's a part of that that I think
35:39 applies to the way we approach our
35:41 selves in life to be dynamic to be able
35:47 to roll with the punches of the chaos of
35:49 life but I think it all comes back to a
35:53 core and again sometimes those things
35:57 are so cerebral
35:59 they're hard to understand but watching
36:02 this documentary made me feel like oh my
36:04 god this dude just boiled it all down
36:07 but it's one thing to say love your
36:09 neighbour and love yourself
36:11 he didn't say love your neighbor as you
36:13 love yourself which is something that
36:15 has said in biblical references which I
36:16 don't think works because I might be a
36:18 lot tougher on myself than I would ever
36:20 be appreciated for by my neighbor but
36:26 his method of saying it is to say love
36:29 your neighbor and that probably means
36:31 you need to adjust yourself as the
36:34 neighbor needs to be loved he had a
36:39 couple kids come in one kid was in a
36:41 wheelchair another kid I'm not sure what
36:45 may be suffering from MS or something
36:47 had a helmet on both kids fully sentient
36:50 brilliant little kids and you saw him
36:54 change just a little bit to accommodate
36:58 them the message he put forth to them
37:02 was unique custom fit for them I think
37:10 that's brilliant I I dated a girl once
37:16 who had a she still does a beautiful
37:19 daughter who was Down syndrome
37:21 I had never dealt with that before she's
37:26 probably about 13 when I met her and
37:29 there was a she was you know she was
37:34 starting to really gain control she was
37:36 getting to be a larger kid you know like
37:38 a normal sized kid and she struggled
37:40 with moments of frustration and she
37:44 would act out in physical ways never in
37:46 front of me and I went over there once
37:49 the very first time where we had decided
37:51 our relationship it hit a sweet spot
37:53 where I could meet the kids she had two
37:55 other kids and I remember that we
37:58 carefully orchestrated the moment when I
38:00 met the other daughter the first
38:02 daughter the oldest daughter who had
38:04 Down syndrome and she couldn't talk much
38:10 she had a few words
38:13 and I remember the only thing I put in
38:17 my head because I thought this little
38:20 girl could read my soul it was I just
38:24 beamed utter and complete love at her
38:30 and she had this beautiful beautiful
38:32 eyes and a beautiful smile and I just
38:36 sat with her and we had a great time
38:40 and then we got her to bed later that
38:43 evening and her mother came out to me
38:45 and said she has never responded to
38:48 anyone like that before and that was
38:51 probably the closest thing I've ever
38:53 done to a mr. Rodgers moment in my life
38:56 what did I do
38:57 I didn't overthink it I just let it
39:02 happen and I went back to my core but I
39:05 was raised with which is to be as honest
39:09 and as pure as I could possibly be with
39:11 another human being and I felt like in
39:14 her presence in my mind she may not have
39:19 all the things that other kids have but
39:21 the one thing I credit her with and I
39:24 think quite accurately and it was
39:25 probably a divine moment where I was
39:27 inspired myself was to acknowledge the
39:30 fact that she could see deeper into my
39:33 soul than anyone else I had met to that
39:36 point and I thought it was probably
39:38 instantaneous and I didn't premeditate
39:42 the moment I didn't really probably I
39:45 can almost assure you I'm now thinking
39:46 back I didn't really drive up to the
39:49 house going oh my god it's that moment
39:50 I'm gonna meet her daughter and I hope
39:52 this goes well and I better behave like
39:53 this and do that
39:54 mm-hmm I just let it be and I when she
40:01 had to be put into an assisted living
40:03 home I went with her when I sat down
40:09 with her and we watched Barney together
40:12 and that's when I heard her sing and she
40:18 knew the words she was mesmerised
40:21 by something very pure very innocent and
40:25 custom-made for
40:26 her I bring that up because I really do
40:32 well let's put it this way I'll give you
40:34 another analogy a scientific analogy
40:36 that I think applies to our human nature
40:39 we keep over complicating the universe
40:43 because to us it is chaotic and it's
40:46 hard to understand at times but I think
40:51 that the most beautiful elegant true
40:53 solutions to life is pure simplicity I
40:58 was having a good conversation with a
41:01 friend of mine regarding organized
41:05 religion and it reinforced in me like
41:10 crazy this previous experience I had had
41:13 which I'm gonna share here I think in
41:16 the theme mr. Rogers being religious
41:18 this is a appropriate now what I'm about
41:24 to say is most definitely not the
41:25 closing beliefs of Fred Rogers I had
41:30 these Mormon kids coming to my house
41:31 like I've said in several previous
41:33 episodes and it was probably about a
41:37 year after I had finally just come to
41:40 peace with the notion that I don't
41:42 believe that Christ ever existed
41:45 again I'm not slamming the message by
41:48 any stretch I just don't think the
41:50 person ever existed but these kids came
41:54 in and they said you know we're from the
41:59 Latter day Saints and I said that's
42:00 great let's sit down talk I don't know
42:02 anything about your world I've heard it
42:04 criticized a million times but I really
42:06 don't know what you kids believe tell me
42:08 and the conversation proceeded and I
42:10 want to be fully open with them because
42:12 I didn't want to lead them down a false
42:14 path I said well I have to be very
42:16 honest with you and I have come to the
42:18 conclusion that I don't think Christ
42:19 ever existed and of course I well let's
42:23 put this way other than perhaps knocking
42:25 on the door of an atheist that would be
42:27 very blunt about such a belief they had
42:31 never met someone who believed in the
42:32 message or many messages I should say of
42:34 the Bible but still didn't believe that
42:35 Christ existed it was a new thing for
42:37 them and so they asked me to pray to God
42:41 for a guess an alteration of my belief
42:44 to reinforce the idea that this son of
42:48 his existed and came down to earth in
42:50 the flesh and died for our sins and I
42:54 prayed hesitantly as I talked to God all
42:58 the time several times a day out loud
43:01 with my voice and I asked him okay I'm
43:07 gonna hold up my word with these kids
43:09 and I'm gonna ask you about this and it
43:11 took about three weeks and I woke up on
43:16 my bed one morning and the room is
43:19 beautifully lit and it wasn't as if I
43:23 was in my bed under sheets It was as if
43:26 I was in the palm of God and my bed was
43:29 his hand and he sounds a little nuts but
43:35 I'm just telling you you know me pretty
43:40 straight shooter right it's very hard to
43:44 put into words because this whole thing
43:45 was an emotional Epiphany but his first
43:50 communication with me was something to
43:53 the effect of I'm here I'm here for your
43:56 answer let me know when you're ready and
43:59 I remember almost feeling like I was
44:02 turning around from being on my side to
44:05 being sort of all my hands on his palm
44:09 and I said I'm ready and he said you
44:14 have never ever nor will you ever be out
44:18 of my presence and presence felt like
44:22 the word bosom you're always near and
44:26 dear to me right here right on my heart
44:30 you're always with me and if you were
44:33 ever outside of my presence you simply
44:35 wouldn't exist so that is the very proof
44:37 that you're within my presence we are
44:40 never apart we'd never have been apart
44:43 there's nothing you can do to be apart
44:45 from me you're here boom
44:51 so face value the whole thing was well
44:55 yeah this overcomplicated protocol we
44:59 have with God in the form of any
45:00 organized religion the do's and don'ts
45:02 and what you gotta do to get to heaven
45:03 and all this other hoopla was
45:06 immediately moot and it felt for the
45:09 very first time in my entire life God
45:12 like simple beautiful hmm
45:18 so of course these moment kids want me
45:20 to address the other half of the
45:22 question cuz I really didn't ask the
45:24 other question I've always believed that
45:26 one but to hear it from the g.od and
45:28 some beautiful feeling in my heart
45:32 changed me forever so I said well they
45:35 want me to ask you about this person
45:38 Jesus being your son and then I felt
45:43 sort of like this disappointment that I
45:46 had to ask the question in the first
45:47 place I was been I had just been given
45:50 the answer and had I just closed off the
45:53 channel with God I probably would have
45:55 determined this other answer by myself
45:58 but I was asking sort of a as man would
46:02 say it to man a dumb question and there
46:07 was a pause there literally was a beat
46:09 in the script where it's almost as if
46:13 God gave me the chance to resend the
46:15 question and take it on myself to think
46:17 I was being lazy I wasn't thinking but
46:21 he obliged anyway and that's when I
46:25 looked down into my mattress cuz he
46:27 asked me this question first before I
46:29 looked down he said who would want you
46:32 to believe that I would kill my only Son
46:36 to create this relationship this
46:40 business transaction of baptism to get
46:43 to me and this whole idea that you're
46:45 away from me in the first place who
46:48 would ever want you to believe such a
46:49 thing and I misinterpreted the answer
46:54 which is why I'm gonna clarify it here
46:56 because it's so it's so appropriate to
47:00 the theme of the show in my opinion
47:02 I looked down and in my mind's eye I saw
47:07 the Garden of Eden something that I do
47:10 not believe exists but he was answering
47:12 it and symbol and immediately I saw the
47:16 serpent in the tree and immediately the
47:20 answer came to me who would want you to
47:23 believe such a horrific story the first
47:26 there's original sin to begin with and
47:27 that I got to kill my only son to bring
47:30 us together the devil Satan himself I
47:39 had never thought that and what ended up
47:43 being the case was he said this whole
47:48 book that people lean on in Christianity
47:51 especially and anyone who believes in
47:53 original sin they've been reading the
47:56 doctrine of the devil now let me clarify
48:01 what I actually ended up understanding
48:04 about the answer because I'm not trying
48:06 to say that the wisdom within the Bible
48:08 is evil how do they do pew in the truth
48:12 movement man they might tell you 80 90
48:15 percent the truth when that last 10 to 5
48:18 percent
48:19 it's a doozy right I know I changed my
48:22 percentages there but let's just go with
48:23 it
48:24 they missguided you at the last second
48:27 into their control apparatus everyone's
48:31 worried they queuing on will do a flip
48:33 at the end I think that's bunk because I
48:36 think that to teach everyone how to
48:38 think for themselves and truly identify
48:40 evil for what it is and then to somehow
48:42 try to turn them at the last second I
48:43 don't think that works and that's the
48:45 last theme you would teach man before a
48:47 big doop job no he would simply do and
48:50 say these people are bad these people
48:51 are good we're the good they're the bad
48:53 and then you do but you don't teach them
48:55 how to think for themselves you provide
48:56 all the answers that's not what's going
49:00 on and the Great Awakening is it you're
49:02 encouraged to think for yourself isn't
49:04 that the theme of the Great Awakening
49:07 for a second I thought God was saying
49:09 that there is a devil I no longer think
49:12 that's what he was saying
49:15 I think what he was saying is evil in
49:18 general the evil overlords who are quite
49:22 human on this planet
49:24 those that invented the notion of
49:26 original sin those who took the most
49:31 beautiful parables man has ever been
49:33 inspired by God to write down and put
49:35 them inside of a story to create a
49:38 control apparatus around man
49:41 to derive money and control I won't
49:46 mention anything specific in this
49:47 episode but we know what I mentioned
49:49 most the time and I mentioned these evil
49:50 organizations that call themselves
49:52 churches they do bad things to our kids
49:58 but because of the control apparatus
50:01 they're untouchable right what happened
50:05 at the end of star wars 1 there are star
50:07 wars for I should say a new hope the
50:10 unthinkable obi-wan Kenobi sacrifices
50:15 himself to Darth Vader and what is his
50:18 final parting words as a human being who
50:20 is alive if you strike me down I shall
50:25 become more powerful than you could
50:26 possibly imagine hmm I know another dude
50:33 that went to the other side his name is
50:36 Fred Rogers hmm now imagine there all
50:43 the experiences you've ever heard of or
50:45 had yourself with potentially the spirit
50:48 realm being completely capable of
50:50 influencing those who are willing to
50:53 listen based on the themes of what
50:56 you're willing to listen to so if you
50:58 are worshipping Satan you're gonna
51:02 listen to dark messages if you're
51:04 worshipping God you're willing to listen
51:07 to light messages bright messages good
51:11 messages this dude saw 9/11 and shortly
51:17 after that had to leave due to health
51:20 reasons he is one voice and one person
51:26 that we know by name because he had the
51:27 ability to get on
51:29 vision for a lot of us as kids but we
51:32 know there's probably infinitely more
51:34 people with the same exact agenda
51:38 perhaps those who even convert it after
51:40 passing that are willing to give us that
51:43 guidance if we're just willing to listen
51:46 then beautifully a lot of us are alive
51:48 right we talk to each other we want the
51:53 deception to stop we want truth to fill
51:56 the gaps that are the voids laid down by
51:59 lies now it's tough to listen and think
52:04 that you've got truth when no one's
52:07 there to stamp it and say oh yeah this
52:09 one is totally true and so what we have
52:12 to do is develop very specific doctrine
52:16 to say this is what is good and this is
52:20 what is bad this is light and this is
52:23 dark in the visual metaphor of recording
52:29 at night is actually fairly powerful
52:30 isn't it I'm surrounded by dark but I am
52:37 lit by light I've always thought that
52:42 when I taught kids anything it was the
52:47 greatest responsibility I've ever had in
52:49 my life especially when I have one on my
52:51 own but I talked to plenty of young kids
52:53 prior to having my own kid when you
52:56 teach kids young people it's very
52:59 important you don't misguide them you
53:02 don't say anything that could be
53:04 misconstrued later on as some sort of
53:08 pass or fail test in life by which if
53:12 they view themselves as failing your
53:15 suggestion that they think that they're
53:17 a failure afterwards well kids you got
53:19 to do this to succeed and then they go
53:20 oh my god I'm not doing that I'm a
53:21 failure I guess I never will never be
53:23 one of those successful people boom and
53:26 they ding themselves down I think there
53:34 are a lot of little kids inside grown-up
53:37 bodies all over the world and I think we
53:39 all have that vulnerable
53:42 of ourselves that is bull that basically
53:48 struggles on a daily basis to try to
53:50 make sense out of everything but we're
53:52 supposed to be growing up right we're
53:54 supposed to be knowledgeable and wise
53:57 after a certain number of years pass but
54:02 the more that we rely on help you know
54:07 we don't go and hunt our food anymore we
54:09 don't craft anything anymore
54:11 it's all a purchase service the more we
54:14 get indoctrinated that if we don't have
54:16 certain items in life are not successful
54:19 it's very very difficult to hang on to
54:22 those base principles because we get
54:24 clouded with our sort of man-made
54:26 desires don't we we give you a little
54:29 litmus test that'll help you kind of
54:31 decipher what I just said even though I
54:33 think it was pretty clear and most of
54:35 you got it if you were to take a piece
54:37 of paper and write down everything that
54:41 makes people happily happy today and
54:45 2019 and then take that piece of paper
54:49 and go back 200 years and say what did
54:54 those what strike everything off this
54:56 list that is not on the list of someone
54:58 200 years ago they can't have it because
55:00 televisions don't exist the internet
55:02 doesn't exist and whatever doesn't exist
55:05 I think when you strike it all down if
55:09 you put not only the emotional things
55:11 that make us happy with the material
55:13 objects that make us happy guess what's
55:16 going to be left on that piece of paper
55:18 all the things that are free to come
55:22 with humanity that come with being alive
55:25 love giving forgiveness empathy sympathy
55:36 that's Mister Rogers he wasn't going
55:40 around to schools handing out you know
55:42 Oprah prizes under their seats what did
55:45 that guy do he sat down he smiled and he
55:50 gave every one of these kids his
55:52 individual attention they wanted to come
55:54 up to him and tell him things I like you
55:57 mr. Rogers and he'd say I like you too
56:00 you're special
56:02 just the way you are right easy easy
56:07 and how much money did he have to give
56:09 out of his pocket every time one of
56:11 these life-changing events happen four
56:13 people zero nothing how many times you
56:20 ever been in a relationship and the
56:24 person that you're with can't be happy
56:25 unless you're out spending money
56:26 somewhere I mean it's an imperative you
56:30 can't eat at home got to go out in a
56:32 fancy place he couldn't possibly spend
56:34 the weekend inside you got to always be
56:37 in a concert be at some gathering some
56:39 museum amusement park you got to be
56:41 doing something to make yourself feel
56:42 special and then you you're sitting
56:47 there saying no wait a minute it's not
56:49 like I don't want to eat out every once
56:50 in a while or go someplace special
56:52 do something special but what the hell
56:53 makes it special if you eat out every
56:56 single day it starts to become boring
56:59 you don't even know we're gonna where
57:01 you want to eat because all that food
57:02 every single scrap of everything you're
57:05 a billionaire it doesn't sound that good
57:07 does it but a home-cooked meal by
57:09 someone you love
57:10 maybe you fix it for them now that's
57:13 special it was crafted with love when
57:17 the food tastes good
57:18 it was handpicked by you or someone else
57:21 for you hmm one of the closing quotes of
57:27 the documentary which again you got to
57:29 see this thing is that he said that his
57:35 mother told him when everything seems
57:39 like it's going wrong
57:43 look for those people who are helping
57:45 others because they're gonna have
57:48 exactly what you need they're gonna be
57:51 the kind of people you want to hang out
57:53 with in the first place right and it's
57:56 I'm paraphrasing but that is the
57:58 brilliance of his mother but he gave us
58:02 a little litmus test that was
58:06 beautifully played at the end of this
58:08 documentary and I don't mean to spoil
58:10 this beautiful moment for you but if you
58:12 have a little bit more time to think
58:13 about his litmus test you might have a
58:16 little more fun at the end of the
58:18 episode but he gave this beautiful
58:21 monologue that was recorded and it was
58:22 played back to a lot of people that
58:24 participated in the documentary just
58:25 being filmed listening to his voice
58:27 saying this I think everybody got pretty
58:30 choked up but he wanted you to think of
58:36 someone in your life it was always
58:39 supportive of you but when you think of
58:43 the one person that really gifted you
58:47 with the perception of the world as it
58:48 should be
58:49 who was that person some people said
58:54 their mothers some people said Fred
58:56 Rogers some people had other answers and
59:02 I thought well that's an interesting
59:03 little question I mean it sounds like a
59:05 little anecdotal test I just remember
59:08 someone nice in your life but I think it
59:10 goes way deeper than that because I'm
59:14 sitting there thinking about the thing
59:15 myself I'm thinking wow who would that
59:18 be and it's instantaneous once you just
59:20 contemplate the question it's
59:21 instantaneous
59:23 whoever that person is it comes right to
59:25 your mind right away for me it would
59:27 probably be my grandmothers they were my
59:30 mom's they grew up in an era where you
59:35 were expected to have as much integrity
59:38 as possible they were extremely
59:39 open-minded women you know I didn't
59:41 really have a bunch of controversy for
59:43 them when I was a kid but they were
59:46 always there with a smile a hug
59:48 encouragement and none of it was
59:52 frivolous it wasn't like oh I just love
59:55 everything that you do constant
59:57 now you know I had some requirements as
59:59 a human being I had to be a good person
60:01 through and through my soul had to be
60:03 pure to get these woman's love but since
60:06 they raised me it was their least I hope
60:11 it's there why is it important because
60:15 Mister Rogers is trying to say to you I
60:18 believe once you find that person in
60:23 your answer you have the archetypal
60:26 moment that Colonel spark of your
60:30 existence that will predetermine how you
60:34 are to be the very best person you can
60:36 possibly be for the rest of your life
60:40 they may be dead and gone or in
60:43 spiritual form but you just need to
60:45 think of them when you have a question
60:47 about how would how should I behave in
60:49 this moment what should I do
60:51 should I raise my voice and get angry
60:53 should I swallow it and get a different
60:56 perspective until it can come out and
60:58 it's not so acidic well those two women
61:01 would be the women but I would push
61:03 everything through in my brain I do it
61:06 all the time I do it all the time
61:08 there's a lot more heroes than that you
61:11 know from my home town then I think
61:13 about that kind of thing my parents
61:15 didn't have the benefit of I think
61:18 growing up in their era so they have as
61:20 many flaws as I have when it comes to
61:22 how to respond to things so I have to
61:24 leap another generation to get that
61:27 purity not were they perfect of course
61:29 not but I tell you what if you had to
61:32 itemize every time that they had hurt
61:35 someone's feelings or taken more than
61:38 they give it's a dead record there's
61:41 nothing on it there's no moment in their
61:43 life where they ever did that because
61:45 that's what they were taught themselves
61:47 and that's how they valued themselves
61:49 every day they laid down on the pillow
61:51 at night to go to bed we all know people
61:54 like that some of you are like that
61:57 naturally you are a mr. Rogers or a mr.
62:00 mrs. Rogers whatever it might be and
62:03 then you are more powerful than any of
62:08 us
62:09 to spread that love and that
62:10 understanding to the world the game that
62:14 we're playing right now and the great
62:15 awaken is that we need more people like
62:18 that all over the world the more that I
62:23 study global conditions around the world
62:26 my fear is that we are waking up in the
62:31 first world and I am I am a little
62:35 frightened that the other part of the
62:39 world is unable to wake up because and I
62:44 hope I'm totally wrong and I've given
62:47 examples like the the gentleman I rode
62:49 with from Vietnam he said he grew up in
62:51 the jungles of Vietnam and he's actually
62:53 going to quit his uber job in San
62:54 Francisco and get back to the jungles of
62:56 Vietnam because he said at least there
62:58 were real we're loving and that is where
63:02 I see an example deep inside the jungle
63:05 without television and and all the
63:08 material crap that we worship in this
63:10 world and they're able to be kind just
63:14 because that's the way man is born to be
63:16 man uninterrupted in a jungle as long as
63:21 there's not you know genocidal Wars
63:22 going on they have the opportunity to
63:28 educate themselves to have this
63:30 beautiful simplicity to their life that
63:33 is the way we were actually meant to be
63:36 you know there's this this kind of
63:39 rebirth of the notion of a job well done
63:44 at the end of the day makes you feel
63:46 better than anything in the entire world
63:48 you built something you fed people you
63:51 helped people you love someone makes you
63:54 feel wonderful at the end of the day you
63:56 sacrificed your time and your energy
63:58 because someone else needed it more than
64:00 you needed it for yourself we must do
64:05 those things the problem that we have
64:09 allowed to manifest in this world is
64:13 that there was a group of people that
64:17 dominated other people in war they
64:22 create suffering
64:23 they control things and when they put
64:27 their head down at night it is that evil
64:30 that they engage in that brings them an
64:34 artificial short-term styling of what
64:39 perhaps we feel by simply helping
64:42 another person there's a lot of people
64:46 in Christianity that they live everyday
64:52 and I had a period of this in my own
64:54 life and you can still do this today
64:55 where the god light regardless if you
64:56 believe the guy ever existed or not we
65:00 have this saying be more christ-like
65:02 because if you can't come up with any
65:05 any human in your life that is like your
65:08 mother or your grandmother your
65:10 grandfather what have your father you
65:13 can always lean back to this ever
65:16 forgiving amazing person known as Jesus
65:21 Christ right you can go there again
65:24 fictional or real real it doesn't matter
65:28 it would seem that I don't think it's
65:34 much of a stretch one of his sons
65:35 actually said this referenced his father
65:38 like this and I never felt like he was
65:41 incorrect in this but by the time I was
65:43 done with the documentary and I
65:45 understand documentaries I have a ingles
65:46 and all this other kind of stuff and no
65:48 man is perfect but I I think that if we
65:52 were to approach again if you see the
65:54 documentary and you really study the
65:56 interactions you know some of it should
65:59 make you want to weep this guy was so
66:01 good at what he did I mean jeez if the
66:04 world was rolling like mr. Rogers I
66:07 don't know if man would have any
66:09 perception of limitation in his life or
66:14 her life
66:15 that guy is as christ-like as any person
66:21 I've ever seen live in my lifetime I
66:24 know there's plenty that we have no
66:26 names for there your relatives maybe
66:28 it's even you but if you want to reach
66:31 out to an the well you want to reach out
66:34 to an example in the last 50
66:37 years of the dude who did it he's one of
66:39 the guys now there was a bunch of funny
66:43 conspiracies about the guy all dismissed
66:45 quite beautifully in the documentary
66:47 about him being a Navy SEAL and all this
66:49 other stuff they don't want to go there
66:51 it's just a waste of your time but the
66:54 other thing that was interesting was
66:55 because he was such a tender soul and so
67:00 true to his form they they thought he
67:06 was feminine I mean he had I think a
67:09 fully enlightened brain which means he
67:11 had the Egyptian definition of
67:14 enlightenment which he had a fully
67:15 functional left and right brain
67:17 he had the maternal instincts of a
67:19 mother and the maternal instincts of a
67:23 father or paternal instincts of a father
67:27 he sang that song you know every time he
67:30 did his show he's singing a song I don't
67:31 know how many shits 1,700 shows I think
67:34 it was in the last shooting of his of
67:36 his show which means he sang that song
67:39 1,700 plus times where he was inviting
67:43 you to be his neighbor
67:44 it's an invitation he said to enjoy his
67:48 world and some people would look outside
67:52 the box and go oh my god what what
67:55 delusion did this man have to believe
67:58 that everything was so wonderful is it a
68:01 fake Leave It to Beaver episode where
68:03 the world's just as great plays and
68:05 there's a couple of minor sins every
68:06 episode that are then straightened out
68:08 by the parents what he did in my opinion
68:13 was create the world around him a halo
68:18 there was his reality distortion field
68:22 this says when you're in my circle this
68:24 is the way we we roll and you're gonna
68:27 be good to each other and you're gonna
68:29 give and you're gonna give children a
68:31 thousand percent consideration whether
68:34 it matters to you as an adult or not is
68:36 irrelevant you know when you know let's
68:41 put this way when I was a budding parent
68:48 especially when my child was on the way
68:50 I would talk to people a lot of said
68:52 well what would be your advice and being
68:55 a parent I got a whole episode on
68:59 parenting which has got a lot of
69:01 wonderful comments and alkaloids from
69:03 people and I duly humbly I should say
69:09 accept those compliments but the best
69:12 piece of advice I ever got was it's not
69:15 about you anymore
69:16 it's about your kid you are sacrificing
69:19 your life to bring new life into this
69:22 world and it was the best piece of
69:25 advice I ever got because every single
69:27 time I had to deal with you know my
69:30 daughter crying or something whatever
69:32 the unpleasantries here and there being
69:34 a parent which is actually pretty cool
69:36 all the way through in the end once you
69:38 understand crying only has about three
69:40 different meanings go see my show up
69:43 parenting to get the definitions that
69:47 never stops when you're with a child it
69:51 doesn't matter if it's your kid or
69:52 someone else's kid doesn't matter if
69:55 they're totally ornery and little jerks
69:56 or if they're mostly they're just
69:58 totally big eyed and looking you in the
70:00 eye and going what do you what can we do
70:02 let's have some fun one of our one of
70:07 our listeners commented in YouTube
70:10 recently and I can't think that I think
70:11 it was a gentleman enough was that he
70:13 said that he had a nine-year-old son and
70:17 I believe he said he was in his mid-50s
70:18 he made it very very big point to point
70:22 that out and he said you know when I'm
70:24 around my son I am reborn as a beautiful
70:30 person because through the eyes of my
70:33 child I see the world all over again and
70:35 I had a partner of mine a year and a
70:38 half ago who was 70 years old and he had
70:41 a one-year-old daughter and he was a
70:44 hard dude man he was very very wealthy
70:48 he had worked very very hard as entire
70:50 lifetime and he had had his his stomach
70:54 kicked in several times by business
70:56 deals and businesspeople and so he dealt
70:58 with the world and a very tough
71:00 tough arena and he was good at it let me
71:03 tell you but he would constantly come
71:07 into our company and tell us the latest
71:09 story about his daughter teaching him
71:12 something and he was smitten boy he
71:16 built his whole life around his kid in
71:18 fact one of the reasons why he was a
71:20 little hesitant to invest in any company
71:21 and all because he said you know I have
71:23 to be able to invest and walk away and I
71:25 have to be able to trust everything's
71:27 gonna go well if I do so and so because
71:32 he wanted to go back to his kid because
71:34 I really just want to grow up with my
71:35 daughter I don't have many years left on
71:37 this planet and she deserves to have my
71:39 guidance for as long as possible the
71:41 cool thing was he also kept himself very
71:42 healthy you when you went back he was
71:45 always pretty healthy he believed in
71:47 working out in staying healthy and all
71:48 that kind of stuff but he was being
71:49 extra careful so he could be with his
71:51 kid as long as possible but now here's
71:54 my my angle at the end of this whole
71:57 thing what if we're all kids what if
72:04 every single one of us are just as
72:06 vulnerable as we were when we were
72:08 little kids all the little things and
72:10 tics and worries that we had about who
72:13 we were especially are still right there
72:16 on their absolute surface and even if
72:19 someone can put on a stoic shell that
72:22 says I don't care what you think about
72:24 me maybe we all do care to some degree
72:28 now on the internet you definitely got
72:31 to grow some thick skin I tell you if
72:32 you make one of these shows you get a
72:34 you gotta just understand that people
72:36 are in their little perspectives if a
72:38 kid came into your daycare center and
72:40 you've never had them before and they're
72:41 just a little ornery kid you know it's
72:43 gonna take time if you're lucky to
72:45 change their mind about being that way
72:47 yeah you're gonna it's gonna take some
72:50 time to get the kid to see how all the
72:52 other kids are cool okay maybe that's
72:55 still all of us the reason why I
72:58 mentioned that is because the methods
73:03 that mr. Rogers
73:04 use used with children to engage them
73:08 and address their concerns and their
73:10 fears
73:11 maybe it's exactly the same as how we
73:15 should treat each other I think that's
73:17 how he went off and talked to adults now
73:19 he seemingly when he talked to the
73:22 adults was coming at them it's such a
73:24 primitive core value system that the
73:28 adults were like are you for real are
73:30 you really asking me these questions
73:32 you're talking to me kind of like I'm a
73:34 little kid and maybe they were their ego
73:36 stepped in and you know there are some
73:40 passive-aggressive feelings that they
73:43 were being patronized or something I
73:45 think we all know he wasn't doing that
73:48 when I was a kid they used to tell me
73:51 he's just happy it was set all around me
73:53 constantly that as you get older you get
73:56 very cynical or at least that you can
73:59 and that's before the world was as dark
74:02 as it is today right I mean things were
74:04 pretty good when I was a kid they were
74:05 still saying people get really cynical
74:07 dark and they said it in several ways
74:11 that it was almost an imperative that
74:13 this was going to happen to me but I was
74:16 gonna go really cynical and I had at
74:19 least one family member that was not
74:22 aware that this was going to occur and
74:24 that person fell into it hardcore and
74:28 they were in my circle so I ended up
74:31 adopting some of that behavior which has
74:34 taken me decades decades to get rid of
74:37 and it will probably be the bane of my
74:40 existence as Paul had the undefined
74:43 thorn in his side that would be my thorn
74:45 in my side is to remain as genuine when
74:51 is honest and is giving and as real as I
74:54 possibly can to counteract any of that
74:57 cynicism but there are things that we
75:01 grow cynical about right we want to wake
75:05 up and not believe that the world cannot
75:10 be made a good place right it's a double
75:11 negative but we want to believe that we
75:13 can make the world a good place and we
75:14 don't want to believe that it's
75:15 impossible to make the world a good
75:17 place that the evil will dominate as
75:21 they used to see on the show a lot we
75:23 got some homework
75:24 folks we got some major major homework
75:27 and it's not something we're probably
75:29 gonna solve in a comment section on a
75:31 youtube channel or in a Facebook post
75:33 maybe a little bit in Facebook I don't
75:36 know it's gonna come with us
75:39 reengineering who we are by figuring out
75:42 who we are and then behaving properly to
75:47 each other and having that little bit of
75:49 understanding for folks that are having
75:51 a really bad day which might translate
75:54 to a rough stretch in life are people
75:58 gonna try to take advantage of us oh
76:00 yeah most definitely if someone's doing
76:04 that they're in such a state of pain and
76:08 disarray that they probably are not
76:11 conscious that they're doing it or if
76:13 they are conscious they simply don't
76:15 know any other method to survive but to
76:18 take their in sort of a level 1 state of
76:24 intellectual fairness for those of us
76:29 having a slightly better life or even
76:31 struggling with the same things but we
76:33 have methods of dealing with it that
76:35 don't end in a cynical heart a hardened
76:38 coal for a heart I think that most of us
76:44 know that we manufacture happiness we
76:46 manufacture goodness it's a product that
76:48 we create there's no limit to it there
76:51 is a rate at which we can create it so
76:53 we have to be careful not to drain
76:55 ourselves down and as I've said in other
77:00 episodes yes a person who is depressed a
77:03 person who is sort of in that downer
77:06 state everything they say is really just
77:08 kind of a Debbie Downer sort of phrase
77:11 there may be moments in your life where
77:13 you simply have been exhausted and
77:16 there's nothing you can do to bring them
77:17 up they need to go off on their own find
77:20 their path maybe self-destruct rebuild
77:24 and you meet him later
77:26 and they're like yeah sorry I was such a
77:28 jerk back in those days so that was my
77:30 dark days I've got plenty of my friends
77:32 I just hung out with one of them this
77:34 evening
77:35 and he's a beautiful guy he said he was
77:40 in a bad state he was in a bad state you
77:43 know in America when you grow older it's
77:45 tougher and tougher to get jobs even
77:46 though you're 100% qualified for them in
77:48 fact you may be a thousand percent
77:49 qualified for them and you don't need a
77:51 whole lot of money because you're not
77:52 hooked on a bunch of consumerism you
77:55 don't have a big mortgage or big car
77:56 payment you just you just live in a
77:59 simplified life so the company could
78:01 actually save money and get far more
78:03 expertise and patience and dedication
78:05 from a person that's a little bit older
78:08 but nevermind they're like I'd like to
78:10 have a little young kid running around
78:12 the office with a bunch of great
78:14 idealistic ideas willing to take a
78:15 fraction of the check that you have even
78:17 though I'm gonna have to babysit them
78:18 and spend money
78:19 my company's gonna slow down and maybe
78:22 they won't decide to work out in the end
78:23 it's interesting but he had gone through
78:25 a dark phase in his life and he just
78:28 came to the conclusion well I'm just
78:30 gonna have to take the job as I can get
78:32 and he did and he's okay now is he in
78:38 the most perfect state no did he really
78:41 compromise his standards to live not
78:43 really in fact he learned that he wasn't
78:46 compromising his standards by taking
78:48 those other jobs and now he goes to bed
78:51 every night for the knowledge of a job
78:53 well done hmm funny that happens huh so
78:59 my advice is to go see the mr. Rogers
79:02 documentary even if you had to pay four
79:06 bucks for it do it it's good for you
79:09 it's good for your soul and I would say
79:14 depending on how much you feel like you
79:16 absorb it I'm one watch maybe watch it
79:18 again I will most likely watch it a
79:23 couple more times what's amazing to me
79:26 is that I watched that show as a kid and
79:28 I didn't have any ill feelings towards
79:30 that man whatsoever there been
79:32 definitely times in my life where I was
79:34 like that guy for real and that was one
79:36 of the questions they addressed on the
79:37 documentary and everybody who knew him
79:39 including his wife and his best friends
79:41 were like yes and that's what made him
79:44 phenomenal he was exactly the way he was
79:47 on that show in real life
79:49 it wasn't playing some character Wow
79:53 unbelievable
79:55 and is this documentary they film him
79:58 hanging out in his house doing all kinds
80:01 of experimental footage or he's kind of
80:03 working out the themes of his show it
80:06 was a very deep thinker he really
80:08 understood deep human philosophy but he
80:13 knew that no one could understand that
80:14 at least of all children and so he
80:16 brought the themes forward in a way that
80:19 they could understand and again God
80:20 liked it every way he just found simple
80:26 simple practices with kids that's what
80:31 we need to do with each other and that's
80:33 what I hope you get when you watch the
80:36 mr. Rogers documentary well done if
80:40 anybody from that show ever just happens
80:42 on this video and you're entranced
80:44 because your work is being talked about
80:47 brilliant job brilliant job everyone who
80:51 worked on the show thank you very much
80:53 for making that show possible and if
80:57 this is your first I was seeing my show
80:58 definitely be where the rest of the show
81:01 is is similar in theme but not quite in
81:05 the PG rating that we're gonna give this
81:07 one orgy reading and if you haven't been
81:10 to deep thoughts radio.com please go
81:12 that's where you can change feeds from

81:18 the planet there's a Twitter account in
81:20 case you guys want to get your feed
81:21 through Twitter just get notifications

81:24 just say subscribe to the YouTube and
81:26 click that Bell so you can get nice
81:28 little notifications as soon as it drops
81:30 I think most of you guys do that because
81:32 boy I will drop a video and in 10
81:36 minutes it's watched 20 times so that's
81:38 super super incredible to see that the
81:41 content is being absorbed that quickly
81:43 I appreciate it appreciate every single
81:44 one of you for those of you want to
81:47 contribute to the show's upkeep and
81:49 cigars I got to buy and all the other
81:51 good stuff pay me for a little bit of my
81:53 time there's a patreon account in case
81:55 you want to do that for all my patrons
81:58 super appreciate it what ends up
82:00 happening on patreon is that you get
82:01 early previews
82:03 so as soon as the video it starts
82:05 uploading from my computer I cut and
82:07 pasted the URL while that's uploading
82:09 into patreon you gotta wait a couple of
82:11 hours for it to uploading and encode but
82:14 you can get it as soon as the what is it
82:16 the 144p encodes all the shows are in
82:20 season four been uploaded in 4k some of
82:24 the shows for whatever reason the bug
82:26 there's some bug in YouTube where it
82:28 doesn't encode it in 4k unfortunately
82:31 I'm keeping all the originals backed up
82:33 at many different manners so at some
82:35 point when we get to a better platform
82:37 everything will go up hopefully
82:39 sparkling clean but anyway take care of
82:43 yourself and someone else like Mister
82:45 Rogers would do and I will see you in
82:48 the next deep thoughts over now
