00:29 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:31 gentlemen is a I guess it's technically
00:37 Saturday morning just past midnight you
00:42 know fairly decent-sized dinner tonight
00:44 there's this Italian grocery store that
00:51 has like a restaurant in the back and
00:54 their lasagna is like crazy huge and
00:58 like two giant squares for like eight
01:02 bucks and then just get a drink so I got
01:05 that and so my tummy's full and that was
01:08 like several hours ago it's a good
01:11 excuse to setup into an episode well the
01:14 body digests using this ether will push
01:17 what we call gravity as I smoke this
01:21 under crown from Jewish state it's so
01:25 funny this one's like a standard Robusto
01:29 size which is like your standard cigar
01:31 in fact it might be a little shorter
01:32 than a reboost oh but my god my episodes
01:35 still going out in 48 minutes it's like
01:37 I could get into the editing I don't
01:39 know how long the episode is I just
01:42 getting a stream of consciousness and it
01:44 just keeps going see I do the food
01:46 update I did the cigar at the oh yeah
01:48 the episode so you know that name of the
01:52 episode you know I'm always searching
01:54 for ideas for episodes I've got a bunch
01:57 cooking someone asked me to do the JFK
02:00 assassination now for those of you've
02:02 seen all the episodes you know I've
02:03 mentioned pretty much everything I know
02:05 about the JFK assassination but it has
02:08 been in little tiny pieces so I'm gonna
02:10 bring it all together I have a great
02:15 group that represents Nikola Tesla
02:17 contact me and they just dumped this
02:20 treasure trove of information on some
02:23 super cool stuff so we're gonna do a
02:25 Tesla episode then hopefully we'll blow
02:28 minds
02:29 I'm still it's gonna take me all weekend
02:30 to review this stuff so very happy about
02:33 that
02:34 so just know a bunch of stuff's cooking
02:36 is oh you're finally managed to get to
02:39 q once published for the patreon people
02:42 right now it's gonna be really
02:44 controversial but this one's about this
02:48 amazing experience that many of you have
02:50 when you were younger if you are still
02:52 experiencing this then you get the A+
02:55 for the day and that is role-playing not
03:01 necessarily the Trailer Park boy
03:03 role-playing with the sheriff and his
03:05 his whatever you call that guy wasn't a
03:08 sheriff but the greedy was a greedy no
03:13 this is about something that started in
03:16 the 70s it was called Dungeons and
03:18 Dragons and has since branched out into
03:21 every conceivable playing system you
03:24 could imagine what I'm gonna be covering
03:28 are three different playing systems that
03:31 I experienced but it's really not
03:33 tremendously important about the playing
03:36 system there is there sorry I should say
03:39 there are distinctions about Dungeons &
03:40 Dragons the way the mechanisms work
03:42 which I will mention it has been several
03:45 year since I played unfortunately but
03:48 what's more important about the
03:50 experience of role-playing is the
03:52 benefit to mankind that you get from
03:55 role-playing but I'm going to talk about
03:57 Dungeons & Dragons champions and
04:00 Shadowrun those are my three go twos now
04:04 my friends played vampire ones werewolf
04:07 ones and I kind of got involved onesie
04:11 twosie on that stuff but nothing
04:13 tremendously involved with the actual
04:15 roleplay experience and what's
04:18 interesting about it is that if you
04:19 mentioned role-playing which has been
04:21 reprise in the Netflix original series
04:23 stranger things you will get this absurd
04:32 slander someone making fun of those of
04:37 us that love to roleplay and what's
04:40 super duper ironic about it is that they
04:43 go to movies they binge watch shows on
04:46 TV and if available they'll go to a
04:49 restaurant with a role-playing miss
04:52 during murder-mystery going on like clue
04:54 that the board game and then come back
04:57 to social media to their friends and say
05:00 this was the most amazing experience
05:02 ever and those of us the role played or
05:06 role play we just shake our head and go
05:10 yeah of course role playing is
05:12 tremendously fun especially if you have
05:15 a good group of people and you know what
05:17 role playing is so Universal in terms of
05:21 its entertainment that it makes people
05:25 good what was funny about the
05:28 role-playing experiences and I'm gonna
05:29 go through my history with this is that
05:33 one you can't do it by yourself that's
05:34 one of the other things so it encourages
05:36 groups of kids to get together but we
05:40 would have people come and play in the
05:42 bay area where I really got a chance to
05:44 play in Redwood City as a matter of fact
05:47 we should just something role-playing
05:48 and EA but not much usually some board
05:51 games Space Hulk we should do that a lot
05:54 for those of you got blessed by Space
05:56 Hulk man you have a treasure in your
05:59 hands let me know raise your hand if you
06:00 played Space Hulk which turn into
06:02 Warhammer eventually but you have we had
06:06 people like you know I was very
06:08 fortunate because I was working in
06:10 Electronic Arts as a contractor
06:12 initially and then full-time after about
06:15 I guess six years from 93 to 99 I was a
06:20 contractor 99 I got in full-time and I
06:25 was doing kind of thing so writing
06:26 databases I was making music for the
06:28 games doing sound effects all kinds of
06:31 weird stuff before I became full time so
06:35 I had G's to professional game designers
06:39 including my own game design skills
06:40 which were professional at the table we
06:44 had one of our mutual friends who wasn't
06:47 a game designer but might as well have
06:49 been because he's got the brain the size
06:51 of a planet a bit like Marvin we had
06:56 another super senior producer slash game
06:59 designer slash legend in the industry
07:01 coming to play every day that we played
07:05 then a bank manager this female and she
07:09 was probably in her late 30s early 40s
07:12 she's playing and whoever you were
07:15 outside of the game
07:16 he didn't matter you brought only your
07:19 character into the room and then we'd
07:22 have these amazing six-month games and
07:25 then usually the the the person charges
07:28 the game which we're gonna explain the
07:30 mechanics for those who don't understand
07:31 how this works and I hope you get
07:34 curious and I hope you're like you know
07:35 what we should start playing again or
07:36 you go find people that you can play
07:39 with or you just crack it open with some
07:41 friends that have no clue and you all
07:43 figure it out but after this episode
07:44 you'll have enough to get dangerously
07:47 entertained and I've never looked up on
07:50 YouTube if there's how to play D&D but
07:52 I'm sure there's tons of it out there
07:55 the person running the game needs to
07:58 know more than anyone else right in the
08:01 room but I was in Massachusetts as a kid
08:05 I think I was about 11 or 12 years old
08:07 they get 11 10 or 11 and my dad's best
08:11 friend who's is Vietnam vet chopper
08:14 pilot is like he's one of my childhood
08:16 Mentors
08:18 without actively trying to be he lived
08:20 by example in front of me he's the guy
08:22 I've mentioned several times he and his
08:24 sons were playing D&D and he says you
08:28 know you want to play I said yeah so
08:30 they just threw me up a character really
08:31 fast there's only one night thing for me
08:33 they're playing all the time and he just
08:36 says well you know you're here you're
08:38 with these folks this is what's going on
08:41 in the room what do you do
08:42 I remember just kind of going what well
08:45 what do you do oh I guess I do this okay
08:48 and he brought some dice behind that you
08:50 know this little cardboard wall okay
08:53 this is what happens and it was just
08:55 instantaneously amazing so I begged my
08:58 dad to let me get a dungeon dragons box
09:04 the original red box
09:05 intro set with your die he's blue
09:08 injection-molded die of all these
09:11 different shapes plus sort of the an
09:13 intro book and I got no clue what I'm
09:15 supposed to be doing plus I'm by myself
09:17 I'm an only child so I never got a
09:19 chance to
09:19 play well I wanted to play I mean I was
09:22 playing all the video games like Zork
09:24 one two and three every adventure video
09:28 game out there was every game out there
09:30 but it wasn't until my mid-20s that my
09:35 friends were like we're gonna start
09:36 playing D&D they had just moved to a new
09:38 house sat down they taught me everything
09:42 and so now my dungeon master we're gonna
09:47 get to the anatomy of a game really
09:48 quickly but I'm gonna back up real quick
09:51 and talk about some of the benefits here
09:52 Before we jump in so you have a little
09:53 bit of a purpose while you're in this
09:55 deep thoughts radio lecture at the deep
10:00 thoughts radio University but I've got a
10:02 you know an amazing game designer being
10:05 my dungeon master he is the brains of
10:07 the outfit he's got the whole map in his
10:09 brain where everything is what all the
10:10 subplots are everything plots subplots
10:13 everything of course he studied our
10:15 group and he's figured out the dynamics
10:17 and so it was an amazing first six month
10:21 experience with the finale that jerk
10:24 tears out of adults which we'll get to
10:28 so but what's the value of this whole
10:30 situation well first and foremost you
10:36 have a gaming system as illustrated
10:38 beautifully and stranger things where
10:39 you have sort of some I wouldn't say
10:42 disenfranchised kids but definitely
10:44 you're more nerdy academic kids they
10:45 literally have sexual experiences for
10:48 not only sex but for mathematics and
10:50 computers and solving problems and
10:51 figuring out how the universe works
10:53 physics and all that stuff
10:54 every time they learn something about
10:56 God's fingerprints they get off not to
11:00 control you not to control the universe
11:02 but just to know just to be more
11:05 fascinated with their environment well
11:08 most of the world is drinking and
11:09 boozing and doing all other stuff it's
11:11 literally Revenge of the Nerds right you
11:13 get your jocks over there and so then
11:17 you have all the other kids that if they
11:19 play their cards right they may not have
11:21 the physical ability to do the jock
11:23 stuff but they almost get everything
11:25 else in life at level 10 great
11:28 so this gaming system brings a lot of
11:30 kids together and cracks them out of
11:32 their shells because they're tired of
11:34 being by themselves but they don't want
11:35 to venture out in front of a bunch of
11:37 kids that are way different than them
11:39 perhaps you know psychologically abusive
11:42 they have conventions around the world
11:44 that play every role-playing system on
11:48 planet Earth and it is an odyssey to see
11:51 yes you'll get every once in a while
11:53 this weird kid he's maybe a little bit
11:55 of a prima donna but boy they eject that
11:58 kid pretty fast everyone really behaves
12:01 unlike social media but the other one I
12:04 never thought was going to be a benefit
12:09 to me was I've always been sort of well
12:11 I actually haven't always been but by
12:13 around 1617 I really got bit by the
12:16 writing bug bite I moved to California
12:19 it was like let's get it on a lot of
12:21 time to myself I got a computer let's do
12:22 this and so I started writing and I was
12:26 always just writing out the top of my
12:27 head of course never planning anything
12:29 and I got some good things out of it but
12:32 for the most part most my things
12:33 wouldn't finish because I'd never really
12:35 thought it all the way through when I
12:37 got into screenwriting it taught me
12:39 structure taught me how to make sure
12:41 I've got an ending before I even you
12:43 know begin writing anything and so what
12:47 role playing did for me was make me
12:49 think on my feet superfast you get a
12:53 certain amount of that skill set as a
12:55 player but you get a massive amount of
12:58 that skill set when you become either
13:00 what they call the dungeon master which
13:02 is exclusively a term for the person who
13:05 runs the dungeons the Dragons game but
13:08 all the other game systems change the
13:11 dungeon word because they don't have
13:12 dungeons in their role-playing system
13:14 necessarily they call them game masters
13:16 so your geom so again diem is just
13:21 straight reference to the Dungeons and
13:23 Dragons GM is every other roleplay
13:25 system and there are hundreds of them
13:27 and new ones come out all the time you
13:30 could make a role-playing game without
13:32 anything other than maybe a couple
13:35 six-sided die for every one as long as
13:37 you can figure out the rules of what
13:39 those roles meet
13:40 Dungeons and Dragons comes with a series
13:44 of books and most of the books are
13:47 basically there for you to say okay you
13:49 may not be creative enough to dream up
13:51 your own monster so we've got a few
13:54 ideas for you so this show you a monster
13:57 they'll show you a race and ogre and an
14:01 elf they show you the races that you're
14:03 to play and then they show you all the
14:05 monsters you're supposed to fight but
14:07 you can create anything that you want
14:09 there are no rules
14:10 in terms of races that you would play
14:13 and you might get into some arguments if
14:15 you design a completely different race
14:17 that doesn't exist in the game then
14:19 you're kind of walking away from what is
14:21 Dungeons and Dragons so you can't come
14:23 in a grey alien because they'd be just
14:24 like dude what are you doing you know
14:26 really good middle-earth you know
14:28 whatever it's like and then and them but
14:31 there are several elfs several dwarf
14:33 several halfling several humans just
14:36 like there are several humans in real
14:38 life and so they all come with different
14:39 dispositions and talents some are super
14:42 academic and not very physical like
14:45 there's a a Grail which really is a
14:49 scholar he reads out of books he has a
14:51 big book with him with all these spells
14:54 in them and then you have like a wood
14:56 elf a wood elf usually has some facial
14:59 tattoos and is just super buff and
15:02 stocky an elf can live 300 to 700 years
15:06 depending on it with the DM says what
15:11 else typically don't live as long as
15:12 Grails because what else are always in
15:14 battle and so they'll get their heads
15:15 chopped off eventually before the
15:18 academic ones standing on the hilltop
15:19 casting spells down gets hit by an arrow
15:21 or something what I think I'm always
15:25 telling you that we are conditioned with
15:28 mental technologies that essentially
15:30 teach our brain how to think with our
15:33 algebra not because you'll ever use
15:35 algebra in your entire lifetime but
15:37 because it teaches you how to simplify
15:39 things and think in a number of paradigm
15:41 it really makes your mind more
15:43 three-dimensional as opposed to just the
15:45 2d Cartesian coordinate system XY it
15:48 teaches you Z as well inside your mind
15:52 well the mental technologies that come
15:55 out of Dungeons & Dragons is ample I
15:59 don't know if it's limitless quite
16:01 frankly might be so this is in just the
16:06 level of fun I swear to God you don't
16:07 have to have any background in this to
16:10 play a game and find yourself time
16:13 warping six hours in your living room
16:15 and it feels like about two hours
16:19 because that's what happens when you get
16:21 in the game so you get a book that comes
16:24 with the role-playing system that
16:26 teaches you how to be a player and then
16:28 the DM goes off and buys the other books
16:31 to enrich the world
16:33 now typically what happens is your DM
16:36 your Dungeon Master will draw like a map
16:38 on a piece of paper on a graph paper if
16:42 they're being strict about it every
16:44 square has a certain kilometre mile
16:48 indicator for how big everything is
16:50 which gives the DM the notion of if you
16:56 walked a certain amount in a particular
16:58 day you get from point A to point B
17:00 before sunset if they get really strict
17:02 about it the more detail they get and
17:05 like that it's not strict as and you
17:07 feel restricted it's just it's actually
17:09 more fun they feel like well we're gonna
17:11 walk to so-and-so City okay it's gonna
17:14 take you about two days you good with
17:16 that
17:16 all of you know this by the way yeah you
17:19 know totally good and what do we know
17:21 about the terrain between here in the
17:23 city well you don't know because none of
17:25 you've done it before
17:26 the rumors are there's some pretty bad
17:28 areas monster Weiss all right okay so we
17:33 try you know you could say oh we're
17:35 gonna walk on the coast because that way
17:37 we don't get to inland you get eaten up
17:39 by dragons or something sitting around
17:41 all these things are just out there for
17:43 you to improvise but dungeons dragons is
17:47 very unique and it's in its die rolling
17:51 because you have really crazy shaped
17:55 dice and that's what that's for me makes
17:58 it absolutely beyond brilliant because
18:01 it
18:03 it just feels different rolling a
18:05 six-sided die which is what nearly all
18:07 of the role-playing systems have gone to
18:09 now in fact I think he one of the latest
18:11 renditions of D&D is sadly giving up
18:15 some of their really awesome die but
18:18 they'll have like a 20-sided die to hit
18:21 so roll is 20-sided die and the way it
18:23 works is the higher the number the more
18:25 accurate your swing is if you roll a one
18:28 which is only a one in 20 chance you got
18:31 a roll to see if you drop your weapon
18:33 because you really screwed up and so
18:36 you'll have two other die with ten sides
18:38 a piece and you roll them one of them is
18:43 marked as the as the single digit and
18:46 the other ones marked as the second
18:49 digit of a hundred-percent rolling
18:51 system so you have a hundred percent is
18:53 going to be either 1 percent or a
18:54 hundred percent so if you will double
18:56 zeros that's 100 percent year-old 0 and
18:59 1 you have 1 percent and there the
19:01 clearly marked which ones which then you
19:04 have some some magic spells and some
19:06 really rare stuff with really high odds
19:09 against and they've got a pyramid die
19:11 it's beautiful
19:13 and the way the pyramid dye works is
19:15 different than all other die most die
19:16 you roll and you read the top plane
19:18 that's visible right on the pyramid die
19:21 you roll it and because it's a pyramid
19:23 what are you looking what's I do you
19:25 look at you grab it pick it up and look
19:27 at the bottom super cool man
19:31 super freaking cool so already the
19:35 genetics of the game are just unique
19:36 just interesting men but your demon will
19:40 draw a map draw cities draw for us draw
19:42 lakes streams ocean whatever just like I
19:46 just like a continent on World of
19:48 Warcraft and then you pick a city to be
19:52 in putting on your your clan the DM
19:56 might say well you know all those races
19:58 are coming together like a couple cities
19:59 in the whole island or the whole
20:01 continent that have all races in them so
20:04 you either here here and then the DM
20:07 might take one controlling move over
20:09 your entire where are you and what
20:11 you're doing and he'll say or she'll say
20:13 you're in a saloon
20:15 that's how y'all meet
20:17 now do you know each other do you guys
20:18 know each you know and if you don't know
20:20 each other then okay well then you're
20:22 sitting way off in the corner on a table
20:23 the three of you are friends you sit
20:25 there and he'll figure out a way or
20:27 she'll figure out a way to get you guys
20:29 to have the conversation usually it's a
20:32 catalyzing event in the room that you
20:34 all have to deal with and when it's over
20:36 you've met each other because you
20:37 conquered some drunk or something or
20:39 something happens outside now what's
20:42 interesting about role-playing is that
20:44 honestly
20:45 nothing's planned and that might sound
20:48 hard to believe but nothing is planned
20:52 the only preparation that has occurred
20:54 again is the map all of its terrain and
20:57 where all the monsters are but you don't
21:00 know that's behind a trifold piece of
21:03 cardboard that the dungeon master has
21:06 and you see this and stranger things all
21:08 the Dungeon Master's roles are behind
21:11 the cardboard you don't get to see
21:13 because he or she will make the decision
21:16 as to whether or not they actually
21:17 acknowledge the role sometimes they'll
21:20 like okay I want to let's just see
21:22 and no throw maybe they throw like a
21:24 twenty and a twenty is a role that will
21:29 chop someone in half because your world
21:32 so good on your hit but you either you
21:34 hit and then you'll roll for damage and
21:36 you roll another dice for damage and
21:39 they'll tell you that 12 sided die is
21:42 this for this particular monster with
21:44 that particular weapon you get a bigger
21:47 weapon they'll tell you to roll more day
21:48 to figure out what the damage is
21:53 it's very simple to read it to get into
21:57 it and then you're off to the races
22:00 the very first D&D game I ever played
22:02 that was truly players not that little
22:07 thing when I was a kid I was probably
22:09 bout 24 years old and we rolled our
22:12 characters for about an hour and you
22:16 have statistics that go with your
22:17 character your strength your agility
22:19 your wisdom all that good stuff and your
22:22 to roll dice now there's some some folks
22:26 are very strict about that our guys were
22:29 not but we what happens is if you're
22:32 allowed to roll a lot several times to
22:34 get the statistics where you want them
22:36 which is just you know it's almost a
22:38 silly experience of just continuing to
22:40 roll continuing to roll that everyone's
22:43 doing it and everyone has an amazing
22:45 character so everything's love will play
22:47 playing field but some people run the
22:49 game very strictly and you roll in front
22:51 of everybody
22:51 if you get a bum roll maybe they'll let
22:54 you do one statistic over you should
22:56 roll a one on your wisdom and your gray
22:59 elf that'd be bad but the DM is cool the
23:02 deme usually will say okay well I'm
23:03 gonna just say that your wisdom is this
23:05 because you're that race and it can't be
23:08 any lower than it so it might roll roll
23:10 the triangle you know the pyramid die to
23:12 see if you can bonus it up because it
23:15 only has one two three four you're a
23:18 little bump right but we were in a
23:20 saloon and the crazy thing is is that
23:24 you then have a difference you see the
23:27 different styles of DMS now some diems
23:30 don't attempt to act the other
23:33 characters now by that I mean not not a
23:37 monster that doesn't speak in the first
23:40 place what are you gonna do it's just a
23:42 dragon coming at you if a dragons
23:43 dragons are very special I might talk
23:45 about them because this this dragons and
23:48 demons are way more powerful than most
23:50 folks are taught by Hollywood like for
23:56 instance there's a Marvel role-playing
23:58 system where there's the Hulk and the
24:00 Hulk in the role-playing systems is
24:04 essentially a god on earth I mean you
24:06 really can't kill the guy he's almost
24:09 got infinite power but every time they
24:11 made a movie prior to the latest
24:13 rendition of the Hulk it never was
24:16 portrayed he was never portrayed as
24:18 being truly as powerful as he was but
24:21 the recent movies have him exactly where
24:24 he is in the role-playing systems which
24:26 is very intense
24:28 so I'm I'll just go down the line here a
24:30 dragon if you can put this into and this
24:34 is my guy he's telling me this
24:36 information so if this is incorrect
24:39 I can blame second edition guys but they
24:44 told me that you know a dragon is so
24:45 massive if it's fully grown that it it
24:49 would dwarf Godzilla but you almost
24:51 never see a fully grown dragon because
24:54 they know their targets as soon as they
24:56 come out but fully grown dragons are
24:58 also extremely intellectual and can
25:00 speak to you there's been a few movies
25:03 that kind of one gets the size right but
25:05 not the brains right and the other one
25:07 gets the brains right but not the size
25:09 right and I believe I have this correct
25:13 you know shame on me if I get this wrong
25:16 I believe all of the colored dragons the
25:19 prime color dragons red black green
25:21 they're all bad dragons but the Dragons
25:24 that are color of elements gold silver
25:27 those are the dragons that are your good
25:29 dragons they'll always help you we only
25:33 bumped into a dragon one time and it was
25:35 a baby dragon very specifically because
25:40 if it were a big one it would be some
25:43 epic moment in history that would be
25:44 above ground and our DM actually had a
25:49 role-playing system where there was a
25:51 little bit of a chance in his realm so
25:54 you're in this realm you're not supposed
25:55 to be in it's almost like you know fools
25:59 walk away or angels fear to tread right
26:01 we were in this area and he's willing to
26:04 die to see which one of the beings in
26:07 this area would pop up and that's not
26:09 necessarily in the system but that's
26:11 just what he did and we all watched him
26:14 roll once and whatever it was it must
26:16 have been like a maybe a 12-sided die or
26:18 something he wrote he rolled probably
26:21 something like a 12 and then looked up
26:23 at us like oh and it was a dragon and so
26:27 in his wisdom he pulled back on how big
26:31 it was its intent he let it be a good
26:34 dragon not a bad dragon and then we were
26:37 able to you know step away oh my god
26:40 sort of experience right but now he
26:45 starts us off in this saloon he plays
26:46 this leprechaun bartender and I can't do
26:51 a leprechaun voice
26:53 my soul but he jumps into this
26:55 leprechaun thing and it was insane it
26:57 was like instantaneously were all just
26:59 teleported into this room we can smell
27:02 the room we can feel the Warren
27:04 patina'd you know picnic table wood
27:08 thing that we're sitting at you know we
27:10 can smell the beer and it what's
27:13 happening in the real world is that
27:15 we've gotten together at my friend's
27:16 house big table we had a craps table and
27:20 then we had this table and we order
27:24 pizzas typically and then my buddy was
27:27 brilliant enough to put on the Conan
27:30 soundtrack from the first film he'd have
27:33 other movies similar to that so he just
27:35 keep cueing it up you know had will to
27:38 work up and out we probably would've
27:39 played that music but just that little
27:42 environmental tick to have the input
27:45 while we're playing sometimes as this
27:48 you know CD is looping we're literally
27:51 at a point where we might go to battle
27:53 and then the album hits a battle track
27:56 and instantaneously without anyone
27:59 looking at each other oh my god the
28:01 battle tracks on let's have a battle
28:02 it just it bleeds into you and you're
28:05 living this other universe in the living
28:07 room we would get together probably
28:10 about 5:30 6:00 in the evening if it
28:14 wasn't a weekend and we played a 1 or 2
28:16 at night and not notice by the time we
28:20 wake up and somebody goes what time is
28:22 it and everyone's going oh my god I
28:25 gotta get home so what I think is
28:28 ironically funny about this whole thing
28:30 is that why do we watch movies why do we
28:33 watch TV why do we binge watch things
28:35 it's to escape but what's more intense
28:39 and more entertaining watching someone
28:42 else's story that you might like you
28:45 might not like or being a part of the
28:47 story
28:48 it's like Game of Thrones but just pick
28:51 your character men except you better mix
28:54 up the races a lot and it's like at the
28:56 end of the night you say I did that my
28:58 friends did this and we live this
29:00 journey and then you just put the whole
29:02 thing on pause the DM is making notes
29:05 about where everyone is
29:07 at the end of the night you get
29:10 experience points now there's two ways
29:15 that this usually works this is sort of
29:17 a technicality you may not be interested
29:18 in but it takes a fair amount of points
29:21 to level and you don't get that much at
29:24 the end of every night because the game
29:26 was designed to be played over years
29:28 with a single story so you just keep
29:31 playing and playing and playing what was
29:34 funny is a lot of the server names on
29:36 the internet and just video game handle
29:40 names were all people's D&D character
29:44 names was absolutely hysterical there's
29:47 entire companies that we bought out at
29:49 EA where we're like wow that's a really
29:51 weird name for a company and the guy
29:53 would just say yeah that was my my
29:55 Dungeons & Dragons character when I was
29:56 a kid I've played the character for
29:58 thirty years and there's some massive
30:01 level and you know a massive level might
30:03 be thirteen cuz it takes a long time to
30:07 get your experience points and it
30:08 doubles and doubles and doubles not
30:11 quite doubles but it's almost a doubling
30:14 to get to the next level so you have
30:17 this heritage with your character you
30:18 can have all kinds of character sheets
30:21 technically speaking you could play
30:23 multiple characters if you need to
30:25 someone doesn't show up well someone
30:28 else plays your character and they don't
30:30 get any points so now they're starting
30:32 to fall behind let me give you some
30:35 dynamics I'll give you some sort of the
30:38 highlights of what I remember about the
30:40 first six months planning when we played
30:43 about three times a week because we had
30:46 to play this game was so amazing I
30:49 played a wood elf my best buddy played a
30:51 grey elf someone else played a thief I
30:55 think one place one person played a
30:58 human guy and played a human girl but it
31:00 might've been like a halfling girl
31:01 halflings are when human beings mate
31:05 with other races like Dwarfs and so you
31:09 kind of a shorter kind of mid mid height
31:13 person but we came up with our whole
31:17 backstory that I was a wood elf
31:20 not gonna go too deep in this so don't
31:21 worry but I was what else on in you know
31:25 my whole clan was in this forest but the
31:27 forest was backed up against the this
31:29 beautiful city and so my buddy was a
31:32 grill and as he would come out and
31:34 practice his magic I'm in there watching
31:36 him from the woods you know we're
31:38 friends we're not I mean we're not
31:39 enemies in terms of our race but over
31:42 time we met each other and that's how we
31:44 got together so it's a real illogical
31:46 pairing between the two they have we
31:49 shouldn't have anything intellectually
31:50 in common but what we realized was we
31:54 protect each other's yin and yang right
31:55 I'm the physical guy he's the mental guy
31:58 he's range I'm right in your face I used
32:02 to have drawings and my characters shame
32:04 I don't probably in my garage somewhere
32:06 but we play this thing we meet these
32:09 other people one of the dynamics that I
32:12 think is interesting is that because my
32:14 friend played a thief it was the first
32:17 time that they my first day together we
32:19 had a camp we encamped because we went
32:22 outside and we're fighting weird things
32:24 like big giant slugs and and stuff in
32:26 the forests just kind of warming me up
32:28 to the whole game and we're all kind of
32:30 getting to know each other and just kind
32:31 of getting the feel of the game and then
32:35 we encamped and I was like okay yeah you
32:36 know I just I guess I'll take first
32:38 watch or something like that but then
32:39 they told me you don't know this yet cuz
32:42 you're not a you know experienced player
32:44 but you got a thief and you can't but
32:47 even though he says he's on your side
32:48 you gotta know this guy stealing
32:50 constantly so you better keep a you know
32:52 an eye on him no honor among thieves
32:56 right so I've shared several experiences
33:01 from this particular campaign or at
33:03 least one where it really was an amazing
33:06 thing I guess I'll do a really
33:08 abbreviated version so I won't bore the
33:10 the routine listeners but there was two
33:15 two instances in six months where I
33:17 picked up the 20-sided die and because
33:19 of the circumstances of the story I
33:22 experienced of the bending of the spoon
33:26 if you will for matrix I was
33:29 encapsulated in a sphere of glass
33:33 I'm being very literal I am shaking this
33:36 dying and I'm so angry at the situation
33:39 in the game that I need to kill this
33:41 character I'm shaking this thing and
33:43 there's this bubble that comes around me
33:45 and it was like Tesla's whole thing
33:48 where he was looking through some
33:49 membrane at his assistant that was gonna
33:51 disconnect the switch and he said time
33:54 compressed and time was strange this is
33:56 what happened to me and I'm telling my
33:59 friends I'm gonna roll a 20 and it's not
34:02 come on Yahtzee I hope I roll five of
34:05 the same you know six-sided die but just
34:07 this is going to occur and the universe
34:10 is going yes you are total control
34:13 because of your will has reached this
34:16 maximum peak inside your consciousness
34:19 your soul and it's gonna happen and both
34:21 times I said it I roll 20s my mind is
34:25 completely blown not just because I
34:27 rolled 220 but because of the the
34:30 experience around me physically it so
34:34 blew my mind I mean I'm a scientific guy
34:37 this is not normal right I'm so blown
34:41 away it's all my friends immediately
34:43 like we're in the middle of the story
34:44 and I go dude I just I just forced the
34:47 22 happen yeah my buddies look at me and
34:50 they go yeah you can do that now let's
34:52 play or that happens every once in a
34:54 while let's play later on I asked him I
34:58 said no okay wait a minute let's back up
34:59 here I had the 20 experience the whole
35:01 universe just collapsed me and gave me
35:04 that 20 what's going on he said well it
35:07 just gets good that sometimes and you
35:09 can totally control the die they're
35:12 overlooking like a miracle of
35:15 consciousness and you know quite frankly
35:19 if we had the deep thoughts we do
35:20 University we would definitely have to
35:23 have game rooms playing 24/7 you know
35:26 students professors all getting together
35:29 and the rooms got to be videotaped in HD
35:32 every freakin angle all of our faces all
35:35 the top down because at some point this
35:37 is gonna happen and it's gonna happen on
35:39 camera and the world's gonna go holy
35:41 [ __ ] and I want to I want to see you
35:46 know
35:47 got your counters I want to see heat
35:49 levels in our bodies I want to see
35:51 absolutely everything to see if that
35:52 sphere is actually visible in some
35:54 machine because it is a phenomenal
35:56 experience as I said it happened twice I
35:59 suddenly remembered after I was
36:01 recording his episodes that I could only
36:03 remember the reason why it happened the
36:04 first time
36:06 there's the finale of the of this was
36:09 actually a phenomenal rolling experience
36:11 as well to be honest maybe that's where
36:12 the second one was anyway real quick
36:15 recap of the story we managed to go
36:18 underground into a cave which was very
36:21 deep and long and you know it was like
36:24 it was lit by the moss on the ceiling so
36:27 we didn't have Sun but we were lit by
36:28 this kind of Tron moss right and it's
36:33 just a narrow stream and there seems to
36:36 be like caves dug out on both sides
36:38 where they have like you know cities
36:40 little cities dug in there like these
36:41 little villages in there and we came
36:43 across this one where it was a saloon
36:44 and it was elven we could tell but
36:48 everyone's dead
36:50 and so we're walking around it's just
36:52 like normal carnage which is unfortunate
36:54 right but we walk into this tavern and
36:58 behind the bar is a wood elf girl and I
37:03 have never seen a wood elf since I left
37:05 my home for a straight it's been a long
37:08 time playing this game months and she's
37:11 been raped and she has been what do they
37:15 call it
37:16 defiled right horrible won't describe it
37:23 but it made my character and me furious
37:29 and I'm not like angry in the room or
37:31 anything but it was like you know I had
37:33 I know how to act so it was sort of like
37:35 when I talked and when I behaved it was
37:37 in me hardcore and my buddy knew he was
37:40 just pulling all my strings and pushing
37:41 all my buttons and so now the the the
37:45 whole room has gone really somber and
37:47 really strange and really intense
37:49 because now we're gonna sail down the
37:51 river and we're pretty sure we're gonna
37:53 find who did it
37:54 and sure enough cuz the DM was to see
37:57 some pretty funny stuff happened
38:00 we're sailing up the river look over and
38:04 here's all these works and obviously you
38:08 know evidence left behind very orc like
38:10 stuff going on you know the the blades
38:13 use roll or you know swords and
38:16 what-have-you but anyway we look up and
38:18 the way that the orcs were portrayed to
38:21 us in the game was that if the leader
38:22 dies they all run because they just
38:25 don't have a command structure that
38:26 works to replace the leader sure enough
38:29 there's this really tall thin throne
38:31 made a wood some crappy metal to hold it
38:34 all together and there's his dude
38:36 sitting on the throne eating and
38:39 drinking and his you know whose men are
38:41 all over the places other or guys are
38:43 all over the place and so I act my
38:48 character out I'm kind of not that you
38:50 know intellectually brilliant I'm not a
38:53 I'm not a strategist with war and so I
38:57 just hop out of the boat and I tell the
38:59 DM I'm like I'm gonna run right at him
39:03 okay he rolls to see if anybody can get
39:07 in my way before I get to him he fails
39:09 his role years ago well he get it right
39:12 up to him what do you do
39:13 I say take my sword and I try to kill
39:18 him with it he's okay and this one I
39:22 picked up the 20-sided die and I hate
39:24 this character this fictional character
39:26 in this game so much that I just bent
39:31 the universe around the spoon as they
39:33 said matrix and I have said I'm rolling
39:35 this is gonna be a 20 it was like no
39:37 doubt on my soul this was gonna be a 20
39:40 it's just gonna it is an imperative
39:42 situation as if if I was really there
39:44 nothing could stop me so our role as die
39:46 sure enough 20 and he's like oh my god
39:49 it was roll for damage pal huge damage
39:52 on this guy got 93 is like a 97% or some
39:56 crazy high number he goes oh you just
39:58 talked him in half and then we just mode
40:01 up everybody else and we have sort of
40:03 retribution for this poor girl on her
40:05 village and all these other things there
40:07 were no other what else back there by
40:08 the way
40:09 so that was one epic experience so fast
40:13 forward to the end of this campaign
40:14 complained it for six months plus I
40:17 think if it's not six it's longer and
40:20 somehow we were traveling around and we
40:25 came across this pyramid of bones like a
40:28 big sorry I should say like a pile of
40:31 bones really tall and sitting on top of
40:33 that like the thinking man thing is a
40:36 big drag our big demon
40:38 well demons aren't necessarily kept the
40:41 size problem that the Dragons have but
40:45 demons are like with their real demons
40:47 they're super duper uber powerful so he
40:51 immediately behind the scenes you didn't
40:53 tell us he pulled the demons power set
40:56 down to one third after I said I'm gonna
41:00 go up and kill him and I forgot what
41:03 premeditated my belief that that should
41:05 be a good idea cuz he warned us he
41:08 totally weren't even my buddy
41:09 next to me is like you know we don't
41:11 mess with those things you know they'll
41:13 they'll take us out but there was
41:14 something about it so he he says okay
41:20 you're coming at him do you look at him
41:23 I said yeah I'll look at him he says do
41:26 a saving throw to see if your mind
41:28 control really go she boom I roll with
41:32 in the 90s no you're fine he breathed
41:35 the tunnel fire on you world to see if
41:37 you take fire damage boom in the 90s now
41:41 the Dean was like whoa that's usually
41:44 not possible he's trying to hurt me
41:46 before I get killed I run up the pile I
41:49 pull back my sword and I hit him I roll
41:53 really high for the hit really really
41:55 high for the damage but now there's a
41:57 saving throw on top of that to see if I
42:00 can counteract some spell he was casting
42:03 or something like that something he
42:05 didn't tell us would be the case and for
42:07 some reason there was like one of the
42:09 guys was mad in the room who was his
42:11 best friend and said you're supposed to
42:13 tell us that kind of stuff he's like I
42:14 don't have to tell you that kind of
42:15 thing anyway we fight this demon I don't
42:17 know for like two hours and it's all
42:21 becoming really strategic my brain
42:22 is casting every spell he saved up and
42:26 it's he's got a sword that is about 20
42:30 feet long and he's slicing and dicing
42:34 he's trying to hit us
42:35 I'm saving but it's gonna it's gonna run
42:38 out as long as I stay on the pile I'm
42:39 gonna get cut right and bad and so one
42:46 of our guys grabs the diem this is what
42:48 school walks in my other room so it's
42:50 gonna talk to you for a second okay go
42:52 outside the room or he goes outside the
42:54 room with the DM they talk for like ten
42:56 minutes fifteen minutes and he comes
42:58 back in and he goes okay here's what's
43:02 gonna happen
43:03 so and so here who's been playing with
43:05 this for six months is going to
43:07 sacrifice his soul into a staff and then
43:12 someone's over here was gonna carry it
43:15 up there and try to hit him with it and
43:16 it's gonna kill him if it hits him no
43:19 saving throw and so I honestly cannot
43:25 remember if we killed the damn thing my
43:29 friend is so when you when you read
43:31 spells you have a bunch of them
43:32 memorized and saved up but once you burn
43:35 through all of what you have saved up
43:36 you have one option you open the book
43:38 and you burn it off the page and you you
43:42 get one last shot but now it's out of
43:44 your school book and you're gonna have
43:45 to go back to a library and study to
43:48 write it back into a brand new book so
43:50 to burn a smell out of a book is a no-no
43:52 no one ever does it but my buddy bill
43:55 was like just burning every spell out of
43:57 his spell book it was I mean this in a
43:59 movie would just be [ __ ] phenomenal
44:01 rate there's your f-bomb for this
44:03 episode but I get cut in half I am dead
44:08 and nothing is going to resurrect me the
44:13 guy who sacrificed himself to the staff
44:15 he's dead and so again I can't remember
44:21 I think the demon died but it was just
44:24 the DM just allowing us to have a bunch
44:26 of stuff trying to not kill us all and
44:29 what it was all over the room was just
44:31 dead silent and we all felt like someone
44:35 had died in the family
44:36 because two of us were dead at least and
44:41 that's how powerful this can be role
44:44 playing you're you're vested man you're
44:48 vested in these characters if you
44:49 thought it was bad when miss pac-man
44:51 died back in the day you know felt this
44:54 before because every single video games
44:58 got a rebirth experience usually you can
45:00 if nothing else you put a new coin in
45:02 and the characters are reborn not in
45:04 this game not if he's even remotely
45:06 played like the rules now what it was
45:08 all over now when it was all over the DM
45:11 was telling us all of the regulator's he
45:14 put on this demon to keep it from just
45:16 absolutely wiping us out in this you
45:18 know instantaneously
45:19 I guess he put this thing in there to
45:24 make us walk around but unbeknownst to
45:27 him because nothing can be planned cuz
45:29 we're making decisions he's setting up
45:31 the world making the decisions when we
45:34 said we were gonna kill this thing he
45:38 had to go with it and so it's like a
45:40 choose your own adventure if you've
45:41 never played so we were kind of like
45:45 done and we're you know it's it's all
45:48 these things of you're kind of mad and
45:50 you're kind of you kind of mad the DM
45:52 but then again when you grow up and
45:55 really think about your like which takes
45:57 a couple days there's usually a couple
45:59 days between your place there's no
46:01 matter what you know there's this delay
46:03 people start coming up with excuses why
46:07 all the sudden they can't make it to the
46:09 the role-playing night so the guy in the
46:14 girl the senior producer in the his
46:17 girlfriend I think it was they peeled
46:20 off forever and never came back
46:22 now we work with the guy but I never saw
46:24 the girl again ever which is weird six
46:27 months together and then all sudden they
46:30 get on a boat and they leave you know
46:31 sort of we talked about it for a couple
46:34 years that last scene was phenomenal but
46:39 then we had a short stint with shadow
46:41 run now a lot of you know shadow run
46:44 really well because your role played it
46:46 a lot of you know shadow run because
46:48 it's a gaming system
46:49 it's made by a company I believe the
46:52 name originally was fossa FASA but they
46:56 got bought out by Microsoft Wizards of
47:00 the coast who made the the card game
47:04 they bought D&D which is just just
47:08 unbelievable Wizards of the coast buying
47:13 the D&D license would be tantamount to
47:17 you and I getting together making a
47:19 mobile app and then buying Microsoft
47:23 later on you know some tiny little app
47:25 gets so popular but we got billions in
47:27 the bank and we just buy this other
47:28 company now of course the franchise was
47:30 about 30 years old it wasn't exactly the
47:33 most expensive thing on earth but it was
47:34 an annuity you know when you buy an
47:36 annuity it's a very different experience
47:38 than just buying something like when you
47:42 buy a car just has value right that's it
47:45 but if you own oil wells that make a
47:47 certain amount of money every year and
47:49 someone wants to buy them off of you you
47:51 need to amateur eyes up what would you
47:53 have made in 10 years 20 years and then
47:56 charge them for the whole thing
47:57 you're gonna have to have you know let
47:59 them have some profit they're gonna take
48:01 the risk not you you need the money and
48:03 then you know that's what it is so it's
48:06 interesting how these acquisitions
48:06 happen but now Shadowrun is very special
48:12 it is something that I've never seen
48:15 properly put into a movie shatter one is
48:20 sort of near future it's actually got a
48:23 fair amount of like sort of some
48:26 agenda21 stuff but it's got it for a
48:28 different reason than globalists doing
48:30 this where they move us out of the rural
48:32 areas write the backstory with shadow
48:35 room is that the Native Americans of
48:39 North America rediscover magic and when
48:43 they do they take back almost all their
48:46 land in North America and push us all
48:49 into the cities and the cities turn into
48:51 Bladerunner cities
48:52 let me just identical to Blade Runner
48:54 series the first edition of Shadowrun
48:59 was purely human which is humans
49:02 though dice that you roll were six-sided
49:05 die that you just have with any you know
49:07 game that you ever get like monopoly or
49:09 something
49:10 except you buy bricks of them hundreds
49:14 of them and they're slightly smaller so
49:16 that they fit and these bricks based on
49:19 what you're doing you could roll you
49:22 know a handful of them one or every
49:27 single person's die in the room which
49:28 I'm gonna give you a little experience I
49:30 gave in several episodes back but now we
49:34 switch from one of my buddies to the
49:37 other guy that was working Electronic
49:41 Arts but he wasn't a producer for our
49:43 game designer again even though he would
49:47 be a great game designer this guy
49:50 devoured every video game at a level
49:52 that I've never seen anyone ever devour
49:55 game whenever quest came out this guy
49:58 played I don't know
50:00 13 to 18 hours a day until he had the
50:03 whole game played and it would be like
50:06 someone getting you know World of
50:08 Warcraft and getting every single piece
50:10 of armor and every single weapon they
50:13 could possibly be gather that's this
50:15 kind of guy now he's the Jian because
50:19 that's what you call him but now
50:21 Shadowrun is again near future even
50:25 though the Native Americans are doing
50:26 their thing they're not really in the
50:29 game unless they're in the city but this
50:32 world is a world where you're
50:34 essentially stealing and selling
50:36 information is usually the main thing so
50:39 you're always hacking computers because
50:42 things weren't in the 21st century the
50:44 way that the anatomy worked this game
50:46 was invented in the 80s and it's it's
50:48 the old first edition books are probably
50:53 where the gold at this point I loaned
50:55 them to a friend and never gonna back it
50:57 they would write a book for every region
51:01 of the world and it was written by
51:03 people in those regions example there's
51:07 a New York book there's an LA book
51:08 there's a Dallas book there's an Ireland
51:11 book a Scotland book a London book an
51:14 England book a France
51:15 a German book these books look like
51:18 books that came from the future when you
51:21 look through them they're not only
51:23 sneaking into the book characters and
51:27 their you know their statistical
51:28 breakdowns in case you want to use them
51:30 in your game which you never do usually
51:31 but it's like it's like a book
51:34 I can entertainment book from the future
51:36 so it's kind of fake ads in it and stuff
51:38 and they're about half an inch thick and
51:40 they're by you know good 10 by 11 sort
51:42 of kind of big book so if you ever want
51:45 to see some really cool stuff go look
51:47 those up if you're walking to it like a
51:48 D&D store I found one in Sydney
51:51 Australia and walked in and could not
51:54 believe my eyes the this D&D swell sorry
51:56 this role-playing store was just
51:58 phenomenal but there's usually a
52:00 role-playing source somewhere in your
52:01 neighborhood just look up hobby shop or
52:03 whatever but you have the your
52:07 characters have this anatomy of first
52:11 you have hard drives embedded inside
52:12 your body you have usually a port like a
52:16 half inch port quarter inch port
52:17 actually quarter inch port in the side
52:20 of your head or in the back of your head
52:21 kind of like got like neo and matrix but
52:25 usually it's in your temple you carry
52:27 with you what's called your deck and it
52:29 looks like a looks like a Commodore 64
52:31 but it's like a really high-end keyboard
52:34 with a CPU in it so you carry it around
52:36 like your like your quiver and your bow
52:39 and if you want to steal stuff you just
52:42 pull your deck out you plug it into your
52:45 head and you plug this other cable like
52:47 r2d2 into the wall into the computer or
52:50 supercomputer whatever terminal there's
52:52 like these ATMs outside that you can
52:54 plug into and what they call Jack into
52:56 the computer so you have outside mission
53:01 gathering role-playing going on then you
53:04 have in the computer hacking going on in
53:07 addition to all that your character
53:11 system your character can basically swap
53:15 part of your body parts for electronic
53:18 transplants you get something called I
53:21 believe was called lightning reflexes
53:24 they replace your entire nervous system
53:26 with synthetic
53:29 wires fiber optics and so when your
53:32 brain says draw the weapon and shoot
53:34 that guy in the face it happens at a
53:36 quantum level right just BAM it's just
53:39 really fast right so that's cool and
53:42 that's fun and there's a bunch of these
53:44 things but you have a limit because in
53:46 the game you have something called your
53:47 essence and there's an essence threshold
53:50 where you're not allowed to swap any
53:52 more stuff so if you get your lightning
53:54 reflexes it takes a huge chunk of your
53:56 essence and so it's sort of like your
53:59 speeding ticket point system where you
54:00 get a lot of speeding tickets you know
54:02 you can't drive anymore you get your
54:03 license suspended forever in there for a
54:06 year or whatever it is right but what we
54:09 found was this we started playing the
54:11 game I can't even really remember the
54:14 story that we were doing but we found
54:16 out very quickly that when someone
54:18 hacked into the computer and the
54:20 computer hacking is brilliant okay and
54:23 it's sort of what's probably gonna come
54:25 at some point but the the compute the
54:29 whole role-playing game slows down
54:30 because now you just have the GM and the
54:33 person hacking the computer and
54:36 everyone's watching and watching and it
54:38 goes forever so no one else is playing
54:40 and so there was a flaw in the game but
54:44 the cool thing they did and we're
54:46 talking really because this is the 80s
54:48 great
54:49 the virus is well put in so as you're
54:52 hacking in the system there's all these
54:54 programs that are trying to stop you
54:56 from program from hacking in and the
55:00 only one I can remember off the top of
55:01 my head was black tar black tar would
55:04 come after you and when it's coming
55:05 after you you better turn around go the
55:07 other way or you better have a really
55:08 good counter program to block black tar
55:11 because you're jacked into the system
55:13 and this this jack is going straight in
55:15 the side of your head it actually
55:17 physically attacks you in the real world
55:19 and the way this typically works is that
55:22 the way they intended the game to play
55:24 was that as you're jacked in and you're
55:26 hacking the computer your buddies are
55:28 outside protecting your body because
55:31 you're kind of like you know you're in
55:32 the system and so if the GM smart he'll
55:35 throw a little battle outside and then
55:37 turn around and talk to the computer guy
55:39 it doesn't work though we couldn't get
55:41 it to work to be real
55:42 balanced so he played there for a little
55:45 while in stopped the Shadowrun it just
55:50 as an entity is super sexy and super
55:52 amazing a lot of the games that you can
55:54 get now and steam for shudder when I
55:56 I find them extremely boring and slow
55:59 beautiful well-designed if I put more
56:01 effort in it and it was probably younger
56:03 to have that kind of time to get into
56:05 although it's a super intellectual game
56:07 I might have a different opinion about
56:09 it so I don't mean to knock the games by
56:12 the third generation of the game they
56:14 started bringing D&D into the game and
56:17 it got silly for me where you had orcs
56:19 and dwarves basically
56:21 Oh suddenly Native Americans to
56:23 rediscover magic and all said
56:24 middle-earth just pops up in the game so
56:27 that for me became silly and extra
56:30 didn't want to play alright we're gonna
56:33 finish this whole exercise with
56:36 champions talked about champions several
56:39 times it's a very similar system with
56:43 six sided die champions is a beautiful
56:46 system because it's completely generic
56:47 you can do anything that you want it was
56:51 invented by a guy named George MacDonald
56:53 he was still alive and well George was a
56:55 big employee of alkylate games which was
56:58 right off the the 405 in the Bay Area in
57:02 Sunnyvale Saratoga you could see there
57:05 building off the side of the highway
57:06 George actually came and played with us
57:08 one day man
57:10 he's still a friend of mine on the
57:12 Facebook it's really cool he actually
57:14 got busted too because the champions
57:16 book the original champions book had a
57:17 marvel I think it's Thor on the front
57:20 finding someone else I can't remember
57:21 it's like amber who it was but they
57:23 didn't have permission to use Thor on
57:25 the front so Marvel tapped them for that
57:28 cover but the company was dignified
57:31 because the artist sold it as if he had
57:33 the rights to sell it and so the artist
57:35 got popped not the company when they
57:37 changed the cover I think I never never
57:38 seen another cover to the champions
57:41 role-playing system and it wasn't a
57:44 mind-blowing sketch it was pretty good
57:46 but anyway what the system does it's
57:49 it's different than the other ones which
57:50 is the only real major distinction is
57:52 that you have something called your
57:55 advantages and you
57:56 disadvantages as you're building your
57:57 character you roll for all your
58:00 statistics just like anything else but
58:02 let's say you wanted to fly they will
58:05 have four or five different levels of
58:07 flying same want to be invisible well
58:10 the first stage of invisibility is very
58:14 predator alike
58:15 you can still see someone at the highest
58:19 level you were invisible men but you got
58:22 a you got to buy that with you these
58:23 these points that you get very
58:25 advantages and what they call the
58:28 disadvantages have the short term of
58:30 DISA deco so this is utterly brilliant
58:36 what they did so let's say you want to
58:38 buy full invisibility because that's the
58:41 character that you've made this this
58:42 Marvel character you have invented with
58:44 the backstory of your own and I'll get
58:49 to one of my characters and again this
58:50 is gonna be repeat for those devout
58:52 listeners before every episode but I
58:55 think for a lot of you this will be new
58:56 and entertaining but if you wanted to
58:58 buy more advantages than you had money
59:01 for in the little economy they give you
59:03 to build your character you take a diss
59:05 sad to gain more economy let's say you
59:10 had a dollar and you bought invisibility
59:13 of a pretty good level but you wanted
59:15 the big one it's two dollars so you take
59:17 a dollar of disadvantages and you can
59:21 buy them right out of the book the book
59:22 tells you which you got a problem with
59:23 you know it's like it's like Kevin Hart
59:25 in Jumanji if he if he ate bread he
59:28 exploded just like this sad right and so
59:32 if he's willing to take that to the
59:34 point he can't ever eat bread or if
59:36 everyone sneaks the bread to him he dies
59:38 then he gets a bunch of extra money he
59:40 gets to spin so you take your
59:42 disadvantages and get your advantages
59:43 fully up I just thought that system was
59:45 beyond brilliant so George is a real
59:49 brilliant guy but we invent some
59:52 characters I honestly can't remember
59:55 shame on me but my other friends
59:57 characters were really all about one of
59:59 them was a tank obviously I was an
60:02 archaeologist and Egyptologist who was
60:04 studying the history of hieroglyphs and
60:08 I had three stones
60:09 had found in the iconology phase of
60:11 hieroglyphs so this is where symbols
60:14 word not a phonetic word not a phonetic
60:17 letter right but I couldn't quite figure
60:19 these stones out and they're all
60:21 different sizes like just stones kind of
60:24 Stonehenge stones a bit more sandstone
60:26 II but they have writing on them and
60:29 they have writing in them and I can see
60:30 that if I rub off if I write down the
60:32 layer that's on the outside then sand
60:34 down that layer there's a whole nother
60:36 message on the inside so I'm from New
60:39 York I'm a prodigy kid I take it I'm
60:42 like a you know star kind of
60:43 archaeologist I take the three stones to
60:45 New York and I put them in my laboratory
60:47 this is gonna be a great movie one day
60:50 well one day accidentally I write I run
60:54 out of paper and so I write one of the
60:55 symbols on my hand and later I rubbed it
60:59 and when I rubbed it it activated and I
61:02 realized that if I find out what the
61:07 passage is do I can construct a whole
61:10 nother me and so I had managed to create
61:13 a nubes and so what happened was as I
61:16 rubbed my hand it makes a staff of my in
61:19 and the staff has all the messages on
61:20 them I just rub the staff and it creates
61:23 certain powerful things that happen and
61:25 one of them is that I sheet change into
61:27 Anubis take you over the river Styx
61:30 right well my geom is so brilliant he
61:36 said you know do you work on the stones
61:38 tonight and I said yeah I work up a
61:40 little bit he goes okay will you see
61:41 like a really deep symbol really dark
61:44 and really thick on the bottom right
61:46 side of your biggest stone was like okay
61:49 I look at it what do I see he says well
61:53 the more you try to look at it the more
61:55 you start to lose your consciousness
61:59 okay so we find out that this symbol
62:04 that's stuck inside my stone is a symbol
62:07 that is of Cthulhu level undead stabby
62:12 is like it destroys it's like the black
62:13 ball and fifth element right he wants to
62:16 undo the whole universe right so it's a
62:18 very deadly symbol that has been put
62:20 deep inside this stone
62:22 not really supposed to be found by
62:24 anyone but I eventually learn the shape
62:28 of it through experimentation a lot of
62:31 bad things happen to me as I'm trying to
62:34 figure this thing out research it's
62:35 almost like the sick of fant thing I've
62:37 got for figuring out this Sybil so I can
62:40 protect it and get rid of it but one
62:43 night we're messing around we're sort of
62:45 in Hell's Kitchen
62:46 because I'm a New Yorker so I'm in
62:48 Brooklyn Marvel Hell's Kitchen perfect
62:52 great but we're messing around and I
62:58 actually went into the subway at one
63:00 point and there was an interesting
63:02 little twist that I said I want to
63:03 practice my skills so I'm gonna find a
63:05 bunch of murderers and rapists I'm just
63:07 gonna kill him and they kinda liked it
63:09 be like okay you do that it was not
63:12 really what Marvel characters doing it's
63:14 okay I'm a little dark you know so I was
63:17 already kind of on the [ __ ] list with
63:20 the other guys for being a secretly dark
63:23 now they have to roleplay like they
63:25 don't know that's the fun part this like
63:27 it's so cool man so anyway there is this
63:31 woman that shows up and she is like a
63:35 blond haired fully developed
63:37 twenty-something late twenty-something
63:40 kind of powerhouse right like the
63:43 chicken man DeLorean and she flies like
63:45 Superman but she's she's really
63:47 clean-cut looking and she is after me
63:51 she is flying at me at you know
63:56 breakneck speed she punches me through
63:59 hits me so hard and one of her blows
64:01 that it sends me through a couple
64:03 skyscrapers because I'm switched into my
64:06 my stone shape so I'm not gonna have any
64:09 problems reviving that kind of Thor but
64:13 she won't let up and I'm trying to
64:14 communicate her I'm trying to like say
64:15 stop you know talk to me who the hell
64:17 are you you come out of thin air were
64:19 the good guys in town which what's the
64:20 deal but she's not hurting any of my
64:22 friends she's after me so the GM won't
64:26 let up and there's no way I could
64:28 communicate with this woman so I'm kinda
64:29 like well I can't really fight her cuz
64:31 she seems to be way stronger than me
64:34 and so I'm pinched I'm in the corner so
64:39 this is my creativity comes around she
64:42 lines up for another strike and she's I
64:44 could just see her she's just breaking
64:46 the sound barrier coming at me and I
64:49 said I can shape change right of course
64:53 is there any size limitation he says
64:59 well generally it's you know your body
65:01 mass that makes the character can't
65:03 really get any smaller than your Kenny
65:04 you can't be the size of a you know semi
65:07 all of a sudden I said okay I looked at
65:10 him and I said I changed into the symbol
65:13 right before she hits me and he's like
65:16 what he said I changed this symbol you
65:20 heard me things like oh my god he never
65:24 ever imagined that that would ever occur
65:30 he invented this thing gave it this
65:32 Cthulhu power which is again undoing
65:34 soon as Cthulhu exists like part of
65:36 universe disappears and there's nothing
65:38 in there not even me through a particle
65:40 so she's coming at me I shape change and
65:44 he looks at us now all of us have
65:45 probably about a hundred and fifty six
65:48 sided die apiece and we carry these bags
65:52 he's like cloth pouches that we carried
65:54 them in they come in these cool cubes
65:56 but you lose the cubes pretty fast
65:58 stacking them in the cubes is always
66:00 paying the button so he looks he takes
66:04 his tricorder thing of cardboard puts it
66:08 down and he says okay everybody give me
66:11 all your dye right what you use gives
66:14 you got a 50-piece right okay we're
66:16 gonna have a hundred fifty back when
66:17 it's all over because they're generally
66:18 the same color and we're like really and
66:22 he's like yeah and he gets his dice up
66:25 we make this ridiculous hammock out of
66:29 hundreds of dye and they okay and we had
66:34 we actually went to the craps table so
66:35 didn't lose him and he just goes boom
66:39 and he says okay
66:41 count all the top sides and so we're
66:43 counting for like 10 20 minutes I don't
66:46 even know how long it was
66:48 come up with this outrageous number and
66:51 he goes and the time they were kind of
66:53 go what's this for what's this number
66:54 gonna be he says I'm not telling you or
66:57 take something like ten more minutes to
66:58 do calculations man is that good this
67:00 was he said okay you have set off a one
67:06 Megaton bomb inside Hell's Kitchen
67:10 because you just killed a couple million
67:13 people and all of a sudden the game was
67:17 over but it was the most epic ending of
67:20 a game ever right in fact I think it
67:24 might have gone further cuz there was
67:25 another scene where he took us to the
67:27 Aztec pyramids and I resurrected all the
67:30 egyptians gods in the Aztec pyramid and
67:33 the whole thing was a setup from the
67:34 gods in the first place this whole thing
67:36 was supposed to happen the way it
67:37 happened and I got mind-controlled I
67:40 went in there as Anubis and just assured
67:43 them back over the River Styx if you
67:45 will back into our reality and all the
67:46 gods of Egypt came alive and took over
67:49 the world there's a movie like that out
67:52 there so those are my three distinct
67:55 experiences now I'm gonna give you a
67:58 generic one at the end which is again
68:00 more towards the purpose of this episode
68:02 which is how much frickin fun this is
68:04 right I became a GM using champion
68:09 systems and I took a screenplay that I
68:11 was working on and fleshed it out and it
68:16 lasted I think about I feel like it was
68:20 about six months probably wasn't quite
68:22 that long but it was almost that time
68:24 and I did the mistake and they just
68:27 taught me how to do this the the I
68:30 planned an encounter and they could
68:34 sense it and so I say with okay this
68:38 happens and they go oh we don't care we
68:40 go over here like what you gotta do this
68:43 you know and it's in a dome city too
68:46 which is sort of restrictive so I tried
68:51 to throw the thing at them and they knew
68:53 but anyway I developed all my characters
68:55 I developed my storyline and because I
68:57 had to do it on the fly constantly by
69:00 the time I got to designing
69:02 the script it was effortless man even
69:06 God said me to draw some artwork for it
69:08 which no one's ever seen I've been
69:11 trying to flush out that script last
69:13 year but it's it's it's a doozy man it's
69:16 super complex so I got hired to do a
69:20 different script and that would taint
69:22 for different reasons but maybe I'll get
69:27 that out the door but if you haven't
69:30 role played there's a whole world of fun
69:33 and the I got some more time on this
69:39 stick here and I really don't know if I
69:43 want to repeat myself I always feel
69:45 guilty repeating myself because I feel
69:47 like the listeners like I got again it's
69:49 the story I now tell people you know
69:52 like I've told a lot of you folks a long
69:54 time ago on episodes if you really want
69:56 to increase your vocabulary and your
69:58 communication skills and your expression
70:00 then you got to start writing either
70:02 which you might call lyrics or poems the
70:06 process is you're right crap I wrote at
70:09 least a hundred just Swilley little
70:12 things before I wrote the first thing
70:15 that I would show to any other human
70:16 being I've come back to those crappy
70:19 ones and yes they're just awful but I've
70:22 got poems that I am extremely proud of I
70:25 mean so it increases your ability to
70:28 pick words if you write words down well
70:31 then you learn the spelling which will
70:33 help you pronounce words properly a lot
70:35 of times people pronounce words
70:37 incorrectly because they don't know how
70:39 they're spelled and that was my problem
70:40 that I discovered when a friend of mine
70:41 said at work one day he goes you know we
70:45 know what you're saying but you use all
70:47 the wrong words and you misspell things
70:49 constantly and maybe you should learn
70:51 how to spell things before you and I'm
70:53 like no Chris you kind of being
70:54 confronted but the same time respected
70:56 this gonna go okay I'll literally make
70:59 sure everything's spelled properly still
71:01 took another 20 years to figure out you
71:04 know all the differences between words
71:05 and
71:08 rode a bike in a road that you drive on
71:11 then in van of the one to use well and
71:14 good you know all these little things
71:18 definitely does not have an A in it okay
71:21 but I had this experience because we I
71:24 lived in San Mateo California my buddies
71:27 lived in Redwood City and we worked
71:28 initially in San Mateo where ei was and
71:31 then ei bought some land which they
71:33 called Redwood Shores but we had this
71:36 hotel and you can look this up it was in
71:39 San Mateo right against the 92 freeway
71:41 is called the dumphy hotel and I don't
71:44 know who built this place in the first
71:45 place but whoever did lucked out because
71:49 he made this hotel was a two-story hotel
71:52 but it was like a giant like gum
71:55 fortress it was a big square at least it
71:59 looked like it was a big square from
72:00 every angle I ever saw it but he
72:03 veneered it with a castle with rook
72:05 towers and everything was brilliant so
72:09 guess what came once a year to the dumpy
72:12 hotel one of the biggest role-playing if
72:15 not the biggest role-playing
72:16 organization in the in the United States
72:20 of America and so this place filled up
72:24 once once a year with this and then
72:27 other things came to like comic-con
72:29 things sort of thing is not comic-con
72:31 but things like that would show up but
72:33 my friend knew this was coming he'd been
72:36 several times and I think I had gone one
72:39 time before this event actually occurred
72:42 that I'm about to tell you I think this
72:44 is utterly hilarious story and hopefully
72:47 you just enjoy hearing a second time
72:49 you've heard it once before my friend
72:52 knew the game was the submit' was coming
72:54 and so we used to play Magic the
72:58 Gathering the cards that Wizards of the
72:59 coast admitted and so my friend being a
73:02 genius game designer and who understood
73:04 every game down to its mechanisms he
73:07 said as a different guy than goin he
73:10 creates his own card game he was a huge
73:13 Magic the Gathering player and so he
73:15 learned he makes his own game all the
73:17 cards everything he makes it for weeks
73:20 and then finally he goes and gets him
73:22 professionally printed we're all sitting
73:24 around cutting these things out and he
73:28 wouldn't got a bunch of old Eve CDs and
73:31 cut them into like four pieces every DVD
73:34 or CD excuse me he got those foam boxes
73:37 that are little puzzle boxes you know
73:39 they only fit together one way he got
73:40 those a whole pack of them broke him all
73:42 part got a Polaroid camera with
73:46 Polaroids in him and he designs this
73:51 rope live action role-playing thing
73:54 called immortals and we're all kind of
73:57 on Bill what are you doing man he's like
73:58 what we're gonna go there and we're
74:00 gonna throw this bash we're gonna have a
74:02 vampire based role-playing system called
74:05 immortals I'm gonna use these cards
74:07 they're gonna be hidden all over the
74:09 hotel
74:10 he says there's gonna be a prince and
74:13 like this sort of Wesley Snipes you know
74:16 blade guy who's chasing the prince
74:18 princes am the king of all of the
74:21 vampires in case you're not familiar
74:22 with that terminology he hit all the the
74:26 CD pieces all around the place with
74:28 codes on them so you would know that
74:30 they went together hid the phone box
74:34 pieces everywhere I mean like literally
74:36 just all over the hotel plants and so
74:40 we're not quite sure what the hell is
74:42 gonna happen here and what the what's a
74:44 polaroid camera for I don't do the
74:47 vampire thing and the other guy was the
74:50 only other guy that was kind of close to
74:51 this franchise played the werewolf
74:52 things that he wasn't involved in either
74:54 so we show up to this hotel and it's
74:58 booming like all these rooms are all the
75:00 doors are open there's wall playing
75:01 games going on I mean just every game
75:04 Stratego rooms everything monopoly rooms
75:07 I mean this was like just board game
75:10 heaven guys are getting emotional and
75:12 yelling being you know crazy they also
75:15 had this you dress up in gear and you
75:19 have foam rubber weapons and you fight
75:22 we did that too that night it's like the
75:25 second we think I was a North American
75:27 something or other it was a group out of
75:29 New England that pioneered all these
75:31 rules and you've seen it online all the
75:33 time
75:34 again it's always nerds playing in his
75:36 with everyone else says but get beanbags
75:38 for spells and you throw out of people
75:40 and you it's just kind of it's fun it's
75:42 crazy and the more I look like a guy
75:45 that would never do that that's the
75:46 point of the story that's why you gotta
75:48 be tolerant and meet cool people men but
75:51 we showed through the hotel unannounced
75:53 and we find all over the walls tonight
75:58 and mortals meted this room at this
76:02 particular time we look at Bill and
76:06 we're like is this you he was like no so
76:10 now we find out someone else is a
76:12 different live-action role-playing game
76:14 plan for that night called the same
76:16 exact thing he called his immortals the
76:19 Flyers are all over the hotel so we go
76:23 to the room and it's on the Flyers at
76:25 the time they said they were gonna
76:26 gather and wouldn't you know it as God
76:30 it would pull a miracle out of his bag
76:33 of tricks they don't show up I mean no
76:37 one shows up we're sitting in their room
76:40 waiting for them to show up so we can
76:41 maybe figure out how to do this right
76:44 because it's I guess it's written all
76:46 over bill stuff so we're sitting in
76:49 there we just start setting up we hijack
76:52 this other promotion but now we're not
76:55 getting too many people in the room this
76:57 is another funny thing that happens now
76:59 we're all fairly decent looking guys
77:01 were pretty trendy and this girl walks
77:05 in who's pretty damn cute and we're on
77:08 our 20s we're in our mid-20s and she's
77:11 pretty you know she's sort of like a
77:13 comic-con girl sexy bouncy you know just
77:18 a real go-getter she was what you guys
77:19 doing here this is what we're setting up
77:21 for immortals are you coming to play
77:23 just what's that so someone throws her
77:26 the pitch she thought that sounds cool
77:28 where's everybody yeah we can't get
77:30 people to come in they're all row points
77:32 she goes I'll go get everybody so she
77:35 uses her physique and her wit and goes
77:39 out there and grabs so many people the
77:41 room is packed I mean it must have been
77:43 40 people in this room
77:45 so then bill lays down how this game is
77:48 gonna work he says this is a vampire
77:50 ruling sister all playing system you are
77:52 going to be looking for the prince
77:55 and once you think you know who the
77:58 prince is in the hotel we're gonna have
78:01 a huge battle at the end and he goes I
78:04 need everyone who wants to play to fill
78:06 out this thing and then when you have to
78:08 come over here and get your polaroid
78:09 taken and we're thinking it's like some
78:12 ID thing to make sure someone doesn't
78:13 sneak in the game nope it's even more
78:15 brilliant than that apparently in this
78:18 role-playing system which I don't even
78:19 know if we have one I think bill just
78:22 made it up he's that brilliant he says
78:25 it takes your picture it's a Polaroid
78:27 you know develops right there on the
78:28 spot so it gives it to uni goes this is
78:30 your loyalty card if you give this to
78:32 somebody else you have given them your
78:35 loyalty they gain power by having your
78:38 Polaroid so don't just give this to
78:40 anybody give it to someone you think it
78:42 is going to be you know for whatever
78:44 faction you think you're gonna be on the
78:45 side of now I show up in my street
78:50 clothes I guess but I also brought this
78:53 some really long cloth like really nice
78:57 wool white wasn't really a trench coat
79:02 because the trench coats have the trench
79:04 coat thing it's just a nice long coat
79:06 you might wear at a party or something
79:09 so I had that in a bang and so bilk
79:13 turns to me and he goes okay you're the
79:14 Prince like I am he goes yeah I had
79:18 short hair at the time was all white no
79:20 spiky and he said okay just hide
79:23 somewhere in the hotel you guys probably
79:25 you should just go down to the bar I
79:26 said okay so what do we do he says well
79:31 you don't want them to know you're the
79:33 prince
79:34 so do anything you can to disinfo who
79:36 the hell you are I said are you the
79:39 blade guy he says yeah I'm the blade guy
79:41 alright so the night starts I guess I'm
79:46 old enough to drink at the time I don't
79:48 think I got anything to drink
79:49 shame on me and it takes a while people
79:52 running around grabbing these pieces
79:54 once he figured out what was going on
79:55 and I forgot what he gave them for
79:58 solving those puzzles
79:59 I wasn't where he was so he was running
80:01 the game from his side the cards that he
80:04 made for the car game are all over the
80:05 place the people trying to build decks
80:07 but here's the weird thing without
80:10 telling anyone to be a particular way
80:13 the faction of kids that walked in that
80:16 room split into two sides one is kind of
80:20 on his side and as they found me one of
80:24 them was sort of loyal to me but they
80:28 don't know who's who
80:29 is that guy the friends am I the prince
80:32 so I'm getting these kids to give me all
80:35 of their Polaroids I don't ask for a
80:38 single one they give them to me I made
80:40 sure it was voluntary so in their mind
80:43 there's no force upon them for them to
80:47 give me their loyalty right so starts
80:50 getting down to the N tonight there's a
80:52 huge punch line of this so that's why
80:54 I'm telling you this story which i think
80:56 is utterly hilarious I had no idea what
81:02 the Punisher was in Marvel Comics I
81:04 think it's mommy and small right yeah he
81:08 bill or punish her t-shirt black with
81:12 the big skull on the one the key uses
81:13 all the time right so came down to these
81:17 guys running back and forth between he
81:19 and I and I'm telling them they go are
81:21 you they asked they I have to tell the
81:23 truth up to a point and I don't have to
81:26 tell the truth at some point but he they
81:28 said are you vampire
81:31 finally someone asked me a question when
81:33 she's supposed to just completely reveal
81:35 that I'm you know the prince so I
81:38 answered the question truthfully but
81:39 then I put a lie on top of it so I said
81:41 I took I did the blade story I said well
81:44 you know I've been fighting these guys
81:47 forever so yeah I've got a little bit of
81:51 their blood I've been bitten once and I
81:52 was they didn't quite dream me so I
81:55 survived so yeah I sort of have vampire
81:57 blood in me
81:58 but I've been trying to find this Prince
81:59 forever have you found him and they're
82:04 like no so I totally believe me you know
82:07 I've got like you know 20 Polaroids
82:10 which I you know it didn't really give
82:12 me any power
82:13 it didn't really you take away power for
82:14 the mana no really what the theory was
82:16 but it felt it felt interesting
82:18 it felt interesting to give away your
82:20 loyalty right and so I said well where
82:23 do you what do you know about this
82:24 vampire you know and I look into build
82:26 down the hallway because I come back
82:27 upstairs I'm looking at this Punisher
82:29 t-shirt yet I have no idea what that is
82:32 but I said well I said the Prince always
82:35 wears a symbol of death on him it's just
82:39 isn't the rule that he has to wear the
82:41 symbol of death and they turn around I
82:44 saw I swear to God I had six guys in
82:46 front of me you know mid to late 20s
82:49 very intellectual kids they roleplay so
82:51 they're super smart and I just see them
82:53 all turn around and look back and they
82:55 see his punisher skull on his chest and
83:00 they're like oh my god so they run over
83:03 to him and ask him he's the Prince
83:05 thinking it's gonna be that easy right
83:08 he tells them on the prince
83:10 he finally just says it they come back
83:12 over to me and they go he says you're
83:14 the Prince like oh my god and it's tit
83:16 for tat thing at the finale not very
83:18 interesting right so I took all the
83:21 Polaroids out and gave them all back to
83:24 them I said I've never needed your
83:26 loyalty would the Prince give you back
83:30 your power you know no but there it is
83:36 all of you've got your your loyalty back
83:39 and now they are a thousand percent
83:41 convinced he's the prince because I
83:43 pinned him with his shirt and a gay back
83:46 all the loyalty Polaroids and it's now
83:49 go time my guys have collected half the
83:53 deck and his guys have collected half
83:56 the deck the girl that showed up in the
83:59 room ended up being on his side and he
84:02 made the game he made the card game that
84:05 we're about to throw down for we're
84:08 playing this card game standing up in
84:10 the hallway we got this gigantic crowd
84:12 around us all watching the cards man and
84:14 I can't remember that I knew anything
84:16 about how to play the game because I
84:18 never had a chance to really look at
84:20 them we got all the way down to the last
84:22 play and we're winning
84:24 but he made the game and the funny thing
84:28 was is that he made a card dedicated to
84:31 me
84:31 because I love Prince and it was a
84:34 prince song called Shaka delica and I
84:37 believe what prince meant by Shaka
84:39 delica just as a little side note was
84:40 that's writer's block when you're making
84:43 music I could be wrong but I think
84:45 that's what he meant but he made a card
84:48 called Shaka delicate and he whispers to
84:50 the girl to play Shaka delica because
84:52 whatever was it was a massive card and
84:55 so by a hair he wins of course he made
84:58 the game and you know that I'm revealed
85:01 and the game's over but everyone had the
85:03 best time of their fricking life and so
85:06 when people were accusing Keo being a
85:07 LARP the only reason why I know what a
85:09 LARP is is because this one time
85:11 experience in my entire life that was an
85:13 absolute blast a couple years later
85:17 probably even within the year my friend
85:21 moved to Vegas and started a game
85:25 company so he took to himself and the
85:29 other guy with him the two game
85:31 designers they both went to Vegas so we
85:32 lost proximity with each other I hired
85:35 the other guy into my team at EA as soon
85:37 as I became full-time and so we lost
85:40 each other and I don't think we've role
85:44 played a single day since super sad but
85:49 things come to an end right things that
85:50 are valuable always come to it in which
85:51 makes them valuable so I know there's a
85:54 ton of you that have role played
85:55 especially if you saw the title and you
85:57 thought it was interesting you never
85:57 been in the channel before you're
85:59 definitely just rah rah and you got a
86:01 billion stories ten times better than
86:03 mine trust me I know that I want you to
86:06 know that I know that but those you've
86:08 never done it heard about it and you've
86:09 jumped on the bandwagon of you know
86:12 throwing out an insult or criticism you
86:16 might rethink that because these kids
86:19 live a much richer life you know in the
86:23 90s that whole dinner Mystery House
86:26 thing was extremely popular and we would
86:29 hear about you know obviously your
86:32 dressing up and some colonial outfit or
86:34 something that you've actually usually
86:35 have outfits for you to wear when you
86:36 those places but we'd hear their stories
86:39 and they weren't bad they're having a
86:40 good time no reason to have two people
86:42 one person loose for someone else to win
86:45 but you know it's one night one night
86:49 and that's it and a true role playing
86:52 the experience goes on
86:53 I don't know however much you can play I
86:55 would say you wouldn't want to play it
86:57 every single day because you would
87:00 probably get tired of the story too
87:02 quickly but a couple of times a week
87:05 this huge sometimes the holidays would
87:07 come by and we'd skip a week and then
87:09 boy we're just so eager to play the next
87:11 time around but it develops your mind it
87:15 develops your sense of emotion if you
87:19 ever become the person in charge of the
87:20 story and again you could you could role
87:24 play I've role play with my kid actually
87:26 that's where I wrote played last when
87:28 she was a little girl you know kids
87:30 always struggle to get to sleep because
87:32 you know their mind wakes up at night
87:34 and you have to use various techniques
87:37 sometimes I would create a story try to
87:40 place like we if we played Candyland for
87:43 instance or something get her tucked
87:46 into bed she's wide awake and I just say
87:48 okay you're in Candyland
87:51 what do you do and she just make up
87:52 something and I'd make up something and
87:55 we would go through the story until she
87:57 got really tired okay okay if you
88:00 haven't young ones especially boys but I
88:05 think girls are coming around now girls
88:07 are always involved with this stuff
88:08 again that girl was at the at the
88:10 role-playing event she saved our bacon
88:12 in this whole thing man just just go get
88:15 the books now what's occurred I believe
88:18 in the latest I think they're the fifth
88:21 edition or something like that with with
88:22 D&D I think well I'm a little confused
88:27 because I was told by one guy that they
88:30 had ditched all of the really cool
88:31 unique died and went over to the
88:33 six-sided die which is a real sad thing
88:35 but then I go to the hobby shops every
88:38 one so long I still see the the old dice
88:40 so I don't know if that's true or not I
88:42 never continued following it past third
88:45 edition the big the big improvement with
88:49 third edition was the
88:50 um during combat it was pretty pretty
88:56 basic stuff you know swinging swords and
88:58 that kind of stuff right but with third
89:02 edition they started people started
89:05 playing other role-playing system got
89:06 really jealous that you could do very
89:08 meticulous type battle stuff like you
89:11 could grab somebody and hold their hand
89:13 I mean you could really do very
89:15 meticulous fighting that did not appeal
89:17 to me because it slows battle down and
89:20 it's really not about how meticulous and
89:24 John wick you are in a fight it's really
89:26 just get in have a good time with the
89:28 battle it's still gonna be just as
89:30 random as ever you're still gonna die
89:33 when you're gonna die and you're gonna
89:34 be you know good when you're good so as
89:37 my screenwriting mentor said you know he
89:40 said starting about your generation you
89:42 guys lost metaphor and you all became
89:46 very pragmatic which is why you want the
89:48 force explained and why everything's got
89:50 to be explained and explained he goes
89:52 you're just taking a piss out of
89:54 everything you're taking all the magic
89:56 out of everything and you got to get
89:58 back to metaphor and so I think the
90:01 role-playing systems are almost
90:02 identical in their evolution and correct
90:05 me if it's if it's better better today I
90:07 would love to hear from some of you
90:08 experts and still play but they they
90:14 followed sort of what he was saying it
90:15 was just a little too much detail
90:18 instead of story stories where it's at
90:21 but when I write screenwriter
90:26 screenplays I I mean only when I'm
90:31 trying to follow someone else's
90:33 storyline so if someone says okay it's
90:36 gotta be this time this place and all
90:39 these factors I've already thought up
90:40 all your characters even though I don't
90:41 know how my movies gonna work that's
90:44 where in order to satisfy the client you
90:47 know you kind of get in there go okay
90:48 I'm getting a little bit of a block
90:49 about how to recreate you know some
90:52 previous thought you might have had in a
90:54 new system right so you know I've had a
90:59 job where someone wanted me to take a
91:01 really old old movie and then
91:04 upgrade it to the current day and time
91:06 and it's a totally different world where
91:10 this previous film occurred and no
91:13 circumstances exist the
91:15 geology/geography excuse me doesn't
91:17 exist anymore the way it was in this old
91:20 story and so when you try to
91:23 reverse-engineer perfection you
91:26 typically end up with crap you know and
91:29 so and under normal circumstances when
91:33 you're writing something original I will
91:36 say undoubtedly because of role playing
91:39 I never have writer's block any more you
91:42 know that doesn't mean everything is
91:44 fantastic and everything has that you
91:46 know the right pull and push at the
91:48 right time I'm not popping emotions as
91:50 hot as I could pop them on the first
91:51 draft but in terms of just being backed
91:55 into a corner and getting yourself out
91:57 of it it's right there on the tip of
91:59 your tongue man so anyway I hope you
92:01 enjoyed the episode I can't believe I
92:04 didn't think about doing this sooner
92:07 just to recap real quickly though if you
92:11 want to play Dungeons and Dragons I
92:13 would say definitely keep the old dice
92:16 whatever you got to do to do it maybe
92:18 stick with second edition or maybe
92:21 borrow a little bit from other editions
92:22 and develop an edition that works for
92:24 you and your friends but second edition
92:26 was utterly perfect okay but you're
92:29 gonna have to have someone that really
92:30 understands the system really well to be
92:32 your Dungeon Master to make the game
92:34 really fun and that might just need to
92:35 be you if you're the one instigating the
92:37 whole thing it doesn't take much to read
92:39 the monster manuals to go online online
92:42 must have like a billion different
92:44 things you get to draw your map I mean
92:46 it's like Europe you're a blizzard game
92:49 designer is really what it is right I
92:51 guarantee you everybody a blizzard place
92:53 guarantee it you couldn't possibly get
92:55 on the the world of warcraft at least
92:57 story team game design team art team
93:00 without probably playing games right
93:03 there inside blizzard proper Shadowrun I
93:06 would say probably can't play it unless
93:11 you're really disciplined I will say
93:13 that the Sega Genesis
93:16 Shadowrun game made by a friend of mine
93:19 it's one of the best video games ever
93:21 made in the 90s ever
93:23 I bought the Sega Genesis to play
93:24 Shadowrun play it to the hill my buddy
93:28 bill borrowed the cart and never brought
93:30 it back to me
93:31 son of a [ __ ] but he was the reason why
93:34 I am bought it the first place but it's
93:36 one of the best video games ever that's
93:38 one of the ways to play
93:40 Shadowrun but if nothing else the
93:42 manuals are the most or that whatever
93:44 you want to call them the books are some
93:47 of the most enchanting amazing gritty
93:50 Bladerunner looking things you've ever
93:52 seen it's gonna be first edition most
93:54 likely you're gonna have to go to hobby
93:56 stores if you start seeing orcs and
93:59 elves and stuff on the cover
94:00 that ain't the books find ones that are
94:02 completely human but the the set the
94:05 first edition set I think must have been
94:08 about two and a half three feet if you
94:11 put all the books together that's how
94:12 many books they wrote it was just
94:14 amazing if you want a great generic
94:17 role-playing system go get the champions
94:20 manual because it will open up a whole
94:22 new world that you can do anything in
94:25 the amount of characters we created in
94:27 champions we played several champions
94:30 sessions the one I told you it was the
94:32 most memorable one but anyway if you
94:36 want to get into video games and you
94:37 want to get into game design you need
94:39 this DNA in your system the amount of
94:42 students I taught about game design how
94:45 it works just the basic neural mechanics
94:47 and then the game mechanics level design
94:49 a little bit it doesn't have it doesn't
94:54 move without a story you know today
94:57 things have become so Hollywood and
94:59 video games the people almost bored to
95:01 death because video games have turned
95:03 into the same video games are better
95:07 than movies in most cases the stories
95:09 are little richer in a lot of case it's
95:11 down some of the Marvel movies have been
95:12 you know story on crack I mean it's
95:14 really tremendous amazing movies that
95:17 Marvel has done but that franchise just
95:18 sort of ended and so they're gonna try
95:21 to keep going but
95:24 the town agencies in Hollywood are
95:27 signaling it's it's gonna be about 10
95:29 years before this comes back strong
95:31 they're not even they got rid of a bunch
95:33 of writers then writing those movies
95:35 just literally let him go so like we
95:37 don't have any more need for your skill
95:39 set so we read the writing on the wall
95:42 for that one I think it will improve
95:45 your life all the way around you'll also
95:50 probably maintain your childlike
95:54 interior that you should maintain you
95:57 know like a lot of people you know it's
96:00 you have to struggle to become an adult
96:01 right to shed your your childlike nature
96:05 then you have some kids then you go buy
96:08 the Legos you buy the model kits you do
96:11 whatever you get your dollhouse for your
96:13 daughter and you start role-playing you
96:15 know I had to be the Kindle I had a
96:17 daughter man so I had to do all that
96:19 stuff and so you know we had to pretend
96:22 cook and all this other kind of stuff
96:24 it's great it rebirths the child in you
96:28 that you need to have that fun
96:29 optimistic view of the world that
96:31 inquisitive thing that you have but
96:34 there's nothing like a great story
96:36 and as you see people in real life going
96:39 through story arcs that are real that
96:41 are maybe not so positive at times you
96:45 will have lived that arc several times
96:47 in a role-playing system at the either
96:51 near or beyond the arcs that they're
96:55 experiencing and you can become very
96:57 useful in that sense so there's just
96:58 there's just all kinds of benefits
97:00 mentally and it I think you dig it let's
97:05 just put that way so anyway this is your
97:08 first episode since this one might grab
97:10 some new people that have never been
97:11 around the deep thoughts radio thing
97:13 it's a fairly intense show so definitely
97:16 be aware you're gonna step into a bunch
97:18 of landmines if you're sensitive but we
97:21 talked about a bunch of cool stuff in
97:23 the comments sections in YouTube Ross
97:24 and my locked Facebook group is super
97:26 awesome so definitely get in there and
97:29 see that and to do that you go to deep
97:31 thoughts radio comm which is the hub for
97:32 the show there's a search field so type
97:35 any word in you
97:36 have an episode about you'll be shocked
97:39 there's two episodes about it but
97:41 there's also a category section in case
97:43 you want to just drill straight into
97:44 what you like and ignore all the other
97:45 videos it's cool we have two feeds for
97:48 video YouTube [ __ ] you please get a bit
97:51 chewed account plenty of audio links for
97:53 your podcast devices I'm starting to
97:56 recommend not to use itunes use some
97:58 other podcast reader on your Mac phones
98:00 so you can get all the episodes all the
98:02 way back to season one because they have
98:03 a count limit and we've got almost 500
98:07 episodes at this point and so you want
98:10 to make sure you've got access to all
98:11 those social media is a lock Facebook
98:13 group like I said Twitter page and
98:15 minds.com eyes that calms a copy of
98:17 Facebook but it's first and then
98:19 protected so please make an account on
98:20 that just to make sure they don't go
98:22 away you could donate to the page or to
98:25 the channel I should say two different
98:27 ways a one-time PayPal a monthly patreon
98:31 patreon people get the episodes before
98:33 everyone else 95% of the time and they
98:36 get a 20% discount on the store there's
98:38 also two products I love for you guys to
98:40 have ones the brave browser which cuts
98:42 off all that Eve state change the search
98:43 engine from Google the DuckDuckGo and
98:45 you're good to go
98:46 put a VPN underneath that if you want to
98:48 keep corporations from knowing who you
98:49 are government will always know who you
98:51 were and where you are no matter what
98:52 they know everything you trans first and
98:55 don't kid yourself and they know exactly
98:57 where you are no matter what you put on
98:59 between you and them the other one is
99:02 the Backblaze backup system eight bucks
99:05 a month one computer infinite storage
99:08 and make no money from those last two
99:09 things although they said they would
99:11 credit me but I know people have gotten
99:14 on it through my affiliate link and
99:15 nothing happens so don't think I'm
99:18 scooping a bunch of cash on that whole
99:20 thing like I said there's a store
99:22 there's two t-shirts for season five
99:24 those will be expired and pull down one
99:27 season five concludes regardless of what
99:28 happens after that I'll make more shirts
99:31 don't worry
99:33 season one is not on this channel
99:36 anymore it's on a separate channel
99:37 because they were just badly edited and
99:40 they had a bunch of music that was
99:41 causing copyright problems I pulled all
99:43 that out of there there's no ads on that
99:44 channel go over there and subscribe
99:45 knock yourself out for the first senate
99:47 episodes again if you
99:49 see anything go to the website there are
99:52 just a couple episodes I completely
99:54 retired so if you're looking in the
99:56 queue and it skips a number that's
99:58 intentional if it's on the website if
100:01 it's skipping on YouTube but it's on the
100:03 website if you find any broken stuff let
100:05 me know but I've never had anyone say
100:07 that but having said all that take care
100:10 of yourself and someone else and I will
100:12 see you on the next deep thoughts over
100:14 now
