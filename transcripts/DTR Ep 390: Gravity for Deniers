00:00 [Music]
00:31 it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
00:35 will you be my neighbor welcome back
00:38 ladies and gentlemen to deep thoughts as
00:42 I test this herrera steli toro
00:44 to see if it's going to canoe tunnel do
00:48 something else it's already got a little
00:50 bit of a tunnel going here on this side
00:52 there just let it go crack down the side
00:55 there okay so today as you can tell the
00:59 name of the video is gonna be called
01:02 gravity for deniers and the reason why
01:07 I'm making this episode because I
01:09 already have a gravity episode except
01:13 you know it's funny I make the I make an
01:14 episode educational sort of episode like
01:16 that in my opinion and I didn't think
01:23 about a better way to say it and a
01:24 better way to analogize it so some of
01:33 you guys get on the Facebook group and
01:35 you'll post these funny memes and really
01:39 super creative graphics which is
01:41 interesting you know someone spending a
01:43 lot of time on this to get people to
01:47 refute the gravity exists and one of the
01:54 funniest suggestions for a lack of
01:56 belief is that if you were to go down to
01:59 the bottom of a or even to get to the
02:02 edge of a ball you'd start slipping off
02:06 the edge just like anything in this
02:09 world you know if we had a big sphere
02:10 and I'm sitting on it why because
02:12 obviously if I go to one of the sides
02:14 I'm gonna slip off and I understand why
02:18 that is so alluring and so profound that
02:21 oh my god these people said it was a
02:23 ball and I never once thought from my
02:25 childhood to being an adult that I would
02:27 have fallen off the ball and now that I
02:29 have thought about it I'm gonna pound
02:31 social media with these memes okay
02:35 nothing wrong with going down a path of
02:38 organic belief development but we have
02:44 to not feed the misinformed about
02:53 everything else group of folks with
02:57 bigger errors on our site the other one
03:01 I get and I'll see in the comments is
03:03 someone will say well I think it's just
03:05 air pressure and you know I've been down
03:09 all this too as a kid and reprise it as
03:12 an adult there are experiments that
03:15 prove that it's not air and so to walk
03:21 around saying it's air pressure it's not
03:25 conclusive because you can build a box
03:29 made of plexiglass put a feather in
03:32 there pull all of the air out and just
03:36 roll that box around and the feather
03:37 falls beautifully just like a little BB
03:42 would fall you know back and forth in
03:45 fact without the air inside the
03:47 container gravity works even better so
03:51 it's not air pressure now I believe that
03:55 I've told you exactly what it is and my
03:57 you know science is based off of the
03:59 writings of the gentleman that had
04:02 discovered electromagnetic waves /
04:06 electricity now what's interesting is is
04:10 that we toss around this whole thing
04:12 about how brilliant Tesla was and you
04:17 should think he's brilliant and you
04:19 should think he's one of the smartest if
04:21 not the smartest human beings that's
04:23 ever walked the earth I don't know if he
04:28 was a nice guy but he was brilliant and
04:32 he explicitly said in several letters
04:34 and writings communications with friends
04:37 and communications with the public that
04:38 every single thing he ever created was
04:42 based on ether all models
04:46 so as you hear about eath remodels it
04:51 would be but I would just appeal to your
04:54 respect for Tesla meaning the dude who's
04:56 great at all this stuff I mean
04:57 unfortunately it might be a little
05:00 overdone at this point you know in terms
05:02 of us getting leukemia from half of his
05:05 inventions but he would have sought to
05:08 it that nothing harmed man if he had had
05:10 the chance but what's interesting to me
05:14 is sort of the thought process that
05:15 gravity only has one property and that's
05:18 the pushdown that's it they could never
05:21 push in any other direction it pushes
05:23 straight down
05:24 no don't we laugh when we hear about the
05:27 the people from millennia ago several
05:30 money ago when they thought the world
05:32 was on the back of a turtle and then
05:35 they said well what do you think the
05:36 turtle standing on and a lady says well
05:37 it's Turtles all the way down I mean do
05:40 we think that she has a point
05:42 is it too Turtles I'll be on the back of
05:45 a turtle is there strictly and up and
05:48 strictly a down is God up there and the
05:51 Devils down there is this the kind of
05:52 world that we believe or the way that we
05:56 sort of surround the conversation with
05:58 gravity before we even talk about the
06:00 science and therefore everything
06:03 scientific is stuck in this envelope if
06:05 there's a true up and there's a true
06:06 down in the universe like God even cares
06:11 I guess now I need to put a disclaimer
06:15 at the beginning if you're a student
06:16 trying to figure out what gravity is and
06:17 you're watching this what's gonna be
06:19 fascinating for you is that you're
06:21 actually gonna get the truth in this
06:22 particular video and when you go to
06:26 school you're gonna get the opposite lie
06:28 about how it works but you can do your
06:30 own research and find out that Faraday
06:33 and Tesla just go look up those two guys
06:35 in their theory of gravity it's ether
06:37 all based they actually had it a
06:38 thousand percent correct but this video
06:42 is going to be half about the
06:43 metaphysical mind of thinking about
06:45 gravity and the other side is going to
06:47 be what it really is so let's go at this
06:50 whole thing about you would fall off the
06:53 bottom of the earth if you went down
06:54 there you can't even live in Cairo and
06:57 again I know that the theory is is that
07:00 the
07:00 flat for some people and therefore no
07:03 matter where you go on earth you're
07:04 being pushed down and you don't feel any
07:06 movement and that's your explanation and
07:09 hey you know I guess and some matrix II
07:13 kind of thing that guess that could be
07:14 real you know again I don't really have
07:17 the the solution for you guys when it
07:21 comes to flying from say Glasgow to
07:26 Cairo and the amount of horizontal
07:29 speeds you're going to have to increase
07:31 your vehicle by to be sitting right on
07:34 the equator traveling a thousand miles
07:36 an hour from Glasgow that might be going
07:38 350 whereas all that other velocity come
07:42 from how come the ship isn't getting
07:44 torn up I mean it's almost at the point
07:46 now where if you travel too quickly to
07:48 Cairo you might get torn apart
07:50 horizontally so I don't understand how
07:53 that works perhaps it's just some
07:57 beautiful synergy of the atmosphere that
07:59 pushes you around so just know I do have
08:02 questions like you have questions but
08:06 let's look at this whole idea about
08:08 falling off the bottom of the world
08:09 because I flew from Los Angeles to
08:13 Sydney and I did not take a trip to
08:15 China my company wanted to they wanted
08:19 to give me a 36-hour layout layover
08:21 unbelievable no my boss went no thanks
08:26 but I understand the idea that it's a
08:28 disc but if I had flown from Los Angeles
08:30 to Sydney on a disc I would have had a
08:34 really really long flight you know I
08:37 think much longer I didn't stop off
08:39 anywhere
08:40 but now remember when you were a little
08:42 kid and it rained outside or it snowed
08:45 outside it was very sunny outside and
08:47 you had a relative that lives in a
08:50 different town far enough away that your
08:54 weather pattern isn't there water pot
08:56 weather pattern and you were talking to
08:57 them on the phone and you made the funny
09:00 mistake as a child of saying you know to
09:05 your grandmother your grandfather or
09:06 whatever you know isn't it isn't it sad
09:10 that it's raining can they go well it's
09:12 not raining where I am and your mind
09:14 blows right you know what you mean where
09:18 you know what I see outside the window
09:20 isn't what everybody sees outside the
09:22 window we're not in a single state
09:23 universe no honey we're not I live far
09:30 away from you and the clouds over you
09:31 are different than the clouds over me
09:33 okay and it starts to expand your mind
09:36 it starts to get you to understand that
09:38 things are relative to each one of our
09:41 little sensor machines called the human
09:43 body
09:45 so the first misnomer about gravity
09:48 outside of the official junk definition
09:50 of you know the earth pulling on you
09:53 know the earth pulling on you model can
09:57 work but it's so it's it has no basis in
10:01 physics and so it's a phenomenon right
10:03 but the ether model of this outside
10:07 pressure pushing on the surface of a
10:09 ball which made it a ball in the first
10:10 place makes complete sense because you
10:14 see it all the time right how many times
10:17 have I said in episodes I'm if it's
10:18 drinking game you guys be borderline
10:20 alcoholics exactly how a bubble exists
10:24 in water is exactly how any stellar body
10:27 exists in the universe the only
10:29 difference is is that the the pressure
10:32 from the universe is far different than
10:35 the pressure that water creates the
10:37 water is simply a higher construct of
10:39 etheral particles h2o and on average
10:44 right then in a single ether a particle
10:49 so it takes probably quadrillions con
10:52 times quadrillions of versions of our
10:55 numbers of ether particles to start
10:58 creating mass in the universe and moving
11:00 things around and getting spherical
11:03 poles established and then building up
11:06 from there to build quarks and then
11:08 finally you know chemical elements and
11:12 then compounds etc etc we are being
11:15 pushed down to the surface of the earth
11:18 by ether
11:20 a tremendous amount of this ether goes
11:24 actually through our bodies because we
11:26 have more space between us than we have
11:28 actual blockage but we have enough
11:31 blockage and there's enough infinite
11:34 ether out there it's pushing down on us
11:36 that we get yanked down to the earth the
11:40 bigger we are the more impact we have
11:42 from Heathrow particles pushing down on
11:45 us and therefore we weigh more smaller
11:47 we get less impact we weigh less an
11:51 ether a particle is the most benign
11:53 thing in the universe it has no charge
11:55 it's not a positive it's not a negative
11:57 however when just like atom in a big
11:59 crowd when they start bunch bumping into
12:01 each other on a three-dimensional level
12:04 they could probably create several
12:06 different shapes but one of the shapes
12:08 they most likely create is a sphere by
12:11 bumping into each other in a
12:12 3-dimensional manner we're talking about
12:14 particles hitting from above from below
12:17 from every single conceivable tangent to
12:19 the curve of impact and ricochet those
12:22 that bounce off of each other will later
12:25 be categorized as a dielectric wave
12:27 those that go in orbit will be known as
12:29 a magnetic wave and when those two
12:32 happen to bang into each other we get an
12:33 electromagnetic wave an electromagnetic
12:37 wave is very interesting because it
12:39 starts to create this sort of exchange
12:42 program between spheres when those two
12:47 the dielectric and the magnetism bang
12:49 into each other remember ones bouncing
12:50 back and ones going in a circle when
12:53 they hit each other something very
12:54 special occurs it creates this tunnel of
13:00 frequency that if you're very similar in
13:03 a conductive manner you're going to be
13:05 able to take an electron or part of this
13:09 wave of energy and as long as there's an
13:12 exchange of of mass right I'm gonna give
13:15 you part of my thing and just like a
13:18 hose you know in order to push the water
13:20 out of the hose you got to put more
13:21 water in the other end right so you push
13:23 someone else's going in and you're going
13:26 out and then typically it's in some sort
13:29 of loop which we call the valence it's
13:31 the surface of a conductive material
13:34 like a gold wire copper wire whatever
13:36 and it goes in a circle it has to
13:39 exchange otherwise you would start
13:41 losing part of this ether into some
13:43 pocket and the mass that originally
13:46 existed to create all these waves this
13:48 dielectric magnetism an electro
13:50 magnetism reaction would simply
13:52 dissipate and that's probably what
13:55 happens when you have fire tearing apart
13:58 mass you know fire is a super aggravated
14:01 state of sort of unraveling the sweater
14:05 when you start pulling a thread out of a
14:07 sweater what starts happening it starts
14:08 disappearing right well fire is
14:11 essentially we could call it a chemical
14:15 reaction but it's really just the
14:16 physical reaction of something's being
14:19 undone something's being so agitated by
14:22 excited particles that these things are
14:23 starting to just vaporize starting to
14:26 unravel there's their elliptical spheres
14:29 but some things survive fire right you
14:33 burn something down a log down and what
14:36 do you have you have a bunch of carbon
14:38 at the base because carbon is such a
14:41 fundamental particle in the universe so
14:43 this hydrogen
14:44 although hydrogen is very combustive the
14:47 carbon you can't you can't get anything
14:52 inside of it meaning you can't undo it
14:56 you could pull a thread out of a sweater
14:58 but if I give you a sheet of carbon
15:01 fiber and I say go ahead and pull the
15:02 pull the thread out of the carbon fiber
15:05 four by four sheet do you know you're
15:09 just looking at a gun list no there's no
15:11 thread to pull out and I'm like yeah cuz
15:13 it's so dense and so intense you're
15:16 never going to be able to undo a carbon
15:18 fiber plate let's go back to the earth
15:22 the earth is a ball the Sun is a ball
15:25 and the moon is a ball because these
15:31 things have organically formed out of
15:33 the very artery of movement of ether all
15:39 particles
15:41 meaning the ether particles are in this
15:43 beautiful beautiful dance in the
15:45 universe between celestial bodies now
15:48 there's a ton of ether particles that
15:50 aren't necessarily trapped inside of
15:52 this ecosystem but once they get close
15:55 to an ecosystem they can easily get
15:57 buried inside what am I talking about
16:01 well there's these beautiful
16:03 illustrations and I'll try to put one in
16:04 this video of how the Sun has a big
16:09 gigantic magnetic pole electrical pole
16:12 around it and then this the earth has
16:14 one and the moon has one and some of
16:18 these artists have done an amazing job
16:19 showing you that the that the ejection
16:22 at the top of the Sun can spread out so
16:27 far that it goes inside the top of the
16:31 earth which then starts adding to the
16:34 atomic mass of the earth and the earth
16:37 is actually injecting the moon now
16:40 technically speaking everything within a
16:42 certain proximity is injecting each
16:43 other technically speaking it's Jupiter
16:47 could be injecting us a little bit it
16:49 would be an infinitesimal amount but it
16:51 could be doing that Jupiter could
16:52 definitely be slamming all of its moons
16:54 and probably Mars it just depends on the
16:58 the the rate sort of the amperage of
17:02 what's coming out of the top of these
17:04 vanilla belt ejectors right actually
17:07 comes out the bottom goes in the top
17:09 comes on the bottom goes on the top okay
17:11 the spherical shape is a natural shape
17:16 that happens in the universe and this is
17:18 why we have bubbles right no one is
17:21 going down inside the ocean and saying
17:22 hey everybody
17:23 when h2o surrounds oxygen you need to
17:29 turn into a bubble why why can't we do a
17:32 square why can't we do a cone or a
17:34 cylinder because this is how we all bump
17:38 into each other on a sub sub sub atomic
17:40 you throw a level how many of you have
17:44 seen your drain drain water into your
17:47 faucet I'm into your sink in your
17:49 kitchen into the tub drain some of those
17:53 holes that happen
17:55 there were where farmers have actually
17:57 put pipes into the bottom of their ponds
17:59 or legs because they have to drain them
18:00 every once in a while and you see those
18:03 crazy circular vortexes
18:06 well who's out there making in a vortex
18:09 but human beings out there going nope
18:12 you you need to do it in a square
18:13 fashion I want a square wave oh I want
18:15 an accidental Saturn CG wave on the top
18:18 of this thing nobody the universe is
18:20 doing that because that's the way things
18:23 bump into each other now how many times
18:27 if you looked at it and you you saw that
18:29 the outer ring of one of those big drain
18:33 holes like you sometimes those the pond
18:35 ones actually have sinkholes that happen
18:37 and it just drains out a lake in you go
18:38 my guy like like I think Tahoe had
18:40 something like this the outer ring is
18:43 going slower than the inner ring the
18:46 inner ring is going really really fast
18:47 it's a vortex it gets quicker as it goes
18:50 towards the center alright the other
18:55 thing is that the center typically has a
18:56 hole in it
18:57 because this stuff is going somewhere
18:58 because it has to have a negative
19:00 pressure zone an empty zone before the
19:04 stuffs gonna have any place to go so
19:07 what's that tell us that tells us that
19:10 the universe is not equally dense the
19:13 universe has very dense areas which
19:15 would be like a Sun and Earth a moon and
19:17 then it has very sparse areas which
19:20 would be what NASA refers to as the
19:22 vacuum of space which is absolutely not
19:25 a vacuum it might be a vacuum of beanie
19:28 babies but it's not a vacuum of atomic
19:30 mass but why is the the little funnel in
19:35 the lake making a little tornado down to
19:38 wherever the hell it's going because
19:41 relative to the ball that were on that
19:44 is fairly large for our size and
19:46 proportion to our size the ether winds
19:49 are pushing in the earth is blocking
19:53 everything that would be pushing up any
19:55 significant amount that would be
19:56 penetrating the plasma ball that's at
19:58 the center of the earth and so that
20:01 funnel goes down that does it in your
20:04 sink it does it in your tub does it in
20:06 the ocean
20:08 all right but if you were to subtract
20:11 that there will never be at the ether
20:14 oil level let's just say any disturbance
20:18 in this sort of Mardi Gras crowd problem
20:21 you know your Dodger Stadium on 4th of
20:24 July game when everything lets out and
20:26 there was a hundred thousand people in
20:27 that place we flow we flow we bump into
20:32 each other now if you were to take out
20:34 the conscious mind out of a particle and
20:36 just let them bang into each other and
20:38 it's all just ricocheting physics that's
20:41 where you start getting these vortexes
20:42 but in a zero gravity let's say zero
20:46 relativity gravity section where you
20:47 don't have something next to it pulling
20:49 it down this tornado thing starts
20:53 turning it into a sphere because
20:55 nothing's yanking it down to be a little
20:56 cone a conical drain if you will this is
21:03 how you get the most fundamental
21:05 grouping of ether particles but as it is
21:11 above so too is a below and as it is
21:13 below so too it is above right that's
21:16 the equation that's both sides of the
21:17 equation if a equals B then you could
21:21 actually write equals a on the other
21:23 side it's all the same thing gravity is
21:28 being explained in my opinion in a very
21:32 silly way within some of the Flat Earth
21:35 situations if flat earth is true and it
21:40 very well could be
21:41 then we're in some wild situation here
21:45 were in you know we could be again a
21:47 contact lens on top of a gigantic ball
21:51 if it's some other planet like the
21:53 Truman Show right the Truman Show it was
21:55 a small town that was in the in the
21:58 movie but it could have been as big as
22:00 the earth disc and again I flew to
22:04 Sydney I didn't take 24 36 hours to get
22:06 there I think it was about a 12-hour
22:10 flight on the disc model I would have
22:13 travelled a lot further the thing is
22:17 this I'm going to pause here for one
22:18 second
22:20 if you've gone down the road of the Flat
22:22 Earth model and let's just say it's not
22:25 true
22:26 and someone can prove it later on a year
22:30 from now whatever there is that
22:32 miraculous NASA mission that we're
22:34 actually all on the same page with okay
22:37 the problem is is that the level of
22:41 credibility that you might lose when it
22:44 gets proven to be absolutely incorrect
22:47 might be devastating and I think you
22:52 deserve a chance
22:53 obviously infinitely to be rewarded for
22:57 being curious and to be rewarded for
22:59 being a believer even for for the lack
23:03 of evidence to prove you wrong you can
23:08 still be right but gravity could still
23:10 work the way that I'm telling you it
23:13 works and I'm not trying to be correct
23:15 myself and you're and trying to make you
23:17 wrong trust me it's not as nuts of you
23:25 saw Dark City you know what I'm talking
23:27 about those of you may have seen true
23:31 and show and then you just pull that
23:33 thing into some space I always think
23:37 that things are done for a reason the
23:40 whole firmament dome theory is that God
23:42 is really really close to us and he's
23:44 really really working with us although
23:48 he's obviously letting a bunch of douche
23:50 bags on the planet but who knows how he
23:52 works right so that it is there has to
23:59 be a way for you guys to accept both
24:01 sides of the fence and simply say well
24:04 if I'm not in this matrix see God place
24:06 which is really what the dome would be
24:09 then I must be in this other
24:11 heliocentric thing it doesn't mean nASA
24:13 has done anything related to going to
24:16 the moon but can't seem to produce a
24:18 picture of the Earth from space that
24:19 isn't a composite so I'm not wrong in
24:23 doubting these space agencies and
24:25 calling them into question and I'm not a
24:28 jerk for willing to examine the Flat
24:32 Earth model as
24:33 if it were totally true and you're not a
24:37 jerk if you believed it for five years
24:38 ten years again we don't have proof of
24:42 either side of the game but you know
24:45 again I think that the the proof that it
24:47 is flat is really poorly represented
24:50 when you see images portraying the flat
24:55 ocean out there I can I live right next
24:57 to the ocean man I see it all the time
24:59 you see a flat ocean graphic and then
25:02 they say okay on a ball what we're
25:04 supposed to believe is that the oceans
25:06 actually round around a ball answer yeah
25:11 it is it is and again you got to be 80
25:14 miles in the air before you're gonna see
25:15 that ocean out there starting to do a
25:17 curve at least okay so if you could just
25:23 do the math on that in your brain the
25:25 rods and cones in your eyes are not
25:27 dense enough to see any curvature out
25:28 there at our tiny six-foot size to a to
25:32 an 8,000 mile wide ball roughly so
25:36 you're gonna have to go way up in the
25:38 air to see it and a plane is not high
25:39 enough and 165 thousand foot weather
25:43 balloons not high enough it's not high
25:44 enough I know that's frustrating I mean
25:47 isn't it frustrating you can't easily go
25:49 up enough to see the curvature of the
25:51 earth but don't blame the entire model
25:53 of the universe for that difficulty the
25:59 man ain't keeping you down from seeing
26:02 the curvature of the earth it's just a
26:04 difficult physical thing to do and again
26:08 if we were like gigantic creatures if we
26:10 were like 200 mile or 200 foot tall
26:13 beings then we would have biological
26:15 problems existing on this planet right
26:18 and so we are the size that we are
26:21 because we are proportional to the size
26:23 of this planet what things are much
26:27 larger than us well there's a few
26:29 creatures in in the jungle there's a
26:33 couple you know gorillas out there that
26:35 can get a little bit little bit bigger
26:36 than us but the biggest things are
26:38 things that live in this sort of rat
26:40 relative gravity bubble called the ocean
26:42 and so a whale can get gigantic because
26:46 a whale has all kind
26:47 the pressure on all sides that's why
26:50 when a whale gets out of the ocean it
26:52 starts to crush itself so if we were
26:57 aquatic human beings could probably get
26:59 as big as a you know humpback whale but
27:04 let me just connect some more dots here
27:07 so you pour yourself your favorite
27:09 bubbly beverage whatever that is and you
27:13 should do this if you're you know
27:15 feeling a little angst from what I'm
27:17 saying hopefully you don't hopefully you
27:20 feel well respected but beer champagne
27:24 soda water whatever get in a nice clear
27:27 big glass and just sit there without
27:30 anyone bothering you and stare at the
27:33 bubbles just stare at them and stare at
27:36 them and stare at them give yourself a
27:37 good half-hour plus and just ask
27:40 yourself how those things are existing
27:43 in water how is that happening now once
27:48 you're done with that exercise and
27:50 you've totally exhausted I don't care if
27:51 you sit there for eight hours just look
27:55 at it until you accept that nothing
27:57 around you a Rothschild at Windsor up a
28:00 sewer is not telling that bubble to be
28:02 round it's not a Masonic Lodge it's
28:04 telling you to be round or some Jesuit
28:07 Church branch it's the universe telling
28:09 it to be round there's no conspiracy
28:12 around the shape of a bubble you know
28:17 we've we think that all these
28:18 organizations have lied to us about the
28:20 shape of the earth
28:22 okay well the bubble isn't being lied
28:25 about you can see the Sun it's round you
28:29 can see the moon it's round if you give
28:30 it ten thousand pounds or ten thousand
28:33 power excuse me Philippe up ten thousand
28:35 pound
28:36 telescope you can see a planet out there
28:39 Jupiter at least one of our listeners
28:44 took her son's photographs that he took
28:46 a Jupiter and posted it I loved it now
28:51 while you're where you are get your cell
28:53 phone out of your nearest internet
28:55 device
28:56 do you prefer to read on and I want you
28:59 to look up how electricity behaves like
29:03 water just read a few like sort of intro
29:08 one-on-one articles about how
29:09 electricity works and there'll be this
29:13 epiphany hopefully that oh my god the
29:17 electronic valence the conductive
29:19 surface of a particular conductive
29:21 material flows a bit like water the more
29:26 surface you have on a wire the more
29:28 amperage you can get out of it the per
29:30 unit per second amount of power that's
29:33 being transmitted down a wire well you
29:39 know if I had a hose here which I do but
29:44 I have to push water in the back of the
29:46 hose to push water out the front of the
29:47 hose when someone turns off the hose and
29:50 you've got like 20 foot all wound up in
29:52 your front yard as you water your lawn
29:56 it just goes a little bit of leak out
29:59 and you can kind of step on the hose to
30:00 get a little bit come up with your
30:01 introducing pressure to push stuff out
30:03 do you know if someone turns it back on
30:05 Kapow here comes the water well that's
30:09 exactly why your power outlet in your
30:11 house doesn't sit there zapping
30:13 everybody who walks by it but you know
30:16 the second you plug in an appliance POW
30:19 here comes the electricity if those of
30:22 you work those of you who have worked in
30:24 industrial parks you know you've got 280
30:27 outlets I mean you've got all kinds of
30:29 massive power that will kill you in a
30:32 second if you happen to draw it across
30:34 your heart what this illustrates is a
30:37 congruent nature of how all things work
30:40 in the universe and of course this stick
30:43 has a nice tunnel down the center never
30:46 so slight so as you look at these memes
30:48 and these beautiful 3d animated videos
30:51 of you know things falling off the
30:54 bottom of the earth and then that hurts
30:59 the brain think about the bubbles
31:03 if you were to stand on the bubble
31:08 shrink yourself down to a little
31:10 molecule and you were to get down in
31:12 there inside your beer or whatever and
31:14 you stand on the bottom of that bubble
31:17 you would be shocked to find out you
31:19 could if you were small enough
31:23 unfortunately the gravitational ability
31:25 for my body to hang on to heat is waning
31:28 with this overcast day but now let me
31:32 give you a little tidbit here that might
31:35 be exciting for you now let's say this
31:39 you when you first got introduced to
31:42 this flatter thing was extremely
31:45 exciting because you felt yourself and
31:47 sort of this epiphany mode and there was
31:51 something glorious about it perhaps if
31:53 you're religious it made things make
31:56 more sense perhaps you had lost your
31:57 religion and you got into it and you
31:59 rediscovered your religion getting
32:01 closer to God is always a good thing no
32:04 matter how you do it in my opinion so
32:07 now maybe one of the psychoses that we
32:10 might be introducing to ourselves would
32:12 be well damn if I'm wrong and I've
32:16 posted literally a thousand posts all
32:19 over the world that it's flat and then I
32:21 find out and it actually is a globe okay
32:24 then you might be resisting any change
32:27 back to a previous theory although we're
32:30 gonna get to something cool here
32:31 and so you just kind of double down on
32:34 it and again if you're new to this if
32:37 you're new to Flat Earth and you're new
32:39 to this notion that gravity isn't what
32:41 they said it was which it isn't what
32:43 they say it is because again the
32:45 official story is that mass pulls on
32:47 mass that doesn't happen
32:49 there could be tangling frequencies that
32:52 could intertwine know that that does
32:54 happen static electricity pulls on
32:57 things because it's created this sort of
33:00 a way to explain it would be sort of a
33:03 velcro frequency where there's a way of
33:09 vibrating and catching other particles
33:11 in the vibration again once you have a
33:13 pole that goes around and around like a
33:16 magnet
33:17 a magnet pulls on steel that is because
33:21 the magnet has an e Thurl inability to
33:25 hang on to all of its integral mass and
33:29 so it has these poles and so then it
33:31 literally digs its fingernails into
33:35 steel and Yanks it to towards itself and
33:40 technically speaking the way that your
33:41 solar system works could have a little
33:43 bit of that magnetism
33:45 property to it as well but now let's
33:50 offer you something different that it's
33:55 it seems like the only option is is that
33:57 you believe it's flatter you believe
33:58 it's round you either go with NASA or
34:01 you go with this new movement which is
34:04 actually a really old way of believing
34:05 that the world was put together okay
34:10 well what if you go to a third place and
34:14 you go stand over there with Tesla you
34:18 go stand over there with Volta ohm
34:21 Faraday Steinmetz all these dudes you
34:24 stand over there with all these uber
34:26 geniuses and that's the third place you
34:28 can go where you don't have to stand
34:29 next to some Masonic apron wearing dew
34:35 shoes lying to the world about
34:36 everything so what's interesting about
34:41 that is you go from the world being flat
34:44 over to a place where it's round again
34:46 but the almost every single thing you've
34:50 been told about how everything works in
34:51 terms of electromagnetism and ether and
34:55 gravity is totally different except that
35:01 that angsty place you lived where you
35:04 were trying to prove the world was flat
35:05 but there's just no way to do it again
35:09 where the [ __ ] is the you know the trip
35:11 to the Antarctica to the you know to the
35:14 wall why isn't someone been able to pull
35:16 that off I know it's not easy but Jesus
35:19 we got billionaires who believe this
35:20 thing work it out man work it out
35:24 I know it's a formidable place trust me
35:28 but you pull out of that world and you
35:30 go to a place where you can prove
35:31 everything because these guys invented
35:34 these guys I love that this group of
35:37 people discovered electricity discovered
35:43 ether moving 50 times faster than the
35:45 speed of light and then they invented a
35:46 ton of crap that took advantage of it
35:48 and what's funny is we now assume and I
35:53 know it sounds nuts but we now assume
35:56 through examining the pyramids on the
35:58 Giza Plateau
35:59 but those freaking things were batteries
36:02 big giant power stations using the
36:05 plateau which is the catacomb of water
36:08 using the aqua ravine that's down below
36:10 naturally bringing up the Earth's plasma
36:12 core to energize whatever's above
36:15 probably a meridian line underneath that
36:17 where there's a natural crack underneath
36:19 that aqua ravine at least back in the
36:24 day when they were building the pyramids
36:25 in the first place
36:26 there might have been a huge adjustment
36:28 to the way that the world worked now the
36:32 one thing that we really don't have a
36:35 bead on you're gonna people say they do
36:38 I don't think we do which is how fast is
36:40 this world change meaning the physical
36:42 crust of the world you know there's Neil
36:46 Adams expanding Earth theory which I
36:48 wholeheartedly believe in I don't know
36:50 that we know how fast it actually
36:52 changes but you have all kinds of wild
36:55 studies one you know one group of folks
36:57 have studied expanding earth and you
37:00 know the 19 centimeters are yeah 19
37:02 centimeters it expands a year nowadays
37:05 and they reverse-engineer it
37:07 you have to the point where it's 1/4 the
37:10 size during some proverbial you know
37:12 fake dinosaur era and then you have the
37:17 the German scientists that studied the
37:20 salt concentration in the ocean and they
37:24 came out and said look man I don't think
37:26 these oceans are more than about 65
37:28 million years old because if you go back
37:30 its losses more and more of its density
37:35 so what are we trying to do with this
37:37 whole you know flat earth thing in the
37:39 first place with the truth movement with
37:41 all the agendas
37:43 for the very real bad politician bad
37:47 banker bad monarch world that we're
37:50 living in here the subtext of the whole
37:53 Flat Earth thing is that these people
37:55 have lied to you and got you to divorce
37:57 the true model of the earth five hundred
38:00 years ago and so you're fighting to
38:02 restore that old model alright but what
38:07 if you could go off to this third group
38:08 and then you've got undeniable proof of
38:14 the way things work you can go back to
38:17 the pyramids and have undeniable proof
38:20 you know if you listen to the the
38:24 electro the electrical engineers that
38:28 look at the pyramids and study the the
38:31 conductive nosov the lime stones that
38:33 are in the center versus the lime stones
38:35 on the outside versus the red granite
38:37 that makes up the corridors this starts
38:41 to become extremely undeniable that the
38:44 effect of this place would be generating
38:45 a tremendous amount of electricity the
38:48 archaeologists back in the 30s the 1930s
38:50 who was on top of the one of the
38:54 pyramids and he was eating lunch with
38:57 all of his workers and he noticed that
38:59 all of the utensils started sparking
39:01 real badly and so he got this idea real
39:03 quick he created a Baghdad battery using
39:06 a bottle of wine that wasn't quite full
39:08 but sit he putted a cloth on the top
39:12 jammed a fork down it or some knife or
39:14 something and then held it up in the air
39:15 on the tip of the pyramid and within a
39:20 few seconds it zapped an arc off the
39:23 bottle in hit a worker who was eating
39:27 his lunch and he fell down at least a
39:28 step or two and they started trying to
39:31 attack the guy because he said he was
39:32 engaging in witchcraft all he did was
39:36 realize the place is a gigantic power
39:38 station and then in an infinitesimally
39:42 with the fork and this gigantic pyramid
39:45 scraping all of this electromagnetic
39:48 waves out of ether all collisions with
39:50 the limestone itself they were able to I
39:54 mean the stones incubate up
39:57 electric and magnetism waves which then
39:59 collide and make electricity and he's up
40:02 there with an extremely conductive piece
40:03 of metal I guess it's not quite a
40:06 Baghdad battery I shouldn't say that but
40:10 he created a little arcing mechanism
40:17 it's beautiful
40:20 so again if you need to retreat
40:23 potentially and you can make this a very
40:24 slow migration in your own mind and
40:26 again no one is on earth that as part of
40:29 this awakening is going to not continue
40:34 to examine this Flat Earth suggestion
40:40 hey we're waiting for someone to prove
40:42 something we're waiting to see a
40:44 gyroscope not change when you fly from
40:47 London to Cairo haven't seen it heard
40:50 plenty of people say that that's the
40:52 case we've heard all these Navy folks
40:54 and you know artillery guises say that
40:57 the the Coriolis effect is not something
41:00 that they ever you know counteract
41:03 meaning the curvature of the earth they
41:04 don't ever factor that into anything
41:06 even though that's what you're told
41:08 you've got snipers that are supposedly
41:10 making adjustments for this but then
41:12 they say they don't I'm not sure a
41:14 projectile out of a gun is ever gonna
41:17 need to have any any correction for
41:20 curvature but even back in Desert Storm
41:24 in 1991 the m1 Abrams tank could shoot
41:30 these guys for 15 miles away now you're
41:33 starting to get into maybe some
41:34 curvature calculations but these guys
41:38 say they don't we have you know
41:41 experiments that basically say the
41:44 curvature is seems like it's there but
41:47 it's minut compared to what they say it
41:50 is which is where you sort of get that
41:51 theory of a contact lens truman show
41:53 container on top of a much bigger ball
41:56 but then how do you explain the Sun in
41:58 the moon but let me throw this at you
42:04 what if those that run the world started
42:09 examining this internet thing started
42:13 examining imagine they have all the
42:15 truth about as much as man has ever dug
42:18 out of the ground for history of
42:20 pre-existing civilizations their own
42:22 civilizations science science science
42:25 applying quotes let's say that they know
42:28 everything they know it is ether they
42:30 know it is all these other things and
42:31 they've got a strung-out on oil
42:33 they've suppress all zero-point energy
42:35 machines they have kept us from
42:39 understanding how the world expands
42:40 because that leads you to understand how
42:42 crude oil is a byproduct of the Earth's
42:44 existence has nothing to do with
42:46 prehistoric matter deteriorating yes
42:50 mass turns back into combustible methane
42:53 that's because it was originally created
42:54 from those fundamental particles but
42:57 that has nothing to do without crude oil
42:59 is created at the center of the earth
43:00 not the center of the earth but the
43:02 crust of the earth just on the edge of
43:04 the plasma sphere it's inside and so
43:09 what they do is they say okay we're
43:11 going to have a huge problem here
43:12 because everyone's waking up and they're
43:15 waking up fast what we need to do is to
43:21 do what they do to you know these key
43:23 witnesses in court now what has been the
43:27 case in court a million times
43:29 someone is conducting a crime a scam and
43:33 it's been going for a long time perhaps
43:35 the politicians getting bribed perhaps
43:37 somebody's selling drugs in your
43:39 neighborhood or whatever the scam is
43:41 well you and I who don't break the law
43:44 we don't see these things happening
43:46 because we're not involved in those
43:47 circles we're not invited in we've never
43:50 lived shady life and so we never see it
43:53 so when they have a witness come in
43:55 against a mob boss who has been close
43:58 enough to see the scam they know who's
44:00 involved in what they do they go into
44:02 court and then you have a mob boss who's
44:06 almost bonafide criminal organized crime
44:10 and you have a person who's far less of
44:13 a criminal trying to whistle
44:17 blow on this hefty asset and so the
44:22 attorneys the Prada the defense
44:25 attorneys start to attack the
44:26 credibility of this informant by saying
44:29 look this person's a prostitute this
44:31 purse is a drug dealers persons a killer
44:33 don't believe anything that they say and
44:36 the juries just kind of left out there
44:39 on their own to siphon through decipher
44:42 through all of the facts to see if they
44:44 believe a little bit of what that person
44:46 says see if there's a motive against
44:48 that person and you know sadly you know
44:52 in some circumstances you like the
44:54 Michael Jackson accusations you do have
44:55 a whole family that's been trained to
44:57 lie so there's a bit of a problem there
44:59 but committing crimes and lying you know
45:01 sometimes they go in and in sometimes
45:03 they don't but now what if you are the
45:07 witness to the lies you have enough
45:10 intelligence to realize that NASA hasn't
45:12 done anything that they've said within
45:13 reason that science is completely off
45:17 center the big bang's crap Dark Matters
45:19 crap black holes are crap because
45:22 they've got the one they have the entire
45:24 definition of gravity reversed they're
45:26 saying it's a pole we know that the
45:30 geniuses of the universe said it was a
45:31 push and so they put out these alternate
45:36 theories and not just Flat Earth but
45:39 everything that exists out there to see
45:44 if gullible sweet people well somehow
45:48 adopt it and start preaching it such
45:52 that when those same people find all the
45:55 other conspiracies that have a lot of
45:57 validity now they can pull you into
46:00 court I mean let's say you're an expert
46:03 on everything they've ever said about
46:04 Flat Earth and you're a believer but you
46:08 also know everything about fiat currency
46:11 about fractional reserve banking about
46:15 child trafficking child molestation all
46:17 these things you're an expert on all
46:19 these conspiracies but you've posted a
46:22 ton of stuff about this Flat Earth thing
46:24 well they bring you into court this is
46:27 really social medias platform at a in a
46:30 court of law
46:31 they see that person over there they
46:33 said that we're a bunch of child
46:34 molesters
46:35 they say that we use Red Cross to
46:38 launder money around the world and these
46:40 kids keep disappearing at all these
46:42 disasters and they find them in buses
46:45 you know owned and operated by the
46:47 Hilary Foundation all these real things
46:50 that need to stop but there you go
46:51 they believe the world is flat and then
46:57 you're subtracted out of the equation of
46:59 potentially affecting any change in the
47:01 universe your family could just do this
47:04 without a trial they could just simply
47:06 say yeah we got an uncle that believes
47:07 in the world's flag can you believe that
47:09 [ __ ] and he also believes Lee Harvey
47:12 Oswald wasn't the one that shot JFK and
47:14 he also believes this and that and this
47:16 and that and this
47:17 well you're erased as being a useful
47:20 asset in the Great Awakening this is a
47:24 big deal I think it would be ingenious
47:28 to create all these alternate theories
47:30 and help accentuate it even as an
47:34 intelligence agency you're putting out
47:36 assets that are going to claim to be
47:39 former employees of NASA claimed to have
47:42 been at tables where people said oh no
47:45 we're the world's flat and you're gonna
47:46 run into the disc and it's gonna be ha
47:48 ha whoo like that one guy that's a
47:51 comedian and the artists I don't mean to
47:54 pick on that guy but let's just say he
47:55 was inserted into the narrative and he
47:58 runs around doing a comedy bit in these
48:00 these little bars pointing at the
48:04 pictures and showing how it's all fake
48:06 and maybe NASA has created those fake
48:08 assets but then you link that guy to
48:10 some other crazy eye now the sudden NASA
48:12 looks like they're not lying because the
48:15 guy that exposed the lies of NASA is
48:17 fully compromised in a different way the
48:20 name of the game is to keep your
48:22 integrity as high as possible such that
48:26 you know you could say like people ask
48:29 me like I said do you guys the other day
48:30 I had a good friend of mine look at me
48:33 at during lunch and we're not talking
48:35 about anything major conspiratorial and
48:38 he said what do you think about this
48:39 flat earth day and you know the way he
48:43 asked me I should say if you were there
48:45 I think you would know that he was he
48:52 had been down the rabbit hole a little
48:53 bit and he didn't say these crazy
48:56 bastards that believe the world is flat
48:58 he didn't say it like that at all he
48:59 said it quite neutral as if he has a few
49:02 for his own toes in that pool and let's
49:06 just be honest with ourselves there's a
49:10 bit of us that thinks it would be
49:11 exciting to find out it's a it's a dumb
49:16 I would find that so utterly
49:20 science-fiction unbelievable and
49:24 exciting I mean wow there's a whole
49:26 other frontier on the other side of this
49:28 barrier of ice potentially there's a
49:31 glass dome potentially there's a bunch
49:33 of continents on the other side and you
49:35 get to meet a whole bunch of new people
49:36 go to these new continents these new
49:38 cities you could eat new food you could
49:40 see new forms of entertainment new
49:42 space-age technology I mean jeez it's
49:45 not exciting
49:46 I mean seriously there's motivation to
49:47 to get into this unfortunately most of
49:53 the theories about what is actually at
49:54 the wall or where the wall would be
49:57 there the probably the least defined
50:00 areas of the conspiracy itself but what
50:04 are they telling us about you know
50:06 what's on the other side of a dome water
50:10 okay well we had these things called
50:12 stars whatever the hell they are and
50:15 they don't wobble like a big giant
50:18 refracting pool of water so apparently
50:23 that wandering this side is still
50:26 there's absolutely no variant in its
50:28 density and I mean it is the most
50:30 perfect still pool ever created in the
50:34 universe and but we have this stuff
50:35 moving around up inside that area
50:37 potentially my other concern about not
50:41 understanding gravity as it's been
50:43 defined by the geniuses that discovered
50:47 all of electricity at least in the
50:49 modern age right we have to give
50:50 Egyptians a potential of having figured
50:53 it out how much of well how much change
50:58 an invention and innovation could exist
51:02 if we truly understand stood how the
51:04 universe is put together I'm thinking
51:08 the whole next era of mankind could be
51:12 completely understood what if you
51:16 believed in Flat Earth but you also
51:17 believed in aliens from outer space okay
51:21 well then where did they come from oh we
51:23 have to we have to default to
51:24 interdimensional theories we have to
51:26 think about it as a hard Dome on the
51:30 other side it's not water it's actually
51:31 some place and they just open a side
51:36 door and come flying in and they close
51:38 the side door and they leave it is sort
51:41 of my belief personally at this stage of
51:43 my life that if you believe in aliens
51:45 then you do adopt the heliocentric ball
51:48 again you do not have to adopt any of
51:52 the sort of mainstream science out there
51:55 that tells you how it all works you
51:57 could reject nearly all of it because I
52:00 think there's plenty evidence that to
52:02 suggest that that's the case that it's
52:05 untrue now it used to be that we would
52:08 think of things and get things wrong but
52:10 we were trying to get it right and so we
52:14 had these theories about the world being
52:16 on the back of a turtle all right that's
52:18 someone trying to explain something they
52:20 don't understand right so they're doing
52:21 their best ok but now we know by close
52:26 observation that those groups that I
52:30 keep mentioning in this video they have
52:33 a policy to reverse and invert
52:36 everything that is true the bad guys are
52:40 the good guys the good guys are the bad
52:41 guys if gravity is a push they have to
52:44 say it's a pull and then to further
52:47 sustain their absurd theories because
52:50 they eventually find you know they it's
52:52 not hard to believe once you figure out
52:54 ether works and negative pressure works
52:55 the whole bodies together in space it's
52:58 very easy to understand a child could
53:00 understand it so they have to put more
53:05 sort of paper weights on top of this
53:08 ridiculous theory to further make it
53:11 absurd
53:13 when I you know used to go into my whole
53:15 thing about the the non-existence of you
53:19 know mythical saviors in organized
53:22 religion on earth the followers that
53:25 have a bit of an ink stood a bring in
53:28 their Bibles or their whatever as paper
53:33 weights on top of their own theory and
53:35 so they have a self defining self
53:37 validating mechanism to say no no you
53:41 don't understand our mythical fiction
53:45 our book will tell you why our book is
53:49 true well what do you think organized
53:53 science is doing we think neil degrasse
53:55 tyson's entire job is whether he
53:58 realizes that or not Hawking's job you
54:03 know I think Hawking was a kid who grew
54:04 up inside of all this indoctrination and
54:07 became extremely clever about keeping
54:10 the indoctrination going there having no
54:12 idea that he was completely wrong by I
54:15 think it's his second book black holes
54:17 and baby universes there's that line at
54:19 the end of a paragraph that says that he
54:22 really no longer believed that the Big
54:24 Bang necessarily occurred and then his
54:29 next book was all dedicated how the Big
54:31 Bang was true was sort of a big spanking
54:33 on his hand how dare you threaten the
54:37 very integrity of Cambridge University
54:39 by saying that you know your celebrated
54:43 PhD work in the Big Bang is fake we just
54:47 spent you know 30 years trying to prove
54:49 this is true your next book is gonna be
54:52 about your apology to mankind but you're
54:55 not going to say you're sorry you're
54:56 just going to do your damnedest to make
54:58 all this true this is our control
55:01 mechanism on humanity they cannot find
55:03 out how this works
55:05 because it'll lead to all this self
55:07 empowerment that the society could have
55:10 I truly believe as primitive as some of
55:16 these tribes are in Africa if they were
55:18 to have some things explained use
55:20 there's always some genius and wherever
55:21 you are and in the
55:23 world you know they're trying to create
55:25 a space program over there
55:27 some of these guys could probably create
55:29 a perpetual motion machine slash the
55:32 zero point energy mechanism to create
55:33 infinite power to take a little bit of
55:35 power and create way more than you put
55:37 in they could figure it out they can
55:39 figure out what Stan Myers figured out
55:41 either completely by themselves or by
55:43 doing research on Stan Myers looking at
55:45 his schematics watching the specials
55:48 that diab you skate his schematics so
55:50 you can understand how it works and they
55:53 could have it and all sudden Africa is
55:55 producing a massive amount of
55:56 electricity as much as they need and
55:59 once you can do that you can turn on
56:00 machines you could turn on lights you
56:02 can fuel hospitals and all sudden they
56:04 get a lot more healthy and once they
56:06 stop you know fighting among themselves
56:08 once the Warlord's are pulled out of
56:11 power because the people are like yeah
56:12 yeah you and your [ __ ] Jenna Seidel
56:15 battle that the IMF and the World Bank
56:18 is paying you to conduct on each other
56:20 we're not going to be in your army
56:22 anymore because you know why this
56:24 zero-point energy system is we're like
56:27 two days away from having anti-gravity
56:29 and we're gonna we're either gonna leave
56:33 or we're going to take over this planet
56:34 I hope you feel me on this right what I
56:40 don't see personally is any connection
56:42 whatsoever with Flat Earth and the
56:45 denial of gravity I don't get it
56:47 why is gravity having to take one on the
56:50 chin just because you believe that we're
56:54 in some celestial God based don't
56:57 doesn't make any sense to me the bubble
57:01 still occurs inside the dump and so the
57:04 forces and the physics that make a
57:06 bubble happen is the exact same thing
57:08 that holds all heliocentric model
57:10 together it's beautiful it's potentially
57:14 infinite in terms of our measurement of
57:17 space and time
57:18 it even explains a lot of the absurdity
57:21 coming out of the official science
57:23 realms doesn't you know it negates a
57:26 bunch of the stuff I always say but in
57:28 terms of gravity waves well of course we
57:32 know this universe is not equally dense
57:35 because we have
57:37 me right here and then there's this
57:39 space between me and the camera you can
57:41 see me because the lens is able to
57:42 reflect light off of me this is just
57:45 waves of ether bouncing around so
57:49 quickly that it looks like what we call
57:51 a photon but now let's look into the
57:55 future let's say that we go the distance
57:57 with this whole thing we do pop out of
58:01 this this total absolute theory of Flat
58:08 Earth and we just leave it there and
58:09 there's gonna be people that are gonna
58:11 research it you may continue to research
58:13 it but you go off to this third group
58:15 you're no longer in the heliocentric
58:17 pole gravity you're in the push gravity
58:20 model over there with all the geniuses
58:21 that have ever lived in the last hundred
58:23 50 years I guess technically but about a
58:26 hundred seventy years okay let me tell
58:33 you a story about when the Mormons come
58:35 to visit me at my house they come over
58:38 ring the doorbell and typically they've
58:41 been sitting me females lately so they
58:43 can't be in my house without a female in
58:44 the house I pull my hair to the patio
58:46 pull out the chairs we sit and talk it's
58:49 pretty much the same thing their whole
58:52 mission is to get you baptized and they
58:55 again say that any baptized baptism you
58:57 had prior to their baptism is an
58:59 unauthorized baptism of course which is
59:01 the control apparatus of all religions
59:03 right but these kids are like 19 to 21
59:07 somewhere in there so you just kind of
59:11 go they mean well they mean me a lot of
59:13 well but a good I should say but then
59:17 I'm pretty honest with them about my
59:19 lack of belief that the Savior that's
59:22 part of that organized religion because
59:26 they have two saviors right they have
59:27 Christ and they have Joseph Smith and I
59:31 tell them that obviously I don't believe
59:34 Jesus ever existed and Joseph Smith well
59:37 I don't know he's a complex story okay
59:43 now their whole thing is to genuinely
59:45 believe that my soul is in jeopardy that
59:48 if I go to the other side the other
59:50 without a belief a devout belief that
59:53 Christ is my Savior bla bla bla that
59:55 somehow I'm going to some [ __ ] ok
60:00 what I have said for last 10 years
60:02 because I never had to say before I
60:04 never did think it through was simps
60:05 essentially this if I get to the other
60:08 side and Christ is on the other side
60:11 again I don't think there's any
60:13 penalties for having critical thinking
60:15 so I don't think there's any punishment
60:16 for using logic just like Hopson said
60:19 you know I want to believe but Jesus you
60:23 know we're around ok and again the faith
60:27 that someone had to have in the
60:29 proverbial Christ era is zero they got
60:32 to meet God so they get a free pass to
60:35 heaven whereas we have to use this faith
60:38 base there's no God talking to us
60:40 telling us to kill our children to prove
60:42 our you know loyalty to the dude what an
60:45 [ __ ] that guy is in that story but
60:49 you get to this side and you find out
60:50 it's all true all right
60:52 so you high-five Christ say man you know
60:56 I I didn't believe right yeah totally my
61:00 god you know it's just a process we had
61:02 to let the Satan take over the earth
61:03 before we'd have a reason to have a
61:05 Judgment Day it's a little kooky story
61:07 dad came up with but whatever all right
61:09 bye 5 I'll see you later man yeah cool
61:11 you going to the party night yeah ok
61:15 the After Hours Judgment Day party I
61:19 tell you that story because that's the
61:21 way you would believe if you left this
61:23 total absolute truth flat earth movement
61:26 you don't say it's wrong necessarily
61:29 because you don't have enough proof
61:30 that's necessarily neither do the NASA
61:33 i'ts right so you go over to this third
61:36 group and you say you know what I'm
61:37 going to lease it in a pool of truth
61:38 over here because I don't have to be s
61:41 myself about how it works and it's
61:42 important that you I think each
61:45 individual of the world male female
61:47 young old middle-aged whatever gets into
61:49 this third group which is the initial
61:51 group I may be actually not maybe it's
61:54 not that it's chronologically it's by
61:55 the last group to exist on me the liars
61:58 are the last one to be made probably but
62:02 I want you over there because
62:04 there are inventions to be had by
62:06 understanding that group over there
62:08 the original discoverers of the modern
62:11 age electricity what if the Egyptians
62:15 really did have power plants and those
62:17 were the pyramids and they had you know
62:19 Jesus they've got hundreds and hundreds
62:21 of them and there's a bunch of them all
62:22 over the world it's not like they had
62:24 the only game in town maybe they were
62:25 the first group in town they migrated
62:27 around the world and through inbreeding
62:30 of you know one guy looked a different
62:33 way and he and bred that and ate the
62:35 fruit and vegetables and animals over
62:37 there and so they ended up looking like
62:38 South American people and then one of
62:40 one to Asia and had a different look and
62:43 whatever but through just sheer
62:46 dominance some Genghis Khan algorithm
62:49 going over and over and over Rome
62:50 destroying things they essentially had
62:53 their beautiful utopia of advanced
62:56 technology ripped out of their hands and
62:59 thus lost again we don't have
63:02 hieroglyphs for how the pyramids were
63:04 built but we have hieroglyphs for how
63:08 you go to heaven how they embalm you
63:10 what's gonna be like in the afterlife
63:13 okay so these people were capable of
63:16 rendering any image they could think of
63:18 in their brain they have sculptures that
63:20 are absolutely perfect to a human face
63:23 geometrically so perfect we don't even
63:25 know how they made them all right
63:29 wouldn't you want to get closer to that
63:31 essence that beautiful simplicity that
63:34 it seems that they lived in but bring it
63:39 back in the modern age if an
63:42 intelligence agency is simply incubating
63:44 up these alternate theories and it's not
63:48 just flat earth man it's every alternate
63:50 theory of everything Jacqueline Kennedy
63:53 Shaw JFK
63:54 anything to preoccupy your mind away
63:57 from legitimate progress then you let
64:02 them win and we lose as a human race
64:06 think about how many stories movies
64:09 television shows that wouldn't exist if
64:11 we hadn't theorized that the world was a
64:14 ball and that we're in this gigantic
64:17 place called the universe and that you
64:19 know there's similarities between all
64:21 celestial bodies and eventually we can
64:23 build craft to escape our planet travel
64:27 the universe what if that had never
64:31 happened I don't know about you but I
64:33 dig Star Wars Star Trek all the other
64:36 science fiction space travel shows that
64:38 have ever existed there's a whole bunch
64:42 of goodness that happened once we
64:43 started finding out that perhaps or not
64:46 at the center of the universe and it's
64:47 not to make man insignificant whatsoever
64:49 if anything it shows how unbelievably
64:52 remarkable we are as a sentient being a
64:56 bacteria that gains such power in his
64:59 own realization self realization that we
65:02 could build a craft a mechanical device
65:05 to traverse the area of which we are
65:08 which is the universe and perhaps find
65:10 other humanoids other creatures out
65:13 there that have superior intelligence
65:15 equal intelligence less intelligence and
65:17 start having a dialogue with really the
65:21 full gamut of what a creator might have
65:23 invested in and if it's all completely
65:26 random and we're all just one being well
65:30 and you get to learn about that you're
65:31 essentially combing over the
65:33 fingerprints of the universe and how it
65:37 was created what I'm trying to do is
65:40 work from empirical evidence that is
65:43 provable observable and provable so are
65:48 you in the flat earth realm you go and
65:50 you look at an ocean you see a body of
65:52 water that's flat you see a lake this
65:54 flat and so I understand the passion of
65:57 saying look look look you know you're
66:01 the one that's in denial about this
66:03 whole thing I don't see curvature and
66:06 then as I'm like solve the problem of
66:09 being high enough to see any and then as
66:12 soon as you don't see it 880 miles and
66:14 everything is still flat then you got
66:16 something well you might someone and
66:20 then on the official side of things goes
66:21 well look at all the International Space
66:24 Station video of Earth well we know from
66:27 their footage earth is being filmed
66:29 through some
66:30 massive fisheye lens because the
66:32 curvature and their shots is insane it
66:35 goes really really tight super curved
66:37 then it flattens out and tight now you
66:39 would see a shitload of curvature at 250
66:42 miles up you would but you won't see
66:44 this oh the earth looks like a tiny
66:46 marble in the shot
66:48 you know they've never done something is
66:51 literally absurd as that but a lot of
66:53 the curvature they show us in these
66:55 shots is artificial you see the camera
66:57 move and just like the guy jumping out
66:59 of the Red Bull thing it's like wonky
67:02 earth shapes right so they're not really
67:05 the solution again the ISS can't see any
67:09 stars the ISS never films the moon the
67:12 ISS doesn't even have a window towards
67:13 the moon as far as I understand there's
67:16 no windows towards space well that seems
67:19 like a bunch of crap to me you're gonna
67:21 build a space station and you don't put
67:24 most of the windows like like what is
67:27 that the enterprise always has a tin
67:29 forward this place where you can go and
67:31 lounge and chill out with everybody and
67:32 it's towards the front of the ship and
67:34 so you can just essentially look out you
67:36 know while you're sipping on your synth
67:39 ale you can look out you know if they're
67:41 the mission in the fictional Star Trek
67:44 episode is about you know I just watched
67:47 one with the Moriarty like I told you a
67:49 Jupiter type planet was being swallowed
67:52 up by a star and they were watching it
67:55 okay went in for could be a look out the
67:57 front and see that happening so why
67:59 wouldn't you want to have constant
68:01 observation of the celestial bodies from
68:03 a space station instead of this absolute
68:06 [ __ ] of wires and human hair and all
68:09 this you know big fibrous sweaters
68:12 everyone's wearing it makes no sense
68:14 it's like one of the most unscientific
68:16 scientific places in the universe so I
68:20 understand the skepticism trust me once
68:23 you get into the ether all models of
68:25 gravity wings on planes make sense
68:30 planets hanging on a planets make sense
68:32 the world expanding the Sun expanding
68:36 the actually the Sun expanding would
68:40 have to have some other big injection
68:41 but all the planets and moons expanding
68:43 make complete sense
68:44 I think it explains in a huge way how
68:47 the pyramids were built especially when
68:48 you start studying the Coral Castle guy
68:52 dudes moving 60 ton stones by himself at
68:55 night
68:55 and when the day comes up he uses he's
68:59 pretty much got the stone where he wants
69:00 it and so all he's doing is using
69:02 pulleys and electricity to make the
69:05 stone weigh a lot less by probably
69:09 vibrating the stone at a point where II
69:11 throw winds that would be normally
69:12 pushing down from the a from outer space
69:14 go through the stone more than hit the
69:17 stone and then you have a stone that
69:21 might weigh six thousand pounds and then
69:25 your pulley and your wood could upright
69:29 it and move it where you need to be it
69:31 explains how he moved it after he built
69:33 it is that not exciting if you have
69:37 children you could raise them with this
69:39 technology and understanding of the
69:41 universe and again if you're new to e
69:44 throw models of the universe then again
69:47 go look up Eric Dollard his lectures are
69:50 a little dry but he reads you the books
69:53 written by these geniuses and he shows
69:57 you the conspiracy that debuted after
70:00 these gentlemen died off he shows you
70:05 that little overlap between Einstein and
70:08 Tesla and again if there's any quote
70:12 that Einstein may have said that is just
70:15 for me the linchpin in this whole game
70:17 is you know they said something someone
70:21 asked him the question I'm paraphrasing
70:23 you know what's it like to be the
70:24 smartest man in the world and he goes I
70:25 don't know once you go ask Tesla okay so
70:30 the guy that said that ether doesn't
70:32 exist or contributed heavily to the
70:34 experimentation and the theoretical
70:35 models of the universe it said ether
70:37 can't exist doesn't exist we've done
70:38 some experiments which is all horseshit
70:41 so as go talk to the guy that completely
70:43 believes that ether exists and built all
70:45 of his patents off of the very
70:49 realization that ether is real the guy
70:52 and if he actually said that he would
70:54 have undone his entire personal theories
70:57 about the universe
70:58 I'm hoping this gets us on the same page
71:01 and I hope this gives us alternatives
71:03 where you sit there and go look if
71:05 you're in the third group and flatter if
71:07 that comes in is true because someone
71:09 finally does an experiment I mean
71:11 literally the best thing we could have
71:12 is a drone that because traversing the
71:17 South Pole is extremely formidable it's
71:19 super cold and all this other stuff you
71:20 you build a drone that can survive 60
71:23 below zero and it can go hundreds of
71:26 miles very very quickly it's got plenty
71:29 of battery power maybe it's one of these
71:30 gigantic drones I've seen at trade shows
71:32 they're like five foot square and you
71:37 get that thing you fly up over the over
71:40 the ice barrier of Game of Thrones and
71:41 you haul ass on that thing and you just
71:43 have a video camera and that thing is
71:46 never it's designed never come back you
71:49 don't care if it ever comes back cuz
71:51 you're rich and you just boogie that
71:53 thing to where you think the barriers
71:55 going to end and a dome and all sudden
71:59 it goes pow and it hits something in
72:01 midair and hopefully the camera would
72:04 survive for at least a split second to
72:06 film what it ran into but even if it
72:08 ends you know how far that drone went
72:11 inland and that becomes your new target
72:14 we're gonna try to fly that far then
72:19 again the Navy is said that they've
72:20 traversed and flown over the South Pole
72:22 a bunch of times to map it well that
72:25 would mean they lied so it's just like
72:28 me going to whatever is after this world
72:32 and Jesus walks up to me and says dude I
72:34 was real
72:34 joke's on you Jack man you got me and
72:37 then it's over so you're over in this
72:39 third group actually building inventions
72:41 that help the world and you find out
72:43 it's flat later alright doesn't negate
72:45 the science that's over there it just
72:48 says well where you are is this
72:49 container for some reason but if you
72:54 ever wanted to be visited by the
72:55 creators of the universe go and develop
72:58 technology that frees you from this one
72:59 and they'll probably visit you yeah they
73:03 probably gonna go you got it you finally
73:04 found the formula you have to come with
73:07 us now but good job but if that became a
73:11 gigantic
73:12 awakening epiphany of the entire planet
73:14 and the whole planet you know instead of
73:16 some guy coveting his invention to make
73:18 a few bucks he's constantly keeping an
73:20 open-source research program and there's
73:22 guys from China Japan Russia all of
73:26 Europe Americas South America Africa
73:29 everyone's participating in this open
73:31 source ether abased invention movement
73:36 then they can't get us all unless they
73:39 flood the whole place again
73:41 but perhaps freeing ourselves is nothing
73:44 more than a state of consciousness you
73:47 know one thing I love a nun that I'll
73:49 shut up here one thing I love about the
73:51 Star Trek universe is this beautiful
73:54 thing I just talked about in a previous
73:55 episode but the whole Zefram Cochrane's
73:57 storyline where he's this drunk
74:00 washed-up aerospace guy that eventually
74:04 you know he's created this warp coil
74:07 thing and he can't meet it to launch
74:08 because it's or in this post-apocalyptic
74:09 world and he eventually flies it his
74:13 warp comes back of course he's got two
74:16 of the Star Trek guys with them which is
74:17 funny and then the Vulcans show up to
74:21 say oK you've made first contact with
74:24 the universe we're gonna make contact
74:26 with you and you got a you know use our
74:29 these are policies of the galaxy there
74:34 might be something to that if you could
74:36 figure out how to completely manhandle
74:40 the universe by understanding how it
74:42 works you know maybe maybe the first
74:46 thing man does is is travel at infinite
74:49 warp some total what does it know that
74:52 it's the infinite probability drive that
74:56 was in the Hitchhiker's Guide of the
74:57 galaxy you create that thing and the
75:00 owners will show up if there are any the
75:03 other members of the solar system sorry
75:06 of the universe show up maybe the solar
75:08 system too you can fly straight to Mars
75:11 on your first day and you have full
75:14 inertial dampers in your system you can
75:17 go as fast as you want you can confirm
75:19 or deny anything that NASA said that
75:21 they've done you can fly straight to the
75:23 moon go to the Sea of Tranquility and
75:25 it's
75:26 lately barren of any man-made things and
75:28 you're like op you didn't go to the moon
75:31 isn't that more exciting than sitting
75:34 here bickering over the shape of the
75:35 world that's where I think we could be
75:39 if we could just move everybody who's an
75:41 original thinker and as a critical
75:44 thinker move them into this camp of
75:46 these dudes from what is it 1850 to the
75:50 1930s it's got to be exciting if we
75:54 could do it anyway I hope you feel me
75:56 help you find that valuable again I
75:59 respect every single person who's off on
76:01 these adventures trust me
76:03 hopefully you didn't feel disrespected
76:06 in this episode outrageous claims
76:09 require outrageous evidence and we don't
76:12 have the evidence on either side of
76:16 NASA's argument or the Flat Earth
76:18 arguments but we know a lot about the
76:22 mechanics of the universe and this third
76:24 group so let's put some effort into that
76:28 one don't let them tie us up in things
76:31 that will jeopardize our credibility at
76:34 a future point it's okay to investigate
76:37 everything maybe don't throw down so
76:41 hard that you have it all figured out
76:42 when you don't have the proof proof
76:46 proof you know if I was talking to a
76:49 friend of mine who's always reading a
76:51 ton of science books he's not exactly a
76:53 science guy but I was telling him about
76:56 that Miraj quote unquote
76:58 of Chicago being filmed from like 6070
77:01 miles away and you know of course
77:03 someone just recently posted that the
77:05 official story about how far you can see
77:07 the Statue of Liberty is 60 miles away
77:09 which would be 2,400 feet on the other
77:13 side of the ball and this dude just
77:16 looked at me and he goes well don't they
77:17 understand that light bends through
77:19 their natural refraction of the
77:21 atmosphere and then under certain
77:23 conditions with moisture especially
77:24 being introduced into it right because
77:26 you look at Chicago you're looking at
77:28 over a body of water you look at the
77:30 Statue of Liberty it's in the Hudson Bay
77:32 I think right and it it is over body of
77:36 water and so you might get the very
77:38 light waves that are
77:40 in a three-dimensional pattern right
77:41 they would normally go tangent to the
77:43 curve and you think that all that lights
77:44 gonna go straight out into space but
77:47 with an ether a wind pushing down on
77:49 these very ripples on the pond in a
77:52 three-dimensional way that light could
77:54 be simply going around the edge of the
77:55 earth because it's being affected by a
77:58 force that's pushing it down the ripples
78:02 of a rock being thrown in a pond are
78:05 always on the outer texture of the water
78:09 right so the lake is flat so the ripples
78:14 come to you in a flat manner okay well
78:18 if we could create a ripple on the edge
78:21 of a bubble that ripples gonna go on the
78:24 curve of the bubble edge and light is
78:28 not made of something that's so
78:29 different that it's going to have its
78:32 own rules when you try to write or try
78:35 to read a newspaper through a shot glass
78:37 being held sideways where you're looking
78:39 at it through the cylindrical body not
78:41 through like the bottom which is what we
78:44 do for magnifying glasses right look
78:46 through the side of the lens it's tough
78:48 to read it because the lights bending
78:50 all around the glass its refracting well
78:53 that's the solid-state version of what
78:55 atmosphere does atmosphere has been
78:58 introduced as a mechanism to explain
78:59 flutters but we negate its other
79:02 explanation for how light could
79:03 potentially Bend
79:05 maybe the Statue of Liberty was in the
79:07 center of you know some desert and then
79:12 you go way way back 60 miles and you try
79:14 to look at it maybe you won't see it
79:16 because there's not enough moisture
79:18 coming off the desert to bend that light
79:22 anyway if you have them into deep
79:24 thoughts radio.com
79:25 please go it has audio/video feeds the
79:29 locked Facebook group with a bunch of
79:31 cool people to believe and explore
79:33 everything that exists we have two ways
79:36 to contribute to the page we have
79:38 patreon and PayPal we also have a
79:40 Twitter account I always forget to
79:41 mention and the new link to season one
79:44 remastered which will have just shy of a
79:47 hundred episodes when completely
79:49 finished but it will be viewable from
79:51 all sectors of the world
79:52 with no copyright infringement soulfully
79:54 and will be cooking with gas alright
79:58 until the next episode take care of
80:00 yourself in someone else and I'll see in
80:02 the next deep thoughts over now
