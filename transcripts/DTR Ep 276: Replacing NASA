00:00 [Music]
00:35 welcome back ladies and gentlemens deep
00:37 thoughts I thought today we talked about
00:41 starting a new Space Agency is a lesson
00:44 I learned when I was probably I don't
00:48 know 19 20 years old probably 19
00:51 somewhere in there before the age of 21
00:55 I was working in the company soft view
00:58 which invented TurboTax what we used to
01:01 call it you know to other names Mac and
01:03 tax and tax view it's like we were the
01:05 other than Mac in tax that was pretty
01:07 awesome
01:07 but everything was Mac in something back
01:10 in the day but we were just the our
01:16 leadership was just incredibly talented
01:18 at creating the worst company and
01:19 product names ever but aside from all
01:24 that I have been working at this place
01:26 since 1987 at the age of 18 I mean I
01:30 just turned 18 maybe a couple months
01:32 before then I was a you know a huge part
01:35 of the development of this product and
01:38 there was a shift because they had lost
01:41 a couple million bucks and they laid us
01:43 off that's when I went off and became a
01:45 video game artist professionally and
01:51 then you know like a year goes by of
01:52 that stuff and then I end up coming back
01:54 for a short stint back to the company
01:59 and they had hired some new folks and
02:02 watching some other new people come
02:04 aboard and my boss who is now still one
02:09 of my very good friends in this world
02:10 had hired a couple of his will actually
02:13 hired one of us
02:13 friends who's a genius who invented a
02:17 big part of inventing directx libraries
02:21 for Windows he was just a badass coder I
02:25 mean this guy was badass
02:26 I mean there's he looked like a biker
02:28 that's the funny thing he looks a little
02:30 less like a biker today but he's just
02:33 uni had a brother looked just like him
02:34 is just crazy
02:35 and so with this little clique and when
02:38 we first came together somehow I had
02:43 complained about something needing to be
02:46 changed
02:47 and I'm a doer in the company right I
02:49 was programming tons of the product and
02:52 you know I completely held down one of
02:54 the platforms by myself and I was
02:55 programming tons of the state packages
02:57 and drawing all the fonts and drawing
02:59 stuff for the manuals and it was just
03:01 like you could do as much as you could
03:03 do they encouraged that but somehow this
03:07 guy there's a point to me saying this
03:09 story this guy had heard only my
03:11 complaints not any of my fixes and
03:15 didn't have any knowledge of the history
03:17 of my participation in the company
03:20 because he was brand new he takes a look
03:23 at my pimple-faced you know I'm 20 or
03:26 below can't remember I think it must
03:28 have been it must have been just 20 but
03:33 he probably rightfully assumed from my
03:35 physical stature he's too young to
03:37 really know what the hell he's talking
03:38 about he's to him to have anything
03:41 really to do with what makes this
03:42 company tick not knowing that I'd
03:44 already spent two and a half years
03:46 helping to develop the product and so on
03:51 so forth right I actually you know had
03:55 that problem a lot when I was a kid I
03:56 mean I was 18 years old in that company
04:00 and within three months I had the
04:02 engineers who were adults asking me
04:05 where I graduated college because I had
04:07 my high school ring on it was a big fat
04:10 Jostens ring right and I just looked at
04:14 him you know my pizza face and I just
04:16 said I'm I'm 18 I haven't gone to
04:18 college it and then they're all kind of
04:21 like what it would how does this kid an
04:22 engineer with us you know so
04:26 I tell you that story about my buddy
04:30 because what ended up happening was he
04:33 went to my other friend my boss and said
04:35 you know who is this kid I don't like
04:37 this kid and my boss goes why he's
04:40 laughing you know he's like you have no
04:43 idea what you're getting into here but
04:45 go ahead and he's like cuz he just
04:46 complains he just complains and he
04:48 doesn't fix anything I hate people like
04:51 that
04:51 you know if you're gonna complain you
04:53 better be a constructive criticism kind
04:55 of guy and offer a solution and of
05:00 course he's a hundred percent correct
05:01 his only mistake was not being at the
05:07 right place in the right time to hear
05:08 the fact that I only come with
05:11 complaints if I can fix him usually
05:14 there's a lot of you who share this with
05:17 me it's like the second you find out
05:19 something is messed up you'll go into
05:21 thinking mode before you even open your
05:23 mouth and the second - you start to talk
05:26 is in the moment you found out what
05:28 could change it's not the de facto this
05:31 is the only way it could be improved but
05:33 one thing that could change that would
05:35 make it better I do this all the time
05:39 everywhere I am you know I'll go to
05:41 Disneyland
05:42 I'll be sitting here if I go for now
05:43 looking around I'd be like you know what
05:46 you need to do they need to change this
05:49 and it's interesting your friends can
05:52 actually get a little annoyed with you
05:55 doing that and they can get addicted to
05:56 you doing that I come to you and go this
05:59 sucks what should we do you know and I
06:02 think the solutions just come right out
06:03 of the universe quite frankly so the
06:07 reason why I mentioned that little story
06:08 at the beginning of this and I hope I
06:09 didn't bore the [ __ ] out of you guys
06:10 really too late is that we complain
06:14 about NASA we complain about SpaceX and
06:18 what we think they're doing gpo and what
06:20 they that we think they're doing Jack
06:22 Parsons laboratory we don't really in
06:25 America I think know what the foreign
06:28 agencies are doing in terms of
06:30 participating in various space programs
06:32 we know they're supposedly a Chinese
06:35 space station
06:36 there's definitely been Russian space
06:38 stations
06:40 if the indeed exist up there but now
06:43 what do we do to make a new space
06:46 program I think it might surprise some
06:50 of you and some of you will be right on
06:52 board but the more I have conversations
06:55 with people about what they think NASA
06:58 does they may be completely convinced
07:02 that NASA lies and have you know 100
07:05 references as to why they can and how
07:08 they can prove that but when I look at
07:10 them and I go ok you're right
07:11 that's only half the equation what do
07:17 you think they're really doing what do
07:19 you think the moon missions were really
07:20 about and then you hear crickets half
07:24 the time now I've seen videos on YouTube
07:27 with the answers to the things I'm
07:29 proposing right now but for some reason
07:31 they don't get watched and people don't
07:32 seem to know there is still that fanboy
07:36 element to people who know that they're
07:40 doing fake things you know i interview
07:45 bart sibrel I was shocked to find out
07:47 that he thinks that there's three space
07:49 stations I'm shocked to think that he
07:52 doesn't know anything about doesn't know
07:53 enough about the Van Allen belts and how
07:55 electromagnetic radiation comes out of a
07:57 sphere to understand that the polar
07:59 north and south is the most concentrated
08:02 in deadly areas because either you know
08:07 he just simply doesn't know and he's
08:09 peddling the notion that he's heard
08:11 those stories that Joe Rogan was told on
08:13 coast to coast am the most factual show
08:16 on radio that you can steer out of the
08:20 the top and the bottom I mean it's
08:25 interesting how ignorant can be used
08:27 against people and they they don't
08:30 realize it you know there's this thing
08:31 again you know I know enough to know
08:33 that you're fake but I will not concede
08:36 that I do not know enough to know what's
08:38 real so the idea is well how would you
08:40 know what's real and what's fake if you
08:41 don't have a scientific background
08:42 enough to know now in some cases in
08:45 Bart's case he saw footage that was just
08:48 absolutely unequivocally fake you know
08:52 and I think one thing that he was
08:53 struggling to say in the interview was
08:55 that it's he was trying to talk about
08:58 time and things and it's like this no
08:59 what they told everyone in Apollo 11 was
09:02 they couldn't bring up an extra
09:03 paperclip because the bout though the
09:06 weight of everything was so incredibly
09:08 balanced so if he's being criticized
09:10 that the fake footage of the earth
09:12 through the portal window is indeed
09:14 rehearsed then bringing up black lights
09:17 and a bunch of other gels and all this
09:19 other stuff it's a weight issue if
09:21 nothing else but then again the next
09:24 mission they took a 700-pound [ __ ]
09:26 Chrysler with them right they may indeed
09:29 have more than one space station if we
09:31 can achieve lower but which I think we
09:33 can I think he's absolutely correct the
09:35 tuna can that Buzz Aldrin was seen
09:37 spinning in the footage from Apollo 11
09:40 yeah it is weird that the Apollo capsule
09:44 the pointy tip part has been put in
09:48 computer simulations in the last five
09:49 years and they found out that there's
09:51 nothing about it that would maintain
09:54 integrity reentering the atmosphere but
09:56 then again maybe the whole thing about
09:59 you know going 17,000 miles an hour and
10:01 hitting thick oxygen and turning into a
10:03 burn plate and all this other stuff
10:04 maybe that's just a ruse because they
10:10 they need to cut radio communication
10:13 that's part of the hoax
10:14 who knows Space Shuttle had tiles on it
10:16 and for the first I don't know Jesus
10:19 five missions that thing came down with
10:21 tiles missing but maybe again that's not
10:23 it maybe that has nothing to do with
10:25 burning maybe that just has to do with
10:28 going really fast and then going really
10:31 slow who knows man but this question in
10:37 this episode has really nothing to do
10:39 with what they've claimed to have done
10:41 nothing now it took me a long time to
10:47 come up with this this opinion and it
10:53 was pushed really heavily by someone a
10:55 friend of mine who just watched a video
10:57 and then told me about it and I never
10:58 actually found the original videos when
11:00 these things are it's like really but
11:02 the video on ok
11:04 can't find it too weird how that happens
11:08 so NASA in the sixties reveals a little
11:12 bit about sort of how NASA got off off
11:18 well it was formed and then it was
11:20 immediately off track right as you all
11:24 know NASA was formed out of a bunch of
11:25 Nazis that were smuggled from Germany to
11:28 the United States through Operation
11:30 Paperclip courtesy of the Dulles
11:32 brothers
11:32 yes Dulles airports named after them
11:36 it's funny how these [ __ ] heroes are
11:40 you know of evil are all over the names
11:43 of our stuff right well let's just say
11:46 that some pretty interesting changes
11:48 happened in 2018 in the following years
11:50 and we actually reset the world and so
11:53 we need to rebuild these the Space
11:55 Agency to get this going
11:56 and so then we need to know kind of what
11:59 was NASA all about Verner von Braun
12:02 wanted to play with rockets he's really
12:04 just a little kid in a big guys body
12:08 he built the v1 rockets the v2 rockets
12:10 which bond the living [ __ ] out of
12:13 several opponents during World War two
12:16 most namely England again if you go to
12:20 England as I understand it there's still
12:22 neighborhoods with you know tracks of
12:24 homes and there'll be one missing and
12:26 that's where a v1 or v2 rocket landed
12:28 and blew the [ __ ] out of a house and
12:30 instead of building it up they just
12:32 plotted it over now in 2018 I don't know
12:35 if that's still true because real estate
12:37 is very cramped over there if you've
12:40 just a little slight digression if
12:43 you've never been to England and you
12:45 live in America I will say that when you
12:47 you're landing a Heathrow Airport on
12:51 that island
12:52 it is like landing in some video game of
12:57 the most plush manicured farmland you've
13:02 ever seen in your life because it's just
13:05 they only have that land and so
13:08 everything is manicured there's not a
13:09 bush out of place there's not a tree out
13:11 of place when they zone something for
13:13 residential they build it but they
13:17 certain building codes and you know it's
13:19 just amazing it's an amazing lived in
13:21 place you'll have an apartment track of
13:24 like brownstone buildings that are like
13:26 800 years old or something I mean it's
13:28 just it's really a remarkable thing to
13:30 witness but back to NASA so you have a
13:36 bunch of war criminals coming over and
13:39 forming a Space Agency the other world
13:40 creamers criminals went off and created
13:42 the clown's right it's a bunch of mind
13:46 manipulation stuff right but immediately
13:50 we have a situation we had World War two
13:53 and then we had this nuclear bomb scare
13:56 the Cold War the 50s for those of you
13:58 that didn't grow up in it like me you
14:01 have to understand that kids were
14:03 terrified it was all [ __ ] Duck and
14:06 Cover was [ __ ] but they believed
14:08 that they were gonna die in a nuclear
14:10 war that's how bad the propaganda was
14:12 and because we were so innocent back in
14:15 that day back in those days people
14:18 believed it we would never fall for it
14:21 today now see a bunch of military people
14:25 all of a sudden changing their heart and
14:28 by the time Kennedy announces at his
14:31 speech that we're going to go to the
14:32 moon within the next within this decade
14:34 send a man there and come back safely it
14:38 has created this vision the the peace is
14:41 here right you had a nuclear you know
14:45 post-world war two nuclear era everyone
14:49 thinks is the atomic era you know we
14:50 think everything's gonna go up at a
14:53 mushroom cloud and all the sudden now
14:54 we're going to the moon which was a
14:56 beautiful change in the mindset of the
14:58 people even of the world but the
15:00 interesting thing was is that the whole
15:02 thing was led by Russia putting up a
15:05 satellite called Sputnik right Sputnik
15:08 and there's people the debate even
15:11 though that even the validity of that
15:13 actually happening the problem with that
15:16 not being real was that it went around
15:21 the earth and we were able to listen to
15:23 it as it went by it's so high and it's
15:29 going so fast
15:30 there isn't a vehicle that's been
15:32 invented that could do that except for
15:35 something that's been thrown into low
15:37 orbit so that's where our scientists
15:41 went holy crap they're starting to
15:43 dominate the lower atmosphere lower
15:46 orbital atmosphere what will happen next
15:48 I mean the Rooskies don't really at the
15:51 time with Khrushchev they were
15:54 threatening the complete demise of the
15:56 Western culture and we just fought our
15:59 asses off to get out from under tyranny
16:02 monarchy and then socialism kind of blew
16:04 up with Marxism which is the globalists
16:07 other technique of bait and switch right
16:11 so we had to energize our nation to get
16:17 into rocket building with really a
16:21 military objective but veneer it with a
16:25 space objective never navarre brawn you
16:30 know is said to have written several
16:32 papers on getting to Mars
16:34 he was then forced to reevaluate to the
16:38 moon he wanted to get and he wanted to
16:40 leave Earth's gravitational pull his
16:43 theory was that we would have to build a
16:46 space station in low orbit and then
16:48 ferry tons of fuel up to the space
16:51 station for storage and then build a
16:54 rocket up there grab the fuel and go
16:58 outside of the outside of the Earth's
16:59 atmosphere
17:00 a slash gravitational pull I still think
17:05 that that's boss impossible like you get
17:07 anything to push off of you're not going
17:09 to be achieving you know escape velocity
17:12 so if you follow NASA's official history
17:16 we have all these you know missions into
17:20 low orbit and Rockets just fell down the
17:23 tarmac and blew up you know unmanned
17:24 rockets and then eventually we start
17:28 getting into low orbit we start lying
17:31 about going around the moon it's just
17:35 it's unbelievably laughable at this
17:37 point but as far as a magic trick of
17:41 lies and [ __ ] they get an a-plus
17:44 they get an a-plus for pulling the wool
17:48 over the eyes of the American people in
17:49 the rest of the world but no sooner did
17:53 the last moon mission complete in 1972
17:56 that the ICBM was introduced to the
17:59 world not just an ICBM but one that can
18:03 be launched from a submarine out of like
18:06 the pill container that goes out of a
18:08 torpedo Bay and this you know torpedo
18:11 Bay goes straight up to the surface or
18:13 not the bay but the torpedo capsule goes
18:15 straight up to the surface of the ocean
18:17 plops out so does it senses that it's
18:19 above water it blows off the case and
18:22 then boom this rocket takes off and
18:24 starts going into low orbit threatening
18:28 the living [ __ ] out of the rest of the
18:29 world if it's coming out of submarine
18:33 you don't need it to fly thousands of
18:35 miles you just bring the submarine right
18:37 up to the coast of the country you want
18:39 to threaten it right so it was
18:44 interesting about that because this this
18:46 video of this I don't think it was a
18:50 Trident submarine but something very
18:52 similar this nuclear capable submarine
18:54 firing this ICBM out of the water which
18:57 is very famous when I was a kid you see
18:59 that and you don't think about the fact
19:01 that that had to be developed had to be
19:05 weaponized it had to be put inside some
19:08 again the submarine delivery system it's
19:11 not just submarine xor's there's missile
19:14 silos all over the Midwest if you go to
19:16 Wichita Kansas and you pay attention as
19:18 you're driving into town we do a big 360
19:20 around Wichita Kansas
19:21 there are cement bunkers all over the
19:24 place that are just ten feet off the
19:26 ground it's because down inside there
19:29 are a ton of nuclear weapons
19:33 NASA was developing a fufu public
19:39 exhibition of rocketry system which was
19:42 very real but what they were really
19:44 doing is developing military delivery
19:46 systems for missiles I think everybody
19:50 missed it how many times did you see the
19:53 space shuttle go up and everyone's
19:55 watching the launch it's really awesome
19:56 on television and when it gets
19:58 the point where they're supposed to film
19:59 what they're putting out in space they
20:01 say Oh in this particular mission we
20:03 can't show you because it's [ __ ]
20:04 military which is a clown organization
20:09 satellite system right in my in my
20:13 memory it's somewhere around 2/3 to 3/4
20:17 of all of the space shuttles missions
20:19 were military based but nobody really
20:23 talks about it they're just kind of like
20:25 oh okay
20:26 and then the brain goes into kind of
20:29 cognitive dissidence you know about the
20:31 whole thing well I'm gonna stop thinking
20:32 about it I'm gonna stop thinking about
20:33 the Space Shuttle entirely until I hear
20:35 that it's landing and then maybe I'll
20:37 get up at 6:00 in the morning to watch
20:38 it on TV and why go through that in this
20:41 particular episode and the reason why is
20:44 that if we're going to build a new Space
20:47 Agency we have to unplug the military
20:51 from a real space program and the reason
20:58 why they've been attached to each other
20:59 is because the government knows that as
21:03 soon as that you think about your tax
21:05 dollars paying for a missile system
21:08 you're gonna hesitate when you think
21:11 about going to Mars and building a space
21:13 station on the moon will [ __ ] there's
21:15 movies and television shows that make
21:17 you want to do that so that's easily
21:19 acceptable
21:20 you'll fund that at 60 million dollars a
21:22 day Elon Musk CEO of SpaceX they have
21:30 worked really hard to make you accept
21:33 this man as a hero by putting him on
21:36 dozens of television shows and movies
21:40 subliminally putting him in movies as
21:42 the guy that opens the door to a
21:43 limousine but you didn't notice he's
21:47 familiar to you even though he is an
21:49 awkward dude man cannot present on a
21:52 stage to save a soul right why are you
21:55 nervous dude are you peddling something
22:00 that's real or you peddle them something
22:01 that's fake but he does stunts to make
22:04 you think positively of the company
22:08 again it's like Bill Clinton playing a
22:10 saxophone
22:11 on stage on Arsenio Hall in the mid 90s
22:14 or the early nineties so he could become
22:15 president he looks cool compared to all
22:18 the stiffs right you don't know he's
22:21 already raped 30 women God knows what
22:25 the [ __ ] you did on Lolita Island right
22:28 with his nearly 30 trips that we know of
22:31 and that's it that's what we know of
22:34 right the guy had a private jet he could
22:36 have been there a hundred goddamn times
22:38 right but Elon Musk is in that territory
22:41 they're pulling off a space agency off
22:44 to the side okay well it's a separate
22:49 ledger line right that's a separate
22:52 expense of 60 million dollars a day to
22:53 the group that's supposed to be doing
22:55 everything the Elon Musk's is doing but
22:58 now we're gonna pull off another ledger
22:59 and create more expense to the American
23:01 people to pay this side company because
23:04 NASA can't do what supposedly SpaceX can
23:08 you know it would be like hiring a maid
23:11 to clean your house and they don't hire
23:14 they don't clean your house for you well
23:15 so you hire another maid or your maid
23:18 you know yeah you hired another maid
23:21 with your money not with your maids
23:23 money to clean your house that's what's
23:26 going on right in front of your face
23:27 it's insane so I think that the space
23:31 program has to be split in two I mean
23:33 all the players right now have to be
23:36 shut down I would almost say we need to
23:40 do a full investigation of the entire
23:42 history of NASA all of their lies all
23:45 their manipulation as bart sibrel said
23:47 during their era it was a felony to use
23:50 propaganda on television it was a felony
23:53 to lie on television believe it or not
23:56 so you reviewed the whole agency find
23:58 out where the criminals are I'm off to
24:00 get most and I'm off to Leavenworth and
24:06 anybody who wants to continue working
24:08 would have to really work hard to get
24:11 the certification to work in the new
24:13 space program I would say none of them
24:15 should be hired into the new space
24:17 program but the problem is you do have a
24:19 lot of valuable PhDs
24:22 problem is once a shill always a shill
24:24 right
24:26 so you can't take a risk
24:29 they'll pay someone off again to smuggle
24:33 information out
24:36 it's funny how corporations have no
24:38 problem keeping their next product from
24:40 being announced you know any that
24:42 leaking out of Apple Computer those are
24:44 all intentional leaks to create some you
24:47 know buzz for the next piece of [ __ ]
24:49 phone they're gonna be creating great if
24:52 you want to keep it locked down you can
24:53 keep it locked down so we have a
24:56 military space program let's just
24:59 acknowledge it stop messing around and
25:02 then we have a private citizen space
25:06 program for two things for like
25:10 exploration and for the survivability of
25:14 mankind the military can inherit those
25:19 programs which are related to protecting
25:22 the world a meteor right right but I'm
25:26 going to tell you right now I differ
25:29 very much with my new acquaintance bart
25:33 sibrel and that i do not believe that as
25:35 I've said in my NASA selling doom
25:37 episode I don't believe for a second
25:41 that we're ever in any threat of a solar
25:43 flare right the fact that in England
25:46 would pedal that [ __ ] bothers me right
25:49 you think that a couple weeks ago we
25:52 almost [ __ ] died to a solar flare okay
25:54 okay so you think that this is something
25:56 that mechanically takes place and for
25:59 the I don't know a million [ __ ] years
26:02 before today it never happened and you
26:04 think it's gonna happen on your watch
26:06 why cause you're special like I said we
26:09 have never had in recorded history a
26:12 hemisphere of the world get burned up by
26:14 some goddamn solar flare and then all of
26:18 a sudden you know we're indigenously
26:21 living there again and there's no marks
26:22 on the ground and trees and flowers and
26:24 birds came back worms crawl on the
26:26 ground it's complete [ __ ] okay the
26:31 problem in me saying that is that in the
26:33 HAARP antenna patents that were filed in
26:36 1958 by Bernard
26:39 I guess his name her Easton excuse me
26:45 they do have a technique of modulating
26:48 the upper ionosphere
26:49 and controlling its distance from the
26:52 surface of the earth theoretically okay
26:55 so if they wanted to do something nasty
26:57 they could resonate it basically grab
27:00 onto it and yank it down to the surface
27:01 of the earth and you could have all
27:03 kinds of crazy things happen it wouldn't
27:04 get hot it would get cold as [ __ ] and
27:07 that's what that one movie was based on
27:09 is that the atmosphere was you know
27:11 wobbling down and touching earth and
27:13 then everything frozen spontaneously
27:14 right this is part of cleaning up the
27:17 world dope this episode is based on the
27:18 fact that we regain control the cue
27:21 anons right that all of those who need
27:26 to fall fall and then again what do we
27:30 do you have to build it back up well the
27:33 new space program would have to start
27:37 from scratch and I mean from scratch we
27:40 get the most brilliant people on planet
27:41 earth who have no previous association
27:45 with globalists with government with
27:49 clowns I mean we do a colonoscopy on
27:52 their past you want to be a part of this
27:55 leadership force of this space program
27:58 we are going into your past you will
28:00 take drugs and you will be surrounded by
28:03 a council of people who ask you a
28:04 hundred questions to make sure that you
28:06 don't have any weird alliances to
28:08 someone or some skeletons up your butt
28:12 we need the most amazing beautiful
28:16 people in the world and you know ladies
28:19 get your science books out because this
28:22 is your chance to prove yourself and get
28:25 this thing going right but the problem
28:27 with the space program today is that
28:29 it's built on outdated theories of
28:31 electricity outdated theories of
28:33 propulsion and we're being held down by
28:36 the globalist so that we don't create
28:37 better forms of energy zero-point energy
28:41 systems we have been forced to get rid
28:45 of all of our knowledge about
28:46 anti-gravity systems we don't study it
28:49 right how many times have you seen a
28:51 special on the inch
28:52 about NASA's anti-gravity department it
28:56 doesn't exist does it it doesn't exist
29:00 because we're never to find out how that
29:02 works where have you seen the but
29:08 where's the documentaries on Netflix
29:09 about the zero-point energy programs
29:12 around the world
29:13 no government's looking for it I have
29:17 friends that are very associated with
29:19 very special people in the world and
29:20 they say that we are 50 years past
29:25 zero-point energy systems that not only
29:27 do we have zero-point energy systems
29:28 that run military operations but that
29:31 we're like four or five generations down
29:33 the line so our new organization is
29:37 going to be based on absolute technology
29:41 that has been kept from us forever
29:45 instead of trying to build big fuel
29:48 rockets we're gonna try to build
29:51 anti-gravity systems based on a
29:53 propulsion system that is based on
29:55 infinite power hey and I'm not saying
29:59 that we can just drive through the Van
30:00 Allen belts simply because we might
30:02 achieve zero gravity because we can
30:06 achieve a zero point energy system you
30:09 know fuel como goes in the thing at all
30:10 it just simply creates infinite energy
30:14 now with this technology we have
30:16 responsibilities and this is probably
30:21 some of the bad thinking that's been
30:23 going on for years or maybe good
30:24 thinking that if let's just say NASA
30:27 creates or the military creates because
30:28 it's the same goddamn place as there was
30:32 a zero-point energy system we know that
30:34 the population of the world exploded
30:35 when energy became abundant especially
30:38 oil oil allowed us to invent a lot of
30:42 transportation
30:43 once we're able to go from our condensed
30:47 population of Europe which can't sustain
30:49 more people easily and we go to this
30:52 open territory all over the world you
30:54 know America's being one obviously
30:56 Native Americans were already here but
30:58 Native Americans hadn't to my knowledge
31:00 overpopulated much there we go we can
31:04 take over the whole continent
31:06 our military and procreate like crazy
31:09 use railroads to get all over the land
31:10 so we can take all the resources and
31:12 sell them and take all the money and
31:13 ship it back to the raw jobs right so if
31:17 we did create these energy systems and
31:19 these zero gravity systems the
31:23 traditional method of NASA is to say
31:26 it's paid for by tax dollars therefore
31:28 everything that they create with that
31:30 money is public domain there's a car
31:34 that was invented by I think the Holley
31:37 carburetor dude called the vector hope I
31:43 have the inventor right and some of you
31:45 guys will know right off the bat the
31:47 vector was this crazy car I mean it
31:49 looked like the precursor to the
31:51 Lamborghini the Countach it's like a 10
31:56 foot wide car I mean it's just
31:57 tremendously wild looking car but it was
32:01 built using a bunch of aerodynamics from
32:04 NASA the the hood of the car had these
32:08 fins that would come up and down based
32:10 on how fast the car was going to keep it
32:12 down to the ground because it supposedly
32:13 had a top speed of 240 miles an hour I'm
32:19 not sure effexor ever went 240 miles an
32:22 hour they said they didn't have tires to
32:24 keep it on the ground at 240 whatever so
32:27 in setting up this organization we have
32:28 to decide whether or not the technology
32:30 that's being invented can be put in the
32:34 public domain it can be disclosed in the
32:37 public domain perhaps it is it is
32:40 created in some sort of black box system
32:43 where you're not allowed to disassemble
32:45 it or we somehow obviously eat its
32:47 creation we have to be careful if an
32:51 antigravity engine or to be stolen for
32:54 instance and given to someone who's
32:56 trying to bomb the world they might have
32:59 a bit of a problem so before this
33:01 technology is introduced into the system
33:04 this brand-new corporation was brand new
33:06 government organization we have to
33:11 figure out what we're trying to do what
33:12 is our objective and what are the
33:15 policies around that
33:17 there's a bunch of you that are sick and
33:20 [ __ ] tired of hearing it's a matter
33:22 of national security that's the way
33:24 they've been hiding pedophiles around
33:25 the world right that's how they hide
33:28 money laundering and again there was a
33:32 Star Trek episode with Picard where
33:35 someone had said that matter of national
33:37 security some something that effect in
33:39 the script in unbeknownst to me the
33:42 writer who wrote Picard's dialogue he
33:44 quoted something from god several
33:47 hundred years ago in american history
33:49 even from our time frame he's supposed
33:51 to be in the 24th century and he said oh
33:54 that was that's the old axiom isn't it
33:57 that you can hide behind this notion of
33:59 national security how convenient for you
34:04 and obviously he's right so we have to
34:07 be careful about creating more of this
34:09 [ __ ] because the second you couldn't
34:11 hide something formally in a government
34:14 organization is the second you
34:15 facilitate a mechanism for corruption
34:19 so the definition of national security
34:22 instead of being this nebulous thing
34:25 right how do we know that something is
34:28 really a matter of national security I'm
34:31 willing to bet even though I've never
34:33 heard this rumor to exist or I've never
34:34 seen anything that remotely approaches
34:37 this that there could be a checklist
34:39 created right some Bill of Rights that
34:42 would say this determines our this yeah
34:45 this determines if something is a matter
34:46 of national threat I mean I know there
34:48 are documentation things for the top
34:51 secret emails but there should be
34:54 something where we can all say it's sort
34:56 of like azimoff's rules of you know
34:59 engagement for a robot right we can say
35:02 this technology if in the wrong hands
35:06 could facilitate weaponry that would be
35:09 tough to control after it is equipped
35:11 properly right but we have to figure out
35:15 a way to get to modern technology when
35:18 you deal with unions in various
35:20 functions it's a very interesting
35:22 process you know right when I told you
35:25 guys that I was briefed by my friends
35:30 from NASA this
35:31 we didn't go the moon okay the reason
35:33 why we're having a conversation is that
35:34 we were at a trade center sorry trade
35:37 show and we were we were not allowed to
35:39 plug our machines in out in the front
35:41 room and so we went and took the lunch
35:42 break because we had everything set up
35:44 and we're just waiting for the union
35:46 electrician guy to come in to plug the
35:47 goddamn computer in the ground well
35:51 imagine that lunacy taken to non lunacy
35:55 mechanism or by the propulsion systems
35:59 that might be dangerous to have in the
36:02 enemy's hands our black box by the
36:05 military side of the equation and you
36:09 build your rocket or whatever your ship
36:12 to do some scientific thing on the
36:14 public side of things well your
36:16 experimentation may be you have your
36:19 moon base equipment ready to go for the
36:23 very first moon landing and the military
36:26 comes in and installs the propulsion
36:28 system in a way that you can't open it
36:30 up and a second that they release the
36:34 engine to you and put it on that system
36:36 it is then monitored for its entire
36:40 duration entire journey and so it goes
36:44 to the moon it lands you do your mission
36:46 if you can you come back if it has to
36:49 stay on the moon then it self-destructs
36:50 and the military's figured out a way to
36:52 make it self destruct in a way that if
36:54 you were to find it and look at it you
36:57 wouldn't know what the hell you're
36:58 looking at there's be a clump of metal
37:01 so it might be a way to quarantine
37:03 dangerous technology the zero-point
37:07 energy system I'm sure would be inside
37:09 of a system that provides anti-gravity
37:11 so it's all in one shot in terms of
37:15 getting through Van Allen belts well I
37:17 think everyone could share that
37:19 information
37:19 I think the Van Allen belts provides
37:23 what we all know it provides infinite
37:27 electricity as we've defined it as
37:30 electromagnetic wave that can you know
37:35 provide a rotational valence current on
37:38 something it has so much
37:42 that'd be interesting to see if we could
37:44 harvest that interaction with the Van
37:47 Allen belts to create a propulsion
37:49 system the least harvest the energy
37:51 while we're in it but for anything else
37:54 we need to deflect it off of us and
37:56 control it so if it has a million times
37:59 more power than we need to run our ship
38:02 then we have to make sure it doesn't
38:04 consume us it doesn't pass through our
38:06 ship and bake us like an astronaut in a
38:09 microwave right but there's radiation in
38:13 space once you get past the Van Allen
38:14 belts the radiation in space is super
38:18 lethal another problem with the moon
38:20 missions so once you're outside the Van
38:22 Allen belts its lethal and again for
38:26 those of you in a debate NASA
38:28 accomplishing anything I will say that
38:30 one of the legitimate programs in NASA
38:32 and the mid-eighties was trying to
38:33 figure out how to insulate astronauts
38:36 against ambient Sun radiation not a
38:38 solar flare just regular ambient
38:41 radiation from the Sun and again the
38:44 gentlemen I talked to that that day in
38:46 1991 he said very humbly he said well
38:49 the only thing we could possibly come up
38:51 with is to ferry water up to a space
38:54 station and then fill a capsule with six
38:59 inches of water around the hole and some
39:02 fish tank because that's the only thing
39:05 we could possibly think of and again
39:06 that's not Van Allen belt protection and
39:08 that's not flare protection that's just
39:10 ambient radiation protection so we need
39:12 something that is absolute now something
39:14 that's going to only work in a certain
39:16 condition now I think it's Michael
39:19 Faraday right in the what 1830s
39:25 if we can create a Faraday fabric around
39:28 our ship something that we weave
39:31 together that is part of a material and
39:34 maybe maybe maybe maybe the event Allen
39:38 bells have enough of a unified frequency
39:40 to to behave literally like children
39:45 behaving the electrons can behave around
39:48 the outer surface of a ship and then
39:51 with building certain mechanisms into
39:53 the shape of the fabric we could route
39:56 electrons into engines to siphon off
39:59 just what we need to create a propulsion
40:02 system perhaps an antimatter engine if
40:05 anyone can really explain to me how a
40:07 man creates antimatter because you hear
40:09 these rumors about us creating
40:11 antimatter and the only thing we've
40:12 actually got is you turn on machines
40:15 there's a lot of spaghetti sparks and
40:18 then someone says oh my god I think in
40:19 the theory we created a couple particles
40:22 of antimatter for a split second you
40:24 know it's like it's not like you have
40:25 this you know tabletop engine that just
40:29 creates antimatter in some you know
40:32 glass bubble so military let's take a
40:37 look inside of a military organization
40:38 for a second because we have the we have
40:41 the military definitions as put down by
40:43 things like like dr. Strangelove right
40:48 where the military is always wanting to
40:50 launch the missiles and always kill
40:52 everyone same thing with that Twilight
40:57 Zone to serve man
40:58 as soon as aliens show up it's a
41:00 military operation military operation
41:01 tons of X minus ones have the same thing
41:06 but if we're gonna build a space program
41:08 where we have damn near infinite
41:10 capabilities do you really need to beat
41:13 everyone up really do you really need a
41:16 world domination thing if any of you've
41:19 ever been on the playground
41:20 I got an episode coming up called the
41:23 playground theory you know if you were a
41:26 kid that grew up in my hometown there's
41:28 lots of these kids where they're six
41:29 foot tall in sixth grade
41:32 they're about 11 years old and they're 6
41:34 feet tall you get your ignorant child
41:38 is raised by abusive parents you get
41:43 your kid out there who's beating
41:44 everyone up because he's just drunk on
41:48 his power he's a big kid right and then
41:51 you get your gentle giant and the kid
41:54 could beat up everyone but he protects
41:56 and and settles everything down he's a
41:57 chieftain there's women like this too
42:00 but hopefully with a rebuilt world where
42:03 we start minding our own business and we
42:05 get rid of globalists that create Wars
42:07 right globalists incubate descent for
42:10 each for each country against itself my
42:13 globalists make Muslims look insane make
42:17 Christians look insane Jews look like
42:20 they're all in some financial cabal
42:22 right eventually I do that episode we're
42:28 all being had you know okay yeah you can
42:32 always find a weird person in your
42:34 neighborhood that believes all the
42:35 propaganda and thinks that they're the
42:36 chosen ones in blah blah blah blah blah
42:38 you know and I mean chosen ones of any
42:40 religion I just named not just one but
42:44 in the modern gene roddenberry world
42:48 someone has to go first right someone
42:50 has to say alright well we have enough
42:52 technology now to police our world are a
42:57 little you know the land that is our
42:58 sovereign land and if anyone gets out of
43:00 control in some horrific way and tries
43:02 to create genocide we can peacefully
43:05 take our technology over there and in
43:07 the war without hurting a soul
43:09 I imagine a directed-energy weapon they
43:15 can get rid of steel and aluminum or
43:18 whatever the hell you want to do it can
43:20 get rid of ceramics they can get rid of
43:21 rubber it can get rid of like red
43:24 plastic all by itself you can dial in
43:26 these frequencies and hit it from space
43:27 and it will simply a demise and go away
43:30 it might get really hot in your hand
43:33 just like the day the Day the Earth
43:36 Stood Still when the Klaatu is after
43:43 everyone's guns and people had to jump
43:45 out of their tanks because it was
43:46 melting now the ordinances would have
43:49 probably gone off but anyway yeah
43:52 imagine there's
43:52 some genocide going on somewhere and
43:54 it's evens people throwing spears at
43:56 each other and we just go over there and
43:58 make would disappear and then we leave
44:04 Duke it out guys Duke it out but in
44:08 terms of our military it's to keep the
44:10 peace and protect and so everything we
44:13 develop in the military side of our
44:15 space program is to preserve the peace
44:21 to prevent aggression to not have war
44:26 I mean imagine a military organization
44:28 that's objective is to prevent war not
44:32 to get in it not so the generals can
44:34 look at you know Tomahawk missile videos
44:38 and watch things blow up in the desert
44:40 you know I'm gonna at least say that
44:43 most males get off on that I've gotten
44:47 off on that several times there's like
44:49 some a fact right now I'm getting off on
44:51 it when Trump goes over and bombs all
44:53 the opium farms in Afghanistan that the
44:57 clowns control it's pretty awesome
44:59 Hinton it's it's a financial artery
45:02 being destroyed again s up to this point
45:05 has been developing delivery systems for
45:08 weapons which then are then you know
45:09 that patents are spun off you know to
45:12 Raytheon and Lockheed Martin and
45:15 McDonnell Douglas and Boeing they get
45:18 the the technology in there to weaponize
45:20 it they create stealth skunkworks stuff
45:23 Ryan Wright Patterson Air Force Base or
45:25 area 51 or whatever it's easy for us to
45:28 say it's all in affairs because we don't
45:30 get to see what's being developed right
45:31 we do now have Declassified planes that
45:34 we see but instead of letting a military
45:38 organization develop its own charter
45:40 behind closed doors without the approval
45:43 of the people and again there's a lot of
45:46 great points about the people not
45:49 knowing what they need right every time
45:51 a person charges for without asking the
45:53 people a lot of times great things
45:55 happen because the people have been
45:57 indoctrinated but let's just say when I
45:59 say the people we say that is defined by
46:03 our best think
46:06 and maybe they have to think about it
46:08 for a little while and they come up with
46:11 again some bill of rights some
46:13 declaration of what this organization
46:16 would be about I mean I think it's
46:18 pretty and you know I do know that there
46:23 are evil people in the world and if we
46:24 don't think like them they they will
46:26 take advantage of us they will win so we
46:29 have to have people that can neutralize
46:31 the most evil thoughts in the world and
46:34 the creations thereof because they will
46:38 always exist in our lifetime right but
46:43 I'm going to let those contingencies be
46:46 sort of backfilled through implication
46:49 I'm implying that those sorts of dark
46:56 requirements are going to be taken care
46:57 of what I want to do in this episode is
47:00 continue going down the line of the gene
47:05 Roddenberry approach which is that we
47:07 have decided to move towards the Star
47:10 Trek realm of peace oh uh maybe even a
47:15 moneyless Society go see my episode on
47:17 Star Trek and see someone to get a whole
47:19 hour and a half on that but what do we
47:24 want to do on the people side of the
47:26 space program well don't we want to
47:29 figure out where the hell we are you
47:32 know when this Flat Earth stuff started
47:33 going around I think it's funny that
47:35 NASA didn't in the military no one has
47:40 helped us solve it once and for all
47:45 right
47:46 what do they have to do they take Eric
47:50 Dubay and whoever else wants to go isn't
47:54 it mark sergeants one of them too the
47:57 most avid Flat Earth supporters in this
48:00 planet you charter some beautiful plane
48:04 some g5 or something
48:06 and they get they're allowed to bring as
48:10 many video cameras as they want as many
48:12 backup batteries as they want they can
48:13 fill up window after window in this
48:15 plane they can attach it to the outside
48:17 of the plane whatever needs
48:19 to happen and they simply fly the g5 up
48:23 and over the South Pole the Antarctica
48:28 and it's a continuous film shot and
48:30 you've got you know you need to have at
48:32 least half a dozen flat earth pro
48:33 flatterers people on this plane filming
48:36 they also filmed the gyroscopes in the
48:38 center of the plane in the cockpit no
48:44 and just a footnote you know I've always
48:46 told you guys that if the gyroscope
48:49 doesn't rotate as you fly from London to
48:52 Cairo then this world is flat and I've
48:56 been told several times on videos and on
48:59 websites that it doesn't turn what I
49:03 have never seen is a photograph of the
49:06 before and after or a movie of the
49:09 before and after so right now it's just
49:12 a bunch of goddamn hearsay like why
49:16 would you say like these guys will say
49:18 I'm a pilot and I've you know I've
49:19 looked and it doesn't rotate it's like
49:21 what do you have a [ __ ] cellphone
49:22 dude right take a goddamn picture would
49:25 ya but these are fun things that we
49:28 could do with a space for a space agency
49:30 to essentially clear up all the
49:33 confusion about where the hell we are
49:34 let's clear up whether or not we're on a
49:36 ball or on a flat plane or some goddamn
49:39 matrix or something or maybe run a big
49:40 giant ball that's so damn big that where
49:43 we are the curvature is really so
49:45 teeny-tiny that we barely see it you
49:47 barely notice it let's go
49:51 3,200 miles up in the sky in orbit I'd
49:55 be well within the event Allen belts but
49:57 that sends some craft up there unmanned
49:59 whatever and see if the Sun and the moon
50:03 are right there all right but if you go
50:05 to the moon and it's two hundred and
50:06 thirty seven thousand miles away we can
50:09 track it you know the sad part is that
50:12 we don't have a rocket that's ever just
50:16 gone up unmanned in the modern age with
50:18 video cameras all over it you know
50:21 there's always this blackout phases this
50:23 [ __ ] you know it doesn't matter if
50:26 we lose communication with the rocket
50:28 and the live feed goes away the live
50:30 feed can be made up the second third
50:31 Rock it actually makes
50:32 contact back with us if that blackout
50:35 thing is really true and it'll be
50:37 mounted if uhrin sin the frames and just
50:39 say look this is what I saw when you
50:40 couldn't see but as this rocket does its
50:44 slingshot [ __ ] around the earth and
50:45 supposedly goes to the moon
50:47 the whole thing's on video every goddamn
50:50 frame is on video it doesn't have to be
50:53 4k it'd be nice it should have enough
50:57 storage on the on the rocket to store
51:01 that transmit at a later time but it's
51:05 possible and we've never seen it if we
51:08 want to exist in space and travel out to
51:10 other stars like Alpha Centauri or even
51:12 visit Mars with our feet then there's a
51:15 tremendous amount of science we have to
51:18 understand right a tremendous amount you
51:22 know SpaceX saying that they're gonna go
51:23 to Mars in the next half decade with a
51:26 human being it's it's just the most
51:29 bold-faced lie you've ever heard in your
51:32 life we've sent you know supposedly
51:36 cosmonauts up there for almost two years
51:38 and they come back and they can't walk
51:39 they've lost tremendous amount of bone
51:42 density and we think that we created an
51:44 exercise bike and that's somehow just
51:46 gonna fix everything right the human
51:49 body relies on gravity to work in pretty
51:53 much I would say 90% of all of our
51:57 organs they're designed to have a
52:00 thorough force pushing down on us all
52:02 the way through our bodies on levels
52:04 that you don't think about like the
52:06 electron flow through our bodies
52:09 requires this force to work properly so
52:12 you can't all the sudden put a human
52:14 being in space for a prolonged period of
52:16 time and just hope that's gonna work
52:17 itself out right
52:20 you could have human being sacrificed
52:23 their lives to to experiment and figure
52:27 that out but you can't just throw anyone
52:29 out there and go oh well you know it's
52:30 it's generally safe right but we have a
52:33 rock supposedly in space that is really
52:37 large very close compared to all their
52:39 celestial bodies and like Bart said we
52:43 haven't been back to it since 90
52:45 72 supposedly right now we know that
52:52 we've never been there so we got to go
52:54 and again if you've watched my
52:56 hundred-year Theory episode from this
52:58 episode you could theorize that we have
53:00 all this technology's been hidden from
53:02 us and you know maybe you're right I
53:03 don't know again if they could if they
53:07 could get to the moon with covert
53:10 technology I guarantee you they would go
53:13 up there and stage all of the landings
53:16 the six landings that we supposedly did
53:18 they'd put everything where it's
53:19 supposed to be dust off the footprints
53:21 and stuff you know unless they find it
53:23 this is completely goddamn impossible
53:25 even if they get there it's just so
53:28 different than what they thought it
53:30 doesn't work they'll never be
53:32 photographs that match the fake sets
53:33 that they built in the Hollywood
53:34 basement I guarantee that's the case too
53:37 right
53:38 I forgot what listener put it up there
53:41 but total kudos to whoever did this one
53:44 of you posted a picture on the locked
53:46 Facebook group of the fact that the moon
53:48 is so bright you know when it's full
53:50 that it lights the earth in a big way
53:51 but when we go up there and land on it
53:53 and take photographs there's just it's
53:55 gray and dismal and tons of shadows and
53:59 it's just really funny the Great Dismal
54:02 part is the is the real clincher there's
54:04 gonna be shadows wherever you go and we
54:05 can see shadows on the moon surface with
54:07 telescopes I'm willing to bet the moon
54:10 is something completely different than
54:12 we think it is and we should find out
54:15 what that is maybe that's an objective
54:19 do we want Space Station's is there any
54:22 reason to have Space Station's right
54:27 military dominance well we know why we
54:29 want that in the old thinking
54:32 communication satellites well there's a
54:35 rational rational thought for that right
54:38 and again for those of you that don't
54:41 think satellites exist if they don't
54:44 then yours truly has seen some amazing
54:46 designs of things that are definitely
54:50 satellites and I don't know why someone
54:52 would work so freaking hard
54:57 designing these things and building
54:59 these things if they're never gonna
55:00 actually go up and do anything right and
55:03 I'm not talking about NASA things you
55:06 know the guy that told me about the moon
55:07 mission thing in 91 he'd been working on
55:11 satellite technology for God 15 years
55:15 had lots of patents related to the
55:19 satellite technology I'll just put that
55:21 way
55:21 I got another friend that spent 10 years
55:23 in a covert program building satellite
55:27 technology and so you know I don't
55:33 really think that the hoax would go so
55:35 far as to have these people sit in rooms
55:37 for decades
55:39 with dozens of other people if we can't
55:43 send something into low orbit again the
55:45 fake footage that's in a funny thing
55:47 happened on the way to the moon it's
55:49 very real right now
55:53 faking the tuna can and Buzz Aldrin's
55:54 hands back in 1969 is tough I mean I
56:00 know you guys think there's you know I
56:01 know that there's the vomit rockets and
56:03 that sort of thing but if the footage is
56:07 if we can't go into lower but low orbit
56:10 and the footage in a funny thing
56:11 happened on the way to the moon happened
56:14 then someone faked to fake you know it's
56:17 just it gets luna ludicrous at some
56:19 point right the other thing that doesn't
56:22 happen in in the old space program the
56:24 existing space program is the public
56:26 opinion about what the hell we would
56:28 like to fund would it be interesting if
56:32 on some non-political interval the
56:37 people are presented a pitch about what
56:40 NASA wants to do we're not inventing the
56:43 idea right you know if if Steve Jobs had
56:49 come up with the iPod and instead of
56:52 debuting it for sale that was a 2001 or
56:55 whatever it was he simply showed you a
56:57 prototype showed you it working showed
57:00 you iTunes and so look that's a legal
57:02 way to buy music so the artists can make
57:04 money and this is a little device that
57:05 holds a thousand songs if I could make
57:08 this would you buy it
57:10 now we know weed why that doesn't happen
57:12 because the competitors would move in
57:13 and do it but if he says like I got all
57:15 the patents I just got to really turn
57:17 this on would you please fund this
57:18 everybody would everybody would right
57:23 same thing with NASA no one can just
57:25 rush out and do what NASA does if and
57:28 we're not talking about the lack of
57:30 protection for patents here and there
57:32 right so we've got a black box that's
57:35 some propulsion system they go we have
57:38 the the x1 propulsion system that has
57:43 been developed it uses a zero-point
57:45 energy system it's anti-gravity is in
57:47 the military wing of our space program
57:49 it is now ready for use by the public
57:52 side of the space program and so they go
57:57 with this engine with three of these
57:59 engines inside this particular spaceship
58:01 that we've designed we believe we can
58:03 get to low Earth or Earth orbit we
58:06 believe we can go through the Van Allen
58:07 belts and everyone will be okay or we
58:09 can eat at least run the project Orion
58:11 experiments to find out if this hole
58:13 will protect in person inside without
58:16 the person being inside there then we
58:20 vote on it and then when the rocket or
58:23 the spaceship just takes off right will
58:25 be a rocket but it just takes off and
58:26 goes in the air the public goes that's
58:30 part of my decision my tax dollars have
58:34 built you know part of that ship that
58:37 rearview mirror I paid for that right
58:40 when the blimp was invented formally in
58:43 the 20th century people would use it as
58:48 a form of recreation a form of
58:50 transportation a silent beautiful ship
58:54 that could float in the sky and you
58:55 could look down on the population you
58:58 know people ate five-star meals up there
59:00 it was amazing and only when the
59:02 propellers turned on did you ever hear
59:04 any sound okay well what if you could
59:07 fly around the earth do a little tour in
59:09 a zero-gravity unit that has no sound at
59:12 all that'd be a fun piece of
59:15 entertainment and then a Richard Branson
59:17 can come in with virgin and get all the
59:21 right approval to use one of the
59:24 proposed
59:24 systems and he can tour his craft in
59:28 this area right it goes out of a certain
59:30 area then you know our propulsion system
59:32 could be nabbed by an enemy and so we
59:36 prohibit that we're destroying the world
59:40 right by harvesting all of its minerals
59:43 now something like oil you have to dig
59:46 it out of the ground every once in a
59:47 while and do something with it because
59:50 the earth makes it as the natural
59:52 byproduct of the earth it's not a fossil
59:54 fuel so if we stopped drilling oil
59:58 there's a funny little thing that will
60:01 happen in that it fills up all of the
60:03 reserves again and they start spilling
60:05 out the top like I've said in several
60:07 episodes you don't want your
60:09 neighborhood full of oil which is what
60:10 it used to be in Texas floating on the
60:12 surface of the earth so we're gonna have
60:15 to do something with that stuff not sure
60:17 what you do with it even if you're not
60:19 going to use it but we're digging you
60:23 know copper and silver and gold and
60:26 uranium and lithium and all kinds of
60:30 stuff you know we're distilling it out
60:32 of the ocean we're we're just destroying
60:35 the surface of this planet because we
60:37 have created dependencies and profit
60:39 margins for the movement of these
60:41 minerals well if you didn't need it you
60:47 wouldn't do it right think of all the
60:49 ugly power plants that exist in the
60:51 world we have a Edison power plant down
60:55 on the beach of Huntington Beach it's
60:58 ugly as sin man why they don't find a
61:01 way to put a veneer on this building to
61:03 keep it looking pretty I have no idea
61:05 but they never do they just paint it
61:06 sand gray so that it kind of blends in
61:09 with the atmosphere because it's against
61:11 the sky I don't understand that works
61:12 it's like a big sand castle but imagine
61:15 all these things go away you don't have
61:17 to pay for power anymore maybe there's a
61:20 limit to consumption that you can have
61:22 in your house you can build some sort of
61:24 death ray or something you get a limited
61:26 amount you get enough to run all of your
61:29 appliances you're cool but you can't
61:31 drag out a million volts for something
61:33 it's exciting to think about
61:35 re-engineering what we do isn't it
61:38 but I hopefully you have found the
61:41 underpinning theme of this episode which
61:46 is is it interesting when you clear the
61:49 slate and you acknowledge perhaps you
61:53 know fancy fancy sea level technology
61:55 being disclosed to the public that all
62:01 the sudden what to do in space hmm it
62:04 sort of flattens out doesn't it no well
62:08 do we really just need to be in orbit in
62:10 a space station what what use is that
62:13 well maybe we study the weather maybe we
62:16 can study more about the bowels of the
62:18 earth and where the next volcano is
62:19 gonna happen the next earthquakes gonna
62:20 happen and maybe there's some nice
62:22 geological environmental programs that
62:26 we can do perhaps we can figure out how
62:28 to make a better metal by by making it
62:31 in space versus making it on the surface
62:33 of the earth but in the end you're kind
62:35 of like well I kind of like earth how
62:38 about you I kind of do but I'm sure some
62:41 people want to float in space
62:42 I guess forever it takes a long time to
62:46 get from point A to point B maybe with
62:48 some again antimatter machine or
62:51 something they can you know warp the
62:55 flow of ether winds we can start
62:58 creating very quick propulsion systems
63:00 and maybe we can get to Alpha Centauri
63:02 which is four light-years away right
63:05 traveling at the speed of light it would
63:08 take four years to get there if what
63:10 we've been told is true now maybe it's
63:12 untrue maybe they just faked all that
63:14 data maybe everything's just right next
63:16 to us right maybe space doesn't exist
63:20 maybe we're in the firmament don't who
63:23 knows man I love the idea of 2001 a
63:27 Space Odyssey because it's come up in my
63:30 life a lot a lot of my friends my
63:32 buddies as a writer that we've been
63:33 talking about it a lot and I forget the
63:37 beauty of what arthur c clarke didn't
63:40 where he said you know in his story
63:43 the monolith was here on earth augmented
63:45 man then went to the moon and hid itself
63:48 such that when we get to the next
63:50 journey which is to get to the moon
63:52 when cover the monolith there and then
63:54 it goes to Jupiter's and it's much
63:56 bigger and we have to get to Jupiter
63:58 it's always baiting us to get to the
64:00 next level of Technology it's validated
64:03 itself as something out of this world
64:04 and it goes there now the one thing I
64:08 found that was interesting was that it
64:12 it blatantly increases the intelligence
64:14 of prehistoric man in an evolutionary
64:16 model I know that rubs some of you
64:18 really bad you know for me it's just a
64:21 story but teaches us how to turn bones
64:25 into weapons and to eat meat meat eating
64:28 meat being the first one which improves
64:30 the brain and our visual cortex to get
64:35 to the point where a weapon could be
64:36 used to combat injustice once they found
64:41 it on the moon though in the movie I
64:42 don't remember if there's big whiny
64:44 noise that happens and then it
64:45 disappears as the astronauts explorers
64:48 touch it which must not have been the
64:50 very first time was touched because the
64:52 whole thing was excavated out
64:53 beautifully but these scientists go down
64:55 and touch it you know and it winds in
64:57 their ear this this horrible ringing
64:59 noise and then it's gone but there was
65:02 no sign in the storyline that they were
65:04 augmented I can't remember what the book
65:06 said I haven't read the book for 30
65:09 years 35 years one thing is for certain
65:12 and that is that we haven't mastered
65:14 earth right we have a master being on
65:17 this ball or this or whatever we are
65:20 still acting like children 2018 is
65:23 awakening it is the first time in
65:27 hundreds of years okay that man is
65:30 behaving like an adult who is the
65:34 resistance to this change our snowflakes
65:36 those do act like children those who
65:40 hate men of authority women of authority
65:43 they hate it I got the heckling birds
65:46 now the reason why I opened this episode
65:49 with my friend was that when he went to
65:53 my boss and then came back to me in fact
65:55 first of the way at first when it was
65:57 that he chewed me out in a cube and he
66:00 said you're just going around
66:03 complaining and you're not offering any
66:04 solutions and
66:05 looking at this guy going what like it
66:08 was the first time anyone ever accused
66:10 me that in my life and I'm looking at
66:11 this guy going you must not know who I
66:13 am I mean I literally said to him
66:15 That's not me I'm a programmer here I've
66:19 I solve all these problems that's what I
66:21 do
66:21 and he kind of stopped in the middle of
66:24 the you didn't he didn't apologize right
66:28 away he was kind of like taken off guard
66:30 like oh [ __ ] do I have this kid
66:31 completely wrong he was big enough to do
66:33 that and then he went off to talk to my
66:35 boss and then he came back and he said
66:37 this is before we all became personal
66:39 friends on the outside and he came back
66:42 and said something like oh man I'm sorry
66:44 I got you wrong you know I thought you
66:45 were just complaining and when so-and-so
66:49 told me about who you were I realized
66:52 you know I thought I was bumping it he
66:55 goes it goes no he said to me he goes
66:56 the problem was in my last company I had
66:58 nothing but people who complained I
67:01 thought I was running into another one
67:03 and I laughed and I was like man I
67:05 totally know what you mean I completely
67:07 sympathize with your opinion because I
67:10 have the same problem you know when we
67:15 complain about our space program that is
67:19 not a bad thing but we have to have the
67:24 answers as to okay what do we do do we
67:29 have a space program at all what should
67:31 it do what's important
67:33 really I personally I would I would love
67:37 to visit perhaps the celestial bodies in
67:41 our solar system maybe if you could make
67:43 it a really quick trip I know this
67:45 sounds naive or or childish if you could
67:47 get me to Alpha Centauri and back within
67:49 um I guess six months to a year I mean
67:54 the full round-trip I'd go I personally
67:58 and this may shock you guys I I wouldn't
68:01 want to lose my earth time to a bunch of
68:03 space exploration it's just not my game
68:06 I love my fellow man I love what we have
68:09 here I think we need to get this place
68:11 right taking all of our intellectual
68:14 flaws into space is going to do nothing
68:16 more than
68:17 pollute space prolong and delay what
68:21 needs to actually occur here right let
68:24 me throw this little question at you at
68:27 the very end of this episode there's a
68:30 lot of Trekkies and let's just say we
68:33 gather up all the Trekkies that worship
68:36 the 1960 series all the way through to
68:38 the end of enterprise in 2005 they don't
68:43 like the JJ Abrams movies they don't
68:45 like the new horrible SJW series on TV
68:51 so we have a bunch of good people and
68:54 this say they know all the episodes
68:56 inside and out when they go to a cosplay
68:59 Star Trek convention they have maybe two
69:02 characters they play some of them played
69:04 just one character they're just Spock
69:06 they're just Captain Kirk
69:09 whoever right ahora counselor troi and
69:15 we say okay these people have been
69:18 utterly devoted to their Gene
69:19 Roddenberry vision of the future no
69:22 money everyone works because that's what
69:24 we do we're responsible for each other
69:27 and we build some sort of Star Trek
69:30 Enterprise because we have these
69:32 propulsion systems now and and maybe we
69:34 don't really need them to cells because
69:35 it really is in a warp field and all
69:37 this other stuff but we can make a look
69:39 any way we want because the propulsion
69:40 systems we've created can achieve what
69:42 this enterprise can a deflector shield
69:45 maybe we wouldn't have lasers and
69:48 torpedoes you know photon torpedoes we
69:53 can go to Red Alert how about that I'm
69:56 willing to bet if you built a whole crew
69:58 and I forgot how money the enterprise
70:00 changes science consciousness I can't
70:02 remember what the what any one of them
70:05 can hold but I say we take a regiment of
70:07 like five hundred people we put him in
70:08 this spaceship and we send them on a
70:11 voyage it's very similar to the Charter
70:13 of Star Trek to explore new worlds I'm
70:17 willing to bet that if we took the most
70:19 devout Trekkies and put them on that
70:21 ship and sent him into space within a
70:24 week or a month it wouldn't be like the
70:28 show
70:29 the frailties and flaws of man that are
70:33 still alive and well inside Trekkies
70:36 which are some good people would surface
70:40 the pettiness of man would surface and
70:43 it's not that if we left him out there
70:45 for ten years they wouldn't get their
70:48 script on a little bit better and figure
70:50 out their anomalies and perhaps evolve
70:52 their thinking to a point where they are
70:54 more Gene Roddenberry and they are more
70:55 balanced right but I think that our our
71:01 current dependencies as man our short
71:03 attention span our constant looking at
71:05 our cell phone would really go in the
71:09 face of what would need to be present on
71:13 a ship like that to recreate that
71:14 environment and why mention that because
71:20 I think that we are intellectually and
71:22 perhaps genetically not there yet as
71:26 much as we can write episodes and act it
71:28 out in a Hollywood studio and put it on
71:30 television we still aren't there yet
71:33 mentally we're impersonating what we
71:35 would like to have happen art is still
71:37 yet to become life in those areas right
71:40 maybe I'm wrong
71:41 I hope I'm wrong if we have those people
71:48 on earth that could really pull it off
71:50 fairly instantaneously
71:51 and I'm sure that the opinions would
71:53 differ too about what Gene Roddenberry
71:55 meant by various charters of the show
71:58 and of course he died early in the 90s
72:00 and it was taken over and the majority
72:02 of Star Trek episodes were created
72:03 without his supervision but I think
72:05 brilliantly maintained the Charter of
72:09 what his original vision was I would say
72:12 that anyone that could walk into that
72:14 scenario and not mess it up would be the
72:16 elders of our generation regardless of
72:19 how old they are you could pull it off
72:22 you'd be special if you're awake then
72:25 you know that there's a ton of crap that
72:27 we have to get right a ton of flaws that
72:30 we have to re-engineer inside ourselves
72:33 you know as I haven't I haven't said in
72:36 a while but you know that the goal of
72:37 this show is to speed up that process to
72:41 get us thinking again
72:43 in every area of everything and as a
72:47 byproduct of listening to any one of the
72:49 ideas I put in one of these shows you
72:52 are thinking about things I haven't
72:53 covered at all and you're refining your
72:57 thoughts and you're becoming hopefully
72:59 more peaceful more educated and again
73:03 it's not any type of formal diploma on
73:05 the wall educated it's in the area of
73:08 education that we really really really
73:10 need you know and I hate to even put a
73:14 category round it but I know that one of
73:15 those categories would be how we treat
73:17 each other this whole problem that we're
73:22 in right now is that we have too many
73:24 people passing the buck propaganda makes
73:28 it really easy to pass the buck doesn't
73:30 it
73:30 we have cancer in this world that was
73:33 completely invented by man but we we
73:35 have just grown to accept it because we
73:37 have stupid catchphrases like everybody
73:40 does cancer everything causes cancer I
73:42 got a friend of mine who just consumes
73:45 cancerous stuff on a daily basis and
73:48 every single time I'm note a well you
73:50 know I don't mean you know I'm not
73:52 telling you to change your life but that
73:53 if you're gonna complain later that you
73:55 got cancer it's because of that [ __ ]
73:57 you've been eating or drinking or
73:58 whatever and then the the rebuttal is
74:01 well I guess just everything in my life
74:03 causes cancer everything I do is wrong
74:05 that's what they always say everything
74:06 is you I was like well it's not what I
74:09 said and what are you trying to do
74:10 you're trying to to be offended or
74:12 something so that I back off the advice
74:14 that that may be you living a long
74:18 healthy life as a thing that you might
74:20 want in this world right and I just want
74:24 to say for the newcomers who are
74:26 beautifully concerned about me smoking
74:28 cigars please do watch the episode on
74:30 cigars it's barely has any views it was
74:32 this season can't remember what episode
74:34 but it will it'll wake you up to what
74:39 these things are and what they're not I
74:41 don't hey Lenny this stuff okay the guys
74:44 who smoked 18 cigars a day tend to make
74:46 it to 90 between 90 and a hundred years
74:49 old
74:50 one of the oldest men in America I think
74:52 he's the oldest man in America he's
74:54 about a hundred and eleven
74:55 I think he smokes I don't know over a
74:59 dozen cigars a day you know again so if
75:02 you don't inhale there's a lot of
75:05 dangers that you avoid you can't inhale
75:08 these things they would kill you if you
75:09 did I think you feel me I'm interested
75:14 in your comments on what you would do
75:18 with NASA forget anything I've said in
75:20 this episode start from scratch you know
75:23 if you have to just number it just say
75:24 look first thing we need to do is this
75:27 how would you divide it up what would be
75:30 the objectives if you want to get rid of
75:33 a space program all together then why
75:36 what do we do with all the junk that's
75:38 in space should we created a program
75:42 that drags all that junk out of the sky
75:44 so what I have a bunch of particles up
75:46 there you know if you haven't been to
75:49 deep thoughts radio calm please go
75:51 there's video audio locked Facebook
75:53 group and patreon always appreciate you
75:56 guys stopping by if you've always been
75:57 an audio listener and you can ever watch
75:58 the videos there's no reason why you
76:00 have to see me talk in black and white
76:02 but it does provide a mechanism for you
76:05 guys to comment and so I definitely
76:07 welcome you guys aboard because I know a
76:09 lot of you have epiphanies while you're
76:11 listening to the show and have nothing
76:12 to do with what I've said or they're
76:14 much better takes on life than what I
76:15 have been able to construct in these
76:18 episodes so I want to hear what you had
76:20 to think anyway take care of yourself
76:23 and someone else and I'll see in the
76:24 next deep thoughts over now
