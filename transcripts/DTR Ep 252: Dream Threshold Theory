00:34 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:37 gentlemen as you can see today we're
00:41 gonna be talking about something a
00:42 little eccentric that I'm calling the
00:44 dream threshold theory so I've been
00:51 brewing up a new episode on dreams
00:55 because I've been dreaming like crazy
00:57 these past several months and I mean wow
01:01 like the most incredibly real continuous
01:05 dreams I've had perhaps in my life and
01:09 what I mean by that is they're
01:13 continuous and there's more continuity
01:16 in them than in previous dreams that I
01:20 can remember meaning usually you know
01:23 every time you go through a door jam and
01:26 a dream you exit an environment into
01:28 another environment your ability to keep
01:31 that other environment that you were in
01:33 stable architectural speaking socially
01:38 who's in the room with you it starts to
01:42 rewrite itself so that if you were to go
01:44 through a door Jim and then turn around
01:46 and go back through it and expect to
01:49 find what you were experiencing
01:51 personally for me it's usually fairly
01:55 inconsistent that's why when you park
01:57 your car in a dream and you go inside
02:00 and you do something then you sure to
02:01 come back out and find it there's always
02:03 that frustration of where the hell's my
02:05 car and then when you can't find it
02:07 because it's been written out of the
02:08 script your brain goes to the next
02:11 assumption which has been stolen
02:13 you know it's been towed away now if
02:17 you've watched my other episodes on
02:18 dreaming you'll know that I have a
02:20 consistent question that I've been
02:22 unable to answer to my satisfaction
02:25 until recently and that's what this
02:27 episode's sort of driven by and the
02:31 question that's been haunting me forever
02:32 is why do we have to dream and it was
02:37 driven by one of my dad's army buddies
02:39 who said when I was probably about its
02:43 armor somewhere between 11 and 12 he
02:45 said I think going to sleep is the
02:47 biggest waste of time and that's really
02:50 you know when you're an entrepreneur
02:53 when you're really excited about life it
02:54 is a pain in the button
02:56 I'm sure the Steven Spielberg and all
02:59 those people that have had high moments
03:01 in their life where they're creating
03:02 something with their time they all feel
03:04 exactly the same but I think I might
03:06 have an answer now what's really funny
03:13 about these questions is there's there
03:15 are things that are right under our nose
03:17 that we don't see because we don't have
03:20 a different approach to it in our minds
03:22 and then somebody or something
03:26 serendipitously
03:27 tells us to think differently first
03:31 what's second and all of a sudden we
03:34 know that the emperor is not wearing any
03:35 clothes right
03:36 this is gonna be one of those kind of
03:38 episodes hopefully what do we generally
03:43 think about when we think about dreaming
03:44 I think most of us realize you're asleep
03:49 most the time no obviously plenty of us
03:53 daydream but the real good stuff well
03:58 that's some good English for you but the
04:01 good stuff is all related to being in
04:05 your REM sleep your random my movement
04:08 phase a dream specialist will tell you
04:12 over and over that you as soon as you
04:13 hit Delta sleep wave you no longer dream
04:18 they're looking at your brainwaves
04:19 Stanford Sleep Center if that's the case
04:23 then I must
04:25 very rarely ever get to a delta because
04:29 again I have continuous dreams all night
04:31 meaning I will go to sleep a dream will
04:33 randomly begin and then I dream dream
04:36 dream a dream and then I wake up I roll
04:38 over some I'm tired on one side and then
04:40 I go back to sleep and the dream
04:44 continues
04:45 and it might restart to be a different
04:47 location or whatever but that continues
04:49 pretty much until I wake up in the
04:51 morning the only I don't know I don't
04:55 know how that continues continuously for
04:58 me but then again I don't think I've
05:00 ever slept like most people sleep like a
05:03 shitty sleep the Dreaming is sleeping
05:05 and sleeping is because we get tired
05:11 don't we why do we get tired I mean
05:16 seriously you can explain it to yourself
05:18 of like well of course you've been up
05:21 and you've been working and of course
05:22 you need to rest because we all feel
05:25 this cycle every single day however when
05:28 you go to sleep your body's a hundred
05:30 percent if it were to be 98 percent you
05:34 probably died right well I'm gonna skip
05:36 a few heartbeats
05:37 I'm going to not send you no immune
05:40 system messages around the body we're
05:41 just gonna like we're gonna take a day
05:43 off on this autonomic system right nope
05:48 your body keeps going 100% and then if
05:53 you really experiment with your
05:54 consciousness and being tired and your
05:57 person like me who's done several thirty
05:59 six to forty eight-hour days which a lot
06:02 of folks do a lot more than that like
06:04 truckers and stuff and soldiers when you
06:08 lay your head down you are experiencing
06:12 a very detailed version of being tired
06:16 you ever been so damn tired you can't
06:18 get to sleep and you're just sitting
06:20 there almost swimming in your bed you
06:21 know what I have found when I get to a
06:24 36 hour moment is when I put my head
06:27 down on the pillow I feel what I believe
06:30 to be my soul falling further so if I
06:33 late you know horizontal a bit I lay my
06:34 head Susan my head hits the pillow I
06:36 feel my consciousness continue to fall
06:39 and then for whatever reason my body
06:42 recaptures it it falls at recaptures
06:44 that it falls you know it's like my body
06:46 is saying you know don't lose connection
06:48 with the so you will you know but isn't
06:52 it interesting that if you lay down in
06:55 the bed you ever had this happen I'm
06:57 sure and you went over 30 had this
06:59 happen you lay down and you have not
07:02 moved and you spent the majority of
07:06 eight hours laying down in bed and
07:08 breathing slowly and not exerting your
07:10 muscles and you're really not thinking
07:11 of much
07:12 hello daydream here a little daydream
07:14 there but you're not falling asleep you
07:16 never lose consciousness completely and
07:18 therefore you never dream and then you
07:22 get up and you feel like you haven't
07:24 slept but you went through the motions
07:27 and then of course if someone says well
07:30 how do you feel you'd be like man I
07:31 didn't sleep last night you didn't sleep
07:33 no well what were you doing well Ike and
07:36 I went into bed I laid down I didn't
07:39 move but I didn't go to sleep I didn't
07:43 dream I didn't have anything happen I
07:45 did lose consciousness basically but we
07:48 don't really track the fact that that is
07:51 what sleep really is is losing
07:53 consciousness so what is losing
07:58 consciousness
08:00 you know I saw getting knocked in the
08:02 head and passing out but what is losing
08:06 consciousness think about the phrase you
08:09 lost your consciousness where did it go
08:12 well if you're asleep you went off to
08:15 Dreamland whether or not you remember
08:16 the dreams or not I hope that everyone
08:18 has one but your body must let go of
08:23 your soul for you to feel sleep and I'm
08:30 just gonna use soul and consciousness
08:32 interchanged freely I'm considering them
08:35 synonyms of each other isn't that
08:38 fascinating isn't that fascinating we
08:43 all know that we get tired okay now I
08:47 could be up all night M and use my hand
08:49 for four days straight
08:52 typing painting building something but I
08:57 don't ever feel like my hand is tired
08:59 right I don't you know if you stand up
09:01 all day at a trade show or something you
09:04 go to Disneyland from 8:00 in the
09:06 morning until 2:00 in the morning
09:08 your feet will hurt they're not
09:12 necessarily tired they're just hurt you
09:17 can stretch your muscles out you stretch
09:20 your thighs out and then they don't want
09:22 to function and so you just you think of
09:25 sort of like well I need to get my
09:27 muscles a chance to to rest to
09:30 reconstitute you're sore for two days a
09:32 two-second days the worst but you're not
09:35 necessarily saying that your muscles are
09:37 tired right what's going on is you've
09:40 torn the muscle and it needs to heal and
09:43 that's why you know it builds up over
09:46 time right now I'm gonna hit you with a
09:49 bunch of ideas in this episode here but
09:51 here's the key kicker okay now we know
09:55 that being in this world it seems to be
09:56 very regimented and it's extremely
09:58 detailed right when you go into the
10:01 dream world it's very free-flowing and
10:03 almost a caricature of reality and
10:05 anything can happen and I mean anything
10:07 could happen it does seem to be limited
10:09 by your ability to imagine what could
10:11 happen in some cases I although you know
10:16 I know we've all had dreams where you're
10:18 like oh my god this is amazing
10:20 yeah there's psychologists that would
10:23 say that you know your subconscious
10:25 streams up a bunch of stuff on its own
10:27 and then you're essentially taking back
10:29 doors to see you know what's behind the
10:32 scenes like the the making that were the
10:35 coming soon' stuff right and I'll liken
10:38 it to that moment when you find out a
10:41 sequel was made to a movie that you
10:43 loved usually the sequel has a little
10:47 bit more of a punch to it than the
10:48 original film but you see a movie
10:50 trailer and you cannot believe that the
10:53 right thing happened recently I just
10:56 discovered the Super Troopers from 1999
10:59 I believe was 2000 was just sequel and
11:03 I'm very excited because that first move
11:06 he was great and then I watched the
11:07 trailer and it's all the original cast
11:08 members amazing I don't know if the
11:12 blonde cop girls in there but the main
11:15 crew is there from the police precinct
11:17 to the original one and it feels great
11:19 but now one form of reality this one you
11:25 get tired and in the other one you're
11:29 living that other reality and you're
11:31 resting isn't that wild this is a
11:36 reality it makes you tired and that's a
11:38 reality that makes you feel rejuvenated
11:40 now how many times in this reality have
11:44 we had something we had to really pay
11:46 close attention to and it made you
11:48 exhausted right you're doing some
11:51 homework you're driving a driving in bad
11:55 conditions right some winter driving man
11:58 you got to hang on that steering wheel
11:59 you got to pay attention to what's over
12:01 the over the hood of your car you might
12:04 die you got to really pay attention
12:06 you're in a conference with somebody and
12:08 you are having to pay attention every
12:13 word you say you get exhausted right and
12:16 then there are some things you can do in
12:18 this world that make you feel so relaxed
12:22 and you soft experience it maybe you're
12:26 floating on a noodle in a lake like Lake
12:29 Havasu it's a hundred and fourteen out
12:32 there but it's a dry heat you got your
12:34 favorite drink in your hand everyone's
12:37 just chilling on a noodle or a blow-up
12:39 chair or whatever you're gonna pool and
12:43 you're totally relaxing you got some
12:44 resort the water is calming your
12:47 frequency down you're still doing
12:50 something but you're relaxing hmm so the
12:55 reason why that happens in this reality
12:57 is due to the amount of calories of
13:01 energy and thought cycles that are going
13:03 to your mind to do the complex one when
13:07 we're chilling out in Hawaii in some
13:09 Lagoon sipping on some pineapple rum
13:11 drink you're not doing much you're
13:14 relaxing right but what are we taught
13:18 about the difference between
13:20 this experience and the dreaming
13:23 experience we're taught this one is
13:25 quote unquote
13:26 real man and the other one is a dream
13:29 it's fake it's a facsimile I mean we
13:34 know that if you you know one of the one
13:39 of the glorious things about people who
13:41 have been injured okay if there is
13:44 anything Laureus about their reality you
13:47 lose a limb
13:48 you can't walk anymore but you did and
13:50 maybe maybe you could see but you're
13:52 blind
13:53 now you're whatever I have heard plenty
13:58 of reports that say that folks have
14:00 reported well I love dreaming and they
14:04 say why it is because I can walk again I
14:06 can dance I can use my hands
14:10 figuratively am I in my dream I can hold
14:14 someone I'm free I can fly interesting
14:18 right the thing is is if I were to say
14:23 this is a real reality and the other
14:26 one's a fake reality they're still
14:28 lecomba denominator word in there and I
14:31 know I'm being selective in the words
14:33 but if words were symbols of meaning
14:35 then the meanings are always going to be
14:37 in the description of those two
14:40 hemispheres right you could mix up the
14:42 words but at some point there's a symbol
14:43 that means reality whether you call it
14:47 real or fake this is a reality and
14:50 dreams are reality so they're kind of
14:56 the same thing right if you have oil
15:00 paint and you have acrylic paint it's
15:03 still paint
15:04 it's just achieved through different
15:05 means something it creates a hopefully a
15:08 relatively permanent mark when applied
15:10 to a surface this one is super detailed
15:14 and usually in life things that are
15:18 super detailed that you do are
15:20 exhausting because it takes more effort
15:22 to do something that's more detailed now
15:26 you could be you know slightly more
15:30 excited by it because it's creating a
15:32 dopamine draw
15:33 your body is creating an endorphin drop
15:35 in your body and that'll make you feel
15:37 high so it sort of counteracts the pain
15:41 of some incredibly meticulous thing you
15:44 might be doing maybe you carve something
15:46 maybe you paint maybe you're drawing
15:47 with a really fine pin maybe you're
15:50 doing some body maneuver that's that's
15:52 requires a lot of attention ballroom
15:54 dancing or something you're driving a
15:55 car 200 miles an hour around and a loop
15:59 but in the dream state it's nice because
16:02 it almost seems like you know most of us
16:06 dream lying down and what's interesting
16:09 about it is usually you have some form
16:12 of comfort when you're achieving sleep
16:14 you're warm
16:15 in the outside world and so when you're
16:19 in your dreams you're sort of floating
16:21 around your dream whether you believe
16:23 you're walking or not or driving you're
16:25 really not paying much attention to your
16:27 feet they don't really exist right you
16:29 never you never get sore feet in a dream
16:32 it's hoped because your body really
16:35 doesn't exist once we created video
16:38 games where we could fly a camera around
16:40 a reality it was probably the most dream
16:42 like facsimile of dreams because you
16:47 just got a camera and you can walk
16:48 around now we have virtual reality that
16:49 even makes it more like a dream when you
16:52 put those goggles on you're not
16:53 necessarily walking anywhere especially
16:55 if you use half the half the programs
16:57 that are out there you have to zap the
16:59 ground in front of you and then your
17:00 body teleports because they really can't
17:02 make you walk because the technology
17:04 kind of sucks here's what I'm gonna
17:07 suggest to you they're the same thing
17:11 they're the same thing reality is
17:15 reality no matter how you splice it and
17:18 this is gonna open up a sort of a
17:20 Pandora's box for us the deep thinkers
17:24 to contemplate how far could this go now
17:28 I just completed in another show about
17:29 you know are we God where I describe a
17:33 lot of my other existential thoughts and
17:35 other videos so we're gonna go with
17:38 again that your true consciousness
17:41 however it really occurs we're not quite
17:44 sure but it is your soul it is
17:47 your mathematical cloud that is you it
17:50 has a sort of a neuron artery back to
17:54 all the other neurons in the universe
17:55 and through that collection of sort of
17:59 you know a AI tree some neural net it
18:06 can access all information in the
18:08 universe as long as you can build the
18:10 query meaning if some alien lived on
18:14 some red planet a long time ago and you
18:16 never knew that that existed unless you
18:20 literally randomly throw darts in your
18:22 brain to create a query okay red alien
18:25 has a blue dog and lives on a tiny
18:27 planet the size of the earth vegetable P
18:33 you know you're not going to find that
18:35 information out because you don't know
18:37 that it exists but if you look back on
18:39 yourself and you eat Indian food and
18:40 you're like oh my god I'm having that
18:42 memory again gosh cuz this pattern of
18:44 this consciousness of a flavor of a
18:48 smell is going back and creating the
18:52 query for you I was going to sleep the
18:55 other day I'm going to digress into this
18:56 little visual I have when I was going to
18:58 sleep I was thinking of memories and
19:01 sort of how that works and I got this
19:05 full-blown Gestalt epiphany of exactly
19:08 what it looks like to send a query into
19:10 the universe it just just absolutely
19:13 showed up in my mind and what you need
19:15 to do is draw like a kind of like a
19:19 flower petal our flower excuse me a
19:22 flower with five petals on it and the
19:25 center of the flower where you would
19:26 have the brown in a sunflower is the is
19:31 where the conduit is it's sort of where
19:33 the the rod of the neuron is that goes
19:36 to all the other neurons in the universe
19:38 and each petal of the five is the five
19:41 senses and the query is built based on
19:44 stacking these things together so if
19:46 you're saying look I'm smelling iron and
19:48 oil and I'm seeing red and whatever you
19:54 stack these things up on each other and
19:55 then you send it down the wire or you
19:58 send it up the wire
19:59 and all it's doing is it's looking for a
20:01 pattern match in your historical records
20:04 of existence
20:05 meaning it's gonna go back up to your
20:07 usually your past then it'll say oh yeah
20:09 I remember this you were at your uncle's
20:11 workshop and he was spray-painting that
20:15 old 66 Oldsmobile red you were smelling
20:19 the paint and you had the rust and the
20:21 oil and the soot from this crazy garage
20:24 and it was 8:00 in the morning so you
20:27 had sort of that do ish summer smell and
20:30 as soon as the patterns lock then it can
20:33 send back the data package that goes
20:35 right here with perhaps a copy of what
20:39 it bumped into that match with all the
20:40 other senses and all the other
20:41 information I thought I'd share that
20:45 before I lost that now for those of you
20:48 who believe the universe could be a
20:49 matrix I think that may be what we have
20:53 done is we have created this sort of
20:55 pseudo illusion for ourselves that it's
20:57 a computer it's a matrix but it's not a
21:01 matrix built out of you know intel chips
21:04 it's not a matrix built out of some
21:06 quantum computing thing right which you
21:09 know twenty thirty years from now that's
21:11 gonna sound hokey as hell
21:12 it's like someone bragging about radar
21:15 in the 40s but the make sure matrix
21:18 could be simply built out of what we
21:20 recognize as consciousness in one form
21:24 of consciousness it's hard and rigid
21:27 there
21:28 there there are arms and legs there is
21:31 pain and pleasure I'm sitting out here
21:34 right now and it's probably about 60
21:37 degrees it's overcast so today is a lot
21:40 cooler than the video I made yesterday
21:41 when it was about 75 and sunny when I
21:47 dream I typically dream about the dark
21:50 whatever I'm doing it's dark but I don't
21:53 really consciously say oh my gosh I
21:55 can't see what I'm doing I'm never I
21:57 never need a flashlight it's somehow lit
22:01 to an extent I don't get lost or it's
22:04 kind of dusky and what's really strange
22:06 is at times throughout the year because
22:07 I'm always involved in crazy projects
22:10 that require me to be awake for a long
22:11 time
22:12 I do sleep during the day a fair number
22:15 of weeks out of the year consecutively
22:18 I just finished a 3d project where I was
22:21 working for two weeks creating 3d art
22:25 and I was staying up till like 8:00 in
22:28 the morning and then sleeping off the
22:30 entire day which sucked and then I wake
22:32 up in the dark and then it's dark and
22:34 it's cold and California that's not
22:36 where we're living for here but it's
22:38 just what the what the job required like
22:41 constant constant work but now think
22:44 about me going on and on other videos
22:47 about etheral particles and gravity is a
22:49 push not a pull you know which is again
22:52 Faraday and Tesla and dollard's theories
22:56 and perhaps all those particles all
23:00 those cloudy little things that make
23:03 things exist in this particular universe
23:05 are kept together through some consensus
23:09 as we've talked about several times a
23:11 consensus reality right now perhaps a
23:15 larger consciousness that never sleeps
23:17 or sleeps on a much bigger cycle than us
23:20 right you know we live a little pity you
23:23 know pitiful little 80 to 100 year lives
23:25 if we're healthy but what if the
23:28 consciousness that is holding this
23:29 particular bubble of the universe
23:31 together is on a you know a trillion
23:34 year sleep cycle so a lot can get done
23:38 in one little moment of consciousness
23:40 and it's not looking for you know
23:43 payback or anything it doesn't need to
23:45 eat it just is and so it holds the whole
23:47 thing together so the matrix could be
23:51 built out of layers and layers of
23:53 consciousness but perhaps the reason why
23:57 we're getting tired perhaps the answer
24:00 to the question I've been seeking is
24:02 merely that it takes me personally and
24:05 you personally and us personally a
24:07 tremendous amount of energy to proceed
24:12 every blade of grass I can see every
24:15 leaf I can probably see in my view wreck
24:18 right now if I just do a pan like this
24:21 I'm probably looking at almost a million
24:24 Leafs
24:25 little tiny leaves from the shrubbery
24:27 the palm trees these couple trees around
24:30 me the vines that are all over in my
24:31 backyard I'm probably looking at nearly
24:34 a million leaves that's a lot of work
24:37 I'm looking at definitely millions of
24:39 Blades grass and the Leafs that have
24:41 fallen on the grass here because we had
24:43 a big windstorm a couple weeks ago every
24:47 nuance of everything I look down to
24:49 concrete that's underneath me here and
24:51 all the little tiny specks that make up
24:54 concrete clean concrete concrete with
24:57 some soot cuz it rained a few weeks ago
24:59 or a week ago think about the details
25:02 that we notice as living beings well no
25:08 wonder we're tired and that's before we
25:10 get to our contextual reality which is
25:13 you know I am a guy and I am X number of
25:17 years old I've got responsibilities I
25:19 have friends and I've got a child and
25:21 I've got a you know people in my life
25:23 that are important to me that I take
25:24 care of and etc etc you have the same
25:28 thing I had an interesting thought the
25:31 other day because and I've never I don't
25:35 think I've ever mentioned this which is
25:37 good for this particular episode have
25:40 you ever heard about these people who
25:44 are anorexic or bulimic and there's two
25:47 kinds there's folks that just need to be
25:49 thin in their mind because they're in
25:50 show business or whatever and then there
25:53 are folks that see themselves in the
25:55 mirror as being heavy as being fat and
25:59 they start starving themselves however
26:03 they want to do it either not eating at
26:04 all or throwing everything up and no
26:07 matter how emaciated they get no matter
26:09 how their bones together of their chest
26:12 cavity right their torsos are just just
26:15 concentration camp looking stuff they
26:17 still think they're fat they're best
26:20 friends they're lovers say honey you
26:23 look great you just need to put some
26:24 more weight on eat a sandwich right but
26:27 we say they see themselves as fat and we
26:30 compartmentalize it to them but we don't
26:33 take that theory up into a deep thought
26:37 into a discussion
26:39 so let me throw this at you because this
26:43 hit me yesterday and I thought oh my god
26:45 is that that whole thing about someone
26:48 being able to see themselves different
26:50 it's amazing now let me ask you this
26:52 okay that's where you're gonna have your
26:55 little Epiphany you ready for this how
26:59 many times in a moment of like beautiful
27:04 confidence and what people some people
27:06 might call vanity you look at yourself
27:09 in the mirror you've done your hair you
27:14 put the right clothes on you know like
27:16 it's nothing there's nothing better than
27:17 when your favorite clothes are clean
27:19 right shirts are pressed your dress is
27:21 pressed whatever you got the right
27:24 amount of Sun on your face it's good
27:26 there's no blemishes any pimples today
27:30 you look in that mirror and you look
27:32 amazing and you're like you know what
27:35 I'm gonna do I'm gonna take a picture of
27:37 myself I want to remember this night
27:40 that I look damn good and sometimes you
27:44 can take that picture and it turns out
27:47 exactly like you thought it would you
27:50 look damn good back to put a little
27:52 filter on your image and you look even
27:54 extra better right but have you ever
27:57 taken a picture of yourself when you
28:00 thought you look good and you look at
28:01 the picture and you're like oh my god I
28:03 look like [ __ ] what's the deal I look in
28:06 the mirror you're like wife right there
28:09 I look fantastic and then my phone and
28:11 look like crap and I'm not talking about
28:14 the fact that cameras don't get the
28:16 right lighting and sometimes you know
28:18 you don't already go like you're looking
28:19 at yourself in a particular angle and
28:21 you're getting your face in a weird
28:22 angle so you're looking at geometry you
28:25 don't normally see and then you realize
28:31 there's almost like two realities it's
28:35 like the camera doesn't lie but it's
28:37 like you're your brain is lying about
28:39 how good you look because you're having
28:42 a great moment you feel so good inside
28:45 that it's almost as if we can be us
28:48 ourselves in the opposite direction that
28:49 someone who views themselves as fat
28:52 is doing they're doing it in a negative
28:54 way but you're doing it in a positive
28:56 way but the camera is like dude I'm just
28:58 looking at you and it's almost as if
29:01 your mind knows when you look in the
29:03 mirror that's you I know that you're
29:07 looking at a reflection of yourself
29:09 and so I'm aiding you and feeling good
29:11 about the way you look but you look in
29:14 the camera on your phone and for
29:16 whatever reason your mind is like I know
29:17 this isn't a reflection this is a
29:19 picture these are pixels of you hmm
29:23 and so there's no embellishment so you
29:28 tended to go and your relatives and your
29:32 friends look at you in the picture okay
29:34 and they're like yeah that's the way you
29:36 look we love the way you look what's up
29:38 you know why are you freaking out over
29:40 your image and then it struck me and
29:44 this might be more of an exercise for
29:46 the brain than a reality but imagine
29:49 this for one second imagine that we
29:53 really don't have a body it's only our
29:56 imagination that makes it I mean you
30:00 don't have a full body in your dreams
30:02 even though you'll imagine you have
30:03 hands and you'll imagine that you're
30:05 running you don't really feel your thigh
30:07 muscles pushing your body forward you
30:11 don't feel your the pitter-patter of the
30:13 bottom of your feet you just don't pay
30:17 attention next time you dream if you
30:18 think you do you won't feel your
30:20 extremities you're a consciousness kind
30:23 of sphere emulating all of the
30:27 constructs of what you think you are
30:29 when you're in this particular reality
30:31 which is a lot more intense it's the one
30:34 that makes you tired so imagine for a
30:37 second that you and I in this world are
30:43 exactly the same thing now to make it
30:47 easier on your brain you could think of
30:49 it as a generic mannequin it's not
30:52 necessarily feminine it's none it's not
30:54 necessarily masculine but we perceive
30:59 ourselves somehow during the formation
31:01 of the embryo into this reality what
31:05 that stage is because we do have
31:07 memories of being small that's what's
31:09 interesting we start out small and then
31:12 we get bigger and then we lock our
31:15 height and our weight for a few years
31:19 until we get older and then we got a
31:20 fight to keep our same size going but
31:23 what if your vision of yourself is
31:26 projected to me from your brain when I
31:29 look at you I am seeing the echo of what
31:32 you view yourself to be and you're
31:35 seeing the echo of what I view myself to
31:37 be now that's not to not to address the
31:41 mirror illusion the mirror issue I just
31:43 mentioned where you see yourself better
31:45 there might be times when your brain
31:47 creates a feedback loop to yourself and
31:49 it could be that you have a halo of
31:52 affecting other people into thinking
31:54 that you look better than you really
31:55 look who knows depends on you're exuding
31:58 frequency your electromagnetic field of
32:01 distortion I say electromagnetic as a
32:05 metaphor not as a literal reality now
32:10 let's take that one step further isn't
32:15 it interesting that men seem to age a
32:18 lot slower than women women age really
32:21 quickly and it doesn't matter if a
32:22 woman's had a child or not women
32:25 typically get wrinkles quicker they they
32:30 just age quicker now if a woman has a
32:31 lot of babies one thing you need to
32:33 understand and I think men need to
32:35 understand this and be proud of it and
32:38 women need to understand this and be
32:39 proud of it if I'm completely wrong
32:41 about this whole illusion thing out
32:43 which I'm gonna go to this next level on
32:44 a woman a woman excuse me his bill to
32:49 give life right
32:51 a man contributes to the process but he
32:53 doesn't carry the child a woman is
32:55 giving all of her DNA and the husband's
32:58 DNA to this child and so her resources
33:02 are strained right you give up some of
33:06 your bones some of your flesh you know
33:08 see it osteoporosis more in females
33:10 because they have given life they're
33:14 given a portion of themselves and that
33:15 might upset about the applecart balance
33:18 of their own supply you know there's
33:22 that there are the theories that if you
33:24 were to abuse drugs and this is the case
33:27 you know there's a lot of scientists out
33:30 there that say that aids is really not a
33:33 disease it's just a classification of
33:35 the diseases that you die from
33:37 apparently there's like 38 diseases that
33:40 if you die from the disease exclusively
33:42 then you died of that particular disease
33:44 let's say pneumonia but if you die with
33:47 pneumonia and you have this HIV positive
33:49 thing they call it AIDS and it's because
33:53 your immune systems given up they're
33:55 finding out that it it they found
33:58 actually if discovered this in the
33:59 mid-90s the there's 600 viral
34:01 specialists that say the AIDS has been a
34:03 complete sham on the people and they
34:06 they make a completely convincing
34:08 argument and I don't mean maybe
34:10 convincing a completely convincing
34:12 argument that says by the time you're
34:14 tested for HIV you don't have any harm
34:18 or risk of dying of HIV you've already
34:21 developed the antibodies to HIV and if a
34:24 virus is gonna kill you it's gonna kill
34:26 you in three weeks so if you're tested
34:28 for HIV and you're positive you are just
34:31 carrying HIV there's a giant percentage
34:35 of folks that have been classified to
34:36 die of AIDS that don't have any HIV and
34:38 that's impossible if the tor interlink
34:40 there's not a single paper in the world
34:42 that links HIV to AIDS because age is
34:44 not a real disease it's a classification
34:46 of other conditions that you have when
34:49 you die but they're finding out that
34:51 people who abuse drugs who abuse their
34:55 dopamine levels and again Parkinson's
34:59 it's actually a dopamine deprivation so
35:05 you don't make enough dopamine which is
35:06 why you start shaking and the drugs to
35:08 treat Parkinson's is to give you more
35:10 dopamine so if you put that together
35:12 that'll help you a little bit but there
35:15 are I'm just gonna go on this little
35:18 tangent here for a split second because
35:20 little little loopback
35:21 ezt is the number one thing that kills
35:23 people who are diagnosed with HIV so you
35:26 get this harmless diagnosis diagnosis
35:28 according to these scientists of HIV
35:29 then you get on one of the most deadly
35:31 drugs and the
35:32 which was actually banned back in the
35:34 60s when they invented it it's basically
35:36 a you know it's a it's like chemotherapy
35:40 is what it is but it kills everyone in
35:42 like two years if you take a ziti you'll
35:44 be dead within two years usually within
35:46 the first year so if you take a ziti out
35:49 of the equation and you just say I'm HIV
35:50 positive then you're maybe you give HIV
35:53 to somebody but they're not gonna die of
35:55 it but there's a lot of abuse and drug
35:59 use which is why they say you catch aids
36:02 from drug use
36:03 now you just blew out your immune system
36:06 with drug use almost sexual males use
36:08 something called poppets I guess and
36:10 it's this little bottle looks like an
36:12 energy drink and I guess they twist it
36:13 off and smell it or something it's like
36:15 a whippet but the the active drug that
36:19 makes them have the high is known for
36:21 absolutely destroying your t-cells
36:23 so all these guys having to do this
36:26 because they're so satisfied with their
36:27 choice in life they end up dying of an
36:29 immune system deficiency which think
36:32 it's classified into this AIDS bucket
36:33 right but back to our dream theory one
36:37 of the other things it's a reality for
36:39 the difference between male and female
36:41 when it comes to self perception
36:43 especially today okay and I think it's
36:47 been going on for hundreds and hundreds
36:49 of years is that women are taught to
36:55 worry about their looks even past the
37:02 years of needing to get a mate to have
37:05 their children you know you'll meet some
37:07 women who've had X number of children
37:10 and they're completely satisfied and
37:12 they may want it more but you know it's
37:14 a toll on your body right so let's say a
37:18 woman is constantly waking up looking
37:20 for wrinkled and worried about having
37:23 wrinkles right they'll I've heard
37:27 wrinkles called stress lines you know
37:30 and it really has to do with that
37:33 particular definition is if you know
37:36 your face is a sort of a record of the
37:39 expressions that you make on your face
37:42 over time I used to work with this
37:46 woman that would suck on her bottom lip
37:50 and she had the Nutcracker marks from
37:54 her from the side of her mouth down to
37:56 the bottom of her jaw and I'd sit there
37:59 in watch her and she would just suck the
38:00 bottom of her lip during conference I
38:02 started doing a company gathering she'd
38:06 sit there as soon as she got nervous she
38:07 started sucking on little tiny girl so
38:11 she didn't have a lot of real estate
38:11 because she's a smaller girl to
38:14 counteract any of that stuff I needed to
38:16 go for a long time that her whole family
38:19 on one side of her family does this
38:21 frown when they're surprised like oh my
38:24 gosh and they'll do this frown at the
38:26 same exact time and so she has carved
38:29 just mountains out of her from her nose
38:33 to the side of her cheek out of that
38:36 expression you'll notice that I have you
38:39 know the two little Devil's horns over
38:42 my between my eyebrows so now I'm doing
38:46 this kind of intense thing because I'm
38:48 intense intense dude see my episode on
38:50 being a tense from season one so we have
38:53 muscle memory it's like you're building
38:55 up your biceps on your face but over
38:58 time you start to stress your epidermis
39:01 in a way that it starts to police all
39:03 the new cells that come into life on
39:06 your face that's why people like Botox
39:08 because Botox cuts out all the ability
39:11 to stress but now imagine if we're in
39:14 some some sort of created reality which
39:17 we've talked about several times on
39:18 different episodes maybe just maybe if
39:23 we're imagining what we look like and
39:25 passing that pattern of perception that
39:28 we have self perception we have to
39:30 others then maybe women are constructing
39:33 age simply out of a psychological
39:36 condition that's been in in you know
39:40 forced on them by society that says you
39:43 must be pretty forever because we saw
39:45 makeup we sell hairspray and hair
39:48 products and dresses and jewelry
39:52 it's no mystery that women's clothing
39:54 costs two to three times more than men
39:56 and it's made horribly
39:58 it's made from pee it falls apart
40:01 quickly
40:02 you can't just wash it you can't take it
40:04 to dry cleaners and you might get you
40:06 know if a guy's pair of jeans can be
40:08 worn you know a thousand times before
40:10 they have to throw it away I'll be it we
40:13 do wear clothes way longer than we
40:14 should a female equivalent she might
40:17 have fifty to a hundred times she can
40:20 wear her clothes before it's gonna
40:21 absolutely just shatter away men
40:25 generally overall don't give a crap what
40:28 they look like on average you know we
40:30 just do the bare minimum and then we go
40:33 on with our life and if you think about
40:36 life before the sort of destruction of
40:40 the family unit in the 70s by the
40:42 Rockefellers where women were and don't
40:45 get pissed at me but you were convinced
40:47 that being in the rat race of a job it
40:50 was the the way that you convince
40:52 yourself that you're a good human being
40:54 just such a crock they had they were
40:58 housewives and they sat home and they
40:59 thought about being all these things
41:01 that men didn't have any time to think
41:03 about right because we were out earning
41:04 the money right but every time you gotta
41:08 earn that money so we get you know the
41:11 best looking woman before we get the
41:12 best woman then once you get you you got
41:13 to keep her and then you want to keep
41:15 your kids happy because they're cute
41:16 little things and they deserve to laugh
41:18 and and have a good time at Disneyland
41:20 right nature is very interesting this
41:23 way you know the birds that are male
41:27 birds they like the Red Robin is a male
41:29 but the female Robin is like a brown
41:32 bird it's like a very generic bird
41:35 because the overall genetic programming
41:38 of a male is to procreate procreate and
41:42 it is just driven in us and it's not you
41:46 know there are there are genes in us and
41:49 chemicals in us that's that create that
41:52 spawning sensation we must make children
41:54 but even after all the children are here
41:56 there's usually two realizations in a
41:59 man let's say a guy's 50 years old
42:01 they'll still want to make kids even
42:03 though they don't want the burden of it
42:04 so they kind of say well
42:05 okay I'm gonna have sex but I'm not
42:08 gonna try to create a child not that I
42:09 don't want it but you know I'm getting
42:11 old and I want my kid to have a good
42:13 young father and so I've passed those
42:16 years you know if you have a child of 50
42:19 then your child's 20 when you're 70 and
42:21 you know you know Larry King doesn't
42:24 give a [ __ ] but some folks you know when
42:27 you have a lot of money you can do that
42:28 Donald Trump can do that indefinitely
42:29 and make sure he's got plenty he has
42:31 plenty of money put away for that kid to
42:33 make up for not having the father run
42:36 after he passes but most of us don't and
42:40 we don't want to put our kid out into
42:41 the world without a father
42:43 boy or girl too soon
42:45 but they get on there get on their feet
42:47 plus you want to enjoy your child's life
42:49 you want to see it you don't want your
42:50 child you know graduating college and
42:53 then you die you know it's kind of
42:55 shitty I think it's interesting that
42:58 when you meet people that are very sort
43:00 of non-critical they typically look
43:04 pretty good yeah they're just bouncing
43:07 around life life is so busy they don't
43:08 have a time to think about what they do
43:10 they look bad but those who consistently
43:15 criticize themselves well you know
43:19 they're stressing themselves out it
43:22 could be just you know forget everything
43:23 I'm saying about this dream thing it
43:25 could just be a biological reality if
43:27 you're stressing over yourself stress
43:29 doesn't create young cells stress
43:31 creates cancerous cells it's got a chill
43:33 out let those that love you love you for
43:36 exactly who you are and not what you are
43:40 and I think you know a good kind of off
43:43 on a tangent ear but the good definition
43:45 of a spouse either way is that they you
43:50 know they love you despite your age
43:52 hopefully you're not you know you know
43:56 in some thirty year gap between your
43:57 spouses I'm not judging but you know if
44:00 you're dating someone re married to
44:02 someone that's within a reasonable age
44:04 of your age you're kind of both going
44:05 through the same thing but if one of you
44:07 seems to be quote unquote winning
44:10 according to pop culture in the youth
44:12 game you can't smoother skin than he
44:14 does with her skin than she does amen
44:16 you should be looking into the soul
44:18 because
44:19 that's the forever stuff right but back
44:22 to our theme what could it mean long
44:25 term if this is a reality this is I'm
44:31 sorry I shouldn't use that word this
44:32 time around if this is true that all
44:35 reality is really the same thing it's
44:38 just we have a different flavor of it
44:40 this one's really intense I mean it is
44:44 it makes us exhausted and again you you
44:48 could on a on a scientific level on a
44:52 monetary level say well dude when you're
44:55 in this reality we have to pay bills we
44:59 could get hit by a car and on the other
45:02 reality we don't do anything but exist
45:04 just have fun you know hopefully I don't
45:07 having nightmares and all I would say
45:10 that that is maybe we have constructed
45:13 bills in this reality maybe we have
45:16 constructed pain in this reality we've
45:20 also constructed pleasure what I think
45:25 is interesting is that I've said in one
45:29 of my episodes about dreams probably
45:30 dream realms that I don't experience
45:33 pain in my dreams really the only time I
45:36 ever experience pain is when I am fine
45:39 of actually feeling pain in the outside
45:41 universe and this particular hardcore
45:44 reality and it bleeds into my dream
45:46 reality okay but it's interesting how I
45:51 felt pleasure in my dream reality
45:54 created by the dream reality you know
45:57 this isn't necessarily a popular thing
45:59 to say and most YouTube channels but you
46:03 have the dream that's called the wet
46:04 dream right it's where you actually have
46:06 as a boy and orgasm in your dream and
46:09 you wake up and something has occurred
46:10 in the real world I've had that happen
46:13 to me one time in my entire lifetime and
46:15 I think I was about seven or eight years
46:17 old I think and but what was funny was
46:21 is that I was dreaming of a house that I
46:24 used to live in when I was five and it
46:26 really wasn't a sexual dream it was
46:30 interesting I was in the utility room
46:33 my old house in Chanute Kansas and
46:37 somehow I jumped up on the washer and it
46:40 was hit nothing deal with the cycle
46:42 running it wasn't running as far as I am
46:43 known and there was a woman or girl or
46:46 something that kind of grabbed me and it
46:49 was just instantaneous I jumped on this
46:51 thing this person grabbed me this girl
46:54 I can't there was no real face to the to
46:57 the person so it really had no identity
46:58 it was like a dream friend it was a very
47:02 good dream friend I guess and it was
47:04 like BAM it happened I woke up and I was
47:06 like oh my god you know you're a little
47:07 freaked out at first and then you you
47:10 don't even know what to call it and of
47:11 course you find out later there's a
47:12 cultural name for it I've had a friend
47:15 of mine who will remain completely
47:17 obscured and nameless he always said to
47:20 me that he had them all the time all the
47:24 time he's a really positive guy and I
47:27 think that was interesting in the real
47:29 world he was extremely positive and
47:31 always looking on the bright side and he
47:33 claimed to be having these constantly I
47:35 don't know if he was blowing smoke or
47:37 whatever I think he was telling me the
47:38 truth because he was sort of
47:40 communicating to me that are you having
47:43 this too because I'm having this and
47:44 it's really strange and it's actually
47:46 embarrassing and I have to watch out how
47:48 I wake up and they said you're excetera
47:51 right so I think it's interesting that
47:54 there's a map between the two my map is
47:58 very exclusive I feel pain from this
48:01 world this reality this intense one into
48:04 my fantasy reality which we call like
48:07 the loose one where you're resting right
48:08 and I feel pleasure the opposite
48:12 direction and the only other maybe
48:15 subtle kind of subatomic reality is that
48:20 if I am very comfortable in this world
48:24 in a really nice bed you know you put
48:26 your flannel sheets on and winter and
48:27 the house is just the perfect
48:29 temperature I typically have really good
48:32 dreams I feel extremely physically
48:34 comfortable in my dreams very warm and
48:36 it's just a really effortless existence
48:40 we're always talking about on this show
48:42 that perhaps we control this reality
48:44 probably tired of me saying it
48:47 over and over again it would seem that
48:51 this reality is one of convergence with
48:56 other folks the one big difference
48:58 between this hardcore reality that makes
49:02 us tired and the reality that is created
49:05 in dreams that makes us feel rested is
49:07 that you have access to other souls in
49:11 this particular reality or at least you
49:15 believe so and I think that the
49:17 distinction and the proof of that is
49:19 that and again there's no proof okay
49:24 the idea that gives us this impression
49:26 is that we are we have a friend let's
49:29 say I've got a friend here and I know
49:31 them and we talk and then I say see you
49:35 later
49:35 I'll see you in one week and then we
49:37 leave we live our life day to day and
49:39 then we have a bunch of dreams let's say
49:41 we have seven dreams for seven days they
49:44 have the dreams I have the dreams and
49:45 then we come back together and we
49:47 compare notes about the dreams and they
49:49 were not in my dream and I was not in
49:50 their dream in fact we don't really
49:52 recognize anyone in our dreams they're
49:54 always brand-new people but we seem to
49:57 return back to this life exactly where
49:59 we left it if you didn't pay a bill the
50:00 bills still not paid if you you bought a
50:03 new car the car is still in your
50:04 driveway
50:05 but in that reality where it's
50:07 loosey-goosey there's no you might dream
50:10 of the same sort of place the sort of
50:12 feeling you know but it's it's all new
50:15 when you dream but when you come back
50:18 here you compare notes and you think
50:19 well this one must be real and that one
50:21 must be fake hmm well maybe one of the
50:26 major distinctions about this particular
50:28 reality is that you remember to bring it
50:32 all back you remember everything there's
50:34 never a point where you wake up and you
50:36 go where's my car
50:38 oh I Drive this now holy [ __ ] I thought
50:41 I bought a Mercedes the other day was so
50:43 weird right but what if that's the only
50:47 distinction that makes us feel like this
50:50 one's real that we that we literally
50:52 have somehow the capability of
50:54 memorizing everything that happens in
50:56 this world and then it goes back to that
51:00 thing of
51:00 maybe there's only one consciousness in
51:02 the entire universe then it goes back to
51:05 my my episode on you know perhaps there
51:07 is only one consciousness in the whole
51:09 universe and it's you and you only think
51:12 that you're with a bunch of people but
51:13 you're not this channel is a very
51:17 interesting litmus test for this theory
51:19 because you're watching me through some
51:22 electronic technique I'm recording
51:24 myself now and I could publish this
51:26 episode in a year and you get to see
51:28 what I said a year ago it could be that
51:33 this is a communal epicenter of multiple
51:38 consciousness that work together to
51:40 create this reality and the reason why I
51:42 can go to sleep and wake back up again
51:44 and it's generally real I mean I'm sorry
51:47 it's generally the same way I left it is
51:48 because while I'm asleep a bunch of
51:51 other people are remembering the
51:52 universe and because one mind is
51:54 infinitely powerful all we need is one
51:57 of us to be awake but it would seem that
52:00 if this theory has any meat to it any
52:03 legs to it is that the dream world is a
52:07 separate location that's sort of the
52:09 sandbox this playground where you get to
52:11 mess with everything and you're sort of
52:13 by yourself to do with what you want
52:15 you'll dream of your spouse and your
52:17 kids in a dream crazy wonderful
52:20 experiences like I often will dream
52:22 about my daughter and I at amusement
52:23 parks but if I called her up I know that
52:29 she doesn't have the same exact
52:31 experience she's not gonna say oh no I
52:33 did not see you last night on Space
52:36 Mountain in it so and so forth think
52:40 about the fact that we have this Mandela
52:41 effect that we believe might be
52:43 occurring big giant pieces of society
52:47 that remember things differently maybe
52:51 that's a slip I want to loop back on
52:55 Mandela effect cuz there's no way I'm
52:57 gonna creating a second episode to make
52:58 this point so I gotta throw it in here
53:02 we all have our favorite Mandela effect
53:05 for me it's Eli Whitney being white and
53:09 for those of you who missed it
53:12 Eli Whitney virtually every single
53:16 person in the world I've ever talked to
53:17 which is probably a couple dozen about
53:19 Eli Whitney because the gentleman who
53:22 invented the cotton gin
53:23 remember I'm being taught to them in
53:25 history class as a black man and it was
53:27 irony that a black man created a machine
53:30 that got rid of the cotton pickin
53:33 industry for the slaves now there's a
53:35 peanut guy too but I have a family
53:39 member that made an invention based on
53:42 the cotton gins mechanism he wasn't a
53:45 cotton piece of equipment at all but it
53:48 was taught to me and it was literally
53:49 the day I remember the day I was taught
53:51 this I think in third grade and it was
53:54 when I understood irony but there's the
53:59 one about Star Wars that for a long time
54:04 James Earl Jones remembers the line as
54:06 Luke I'm your father and the line that
54:08 we have today is no I'm your father
54:10 and for since I learned about the
54:13 Mandela effect and learned about that
54:15 particular one and then watched the
54:17 special of James Earl Jones saying Luke
54:19 I'm your father and recounting when he
54:21 first saw the line and for thirty years
54:23 he's been saying that and there's videos
54:24 of him that conferences saying it Luke
54:27 I'm your father and now it's know I'm
54:29 your father
54:29 what's interesting about it is I
54:31 remember it as Luke I'm your father I've
54:32 been in plenty of writing classes that
54:34 we'd call it the Luke I'm your father
54:36 moment which is if you can create that
54:39 in a script where you make the audience
54:42 reassess every fact they've ever learned
54:45 in the script up to that point you're an
54:49 amazing writer you've had a lucky
54:50 amazing moment right but the line
54:54 preceding that line is something that I
54:57 remember quite clearly as well which is
55:01 Luke saying he told me you killed him
55:05 when you preface this claim of Luke I'm
55:10 your father versus no I'm your father
55:11 with the line he told me you killed him
55:15 it has to be no I am your father
55:18 because to follow it up with he told me
55:21 you killed killed him with Luke I'm your
55:24 father
55:25 you could say it but it doesn't make as
55:28 much sense as saying it no I'm your
55:29 father it's like no I didn't kill your
55:32 father I am your father so that line
55:34 makes complete sense to me so I remember
55:36 I mean you can see it in I can see it in
55:39 my head just photo-real him hanging on
55:42 to that that platform he's on with his
55:46 chopped off hand and you know he's got a
55:49 big frown on his face and his teeth kind
55:51 of look you know would Chucky and he
55:55 said the line you know that's impossible
55:57 so we'll clean up that theory in my
55:59 brain but yeah Eli Whitney being white a
56:01 white guy from Yale it doesn't even make
56:05 any sense to me
56:06 a guy from Yale I guess moved to the
56:08 south and I guess observed plantation
56:11 cotton pickin and had this epiphany you
56:15 know you usually have epiphanies about
56:18 mechanical things when you're deeply
56:20 experienced in a particular art and a
56:23 guy who is picking cotton and watching
56:25 how his hands are grappling cotton off
56:28 of the branch because it's it's not the
56:31 easiest thing to do I've I've had a
56:33 cotton you know branch in my hand at
56:35 once and trying to pull this stuff off
56:37 and it's not exactly easiest thing and
56:39 someone thought okay we'll create these
56:41 wires that bang into the to the branches
56:44 and the branches will not be inclined to
56:47 come off but the sticky cotton the
56:49 fibrous cotton will stick to these wires
56:51 and it will be yanked off the branch
56:53 makes complete sense to me but not a guy
56:55 who hasn't picked cotton for a very long
56:58 time to see this but I guess the dude in
57:01 this reality
57:02 must have gone down and watched a bunch
57:04 of hands touch cotton and came up with
57:07 this idea to speed up the process thank
57:10 God
57:11 so one reality makes you tired and
57:13 another reality makes you rest one is
57:16 extremely detailed and full of burden
57:18 and the other one although you can have
57:20 a frustration dream or a stress dream as
57:22 you might call it that you know doesn't
57:24 do you any good when you wake up most
57:27 the time it's not like that
57:28 you only have periods of that kind of
57:29 stuff we tend to take stress from this
57:34 world and work it out in the other world
57:37 it's very interesting because
57:39 we have a compartment compartment where
57:42 they're not this theory is right or
57:43 wrong doesn't matter we still have a
57:44 compartment a quarantined area where you
57:47 have dreams and it's your area I've had
57:51 situations where you know I'm worried
57:53 about something and I will take it into
57:55 my dream and it's either realized in an
58:00 in a way that the worry is legitimized
58:03 or it's it's completely vindicated out
58:07 of existence and I'm like oh yeah I just
58:08 needed to see it from a different
58:09 perspective and now when I wake up I
58:11 don't have this worry anymore because
58:13 I've had you know more of a perspective
58:16 by sort of working it out
58:19 but the other thing I want to leave you
58:21 with before we close up this episode is
58:23 that life I think and I've alluded to it
58:26 in one other episode if you can break
58:30 down all of life into symbols of meaning
58:33 it will do an amazing job to your
58:37 perception of reality which is you know
58:41 when I like career manage people from
58:43 time to time and it's always what I
58:46 always tell people is you know don't
58:50 worry about being a fireman or a doctor
58:53 worry about don't worry about anything
58:56 but come to grips with what you are as a
59:00 human being are you a taker or are you a
59:03 giver that's the first question and the
59:06 second one is do you like to help people
59:08 or take advantage of people because
59:12 that's usually the subset of those are
59:13 the two you know one of the interesting
59:16 things is when society gets privileged
59:18 like American society gets privileged
59:22 you'll have a bunch of people and this
59:24 has been a trend for twenty thirty years
59:26 I will because I you know I wanted to
59:30 create things I'm an engineer no matter
59:32 what it is I want to engineer a drawing
59:34 is an engineering process you know if
59:37 you mix and a lot of right brain and it
59:39 becomes creative and amazing you're
59:40 right music you're engineering a song
59:42 you know there's all kinds of credits
59:44 about arrangement
59:45 well arrangement is engineering the
59:48 attention and release loops the voice
59:50 leading of a piece of musical material
59:53 right figuring out well the brain can
59:55 handle this sound for a little while and
59:57 then I should probably give them a
59:57 little break some Victorious you know
60:01 major key crescendo and then we'll go
60:04 into a minor key for the break and it
60:05 pops back out you know it's Red Hot
60:08 Chili Peppers is really good to hear
60:10 rock music that does this where they'll
60:12 have this really kind of minor key
60:15 verses that go into this major key break
60:18 and then they go and then when the solo
60:20 comes in it's all this kind of cranky
60:22 minor key stuff and then boom right back
60:24 out through the through the chorus it's
60:27 all major key stuff and you just feel
60:29 that tension and release is beautiful
60:31 right
60:32 but cymbals are amazing usually
60:38 everything that we do is a symbol when
60:41 and I'm gonna give you some kind of
60:45 extreme examples here but you know a
60:50 career has all kinds of symbols of
60:54 accomplishment but our intimate
60:57 behaviors with each other are very
60:59 interesting in that love is usually a
61:03 sense of purpose in terms of you are
61:08 protecting and you are giving you are
61:11 supplying what you're supposed to supply
61:12 especially from a man perspective a
61:14 mother with a great maternal instinct
61:18 what is the maternal instinct it is a
61:21 symbol of giving it's very very simple
61:24 remember purposes love and love is
61:26 purpose right but think about the
61:30 extremes when I was a young kid I had a
61:34 really really hard time understanding
61:36 the concept of rape when I was a child
61:39 because again when you're a child you
61:42 don't think about doing something
61:43 horrific like that right and I remember
61:46 asking my mom is a child why do you guys
61:49 do this
61:49 you never hear it from a female to a
61:52 male I think this probably cuz upper
61:53 body strings but females a little bit
61:55 more relaxed about that need to
61:57 procreate or just to have some you know
62:02 physical satisfaction but my mom told me
62:06 she said
62:07 it's all about control and that went
62:11 over my head I did not understand that
62:12 for decades because I was probably under
62:14 10 when that I got that answer and after
62:19 watching you know these prison shows and
62:22 these crime shows and you know you get
62:25 to crawl into the head of these guys
62:27 that are answering questions about it
62:28 all it took me decades of hearing these
62:31 guys testimonies to finally go oh I get
62:35 it I don't understand you I don't have
62:37 that exact problem but I get why you
62:42 know it's usually a guy that is a little
62:44 awkward
62:46 what case of Bill Cosby it is it is the
62:50 taboo of control taboo is another symbol
62:53 of thought you get into taboo things it
62:56 can be anything the drinking water
62:57 upside down is taboo and so you do it
62:59 you get the taboo symbol in your system
63:01 you create taboo symbols however you
63:03 create taboo symbols right kids are all
63:07 into the taboo not necessarily anything
63:11 you know really outrageous but think
63:13 about it they want to symbolically defy
63:16 their parents as soon as they start
63:18 feeling this rite of passage which is
63:20 nothing more than their need to take
63:22 control over their life because they
63:23 believe that they have at least enough
63:26 knowledge from their parents from
63:28 society from their own chewing up a fax
63:30 and observing reality that they can
63:32 handle it all and there's no need to
63:34 surrender this control because we all
63:36 have that push to be free and the right
63:40 of passage is the push to be free within
63:42 a child right for Harvey Weinstein it
63:45 was most likely a push for I can do
63:48 things that other people can't do and
63:50 it's taboo symbol and it's probably a
63:54 little bit of the control symbol but
63:58 it's also some version some sick version
64:00 of I have money and money gives me power
64:04 I can buy attorneys to get out of this
64:06 problem right it's funny it's lightly
64:08 raining right now it's really crazy I'm
64:11 in total Sun but there's I can see this
64:14 tiny pitter-patter of rain coming down
64:17 pretty funny
64:18 well when it comes to your dreams those
64:21 symbols are readily accessible you can
64:25 you can do whatever you want in your
64:27 dreams because you're not really hurting
64:29 anyone even though you're not really
64:31 consciousness I'm conscious of it unless
64:33 you're having a lucid dream as soon as I
64:36 realize that I'm having a dream and I'm
64:38 lucid which doesn't happen very often I
64:41 immediately start flying no matter where
64:44 I am and I won't necessarily fly really
64:47 high high up in the air there's
64:48 something about that that's sort of too
64:50 spooky for me it's you know why fly
64:53 10,000 feet in the air because there's
64:55 nothing up there right I'm gonna be
64:56 looking at clouds or something like that
64:57 it's usually flying around the group of
65:01 people that I'm with sort of thing but
65:04 to symbolically come back to the theory
65:06 and then come back to the reality that
65:08 is this thing that you're seeing me in
65:11 the idea is control if you believe in
65:17 the secret like I've mentioned several
65:19 times recently and you believe in sort
65:22 of this ability to pick the next second
65:24 of your life this might be at the heart
65:28 of that mechanism to say well this
65:33 reality is the one that makes me
65:35 exhausted the other one is the one that
65:37 makes me feel rested so all I need to do
65:40 is start to loosen up my attitude
65:43 towards this reality a little bit and
65:47 understand that maybe because I I
65:50 respect the relationship of these two
65:52 universes that I appear to live in the
65:54 seeing in this yang but I have a lot
65:57 more control over this universe than I
65:59 think I do and because I don't think I
66:01 or I should say because up until it may
66:04 be this moment you haven't believed that
66:06 this is possible because there's no
66:07 evidence there's no clues that you could
66:10 be doing this you haven't been able to
66:12 do it now the one thing I always lean
66:15 back on and I said it once before which
66:17 is um we do have mentally insane people
66:21 in this world and if there's any benefit
66:25 we can get out of their existence it
66:28 would be that even if you are apps
66:31 lutely delusional and you could you
66:33 could actually pull into this group
66:37 folks that are on really intense drugs
66:39 that are making them believe that they
66:41 are something different than they are
66:44 you know there was a gentleman who
66:46 played Superman back in the 50s in
66:48 America and apparently it's reported two
66:53 different ways he committed suicide by
66:54 jumping off of a building according to
66:57 my father's research because he was a
66:59 huge fan of this gentleman and a huge
67:01 fan of the Superman franchise as a child
67:03 in the 50s he learned that the the actor
67:08 had developed a point where I guess he
67:11 thought he could fly or he thought that
67:13 he could do this it's represented in the
67:15 movie with Michael Keaton which the name
67:18 of the movie escapes me but it's the one
67:20 it's like Birdman it's Birdman where he
67:22 lives this dual life where he is this
67:24 it's sort of confusing in the movie but
67:26 he plays a superhero that's called
67:28 Birdman on it on movies or television or
67:30 something like that and he ends up
67:32 actually living both the lives and he
67:35 flies around and does things
67:37 when no one's looking and then is he
67:41 tells his family members that he's doing
67:43 this and he got divorced I think because
67:45 of it or something like that but it's a
67:47 very interesting thing to think that if
67:50 our willpower is the only thing that
67:52 keeps us in this reality and if we're
67:55 able to undo it am at it with our
67:57 imagination that all sudden anything can
67:59 happen then we look at people that are
68:01 suffering from mental illness and we
68:02 think well why aren't they flying why
68:04 aren't they turning into whatever it is
68:05 they believe they are you know it used
68:07 to be this well schizophrenia is a very
68:10 interesting reality and it was in the
68:14 movie altered states with William Hurt
68:17 he has line in there of course someone
68:20 else wrote the script who had a lot of
68:21 research under the underneath her belt
68:23 that schizophrenia very often leads to
68:26 the belief that they are Jesus Christ
68:29 and what's fascinating about that
68:32 statement is you might assume that
68:33 everyone who has that vision is
68:36 Christian and all they're doing is
68:39 manifesting their fictional character
68:41 into reality
68:43 as a form of mental insanity right but
68:47 we don't see them suddenly walk on water
68:49 turn water into wine the movie excuse me
68:54 this the TV series Twilight Zone The
68:56 Twilight Zone is actually a scientific
68:58 theory which is the mezzanine between
69:00 consciousnesses between this reality and
69:03 your dream reality there's a mezzanine
69:05 layer between the two and Rod Serling
69:08 was a genius to name a series that say
69:10 this is where you're sort of in this
69:12 reality but things go a little funky
69:14 like a dream that's why every single
69:16 Twilight Zone is a brilliant twist at
69:18 the end the other reality is this you
69:23 will go to sleep next to your spouse at
69:24 night and you will be cutting logs next
69:26 to your spouse your spouse can look over
69:29 and you're asleep and you might talk to
69:31 yourself you might shake your leg and
69:34 they're not seeing your body disappear
69:36 you're still here at least as we
69:41 remember when we wake up right if
69:42 everyone else is just your memory in
69:45 your imagination when you come back then
69:47 maybe even this is not true but so far
69:49 we don't see people vanish out of
69:51 existence so if someone is in a mental
69:56 institution and they're talking to
69:57 themselves having these conversations
69:58 with beings in the room that no one else
70:00 can see there may be a mezzanine of your
70:04 consciousness whereby you do maintain
70:06 this body here maybe it's maintained by
70:09 other people thinking about you maybe
70:11 it's maintained by that global
70:12 consciousness which is the operating
70:14 system but your soul is out there
70:16 floating around those that talk in their
70:20 sleep well they have this little silver
70:21 cord that goes back to the body and
70:23 reports back in and they don't quite
70:25 sever the umbilical cord during sleep
70:27 and so their mouth kind of mimics what
70:29 they're saying in their dream it's like
70:31 having a little uh you know telephone
70:33 back to your body the interesting symbol
70:37 of our existence in 2018 is that we're
70:41 having sort of this renaissance of
70:43 consciousness in mankind right now and
70:46 it's fueled by the internet which is
70:48 Shrunk the world considerably right it's
70:51 getting smaller and smaller and smaller
70:54 we're hive mining more than we ever have
70:57 in the past and I think that those of
71:01 you are paying attention to social media
71:02 platforms because we have globalists
71:06 losing this death-grip they've had on us
71:10 just like Princess Leia talking to
71:12 Tarkin and saying the more he squeezes
71:14 the more we slip out through his fingers
71:16 that's a beautiful metaphor for what's
71:19 going on right now so they're trying to
71:21 sabotage their own platforms to make
71:23 sure that the communication we have
71:26 between each other is harder to acquire
71:30 there's what they call what is it shadow
71:35 censoring where they don't get rid of
71:37 your videos or anything they just make
71:39 them not show up in any of the Google
71:41 searches you don't see them in your feed
71:46 searches now if you're a subscriber to
71:47 this channel and you search on moon hoax
71:49 my video will probably pull up in your
71:51 channel because you have gotten there
71:54 early enough that you're linked to me
71:56 and so they try to make sure that you
71:58 don't sense that there's any censorship
72:01 going on but someone who's never seen
72:02 the show they've never linked to it they
72:05 may have a really hard time finding this
72:07 until they really really type in the
72:09 right words or you referred to somebody
72:11 and they type in deep thoughts with
72:12 radio and they find it at that point
72:15 you're in the crowd but they're like hey
72:16 overall we're keeping 99.9% of the
72:20 population away from information and
72:23 again it's hardly my show is the big
72:25 epiphany but you know journalists that
72:27 are amazing journalists that really talk
72:29 about current issues and are really
72:30 pushing things forward I'm all about
72:33 expanding your brain right to think of
72:36 things a little bit differently and to
72:37 show you examples in the world ward
72:38 world world such as the hoax of the Moon
72:40 mission so that you realize Scott you
72:43 know they do lie Jesus Christ do they
72:45 lie but while we have this opportunity
72:49 we can inject ideas into each other and
72:52 ideas are beautiful symbolic metaphors
72:56 of reality
72:57 that allow us to chain link other
73:01 epiphanies together that would never
73:02 have been linked together before and
73:05 let's say you hear me in 2018 and say
73:08 2020 they've destroyed YouTube and
73:11 there's no other video service able to
73:14 launch because it costs too much money
73:16 to serve video over the Internet but you
73:21 have this idea passed on by me who was
73:24 passed to me by somebody else maybe you
73:26 made a comment in a video of mine and I
73:28 made a video based on your comment and
73:32 this so it's just this beautiful
73:33 feedback loop and feedback loops are
73:35 interesting right when you hear someone
73:37 talking to a hot mic you know like Will
73:39 Ferrell and his his episode with it was
73:44 Ana Gasteyer gas towers her name you
73:47 talk and there's a little tiny reverb
73:49 when that goes from the mic into the
73:52 speaker out the speaker into the mic and
73:53 what happens with the feedback loop it
73:55 gets really crazy starts going up and it
73:58 starts squawking and you have to put
74:00 your hand over the mic to get it to stop
74:01 right you guys didn't hear what I just
74:03 said there's then but the idea is that's
74:07 what we're doing with our consciousness
74:08 right now and I want to make this point
74:11 because I can make a whole episode on it
74:14 but the idea is people are waking up in
74:19 a level that's amazing some people
74:22 waking up to the horrible globalist
74:24 conspiracies and some people waking up
74:27 like this show which is just think more
74:29 intensely think more global in in where
74:34 we are as a person as an individual
74:36 excuse me instead of thinking straight
74:39 constantly like you've got blinders on
74:41 you're able to turn left like my buddy
74:43 said meet and think 90 degrees to the
74:45 left to see something that isn't there
74:47 you know one of the one of the first
74:51 episodes of Doctor Who with Matt Smith
74:53 it was one of my favorite doctors up to
74:56 this point I've seen every episode that
74:58 I could get my hands on since 1963 he
75:01 had a creature and it's there's there's
75:03 a Thin Man conspiracy out there as well
75:06 that does this too but there was this
75:09 sort of sneaky creature in this
75:10 apartment complex that you couldn't see
75:12 by looking straight at it you could only
75:15 see it out of your peripheral vision and
75:17 I think that that was a beautiful
75:19 metaphor for waking up is
75:21 that you're able to see things in your
75:23 peripheral vision things that you
75:25 typically ignore you know the frame rate
75:27 of our peripheral vision is faster than
75:29 the frame rate of looking straight you
75:31 also don't see 3d and you're on your
75:34 side because you don't have the right I
75:35 can't give you an image on what you're
75:37 seeing with your left eye and vice versa
75:39 so you can't create a stereo image and
75:41 the reason why the frame rate is faster
75:44 in your peripheral vision then you're
75:46 straight forward vision is that when you
75:47 have a predator coming up on your left
75:49 you need to know and you need to turn
75:52 your head and get the stereo depth of
75:54 field to figure out is that line really
75:56 far our way is it right on me do I need
75:57 to do something about this should I go
75:59 run and hide etc if you want to test
76:02 this theory I'll give you a cool little
76:04 experiment I teach my students you got a
76:06 ceiling fan in your house lay on your
76:08 bed look up at the ceiling fan look on
76:11 it straight ahead and you get that sort
76:12 of blurry rotation thing that we draw
76:14 with animation right the old propeller
76:17 from like a Disney Steamboat Willie sort
76:19 of thing and then turn your head left or
76:24 right to put those fan blades in your
76:26 peripheral vision all of a sudden you'll
76:28 see the blades turn smoothly because
76:31 your frame rates coming up it's very
76:32 interesting that's sort of what we're
76:35 doing here with our consciousness we're
76:37 speeding up the frame rate and we're
76:39 also what what happens when you speed up
76:42 your frame rate have any of you thought
76:44 about the fact that slow motion cameras
76:47 even though I'm saying slow motion the
76:49 camera is not going slower the camera is
76:51 going faster it's taking more frames
76:53 than you typically get in your eye at 60
76:56 frames a second and so when we play it
76:58 back at 60 frames a second those million
77:00 frames of the bullet going through the
77:02 coke bottle you can see it you know they
77:06 film what is it photons going through a
77:07 bottle and you get to see light travel
77:11 for the very first time in your life
77:12 it's cool and that's sort of what we're
77:15 doing on our conscious level right
77:17 anyway I know you feel me I love stuff
77:22 like this because it it can really
77:25 profoundly affect how you think about
77:27 reality from second to second and it's
77:30 not a negative it's a positive right you
77:33 learn about all these negative
77:34 conspiracy theory
77:35 you know you kind of travel around with
77:37 this sort of burning coal in your gut
77:39 that's kind of Jesus really reality man
77:41 I can't even believe this I got a deal
77:42 with people who think that you know
77:46 negative things happen when they really
77:47 didn't because it was all conspiracy it
77:49 was a manipulation it was a fake
77:50 massacre or whatever it's kind of a
77:52 bummer right you don't need those
77:54 cancerous frequencies in your body so
77:57 what I'm trying to do with this show is
77:58 give you very positive frequencies that
78:01 you can chew up for your whole life
78:03 that's what I do me talking to you
78:06 through this show allows me to feel like
78:08 I'm sort of bringing people on board to
78:12 think like this and again it's no
78:13 conclusive thing I'm not trying to
78:15 convince you one thing as real or not
78:16 cuz man I'm not I'll let you know if I
78:19 completely believe something or if I
78:21 just I'm postulating this but I want you
78:24 guys to have subject matter that you can
78:26 think about it's just really fun and
78:28 again my theory of the universe is that
78:32 if there's ever gonna be a single human
78:34 being that figures out something ultra
78:37 profound about reality I believe it's
78:40 going to come out of the mouths of a
78:41 child
78:42 boy or girl doesn't matter they are
78:45 going to just look at reality and
78:47 they're not going to have all these
78:48 predispositions all this constraint of
78:51 thoughts that we we give kids remember
78:54 when you're born every day that you're
78:56 alive your mind is being closed and it's
78:59 these opportunities in society like this
79:02 Renaissance 2.0 of consciousness that we
79:05 start to undo these predispositions
79:08 these constraints on our on our mind to
79:12 open it back up again right every
79:15 conspiracy theory that's out there
79:17 that's ever happened to us as human
79:18 beings has been based on the fact that
79:20 some you know government agency
79:22 manipulating the press is telling you
79:24 that reality is this particular way this
79:27 guy attacked the World Trade Centers and
79:28 da-da-da-da-da and by having an open
79:31 mind and folks that have have had this
79:34 worked out you know I'm often
79:36 referencing Hunter s Thompson came out
79:40 on the the morning of 9/11 and said
79:42 follow the money and you'll find out who
79:44 did this
79:46 why did hunter arrest Thompson have that
79:48 capability because he had seen some
79:50 conspiracies in his lifetime and even
79:52 though he wasn't allowed to report on
79:54 all of them he still knew that this was
79:56 bogus
79:56 and that being told by the press on the
79:59 morning of exactly who did this when
80:01 your average homicide takes weeks and
80:03 months and years to maybe solve he knew
80:07 something wasn't right we need to be all
80:11 hunter s Thompson's right we need to be
80:15 able to see a hoax when we see it
80:17 because in the end you remove a lot of
80:19 negativity out of your system because
80:21 you're being sold this what do they call
80:24 it the is it the Galleon dialectic or
80:27 whatever it's the probably saying
80:29 they're wrong but it's the problem
80:31 reaction solution that David Icke talks
80:33 about a lot you deserve to be free in
80:36 your mind you deserve to be in complete
80:37 control of your mind you don't need to
80:39 be lied about global warming without the
80:42 capacity to research at all and so we're
80:48 getting better we're healing we're
80:50 absolutely healing as a society and if I
80:53 tell you a little story about dream
80:54 reality versus this reality and it gets
80:57 you to get the symbol in your mind that
81:01 things are not always as they seem that
81:03 reality is stranger than fiction
81:05 then you will approach everything that
81:08 you're told everything that you thought
81:09 with that discerning mechanism in your
81:11 mind right when people try to police the
81:14 way that you think and they say no no no
81:16 this this piece of World War two history
81:18 is exactly this way and you're like you
81:21 don't know that right
81:23 the facts that you believe have largely
81:25 been debunked scientifically it's an
81:29 impossibility the things that you
81:30 believe about world war ii well I don't
81:33 want to have to go do research because
81:35 effort bothers me it makes me tired
81:37 right and you get invigorated by seeking
81:41 the truth you like to get those negative
81:43 frequencies of lies out of your system
81:45 and you want truth to be in there that's
81:48 why you have hunches about truth because
81:50 you just your total line of crap and
81:51 you're like I don't know I don't know
81:53 exactly what the truth is but that
81:55 doesn't feel true
81:57 right why do religious people
81:58 continually tell you that their Messiah
82:00 is the one because they're nervous
82:02 inside inside they don't believe that
82:05 it's true and so the way that they fight
82:07 that is through repetition like a
82:09 criminal who did a crime constantly
82:11 saying they're innocent trying to
82:13 convince their insides that the lie is
82:15 actually a positive frequency and it was
82:18 actually true that they didn't do the
82:19 horrific thing that they did but they
82:22 did and the the real the reality of
82:26 those sort of lies is that they never
82:28 ever ever feel like truth ever with that
82:34 will in the show if you dig the series
82:37 please go to deep thoughts radio.com
82:39 remember there are other seasons out
82:41 there too some of the episodes in season
82:44 one I think are some of my finest work
82:47 and some of them have under 200 views
82:50 which sort of is interesting and I get a
82:54 lot of viewers that will say you should
82:57 do an episode on this or this and I hope
83:00 you've seen the episode I did exactly on
83:02 that oh no I haven't seen that so one of
83:05 the keys if you can hear my voice is
83:07 that you must understand that the
83:09 podcast has everything so go to the
83:11 website deep thoughts radio com click
83:14 the RSS feed on your phone and you'll
83:16 get the the podcast if you're on Apple
83:18 phones there's a link to iTunes if
83:20 you're an Android and go straight to
83:21 Google Play if you just click the RSS
83:23 feed it will find the the podcast radio
83:26 you got on your phone you'll be set up
83:27 so definitely if you did one of the
83:30 shows you know look at the subject
83:32 matter if it's absolutely something you
83:34 know you're gonna hate don't listen to
83:36 it if it's a curious title and you're
83:38 not quite sure give it a give it 10
83:40 minutes to see if there's in the twist
83:41 at the beginning that will entice you to
83:43 continue because I think that above all
83:47 it's not that you need to believe what I
83:49 believe at all it's that if I get you to
83:52 contradict me with your own thoughts and
83:54 their well-formed thoughts and you've
83:55 done your research
83:56 then I really want to hear from you
83:58 contradicting me I don't consider that a
84:00 negative thing at all plenty of people
84:02 in the comment section that don't agree
84:04 with me and I love it because that you
84:06 can change my mind
84:07 you know I've the stuff that I used to
84:09 believe in episode
84:10 one all the way to this episode right
84:13 now it's phenomenal you know when I
84:15 started the first first episode on the
84:20 fundamentals of the universe I believe
84:21 at the time I believed in the the pole
84:24 version of gravity and now I no longer
84:27 believe that the other things that I
84:30 believed in was like expanding earth but
84:32 when I heard about Flat Earth for that
84:34 brief moment when I was completely
84:36 enticed by that theory and was really
84:39 looking up at the sky going oh my god it
84:40 could be a flat earth right
84:41 I hadn't cross-referenced it with my
84:44 belief and expanding earth for those of
84:48 you are supporting me on patreon I want
84:49 to say thank you I am just so that you
84:51 guys know I'm gonna be posting some
84:52 exclusive content in patreon the way
84:56 that that's gonna work is that I have
84:57 I've probably recorded I try to do the
85:00 math on it I would say easily 30 hours
85:03 worth of episodes that you've never
85:04 heard because either they were crap or
85:07 some part of the technical chain of
85:11 events the ecosystem between the
85:12 computer or the camera
85:14 failed usually it's the computer that
85:17 failed and so but actually I've actually
85:21 recorded 30 minutes of an episode
85:23 without turning on the camera without
85:24 realizing it shut itself off because I
85:26 didn't actually turn it on so I've got
85:29 hours and hours and hours of episodes
85:31 that I haven't redone think I'm gonna
85:34 start turning into audio only access
85:38 episodes and I'm gonna be linking them
85:40 directly to the patreon account so those
85:43 of you are contributing can get a little
85:44 extra bonus for your your wonderful
85:46 sacrifice I appreciate that
85:48 so that's it please comment in the
85:53 section down below if you've got any
85:54 good ideas or just some other epiphanies
85:57 about what we're talking about and I
85:59 will see you in the next episodes take
86:01 care of yourself in someone else over
86:02 now
