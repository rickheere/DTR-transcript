00:00 a windy day but it's the first nice day
00:38 we've had in a while so welcome back to
00:40 deep thoughts ladies and gentlemen
00:42 make sure my feet don't touch the bottom
00:44 of this microphone because it makes this
00:46 horrible bump noise then I cringe later
00:49 when I'm editing it I apologize for all
00:51 those things that have happened as well
00:54 I've changed my box from an audio box to
00:58 a Digidesign box and it's a much more
01:02 expensive box that Cool J gave me and
01:04 it's a little sensitive so if you've
01:07 been hearing my mouth sounds I do
01:09 apologize today I thought we would talk
01:12 about something that will sadly probably
01:16 not attract a lot of people's attention
01:17 and in the title of the episode but is
01:21 extremely important and it would be
01:24 something around the lines of like
01:27 finding your real purpose now I say on
01:29 the show the purpose is love and love is
01:33 purpose something I distilled out of
01:34 doing episodes on love and on purpose
01:37 and also their kind of stuff and I just
01:38 figured out for myself
01:39 I'm probably very late to the game on
01:42 that but when do you feel the most love
01:45 it's when you wake up and you have that
01:48 push in your chest the reason why you're
01:50 supposed to bounce out of bed you're
01:52 excited you're a part of something
01:53 really cool something you created from
01:55 scratch something you joined either way
01:58 it could be both could be four or five
02:00 of these at the exact same time some of
02:02 the purposes that you could find are
02:04 purposes you have for your own internal
02:06 goals who you are as a human being what
02:08 you want to do you want to workout you
02:09 want to get smarter whatever you want to
02:11 do then you have goals that
02:13 up to your your friends you're starting
02:15 a business together you're just hanging
02:17 out and playing volleyball or softball
02:19 or whatever then of course there's
02:21 family when you start making one of
02:23 those things get married into one you
02:25 date into one you won't have children
02:27 soon as you have a child soon as you see
02:29 the head of your baby come out of its
02:31 mother or you are the mother and you're
02:33 seeing it for the very first time man
02:36 does your life change it's it's almost
02:38 as if God comes down and visits you on
02:42 that one day on that one second I said
02:45 that to a bunch of people because that's
02:46 why I felt I saw my daughter come on
02:48 like there was just this moment in time
02:51 that was unlike anything else I've ever
02:54 felt you know it's people that don't the
02:57 people who say they haven't seen or felt
02:58 the proof of God I would say you haven't
03:00 had a kid it's probably the case you
03:03 haven't any we're not there when your
03:06 child was born because when you're there
03:08 it's almost as if you get this
03:11 ceremonial visit from the big G OD it's
03:14 pretty funny but beyond the self and
03:17 friends and family you have your job
03:20 you're joining a really cool company
03:22 there's very few things that are more
03:24 exciting than joining a really cool
03:26 company to be honest we're a little bit
03:28 of in sexual work has already been done
03:29 if not a lot and all you're doing is
03:31 coming in bringing your talents on and
03:34 attaching your power supply to the motor
03:36 so that goes faster so that everyone can
03:38 reach their goal a lot quicker and when
03:40 I was a kid
03:41 purposes were really that simple that
03:44 primitive and today sadly because the
03:50 education is so bad the purposes are
03:53 really cloudy and weird right and I
03:57 won't spend much time you know trudging
04:00 around in the negativity of lost
04:01 children today because it's really it's
04:04 sort of like shooting fish in a barrel
04:06 to be honest it's too easy I want to see
04:09 just a bunch of archetypes for your
04:12 purpose right and all I'm doing is
04:15 you're gonna come to this episode and
04:17 you're looking at a vending machine with
04:19 the most exciting packaging you've ever
04:21 seen your life so if you like a lot of
04:22 prime colors and
04:23 cool Japanese anime on top of your candy
04:26 then that's what I'm doing if you would
04:28 rather see a more you know Louis Vuitton
04:31 looking thing then that's your thing
04:34 right if you want a bunch of greasy car
04:36 parts in there and that's your thing
04:38 right
04:39 imagine the vending machine of
04:40 everything that you would be turned on
04:42 by to live your life for not necessarily
04:44 as a consumer but a participant right if
04:48 you're a rocker you're seeing the most
04:50 incredible Les Paul's and I've been in
04:52 as bass and whatever and microphones
04:54 right record deals and platinum record
04:58 Awards and all this other cool stuff
04:59 right because that's your world I think
05:04 one of the most important things is to
05:07 choose your purpose you choose your
05:12 purpose right it's okay for someone like
05:14 me to bring you a bunch of choices and a
05:17 bunch of ideas but you have to be the
05:19 one that chooses it right and sadly in
05:22 the world right now we're you know the
05:25 kids that have these degrees that can't
05:26 get jobs you know they're having their
05:28 purpose sort of shoved into their
05:30 narrative shoved into their brain well
05:32 this is what you're about are you gay
05:34 well then gay is this and and gay gay
05:38 gay gay gay and they can't get away from
05:40 these certain weird things not saying
05:43 gay is that's really weird but I'm just
05:45 saying look don't let someone come in
05:47 and tell you what's going on with your
05:50 life right you have to choose what's
05:53 going on with your life right so this is
05:55 gonna be bright and fun and cool it's
05:59 going to combine things I've said in
06:00 previous episodes I'm going to say right
06:04 now and some of you are figuring this
06:06 out there's some excellent episodes in
06:08 season one if you are doing the count
06:10 from season from sorry episode one to
06:13 episode 100 and you cannot see one of
06:15 the numbers please let me know because
06:17 that probably means that due to the
06:20 copyright music problems which I use
06:22 maybe like 15 seconds to someone else's
06:24 song at the beginning in some countries
06:26 they're blocking access if you can't see
06:28 a number on your mobile phone you'll be
06:31 surprised you can actually see it on
06:32 your laptop it's just this weird thing
06:35 Germany has a huge problem with
06:37 copyright infringement problems with the
06:40 United States companies it'll just tell
06:41 me that no one in Germany can see this
06:43 video because you used 15 seconds of Kid
06:45 Rock music or something like that right
06:47 really set but the major point is is
06:50 there's a lot of good stuff in season
06:51 one I mean a lot of good stuff in terms
06:55 of finding a job you know going through
06:59 you know concepts of truth and denial
07:01 what it means to be awake and all those
07:03 kind of things
07:04 choosing your beliefs is a real cool
07:07 episode that I think helps you
07:09 understand that you you aren't always
07:12 formed out of your own ideas you might
07:15 wake up later on in life and realize
07:17 that I don't know 35 you are this way
07:19 and you feel comfortable but when you go
07:20 back into the inventory and ask yourself
07:22 when did this data get inserted into my
07:26 brain it's because your parents your
07:28 grandparents you you know before you
07:30 even could remember your past you
07:33 believed a bunch of stuff all right most
07:37 of us you know I have a pretty powerful
07:39 memory and I have least couple memories
07:42 for every age but around seven my life
07:44 just became a linear on switch I
07:45 remember it all and you know I can't
07:50 remember what age I was but there was a
07:53 point when you know I found out Santa
07:57 Claus was what he was and the idea was I
08:01 didn't really consciously remember much
08:04 of the belief in him except the
08:06 Christmas days which are burned into my
08:08 mind because my parents told me he was
08:11 real right it's important and when we
08:13 talk about our purpose here moving
08:15 forward part of it is to figure out what
08:17 you stand for
08:18 if you stand for anything ever if you
08:20 stand for you don't stand for something
08:22 you stand for nothing it's kind of an
08:24 interesting thing not everybody I guess
08:26 has to write we don't he'll have to be
08:28 really intense Revolutionary War people
08:32 right now let me tell you about purposes
08:35 before we actually try to trigger your
08:37 brain to finding yours one of the most
08:40 beautiful reasons why you want to find
08:42 your purpose is because once you find it
08:45 a lot of pain of working simply
08:48 disappears
08:50 the pain of getting up in the morning
08:51 disappears and that's a wonderful
08:54 feeling it's sort of like a mental
08:57 energy drink simply because you are you
09:01 are excited and that's really cool the
09:05 other thing is that purposes can be a
09:07 little freaky sometimes well I've never
09:09 done that before there's no way I could
09:11 do that I mean I'd love for that to be
09:12 my purpose but you know I got a bill to
09:14 pay and a kid to feed and that it uh
09:16 don't look up your heroes you don't what
09:22 does it Wikipedia which is obviously
09:24 full of a bunch of crap has some you
09:27 know basic facts about people's lives
09:29 that are very true you look up a
09:31 celebrity in the first paragraph says
09:33 this is what they are known for - this
09:38 is early life and you read about their
09:40 early life one of the most interesting
09:42 things about early life and sort of
09:44 their career because it goes into there
09:46 sometimes it says early career if
09:48 they've been around for 60 years but at
09:50 some point there's the first tab that
09:51 gets into the career and I want you to
09:54 study the pivotal points of people that
09:56 you respect to find out what took them
09:58 from sort of what you might consider to
10:01 be and I might consider to be a normal
10:04 person
10:05 into this realm or they became a sort of
10:07 a superstar was a Lance Armstrong a man
10:11 he peddles a bike he pedals the bike and
10:15 he pedals it really really well right so
10:19 some pivot some pivotal point he joined
10:21 a race pedaled the bike and won and then
10:24 that keeps that kept stacking up and
10:26 stacking up a stack again for comedians
10:29 as I've said several times and you have
10:30 heard this a hundred times and I want
10:32 you to take it literally a comedian will
10:34 tell you even Johnny Carson they'll say
10:39 when did you become a comedian when did
10:41 you decide you wanted to be an
10:43 entertainer and male/female older young
10:46 they all say the same thing I was
10:47 messing around and I said something and
10:50 people laughed and the second I felt
10:54 them laugh was the second that I
10:56 realized this was my career this was my
10:59 purpose isn't that nice
11:02 they had a triggering moment in their
11:05 life for Johnny Carson he tells the
11:07 story that he was in a play in school
11:09 and was a fairly serious play you know
11:12 sort of mid-range and he did something
11:17 where the audience laughed they weren't
11:20 supposed to laugh but they did laugh and
11:21 when they did laugh boom that was it he
11:25 was bit and he proceeded to create a
11:28 show that lasted you know 30 years for
11:33 him personally right thinking over for
11:35 Jack Paar have you ever looked on some
11:38 sort of documentary that you're watching
11:40 and you see your heroes and you know
11:44 there are heroes out there that we have
11:46 that aren't like this we might like it
11:49 Nikola Tesla or someone is more academic
11:52 I guarantee you and their travels what
11:56 we're going to talk about in just a
11:58 second year they've had their version of
12:00 it which is essentially a very
12:03 celebrated recognition but I grew up
12:07 liking musicians and you know I liked
12:10 actors but I didn't get into them you
12:12 know I didn't try to behave like them or
12:14 anything like that and I didn't try to
12:16 behave like rockers either but I just
12:18 enjoyed their freedoms of their talent
12:21 but you'll see all those backstage shots
12:24 of your favorite musician and they're
12:27 just in heaven and in your mind when
12:29 you're watching them now they're not
12:30 always in heaven right sometimes they
12:31 hate each other and they're just posing
12:32 for the documentary but virtually all
12:36 bands have had that sweet spot even what
12:38 is it the Oasis brothers they had some
12:43 times where they dug each other and then
12:44 eventually they grew apart or whatever
12:46 but everyone's had this moment where
12:48 they're on what we call cloud 9
12:51 everything is going right depending on
12:55 how old you are you have probably lived
12:57 on cloud not a couple times in your life
12:59 cloud 9 comes in the form of sometimes
13:02 simply moving out of your parents house
13:05 sometimes it's meeting that special boy
13:07 or girl and they like you just as much
13:10 as you like them at least in that first
13:12 era man it
13:12 awesome there's no worry about growing
13:15 apart because it's all about the hearing
13:17 now and you're just living in heaven you
13:20 get the job that you always wanted to
13:22 have you go to the concerts you always
13:25 wanted to go to during this episode see
13:28 if you can't crawl inside of the psyche
13:30 of what I'm talking about it recreate
13:31 those emotions for those moments that
13:34 you have either witnessed personally or
13:36 that you've seen on television that move
13:38 you and in extreme cases you can even
13:43 use fictional situations or some movie
13:45 out there that's completely untrue it's
13:48 just a nice theatrical recreation of
13:50 some story but it makes you feel the way
13:52 I'm telling you
13:53 I need you to resonate and feel this
13:57 moment usurp other people's moments for
14:00 yourself and say okay that's what I'm
14:02 going for I have felt this how many of
14:06 you have bought a lottery ticket and you
14:09 got back in your car at the gas station
14:11 you stared at it for a second and for a
14:13 moment for a moment you're able to
14:16 convince yourself that you have won and
14:18 you have that amazing feeling that
14:21 you've won and that there's no one
14:22 that's gonna control you anymore because
14:24 if nothing else you're gonna have your
14:25 own money you're gonna flip the bird to
14:28 the world and go do whatever the hell it
14:29 is you want to do right that's what
14:31 we're trying to get to and there's a
14:33 reason why we're trying to get to that
14:35 because of something called valve
14:37 attraction go see my episode on Law of
14:40 Attraction a resonating feeling inside
14:43 your soul controls the second that you
14:45 pick in the next moment for all time
14:48 exists absolute in all directions
14:52 everything that could happen has been
14:55 forged into the universe you just need
14:57 to find the time bandit door to get
15:00 there to move into that second that you
15:02 love now I'm going to tell you out of
15:05 experience that there are some details
15:08 with purposes that are very important
15:11 we're all different people right of
15:13 course
15:14 I might like a particular color that you
15:15 hate and vice versa and that's stuff
15:18 that we don't need to worry about and
15:20 things that we can just say no problem
15:21 but there are purposes that require that
15:24 you
15:25 Vinc and their purposes that you could
15:28 come up with where you don't have to do
15:30 anything now before I go too far yes
15:34 every human being on earth needs a break
15:36 we do you know I had worked 25 years and
15:45 most did in the video game business but
15:47 in a whole bunch of other industries as
15:48 well and when I had to close my company
15:52 because the 2008 recession finally
15:56 caught up with my clients a few years
15:59 later about five years later I just came
16:01 home that day after packing up my last
16:04 office which was very depressing and I
16:07 just felt like uh Turley exhausted I had
16:11 been thinking for 25 years solid being
16:14 the lead guy always lead dude and I I've
16:19 told the story before in season 1 but I
16:21 ended up taking unemployment and just
16:25 showing out that's looking for work but
16:28 I just needed a retreat so thankfully I
16:31 live in Huntington Beach California so
16:33 at the time we had this really cool
16:34 little pizza place right down off the
16:36 highway one little slice joint a lot of
16:39 the high school kids would come there
16:40 after school I go down there about a
16:43 summer time so everybody was home at
16:44 first and so I go down there and just
16:47 grab a piece of pizza eat walk across
16:50 the street sit on this we have these you
16:53 know cement steps that go down to the
16:55 sand we have like a Venice Beach
16:58 sidewalk that goes all along the beach
17:00 and then it's like I swear to god it's
17:02 nearly a tenth of a mile before the
17:05 ocean starts beautiful sands we have one
17:08 of the most beautiful beaches in
17:09 California down here and I would just
17:11 sit and stare at the ocean with a little
17:13 tiny book a little tiny black book and I
17:15 started writing up a bunch of stuff
17:16 which I've cut and covered in other
17:17 episodes which is not important right
17:19 now but I was sort of taking this
17:25 strategic thinking to keep a business
17:27 count going to close a deal to finish a
17:29 project and I let it be thinking that
17:32 was stimulated by the ether winds of the
17:35 universe if it occurred to me it
17:38 occurred to me and I
17:39 thought it but otherwise it wasn't going
17:41 to proliferate my mind and I needed that
17:44 now the distinction is and the reason
17:47 why I bring that story up is it's not a
17:48 sustainable in my opinion a way to live
17:51 but I have found there are celebrities
17:54 that are so well-loved that all they
17:58 need to do is show up on stage and
18:00 people will just get goo-goo-eyed over
18:04 them you know and it's not that they
18:07 don't craft their craft when we're not
18:10 looking to make it look effortless and
18:12 easy when it's actually incredibly
18:14 difficult and unique which is why they
18:16 are who they are whether they be male or
18:18 female or whatever I'm going to be
18:20 preparing an episode that's going to
18:22 cover sort of the history of the the
18:26 20th century in regards to what kind of
18:31 people we were back in those days
18:33 because I think that there is an
18:35 extremely important lesson that might be
18:38 one of the most important lessons we can
18:40 learn as a nation and as a world but we
18:43 are Americans and so we can understand
18:44 our own history I'm hoping it's as a
18:46 value it's as valuable to the European
18:48 and and other communities out there but
18:52 there's an actor comedian named Groucho
18:54 Marx which most of you over I would say
18:57 35 know who he is
18:59 but this guy could walk on stage of any
19:02 show that he was a part of he busted his
19:04 button all kinds of vaudeville stuff and
19:06 movies with his brothers the Marx
19:08 Brothers but when he pretty much hit
19:11 about 1945 or so he was kind of on his
19:13 own and he would just have to show up to
19:16 a What's My Line or you bet your life
19:19 which is also called the Groucho Marx
19:21 show and Dick Cavett or whatever and he
19:26 just needed to exist and everyone in the
19:28 room was totally entertained everyone
19:29 was on the edge of their seat because
19:31 this guy would quip and he is the master
19:33 of the play on words and if you've ever
19:36 think you've seen someone do well at
19:39 that art Groucho Marx is the utter
19:42 grandmaster world champion of being a
19:47 play on words several of his brothers
19:50 are equal in this
19:51 so there is a there the reason I
19:53 mentioned that is that there's a place
19:55 that you can find in your own life where
19:57 you become so interesting to others that
20:00 you can achieve that it's a very rare
20:03 thing but you can pull that off and so
20:05 that is the only time I've known that
20:07 folks can just be sort of you know
20:11 free-floating in life and be able to
20:13 earn money and live with a lot of
20:16 without a lot of burden of learning
20:18 lines and standing front of a camera is
20:20 in rehearsing but those are one in a
20:22 million's those go back to my lottery
20:24 way of living life which isn't real but
20:27 the world is a lot different now right
20:29 we want to have usually in this world a
20:32 a personal purpose and then we know we
20:36 have to have a career purpose because we
20:40 all have bills in most cases if you can
20:44 shed the career one well geez so you can
20:46 do pretty much what you want but there's
20:48 a lot of unhappiness on the other side
20:50 of waking up in the morning and not
20:52 having to do anything because someone
20:54 else is paying your bills you have to be
20:56 very careful with that that coveted
20:58 lucky experience I say enjoy it but
21:03 you're gonna have to work harder than
21:04 most people to enjoy someone was posting
21:08 the other day on my Facebook feed you
21:11 know what year do you want to retire and
21:13 everyone's rushing in to pick the year
21:14 and talking about their financial
21:16 planning and stuff and I just posted
21:18 never retirement rots your mind it does
21:23 now maybe you've can consider retirement
21:26 one of these things where hey I've saved
21:27 up enough money I can pay my bills with
21:29 my current standard of living I love to
21:32 see that work in this day and age but
21:34 the standard retirement that my
21:35 grandparents had I think led to dementia
21:39 if you do not use the cells in your mind
21:42 and there's only one way to do such a
21:44 thing which is to think then they start
21:48 to atrophy you know it would be as if
21:52 you consider all the neurons in your
21:54 brain the top athletes in the world for
21:56 whatever sport that you like and while
21:59 you're alive and you're working and
22:00 you're doing something they are playing
22:02 the World Series games over and over
22:05 over inside your brain if you get sick
22:07 they're just doing little skirmishes but
22:08 overall they're usually at the top of
22:10 their game the second that you retire is
22:13 the second that you blow the whistle
22:15 sound the bell whatever it is it stops
22:18 the game and they just sit on that
22:21 course and they do nothing but they're
22:24 built to play the game every single day
22:26 and so they get fat and they get bored
22:29 and they get depressed and they kill
22:31 themselves that's your brain on
22:33 retirement but you're taught as is pavlo
22:38 nyan trigger that having retirement is
22:40 your goal it's your success it's your
22:42 proof to the world that you did well I
22:44 retired at 40 anytime you know many guys
22:47 I know in the Bay Area who've retired at
22:49 40 because they made a little bit of
22:51 money in the stock market with selling
22:54 their startups only a few that I've ever
22:57 met seem to be happy but then they'll
23:03 marry a friend of mine and I get you
23:05 know when that happens you get a little
23:07 more of a inside scoop on what the
23:08 family's like and
23:10 you know if they end up being happy for
23:15 you know maybe even 10 years but afford
23:18 it you're just 50 after 10 years so
23:20 there's a lot more game to be had right
23:22 I know a guy who retired out of the
23:26 video game business and he bought I
23:30 don't know dozens and dozens of Ferraris
23:36 he built a garage that has all the robot
23:38 loading platforms that you know you can
23:41 push a button I want that car way back
23:43 in the corner and it's moving all the
23:44 other cars out of the way and here comes
23:46 this other car and drops it off and he
23:47 can go for the weekend in his Testarossa
23:50 he was able to hang on to his sort of
23:53 game for about 15 years and just
23:55 appearing events and being very very
23:57 happy and he's not suicidal or anything
24:00 today but trust me but he's realized
24:04 that his life has turned into this sort
24:06 of templated game that's no fun anymore
24:09 he's seen the entire world and I mean
24:12 the entire place everything he could
24:13 think about he's seen he's had some kids
24:16 he remarried
24:17 here kids with his new wife and that's
24:21 fun obviously that has its own rewards
24:23 day-to-day but in the end what's really
24:25 funny is what he appreciates in life
24:27 today with his hundreds of millions of
24:29 dollars worth of stuff is the same kind
24:32 of stuff that the people at my hometown
24:34 appreciate with no money at all
24:38 isn't that funny right
24:40 and that little anecdote is to shake
24:43 your mind up to make you realize you
24:46 need to pick your careers carefully you
24:49 need to pick your purposes carefully now
24:52 there's an interesting thing going on in
24:53 the world right now which is called the
24:56 technical revolution of freedom sort of
25:01 the Revolutionary War 2.0 it's being
25:05 most vehemently fought in the United
25:07 States of America but it's also being
25:08 fought globally because a lot of
25:10 Europeans are absolutely sick and tired
25:13 of being run by bankers and worshipping
25:16 monarchs on plates right there's this
25:20 character online in a trend called
25:23 queuing on cue Anonymous I would imagine
25:27 that a lot of you would want to know
25:28 what my opinions are of this guy I don't
25:30 know if he's real but he seems to be
25:32 very consistent with his predictions
25:33 we're using he is the proverbial he
25:35 until you know otherwise he is promising
25:38 a lot of change but then again we had a
25:41 group called Anonymous a long time ago
25:42 two years ago who was also promising a
25:44 lot of change which never happened
25:46 claiming to have videos of people doing
25:49 bad things that they were supposed to
25:51 leak to the world which never happened
25:53 so we'll see right but the coolest thing
25:56 about q and on is this for me what he
26:02 says is obviously riveting if it's true
26:04 it is even more riveting but what's
26:07 interesting is is that the folks that
26:09 are dissecting the Cuban on posts online
26:13 seem to be very young people your
26:16 Millennials maybe even a few Jen's Z's
26:20 and he is drawing them in and saying
26:23 look you guys need to learn how to think
26:25 you need to think critically to
26:26 understand what I'm telling you because
26:28 I'm just not going to tell you because
26:30 I'm not spoonful
26:31 the freedom to you one more time you're
26:35 gonna have to be Minutemen and minute
26:37 women and you're gonna have to rise up
26:39 and you need to learn this information
26:41 from an intimate level up to understand
26:44 what you're trying to prevent from
26:45 happening once again otherwise it's
26:48 going to happen again so even if it's
26:52 fake
26:52 by god it's doing something to the minds
26:54 of people and I said a long time on the
26:57 episode that for me personally creating
27:03 things is very important to me and
27:06 creating things could be improving
27:08 something that's already in existence or
27:09 creating it from scratch either way it's
27:11 good bringing new experiences that that
27:15 give tools to other people so that they
27:18 can create something of their own you
27:21 know one of the one of the things when
27:23 you get into product development that's
27:24 very interesting is if you can create a
27:27 tool of any kind it's way more
27:28 satisfying than creating any other type
27:30 of in solution for instance if you
27:33 create an iPod yeah that's that's
27:36 definitely making a lot of people happy
27:37 by putting music in every place on
27:40 planet earth but if you create a
27:42 computer that allows people to draw to
27:46 write movies to engineer iPods well
27:49 that's a lot more interesting because
27:50 it's pretty cool if you create a socket
27:52 wrench thank you how many things have
27:55 been made with socket wrenches your
27:57 standard your metrics whatever you're
28:00 responsible for a lot of wonderful
28:01 things when you create a tool so keep
28:03 that in the back your head as well I
28:05 think most purposes are routed to
28:08 effecting change to making the world
28:10 better place in a lot of cases could
28:13 just be your immediate world you're just
28:15 trying to make your three-year-old have
28:16 a better life your wife your husband
28:18 yourself it's all the same symbol in the
28:21 symbols of life the purposes and themes
28:24 of life right now let's take a purpose
28:29 and let's extend it one more level okay
28:32 and I want to kind of get into a murky
28:35 area where we we worry about
28:41 things that we shouldn't worry about if
28:46 I put you in a vacuum
28:47 I literally pull you out of planet Earth
28:49 I take you to a new planet no one knows
28:52 you baby there's no one even there but I
28:55 give you the ability to have sort of
28:57 infinite resources to build and create
28:59 whatever you want I'm not going to
29:01 create a for you you got to create
29:02 yourself its meaning if you want to put
29:04 a a satellite around that planet I'm
29:07 gonna give you all the books that teach
29:09 you the mathematics of aerospace and
29:10 science and you're gonna have to learn
29:12 it you're gonna to build your own rocket
29:13 you're gonna have to go through your own
29:15 tests and whatever maybe we'll fleet of
29:17 robots to help you build a rocket
29:19 whatever right but when you're by
29:21 yourself and you're not surrounded by
29:22 society you're not in a sociological
29:23 environment of what other people think
29:26 of you a beautiful thing happens and
29:29 that is that you're not infected by the
29:30 concern of what others think about you
29:33 or think about what your purpose is all
29:35 about as you postulate what your purpose
29:39 might be or reevaluate the things that
29:41 you have considered to be your purpose
29:43 up to this point I want you to think of
29:48 whether or not the purposes that you
29:50 have chosen involve the approval of
29:53 others it's okay if it does but I want
29:56 you to be very conscious of the fact
29:58 that you are engaging in that for the
30:01 explicit feedback of others because I
30:04 want you to put that in your life on
30:06 that shelf of entertainment or
30:10 entertainer because that's what you are
30:12 and that's fine I want you to entertain
30:15 me I want you to write a movie that I
30:16 want to see an episode on TV a song I
30:18 want to listen to I want to see you go
30:20 break dance up there on a stage an
30:24 amazing way there's this great video
30:25 that came out I think you look up
30:27 breakdance puppet master it's a black
30:30 guy on a white girl and she is painted
30:33 to look like kind of a wood doll and
30:35 this this group is literally the most
30:39 amazing breakdance trio or sorry duo I
30:41 have ever seen in my life and they do if
30:44 you know breakdancing really really well
30:46 they have only what I could call a micro
30:48 popping between pops between normal pops
30:51 their micro popping like they're made of
30:53 mechanical gear
30:55 device it's really tremendous they're
30:57 entertainers there's a part of their
31:00 life that's purpose is to entertain by
31:03 laboring and studying and getting a
31:06 piece of music and very quickly taking a
31:09 recent piece of music and creating a new
31:12 dance for that piece of music right in
31:17 ten years we might look at it and may
31:18 not feel the same who knows but if
31:22 you're on that island by yourself or
31:24 that planet by yourself now your purpose
31:26 can be exclusively for yourself right
31:29 and you do not worry what anyone else
31:33 thinks and it there's some amazing
31:35 beauty in that it doesn't mean that you
31:38 have to be alone to do this by any
31:40 stretch the imagination be married with
31:42 eight kids and have 50 buddies out there
31:45 that you're hanging out with but I want
31:47 you to evaluate without you have a
31:49 purpose that is truly your sovereign
31:52 purpose something that's yours right and
31:57 this is not a five food group
31:59 conversation where you have to eat one
32:01 of everything I'm not saying you
32:02 actually have to have one of these but
32:04 it would be nice for you to know whether
32:06 you do and it could be the inverse right
32:08 it could be that you have a great
32:09 purpose for yourself and you you may
32:13 feel incomplete because you don't have a
32:15 purpose that goes out to the others well
32:17 I wish I was more effective for society
32:19 I don't know what to do what's really
32:22 interesting is that you'll have people
32:24 that are very busy even successful and
32:28 they don't really have a purpose and
32:32 some folks are very very left brain and
32:34 they have no idea that they don't have a
32:36 purpose they you know I've dated people
32:39 that live in their left brain constantly
32:41 and they really don't have an emotion in
32:44 their body because the right brain
32:45 doesn't function it's a very interesting
32:48 thing because at first you don't think
32:50 that that's possible and then you find
32:52 out it's not only possible it happens
32:54 all the time and there's nothing
32:56 necessarily wrong with those people it's
32:58 just you have to decide whether or not
33:00 you're like that and whether you can
33:01 understand that before you go into any
33:03 deep friendship or relationship with
33:05 those people right if you're watching
33:07 the show I assume that there's a
33:10 similarity that we have with each other
33:12 people keep asking me like even my
33:14 closest friends will say man your
33:16 episodes are too long so what's the show
33:19 called it's D thoughts I said well how
33:20 the hell can you have a deep thought in
33:22 five minutes because they'll say well
33:23 you should make up 45 minutes they said
33:24 what's the huge gain by losing half an
33:26 out of 45 minutes off an episode or
33:28 maybe 15 minutes off an episode if you
33:32 can make it 45 minutes you can keep
33:33 going and again a lot of you need to
33:36 understand who are coming through
33:37 exclusively on YouTube that a lot of
33:40 folks listen to this in their car when
33:41 they're driving they've got those
33:43 horrible communities in the morning and
33:44 you know I only wish I could do this
33:46 every single day with a research team so
33:48 we could come up with some really
33:49 awesome daily stuff that could take you
33:54 to work every morning that'd be awesome
33:55 take you home every day be fun talk you
33:59 to sleep at night right my only hope is
34:01 that if you find this show at 250
34:03 episodes plus and you dig it you can go
34:06 all the way back you can sign up to the
34:08 podcast off the website and just dial
34:11 back right the only bummer about the
34:13 season one is that I hid and figured out
34:15 that the microphone could be ten inches
34:18 away from my face and still work fine so
34:20 a lot of its you know hugging up on the
34:23 microphone a little too much but one of
34:27 the reasons why I created this show has
34:28 to do with purpose as I always say I
34:32 used to have another show called MKULTRA
34:34 radio I may actually be freeing up some
34:37 of the funnier episodes for the patreon
34:40 folks I just keep them over there
34:42 there's a lot of good stuff in that show
34:44 I will tell you but it's a different
34:46 show it's for the snowflakes it's
34:49 probably you know like being set on fire
34:52 that's all I can say is it's not as kid
34:56 gloves as this show but we did it and
34:59 what ended up happening with MKULTRA was
35:01 that I think we created great shows and
35:03 and the rapport between Kyle and I was
35:05 fantastic I mourn the fact that we live
35:07 90 minutes away from each other because
35:09 he and I could be cranking out episodes
35:11 left and right but I found that there
35:14 were subjects I wanted to discuss in
35:16 great detail and in MKULTRA radio I
35:18 created something called essays
35:19 and there was never any video within
35:21 culture it was a true radio show that
35:23 went out on kxr Z radio here in Los
35:25 Angeles SuperDuper heavy metal station
35:27 that Snoop Dogg bought I guess but I
35:30 created these essays there one hour and
35:31 I would have a little outline in front
35:33 of me in a computer and I just riff off
35:38 this one page thing turning to one hour
35:40 and so Kyle and I would touch on these
35:45 amazing subjects and it was sort of
35:46 things like Mandela effect something
35:49 that really needed a lot of observation
35:50 a lot of research and because either he
35:53 was busy or I was busy he'd bring
35:54 something I didn't know about her
35:55 vice-versa so we try to teach each other
35:57 about it during the episode which had
36:00 its value it was the way to get in and
36:02 out of a concept in 15 minutes usually
36:04 still the episodes were an hour two
36:05 hours long touched on a bunch of
36:07 different stuff but I felt like look
36:10 there's a bunch of things that I
36:11 research in my life
36:12 ton of stuff from time-travel - what's
36:16 the fabric of the universe - the
36:18 sociological impacts of people's
36:20 behavior having been a manager for 20
36:22 years and managing hundreds of employees
36:25 you you bump into archetypes you bump
36:28 into things that that I see repeated in
36:31 people's lives right because different
36:34 companies different employees and I
36:35 think oh here comes that one again if
36:38 they had only known about my other
36:39 employee they would never make this
36:40 mistake and they would never have that
36:42 horrible you know crash and burn moment
36:45 now some crash and burn moments are
36:47 important because they teach us a lot of
36:48 information about ourselves but
36:51 sometimes you just don't want it to
36:52 happen right there's some things that
36:55 happen to people that should never
36:56 happen to people period and they make
36:59 mistakes to get themselves closer and
37:01 closer to those moments of demise right
37:03 you know this show was just made out of
37:06 thin air bought a camera I wanted season
37:10 two of him in culture to have video Kyle
37:13 didn't want to do it so I had this
37:14 camera for no reason started filming the
37:16 backyard created about five episodes
37:18 that were a joke using the microphone at
37:20 the camera showed a couple of our
37:23 listeners the episodes the first couple
37:26 episodes I was putting together got a
37:28 huge thumbs up
37:30 you know Jed was one of the big people
37:32 that kind of got me going he mentioned
37:34 the whole topic for episode 2 evolution
37:37 and it just started from there it just
37:40 is like a grassroots little show like
37:42 most shows right you too can create your
37:45 own YouTube channel you know I had a
37:48 client who's still kind of a client who
37:51 wanted me to help him take one of his
37:52 shows on YouTube and turn it into a
37:54 podcast I didn't know how to do it but
37:57 then I learned and when I learned for
37:59 him I learned for us at MKULTRA and then
38:01 I just folded that technology over here
38:03 to deep thoughts
38:04 boom it's on podcast too it's awesome
38:07 but the format of deep thoughts went
38:10 like this I'm just going through my
38:11 purpose arc with deep thoughts here very
38:13 slowly I apologize when I'm out in
38:15 public and I'm talking to people
38:18 usually it's mug lounges or just it
38:21 functions where people are kind of
38:23 telling me more about themselves as soon
38:26 as someone learns that you're a person
38:28 who tries to help and they have suffered
38:32 for a little while they typically reach
38:34 out and say I need your help could you
38:36 help me you know I was looking for a
38:39 place to live at one point and the woman
38:43 that I went to sat me down we had coffee
38:46 together to see if we were kind of
38:47 compatible to rent she had a couple
38:50 rooms for rent young girl younger than
38:52 me 10 years younger than me and she
38:55 started just talking to me and talking
38:57 to me and finally just came up that she
39:01 decided she want a guy in the house even
39:02 though at first [ __ ] that's what she was
39:04 shooting for and I think it was one of
39:06 the other women in the house felt that
39:08 he had a problem with that which is just
39:09 fine so we kept texting and she finally
39:14 just was sharing her life like I had a
39:16 bad day and I get into why she had a bad
39:18 day and then she said well I got to get
39:21 out this business I'm in it's it's fine
39:22 it's okay I'm not I'm definitely making
39:24 enough money but this is not my purpose
39:26 and I was like ding ding ding so through
39:30 a few more texts she's like okay I need
39:32 you to talk to me and we had dinner
39:34 together I took her to dinner and we
39:37 talked for I don't know God three hours
39:39 to the restaurant closed rate and at
39:41 that point and I done a lot of
39:42 preparation for her
39:45 through texting I'd figured out kind of
39:46 what she is trying to do with her life
39:48 and so I put together this little plan
39:50 for her and taught her pretty much
39:51 what's on this show from how to get a
39:54 job to figuring out sort of your themes
39:57 for life getting back up that sort of
39:59 thing but what I realized for myself was
40:03 that I keep repeating myself to
40:04 different people
40:05 over and over and over again I keep
40:07 giving the same lesson out the same
40:09 lesson out and that's sort of
40:10 aggravating because I want to move on to
40:12 the next level of consciousness I want
40:14 to move on to okay we got the basics
40:16 figured out now there's more fun to be
40:18 had further down the line right and so
40:23 by creating deep thoughts episodes about
40:25 these lessons that I have used to help
40:27 many many people in their lives I get to
40:29 move on and anytime I run into someone
40:32 who's got a problem I say hey go see my
40:33 episode dr. dot this one and this one
40:35 this one and just listen to it these are
40:38 the things you're gonna get out of these
40:39 episodes you can skip you know listening
40:41 to this but it's in there and it's
40:44 working it's cool and again I get to
40:49 keep going this episode right here
40:51 wouldn't have happened in two different
40:53 ways had I not created this show and
40:56 locked those lessons in previous
40:57 episodes one I wouldn't have connected
41:01 so beautifully purpose and love until I
41:04 made my love episode nobody watches that
41:06 crap because I'm like I don't watch I do
41:08 talk about love one of the least watched
41:11 episodes is called loving yourself and
41:14 the irony is is the amount of
41:16 unhappiness in the world because people
41:18 have been convinced that doing so is
41:20 somehow an arrogant thing it's a it's a
41:23 violation of morals in this world it's
41:26 sort of sad everybody needs to love
41:28 themselves right religion teaches you
41:32 don't look in the mirror and don't
41:34 become a narcissist right that's the big
41:36 word once someone learns you know
41:38 megalomaniacal or narcissist or
41:42 misogynistic oh my gosh then everyone
41:44 they ever meet has these these labels
41:46 attached to them and it was funny is is
41:49 the more that people lack an
41:51 understanding of another person is
41:53 usually to the degree they label them
41:55 incorrectly
41:56 and the problem is is that if someone
41:59 actually has qualities that you should
42:01 probably emulate and you are drawn to
42:03 either by an outside force to label them
42:06 as something that they're not then you
42:09 have literally blocked a great resource
42:12 in your life to learn something that you
42:13 need to know and again you could have
42:16 someone who's really successful in thing
42:20 a and be like I would love to have that
42:22 that talent yeah but and B it just turns
42:25 your stomach makes you want to puke
42:28 technically speaking you can copy a and
42:31 leave B behind as long as you're
42:32 conscious of what's going on right I've
42:35 seen some of you guys comment in videos
42:37 and watch the replies because I don't
42:41 get notification of the replies but
42:44 sometimes I'll just notice that a video
42:45 like the SpaceX video has nearly 60
42:48 comments on it as a rootless recording
42:50 and that that I've had 60 notifications
42:54 it's you guys having conversations with
42:55 each other what's nice about this
42:58 particular channel is that most folks
43:00 don't get super negative you know they
43:04 disagree with each other respectfully in
43:07 most cases right for all of you who
43:10 disagree routinely with takes on the
43:13 universe or whatever but you're able to
43:15 come in day after day and week after
43:17 week and be polite about your
43:18 differences you know it really is a
43:22 measurement of you being the bigger man
43:25 as they say realizing well you know I'm
43:28 on the edge I'm on the edge of beliefs
43:31 in this particular area but here's the
43:34 crux the purpose here is the purpose of
43:37 purpose I like that when you find it and
43:41 there's two ways of finding it you can
43:44 find a purpose in a way that you go to a
43:48 concert and you watch someone on stage
43:50 and you're like oh my
43:51 Shh I'm pretty good at the guitar I'm
43:53 pretty good at singing I'm pretty good
43:55 at acting
43:55 whatever the hell you're looking at to
43:58 be a TEDTalk and so I was talking about
43:59 something super techy you're like oh my
44:01 god I love this subject matter of
44:03 artificial intelligence of chemistry of
44:05 cosmology whatever it is then have to be
44:08 something outrageous like that could be
44:09 I went to an accounting conference or an
44:11 insurance conference there are purposes
44:13 that hit you in the face like that like
44:15 a Mack truck just hitting you and you're
44:17 like oh my god I don't know what I got
44:19 to do to get into this but I got to get
44:20 into this but there's another kind of
44:23 purpose you can run into and I want to
44:24 make sure that you're aware that this is
44:26 something that happens to all of us and
44:29 if someone doesn't tell you that this is
44:33 possible you may miss it when it happens
44:37 and people like Steve Jobs and Johnny
44:40 Ives they knew this happened and Steve
44:43 has a great analogy for it which I'll
44:45 share in a second here it would be what
44:48 I would call the thread in the sweater
44:50 you're living your life and you know
44:54 you're happy whatever maybe you're
44:56 unhappy doesn't matter either way and
44:59 you notice something that gives you a
45:02 little ping of feeling a little ping the
45:05 purpose something your buddies doing and
45:08 they may be doing in an area that you
45:09 have no interest in you may listen to
45:11 you may listen to some music you hate
45:13 and you realize when you turn the radio
45:15 it's everywhere no like god dammit we
45:17 used to have really good music where did
45:20 it go
45:21 I'm pretty good at music or if I'm not
45:24 maybe I can get good at music and get
45:26 some real music back on the on the
45:29 airwaves you know get rid of these
45:31 tuning you know voice tuning machines so
45:35 that people are tone-deaf can sing songs
45:38 right maybe you've seen karaoke three
45:42 days a week and you're like man at this
45:43 point I'm I'm actually really good and
45:46 maybe I should record myself at home
45:49 used to be you needed a studio I hate
45:51 just need a laptop download a little bit
45:54 of Logic Pro or some some anything to
45:57 record your voice and layer something on
45:59 top of it which is almost all software
46:00 these days you don't play any
46:02 instruments but your buddies do
46:04 maybe your buddies mix music all the
46:07 time and you're like you know how did
46:09 you get that beat on your track you
46:11 don't you have a drummer
46:12 oh yeah it's this kid of drums software
46:14 well you know can I come over and you
46:16 show it to me I'll bring my laptop over
46:18 tell me what I gotta have before I get
46:20 there or give it to me when I get there
46:22 be prepared all right I've done this but
46:26 there's that little thread that little
46:28 thread that comes out the sweater that's
46:30 all over the place
46:31 there's threads everywhere you look in
46:33 society everywhere from hanging out your
46:35 backyard to becoming a professional
46:37 surfer because you went to the pier and
46:39 you looked off and you went my god look
46:41 out in shape and happy that person is
46:43 they can ride a wave Steve Jobs analogy
46:46 has communicated to us through Johnny
46:48 Ives was that a great ideas like a
46:50 butterfly when a butterfly is a very
46:54 delicate beautiful thing and one must
46:57 figured out a way figure out a way to
46:59 catch that butterfly with a net and not
47:02 hurt it keep it alive nurture it feed it
47:06 and then it could become an integrated
47:09 part of your life and the butterfly in
47:12 your mind then turns into something much
47:14 much bigger there's a friend of mine who
47:16 was a bartender he was also a surfer he
47:21 was also a personal trainer his body is
47:24 perfect and he bumped into a guy surfing
47:29 in Australia where he's from and where
47:30 this other dude sorry not where he's
47:32 from sorry with the other guys from he's
47:33 actually from Ireland but he just sort
47:36 of dedicated himself to surfing in
47:38 really exotic areas and over the course
47:41 of I don't know how many years or
47:42 whatever months he made really good
47:44 friends with this guy this guy turned
47:46 out to be Chris Hemsworth that he made
47:49 friends with the gentleman who plays
47:51 Thor now among other ever-increasingly
47:55 cool roles right he became his trainer
47:59 he became sort of you know kind of an
48:03 ancillary manager of sorts another voice
48:05 to bounce ideas off of off of right that
48:10 guy now bounces around as far as I know
48:12 with Chris making all those movies and
48:15 having a good time
48:17 but what did he do he followed the
48:19 things that he loved his purposes in
48:21 life he took care of his is coinage you
48:25 know he made sure he could pay his bills
48:27 not a super rich guy at the time saved
48:31 up enough money to travel traveled took
48:35 care of his body took care of his
48:37 persona and his character who he is as a
48:39 person he's really I wouldn't say he has
48:41 much of a personas really who he is when
48:43 you meet him he's that guy he's a really
48:45 cool dude when I got around him it
48:48 inspired me because I was way out of
48:51 shape when I met him and he was so nice
48:54 not to say dude you're way out of shape
48:56 he should have said that to me right
48:57 from the very beginnings like dude what
48:59 are you doing but he had never seen me
49:00 in shape so as far as he's concerned
49:01 I've been that way my whole life a
49:04 couple years after he moved on and went
49:08 into the movie business full-time I shed
49:11 the weight and every day I ate and every
49:13 day I exercise I thought about all these
49:14 things this guy taught me but the
49:16 personal training thing I knew that they
49:18 worked because I could turn on the movie
49:19 and look at Chris and go yeah
49:21 the brother knows how to make another
49:23 guy look really awesome right so the fun
49:26 thing about finding your purpose and
49:28 catching a purpose slash a great idea
49:31 for your life is that it's happening
49:33 around you all the time all the time
49:37 it's like life becomes an adventure of
49:39 cool things to do I think I told in a
49:42 story a long time ago and one of the
49:44 episodes I had been in the professional
49:47 software business pretty much my entire
49:49 life later in life I was lucky enough to
49:52 get around some Hollywood folks and get
49:54 close to that business something I was
49:55 always interested in got to participate
49:57 the highest levels that was cool I'm not
50:00 saying that to impress you okay
50:02 just telling you that's my journey
50:06 in the irony about this is I'm gonna go
50:08 the opposite direction of the brag
50:10 feeling but you might be feeling right
50:13 now sometimes my friends come up to me a
50:15 man that episode seems like you're
50:16 bragging too much and like dude hell am
50:18 I gonna teach anybody about my journey
50:20 if I don't tell him what my journey is
50:22 you know I don't think I've ever been
50:24 accused of being her again by any my
50:25 friends confident yeah
50:27 but that's about it one of the things I
50:31 never did I was actually a retail guy
50:33 once at a video rental store as a young
50:37 man I ran a movie theaters young man I
50:39 worked as a Stockman at a Walmart way
50:43 back in 85 86 but the one thing I never
50:48 did was work a restaurant as a waiter
50:52 work a restaurant as a cook run a West
50:56 restaurant as a manager right but all my
50:59 friends had you know my friends had been
51:00 waiters and waitresses and cooks and
51:03 whatever they'd all kind of bounced
51:05 through that from fast food all the way
51:08 up to you know nice restaurants with
51:09 tablecloths I still never done fast food
51:13 I'm not sure how much I'd be interested
51:14 in that particular thing that I've seen
51:15 the Machine of how it works but a buddy
51:19 of mine owned and ran an Italian
51:22 restaurant
51:23 amazing food I got hooked because he
51:27 made he's from Brooklyn New York and he
51:29 made Brooklyn Pizza and here in
51:33 Huntington Beach to see someone claim
51:34 they have Brooklyn Pizza you're gonna
51:35 like yeah right sure and I went and ate
51:37 it and my mind was blown and then I
51:40 found out he's you know he's the first
51:42 generation of two parents from Naples so
51:45 I helped him technically rebuild his
51:48 website rebuild his catering website got
51:49 him the biggest catering jobs of his
51:51 entire career because Google had messed
51:53 up the search something the average web
51:57 designer could have done so I'm not
51:58 bragging
51:58 we did it right and it worked before the
52:01 November up there was that the yeah the
52:03 November update of 2003 but over the
52:06 next two years he said you know I want
52:08 you to you come in late and you stay
52:10 after you've worked or before you go to
52:13 work because we used to work night
52:14 shifts at my house just the hell of it
52:15 he said you know I want you to keep up
52:17 on this place
52:18 he does let me show you how to make a
52:19 pizza let me show you how to make shrimp
52:21 scampi and fettuccine and a bunch of
52:23 other meals and he goes just work with
52:27 the customers get the place cool and I
52:30 would show up to get my food for the
52:33 night and sometimes the place would be
52:35 slammed place has got you know
52:37 tremendous number of customers more than
52:38 usual and the staff was just struggling
52:41 people been sitting out there for 20
52:43 minutes having placed their order
52:45 without getting their food yet I go back
52:47 and ask what the queues like and I'm
52:49 finding out it's gonna be another 15 10
52:51 15 minutes are they gonna get their food
52:53 my god give me some garlic bread
52:54 whatever let me get something for them
52:56 no cost bought it out I'd sit down with
53:00 these couples and apologize for the for
53:03 the backup serve them some free stuff
53:05 and just you know it wasn't a big you
53:09 know lost lead or anything and just talk
53:12 to them and get him smiling again and
53:14 they were like you know what it's
53:15 totally cool the food here is so good
53:16 we're willing to wait thank you for
53:18 dropping by that it just that rapport
53:20 with people was so much fun seeing them
53:23 go from sort of being frustrated to
53:25 being totally happy was something I love
53:28 to do there's like a little purpose in
53:30 there right I got close to the
53:32 restaurant business I could go in there
53:34 and crank out a bunch of the pizzas
53:36 while the chefs are cranking out the
53:38 eggplant the more intense stuff right
53:40 that I don't know how to cook life is an
53:43 adventure a purpose there you know there
53:49 are again internal purposes for you
53:51 there purposes of which you can share
53:54 great things big things how many people
53:58 love it when a revolution happens on
54:00 their watch honestly not a lot of people
54:03 because it means you could die depending
54:05 on what level it is as I said the 1770s
54:07 and you got to find a 30-year war if you
54:11 know you're talking about kids that
54:14 fought in that war that weren't alive
54:15 when the war started because it went on
54:18 for 27 years off and on horrendous
54:21 that's why we make statues of Minutemen
54:25 statues of the leaders who had the balls
54:27 to flip the bird to tyranny well
54:31 tyrannies back people
54:32 Tierney's back in a huge way and it's
54:34 trying to grow like a virus all over the
54:35 world so you can get into a super
54:38 political thing just make sure my
54:42 opinion you are fighting for freedom and
54:43 sovereignty but I think before you go
54:46 deep before you go dark it's better to
54:49 find out who you are as a person to
54:51 figure out what you what you live for
54:54 what I find in this particular world
54:56 just to put a fine point before the
54:58 episodes over here a lot of folks that
55:00 are fighting for globalism have never
55:02 had a business of their own they kind of
55:04 dream about having one but they just
55:06 haven't been able to pull it off and so
55:08 a giant sector of globalism hasn't
55:11 really hit them yet because they don't
55:13 realize that globalism is counter
55:17 freedom counter entrepreneur counter
55:21 small business they want corporations to
55:24 run the world once you start your own
55:27 business you'll run right into global
55:30 competition people stealing your idea
55:32 and running off with it a friend of mine
55:35 helped a young man in Los Angeles trade
55:38 his Kickstarter for a product he
55:41 invented it for the most part they've
55:45 been very very remedial versions of what
55:47 he had made in the past there were
55:49 hundreds of years old and he took it
55:51 realized man this this is probably
55:54 something we could use now because we
55:55 have electronic devices it's a little
55:57 shelf that goes in your bed side and
56:00 everyone helped him get his Kickstarter
56:02 going he blew up on Kickstarter ways
56:04 raised three times as much as he wanted
56:06 if not more and two corporations have
56:09 now copied him and they're taking away
56:11 the profit they're able to use their
56:13 global buddies to get it made in China
56:15 for nothing and despite any type of
56:18 copyright he might have on it he doesn't
56:20 have the money to fight him and that's
56:22 why we have to protect things like that
56:24 the one thing I want to press upon you
56:27 just as we wrap up here as the world is
56:30 still a wonderful place on high as a
56:34 majority people are still sweet people
56:37 in most the places on this planet for
56:41 those that are struggling and who are
56:43 angry for those that wake up every day
56:45 and sling an ache
56:46 47 over their back and have thoughts of
56:49 infidels and all that kind of stuff just
56:51 the food that do and I say the few
56:54 they're just scared they're just scared
56:59 that their way of life is going to be
57:02 threatened and so their purpose becomes
57:05 very skewed very strange but what
57:10 happens to a bee's nest if you walk up
57:12 to it in a beekeeper suit and you just
57:17 tap it with your gloves right you just
57:19 tap it and they all come out and they
57:21 swarm all over you and they're trying to
57:22 kill you what happens when you walk away
57:25 from the bees nest it sort of comes down
57:29 you know if you come back a day later
57:31 two days later and you look at it from
57:32 afar you don't touch it and you don't
57:34 mess with it they just stay inside their
57:36 little beehive sure it'll make more but
57:40 the natural attrition of you know bears
57:43 and raccoons going up to just pull out
57:46 all the good honey and destroy it
57:48 and it keeps their numbers limited most
57:51 human beings have a limited amount of
57:52 land anyway you don't have to save the
57:55 world you could participate if you want
57:59 start small and go big start small and
58:03 stay small who knows but I will tell you
58:06 that the the most beautiful thing that
58:08 can happen is for you to repair your own
58:09 little halo your own little circle of
58:11 life your safe space right repair that
58:15 first get yourself feeling comfortable
58:18 as a human being feel good in your own
58:20 skin take care of your own first and
58:24 you're the first that exists in your
58:26 life to start with self move to family
58:31 and then go to work most of us don't
58:34 have families at first we we have our
58:36 parents and our siblings but we go self
58:40 work family is typically how it works
58:43 maybe that's a way to go
58:47 I think after that you might have world
58:52 maybe I think you feel me if you haven't
58:56 been to deep thoughts radio calm please
58:58 go there is video and audio is audience
59:02 of cars driving by
59:05 there's the lakh Facebook group link up
59:07 there we used to have a page but then we
59:11 had the page we got a bunch of weird
59:13 robots coming in and messing with it not
59:16 bashing BOTS just weird accounts so we
59:22 locked it up and it turned out to be
59:23 great there's a patreon thing going on
59:25 and for those of you who've been joining
59:28 I really appreciate it again I'm gonna
59:29 be probably taking some of the more
59:32 entertaining episodes of mplt radio and
59:35 putting them in there I might just take
59:37 my essays and get them up there fairly
59:38 quickly so you guys will have some
59:40 interesting content I can't turn on a
59:42 partial podcast in that region so it
59:45 will not be available on audio I
59:47 apologize to you guys we also had
59:51 another show that we call real or
59:52 [ __ ] and those are pretty fun it's
59:56 we're calling I just riff on aliens and
59:58 all kinds of wild stuff between the two
59:59 of us Kyle's a riot 2 min so anyway take
60:03 care of yourself and someone else and I
60:05 will scene the next deep thoughts
