00:24 oh my god I'm able to do a show during
00:32 the day was it Christmas its January 6th
00:38 and it's 75 degrees outside here in
00:45 SoCal and for all of you under snow it
00:48 was really cold here we had snow in
00:52 places that we've never had snow well
00:56 Easton probably last 50 years
00:58 like Bakersfield so I thought I'd take
01:02 advantage of the opportunity here I
01:04 thought that was a little zoomed well
01:09 today I thought we'd talk about
01:10 something I wrote in my phone about a
01:12 week ago which is may not make any sense
01:16 to you right away
01:17 but I think it will eventually which is
01:19 what I'm calling intellectual hatred and
01:23 what that means to me and it really
01:29 comes from my hometown coast or the
01:32 Midwest in general but it happens
01:34 everywhere it's just at different levels
01:36 at different places but there's a trend
01:40 in the Midwest when you get sort of
01:44 landlocked in the Midwest right
01:48 you're not financially capable of going
01:51 anywhere else it even if you were you're
01:55 so terrified of the world because you
01:58 never been anywhere that you won't go
02:00 maybe you're taking a vacation but when
02:04 you think about really living wherever
02:05 you take your vacation you're like oh
02:06 man I could never handle this and so you
02:08 go back to your little town and but do
02:11 you watch television it's a very very
02:15 meticulous process that occurs to create
02:17 this intellectual hatred in the Midwest
02:21 you can get to a point where you feel
02:22 like everyone else is having more fun
02:24 than you you're everyone else's children
02:26 everywhere else are Marja cated than
02:28 your children which now that I've talked
02:31 to plenty of my friends from the Midwest
02:33 we know that's that's completely bunk
02:37 you get a much stronger education in the
02:39 Midwest but still they see the nightlife
02:43 city they see all these opportunities
02:45 nightclubs beaches amusement parks
02:49 whatever whatever turns them on they
02:52 don't think they have them in the
02:53 Midwest and so they get envious but now
02:57 here's the other element to it so you
02:59 have someone who's fairly young in a
03:00 week in terms of just what's out there
03:04 in the world not necessarily the deep
03:05 conspiracies or anything and then
03:09 they'll go to their local pizza parlor
03:10 or their local you know barbecue joint
03:13 or whatever and they start talking to
03:15 other locals that are older than them
03:17 and they get this sense that they're in
03:20 a world of a bunch of country bumpkins
03:23 and so which again may or may not be the
03:28 case but this is le feel and so now they
03:32 feel like oh my god I'm stuck in the
03:33 Midwest with a bunch of you know
03:37 undereducated uncultured people not
03:42 understanding that they're really
03:43 actually wrong about that and the
03:46 strength of those individuals is
03:47 actually what will keep them on track as
03:51 I always say you know you learn all
03:52 these lessons in the Midwest that you
03:53 never learn in a big city because you
03:56 you mechanically can't but you will
03:58 learn some things in the big city that
03:59 obviously you can't learn in the Midwest
04:01 as well or little towns right I know
04:03 this is kind of going all over the place
04:05 but stick with me here because this is a
04:06 real syndrome that's going on in the
04:08 United States of America at least so you
04:11 have this person male/female a worker
04:16 housewife doesn't matter it does tend to
04:20 show itself of my personal history with
04:25 my friends that are more housewife's
04:28 just a something that happens but what
04:32 they do is in order to do this sort of
04:35 faux upgrade of their intellect in their
04:38 own mind what they do is it's almost
04:41 like they get a brochure from the coast
04:43 and the brochure says this is what we
04:47 hate this is what we like
04:50 this is what makes us sophisticated city
04:53 folk and these people automatically take
04:58 someone else's opinion and start to hate
05:02 the same thing and the big trend which
05:07 is going to utterly gut this country of
05:10 the United States if we don't squash it
05:13 and it's actually being squashed by our
05:15 current president but it could get out
05:17 of hand is that these individuals are
05:20 actually enjoying the solitude of what
05:26 those bumpkins have created meaning give
05:30 you an example I take my friends from my
05:33 hometown they come and visit and I go
05:35 wouldn't you want to live here and they
05:36 look at the traffic and they're like no
05:38 way I would never want to live there I
05:39 don't even live next to Wichita Kansas
05:41 City because I don't like big cities and
05:45 those are not really that big of a city
05:47 either one of those places and so what
05:50 they do when they go home and they take
05:52 on usually again they're living in a
05:54 generally conservative area it's not
05:57 extreme right it's just pretty much dead
05:59 center too right just a little bit
06:00 because the farmer has to have stability
06:02 in their lives and they can't be you
06:03 know worried about trends and stuff but
06:07 what they do as they take a liberal
06:11 agenda from the coastal regions that
06:14 they see on TV that they see on the
06:16 Oscars and the Grammys and tmz.com
06:19 and they absorb it they don't really
06:22 understand what they're what they're
06:23 doing the theaters orbit and in the end
06:27 what's going to occur is that their
06:29 Midwest sanctuary which protects their
06:32 inability to live in a city is going to
06:35 disappear because of Jena 21s coming and
06:37 it's destroying the Midwest all these
06:39 people will be herded into major cities
06:41 anyone that's a fifty to sixty years old
06:45 who's gonna live another 20 to 30 years
06:47 they find themselves in some you know
06:50 concentration camp city with massive
06:54 surveillance which is the agenda21
06:56 goal now in America we're fighting back
07:00 but you never know what's going to
07:00 happen right
07:01 so in order to go to their local
07:05 restaurants bars gatherings with their
07:08 friends they tote the surface layer of a
07:14 liberal agenda into the room and I don't
07:18 know what it's like for them to meet
07:20 each other but I definitely see it
07:21 online I see you know you're more
07:23 literally it's it's unbelievable the
07:25 guys in my high school that were more
07:27 feminine not necessarily gay by any
07:30 stretch just feminine dudes they tend to
07:35 huddle around these women who are doing
07:41 this game of hey I'm suddenly a liberal
07:44 and it's really funny because in this
07:46 show Little Britain they nailed this
07:49 archetype hugely and it was I don't know
07:52 if you guys have seen Little Britain it
07:54 was on BBC Four and it was the these two
07:57 guys had this great sketch comedy show I
08:00 forget what their names are they're
08:02 brilliant
08:02 one is sort of tall and handsome and the
08:05 other one is sort of short and chubby
08:08 probably handsome but he's so fat it was
08:11 ridiculous I think he lost a lot of his
08:12 weight but they also Kate come fly with
08:14 me was their second show they made but
08:16 they did Little Britain two seasons and
08:18 then a little Britain in America and
08:20 then they did come fly with me I don't I
08:23 don't think they work together anymore
08:24 but the fat guy absolutely hilarious
08:27 dude so talented it's ridiculous both of
08:31 them they could play like 50 characters
08:33 apiece but he created a skit called the
08:37 only gay in the village and he would
08:40 walk in his older book like this and he
08:42 wore this crazy out of his huge potbelly
08:44 and so he were like this tiny little
08:46 choker I think it was like yellow and
08:48 you know little bikini bottoms and stuff
08:51 and a g-string and he would go to the
08:54 pub in Britain you talk like this the
08:58 only gay the village you know and the
09:00 whole thing was he tried to be profound
09:03 by being gay then any of this little
09:07 tiny hat on to which was hilarious then
09:11 he I think put an advert out that it was
09:15 looking for men and all these like big
09:17 masculine guys kept coming into the bar
09:20 are you that guy who put the head out
09:23 you know and then all of a sudden it
09:25 came down to actually being gay and I
09:29 couldn't understand exactly how they put
09:30 the steel it was hilarious he would
09:32 suddenly get terrified of being with a
09:34 man and he'd make an excuse not to be
09:37 with the man and he would just there was
09:40 a female bartender who was the whole
09:42 rooms very accepting of the guy and he
09:44 wants them to not accept him he wants to
09:46 stand out and be a big you know look at
09:48 me look at me kind of dude right but
09:50 everyone accepts him the guys are coming
09:53 in one after the other trying to have
09:55 sex with the guy and he teeth I don't
09:57 know if he wasn't gay or he was scary to
09:59 begin or what the thing was but that was
10:00 the way the ski it worked and this is
10:02 how it's working in the Midwest for
10:04 these sort of ankle-deep intellectuals
10:09 claiming to be liberals when you start
10:13 interviewing them about their movement
10:15 about their party about what they
10:17 believe in how anything's gonna get paid
10:19 for and these socialistic programs they
10:21 in my experience these are what I
10:24 assumed to be very educated individuals
10:26 that come up bone-dry
10:28 absolutely bone-dry and so once you sort
10:34 of wake up a little bit to the world and
10:36 you can pick any subject on planet earth
10:38 you realize we have this massive inertia
10:42 towards fixing anything because we have
10:44 too many people believing the hoax or
10:47 believing in a philosophy they don't
10:49 really understand and what we're gonna
10:52 review here how many of you would like
10:55 you know to really get into space travel
10:59 but you look at NASA and you're like
11:01 yeah in fact I'm gonna look up a comment
11:04 here one second the comment was by a
11:09 person who calls himself Princeton Rubin
11:12 he made a great comment he or she made a
11:14 great comment the comment was on my
11:20 going off world episode which involves a
11:23 lot of space travel conversation a
11:25 little bit of NASA this NASA that now
11:27 again
11:28 constantly wreaking nests over the coals
11:31 because of their boatload of lies but
11:35 this person said look you know I really
11:38 kind of dial out of these episodes now
11:40 because NASA is such a liar I can't take
11:43 anything related to space travel
11:45 seriously and I kind of mentioned that
11:48 in the episode as we start I said you
11:49 know just stick with me here because
11:51 we're gonna move around NASA and go our
11:52 own way when you meet these individuals
11:56 who have obviously picked up some sort
12:00 of brochure online of what's trendy and
12:04 what's cool and then you attempt to have
12:07 a conversation with them about their own
12:09 massive agenda and they don't know
12:11 anything they don't know who George
12:14 Soros is that's such that's such a
12:16 common trait of these liberal morons
12:20 okay well he's the guy pulling all your
12:22 strings I mean you think you're thinking
12:24 for yourself but one of his 179
12:27 corporations are controlling what you
12:31 think you know when you voted and you
12:33 thought you voted for Trump but you're
12:35 your vote switched over to Hillary's
12:37 vote it's because that [ __ ] owns over
12:39 40 percent of the most popular voting
12:43 machine in the United States of America
12:45 it's pretty important you know that
12:48 right when you ask a liberal how money
12:50 gets valued in this world they have no
12:52 clue how fractional reserve banking
12:55 works they have no clue and it's just
12:58 categorical I'm yet to have a single
13:02 deep conversation on the Democrat side
13:05 about the facts of the world just the
13:07 basic facts this is before we even
13:09 debate philosophy of how what exists out
13:13 there that supports the world could be
13:16 manipulated ABCD to change the world in
13:19 one way or another they're unaware of
13:21 everything now there are some advanced
13:24 agendas that I don't really slight
13:26 anybody for because the agenda 21 is
13:29 again fully disclosed and fully
13:33 manicured at the EU side of the world
13:35 and the United States of America it's a
13:39 conspiracy theory
13:42 unbelievable I had this this band of
13:45 housewife's I stepped into their threat
13:50 on on Facebook because they were just
13:54 spouting a bunch of [ __ ] you know
13:56 don't know what they're talking about
13:58 and I you know I just reminded them that
14:00 what they were hating Trump for was
14:03 related to Trump turning off the you
14:06 know TPP NAFTA a bunch of the June 21
14:09 stuff and then this you know only gay in
14:15 the village woman came in she's
14:17 literally lesbian which is fine with me
14:20 it's just she really parades that as you
14:24 know I hate to say things you don't get
14:25 to say and you can't say anything
14:26 against me because I'm gonna use my
14:28 orientation as a defense mechanism and
14:29 it's like seriously we all knew when you
14:32 were like 12 this is the way you were we
14:35 fully accepted you so don't throw it
14:36 around as a big baton you know but she
14:39 steps in with the Yodo you're doing a
14:41 conspiracy world how do you figure men
14:45 it's it's every 10 years the EU meets on
14:48 it from 94 to 2004 to 2014 they meet on
14:52 it and talk about it publicly that's
14:54 under 21 moving everyone out of the
14:58 rural areas of the world into major
15:00 cities major surveillance major
15:03 surveillance in these cities the social
15:06 credit system that China has oh that's a
15:08 big part of it reducing world population
15:11 96 to 99 percent big part of it
15:15 it's just a part of their plan the other
15:18 thing that's really interesting is I
15:19 have liberal friends that will draw
15:22 rowdy population and the naivete there
15:26 is they believe they're on the list to
15:29 be the after group or that they think
15:33 the people that will come after them you
15:35 know that will survive the depopulation
15:37 are like them and it's nothing like them
15:40 there's two types of people that will
15:42 survive the depopulation if they ever
15:45 get their way it's going to be these
15:47 rich bankers slash royal families maybe
15:53 an Epstein or two and then a bunch of
15:55 Pez
15:55 it's a bunch of third-world peasants who
15:58 will not ask any questions which means
16:01 every white person on planet Earth if
16:03 they're not part of the banking cartel
16:04 we're gone we're gone anyone who is
16:09 intellectual gone you have to be a
16:12 Neanderthal to survive because they
16:15 don't want anyone that has the mental
16:17 capacity to question their their
16:20 methodology they're not looking to reset
16:22 again after the reset they may
16:24 inevitably say and you know ten thousand
16:26 years it might be necessary but they're
16:28 looking to genetically conditioned down
16:29 those that serve them and as soon as
16:33 robots can replace that lot then they're
16:36 just going to populate the world with
16:37 their seed you know but these are big
16:40 ideas nobody thinks in big ideas right
16:43 which is again why David Rockefeller
16:46 wrote in his memoirs he goes you know
16:49 this is why we operate at a level that
16:53 you can't conceive there's nothing to
16:56 fight because no one can conceive of
16:58 what we do and now because of the
17:01 sophistication of storytelling because
17:04 of the Internet's and because it's just
17:06 sort of the Great Awakening in itself we
17:09 are you know clawing our way up the side
17:12 of their skyscraper that has all these
17:16 floors with these chambers of things we
17:19 couldn't possibly imagine before I
17:22 always get the vision of like that
17:23 Ghostbusters building you know that
17:26 really crazy crazy building at the top
17:28 it's just all there child sacrifices up
17:30 there you know super hideous stuff that
17:34 you know we really can't deal with as a
17:37 society so the the the purpose of this
17:42 episode is to highlight the fact that
17:43 people are sort of trying to upgrade
17:47 their intelligence so they're I should
17:49 say their intellectual perception in the
17:52 world their persona by trying to
17:56 convince the world that they hate all
17:58 the right things right and again you
18:01 know I've gone over it several times
18:03 with people hating Trump just to seem
18:05 like they're intelligent you know they
18:08 they don't think for themselves
18:09 they'd haven't pieced together that they
18:13 operate in a bunch of oxymorons you know
18:16 when people say people say Trump is a
18:20 jackass
18:21 I can understand that because to their
18:23 standards they would never talk to
18:25 another soul the way that he talks to
18:27 folks right I got friends of mine that
18:28 say that have told me I've never called
18:31 anyone a name my entire life I'm like
18:35 wow that's [ __ ] amazing man because I
18:37 sure as [ __ ] have you know it's like
18:39 when someone is an [ __ ] boy they get
18:41 it man they get it a hundred percent I
18:43 call them completely out I don't think
18:45 people deserve to to navigate around
18:48 their their deeds right I'm not saying
18:52 don't forgive people but hey yeah it's
18:54 just like you were an [ __ ] yes you're
18:55 right yeah okay give me a boo-boo
18:57 we're all right so I don't have that
18:59 moral fiber to do that so when they see
19:03 Trump do it they're like oh my God he's
19:05 so you know you know visceral and then
19:09 it's like okay at least I get that I get
19:11 that part of it but there are a bunch of
19:13 folks and this is not Trump episode it's
19:15 just he's a fun target at this point for
19:17 this particular conversation but they'll
19:20 say that he doesn't know how to read I
19:23 don't know who is spreading this
19:24 freaking rumor it's just the funniest
19:27 thing if you actually believe that Trump
19:30 can't read it's unbelievable
19:32 great he reads off teleprompters all day
19:35 long graduates the top three in his
19:38 class and college I mean how do you get
19:40 through school how do you make ten
19:42 billion dollars how do you sign a
19:43 contract I mean it's like this isn't
19:46 what does it made whether it doesn't
19:47 know how to read
19:48 he just boxes what does he have to do
19:50 you know with anything Trump's office is
19:53 you know he he reads like JFK I mean
19:58 he's got like 20 magazines on his desk
20:00 this is the way he's been running his
20:02 own personal office and Trump Tower for
20:04 the last 40 years it's crazy and believe
20:07 me I know people with reading
20:08 disabilities that cover it up they they
20:10 fill up their living room with shelves
20:12 of books but they can't read two pages
20:13 of a script and a week I know people
20:17 like this you know they have 14 copies
20:20 of the Bible but they don't know who
20:21 Paul is that's a person does
20:23 know how to read and they need to cough
20:26 it up so we can move on past their
20:28 issues you know so I've seen the real
20:31 thing and what's nuts about it is you
20:36 know George Soros is funding whether
20:38 he's dead or none his organization is
20:40 funding the fight against freedom the
20:47 fight against anything other than
20:48 socialism he is fighting to implement
20:51 agenda 21 and Trump is the biggest
20:55 obstacle on planet Earth written to 21
20:58 right now in modern day history and so
21:01 of course all of these globalists are
21:04 moving in to displace him but now only
21:10 some of the group and I don't even know
21:12 what the percentage is but I would say
21:13 it's probably less than 5% of the group
21:15 understand that they're fighting for
21:16 agenda 21 you're Pelosi's understand
21:19 that your shift understands that so they
21:24 know how nefarious their plan is but the
21:26 Midwest wife's you know and I haven't
21:31 seen a guy do it well actually sorry no
21:32 I have like an effeminate guy I used to
21:34 hang out with when I was a little kid
21:35 and he's the one you know
21:38 Thanks everything's a conspiracy until
21:40 it's proven it's not a conspiracy and
21:42 then of course he knew it the entire
21:43 time that it wasn't a conspiracy so they
21:49 don't have any idea that they are
21:50 fighting for their own demise they're
21:54 fighting to [ __ ] everything up and it's
21:57 so sad you know as of right now
22:01 Australia is suffering one of the
22:03 largest fires and the history of their
22:06 entire island and my friend's a
22:09 geologist so I am confirmed it is
22:11 considered an island not a continent so
22:16 kim.com
22:16 a former client of mine he's up there
22:20 posting he has no idea that I know him -
22:22 it's funny
22:24 he's up there posting that the climate
22:27 change is real because he's seeing the
22:29 forest burn in Australia okay so there
22:34 he is advancing an agenda 21
22:37 population control mechanism kim.com is
22:40 exactly the kind of guy that will be
22:42 able to continue screwing and having
22:43 kids because he can buy his credits he
22:46 doesn't give a [ __ ] about you and the
22:48 fact that you'll never be able to buy
22:50 more than you could buy you know one
22:53 child with your with your climate change
22:55 credits your second one's gonna cost you
22:57 and your third one you need to be rich
22:59 right this guy would like three or four
23:01 kids what he doesn't understand cuz he's
23:05 really like he's completely asleep I
23:07 mean look at this guy's posts
23:09 I thought his heart was in the right
23:10 place he's you know he's on one of these
23:12 julian assange free things which I think
23:14 Julian should be pardoning freed
23:15 immediately and again I think Julian's
23:19 being held in Europe because they know
23:21 if he comes to America we're gonna
23:22 pardon him even though morons keep
23:25 saying that if he comes to America we're
23:26 gonna execute it it's like are you
23:28 kidding me he's the reason why Trump got
23:30 elected he's the reason why we're waking
23:31 up Q of all people said that he's
23:37 totally safe once he gets here but they
23:39 don't want to let him go because he
23:40 threatens the establishment over there
23:42 so they want to keep them in their
23:44 prisons over there hopefully until he
23:46 dies is there hope right anyway Kim
23:50 doesn't pay attention right so Kim
23:53 trills Kim trills drop nano-sized
23:57 aluminum oxide go s retired neural
24:00 surgeon dr. Russell Blaylock who has got
24:04 a sampling of this stuff and checked it
24:06 out and proven it well aluminum oxide
24:09 does to the soil in the ground is that
24:12 it takes it from a negative acidity
24:15 which is important for growing crops
24:17 because I think it's like six point
24:19 three to six point seven is the growth
24:22 index for acidity in soil and it
24:26 alkaline is it back to zero
24:28 but once the nitrates are gone in the
24:31 soil and goes to zero the the plants die
24:38 sorry cats in heat or whatever is like
24:41 it's a dude cat to that I understand it
24:43 but once all of that spraying on
24:47 Australia settles for 5/10
24:51 years you've got a ton of gutted plants
24:55 that are ready to burn they don't have
24:58 to be necessarily completely dead but
24:59 they're super duper extra dry and their
25:02 internals our super duper extra dry
25:05 because the internal of a plant systemic
25:07 Lee dies first and then the outside dies
25:09 right so as soon as they want to drop
25:13 the match on that place Kapow
25:16 so they're orchestrating as david icke
25:18 would say the problem reaction solution
25:20 to instantiate climate change / you know
25:26 the climate change credits your carbon
25:29 credits and kim comm an influencer on
25:33 twitter is out there pumping [ __ ]
25:37 because i guess the guy doesn't have
25:38 enough time pull his head out of his ass
25:40 and didn't study anything and he also
25:43 took the whole tact that were you know
25:45 climate change you know climate change
25:47 deniers which he's trying to link it to
25:49 the holocaust rate what a [ __ ]
25:51 [ __ ] that we're all idiots because we
25:54 actually studied you know from the head
25:57 meteorologists at MIT from the top
25:59 patent holding guy at nasa from one of
26:02 the cofounders of greenpeace right and
26:04 three other experts that are above all
26:06 three of those guys the first six dudes
26:09 who created there was who were hired to
26:12 investigate global warming back at two
26:16 thousand three then sued for ten years
26:20 to get their name off of gal Gore's list
26:21 because they said this is all fraud but
26:24 this is how someone creates a faux
26:28 position but maybe it's even a real
26:30 position on a faux subject that they
26:32 don't know a [ __ ] thing about to seem
26:36 intellectual right I'm sure when Kim
26:39 common less he's literally getting paid
26:41 he's hiding in new zealand's because
26:43 there's no extradition I don't exactly
26:45 know exactly what his problem was I mean
26:47 he created the beggar download I don't
26:49 think that was a violation of anything
26:52 they said he was a huge hacker back in
26:53 the day and did a bunch of crimes I
26:57 don't know I personally have no idea why
27:00 that guy's in there other than mega
27:01 download but what if it is part of
27:05 his case I doubt this is the case but
27:07 what if part of his settlement to get
27:10 out of his perpetual lawsuit that he
27:12 seems to be in with the entire planet is
27:13 start toting the climate change thing
27:16 start toting the carbon credit thing and
27:18 then we could see that you have
27:20 influenced and infected our agenda 21
27:23 Pro agenda 21 depopulation thing then me
27:28 will light in your churches and so he
27:30 goes out there he goes okay I do that he
27:33 told everyone to see TED talks to get
27:35 educated isn't that funny
27:37 oh really TED talks of all the [ __ ]
27:40 places on planet Earth right the
27:43 controlled super police agenda 21
27:46 [ __ ] you know talking points show
27:51 there's TEDx and there's Ted I have
27:55 categorically found that the people that
27:57 watch in a TED as a super addicted thing
28:00 are the most [ __ ] indoctrinated
28:02 people on planet earth the faux
28:04 intellectuals who can't come up with an
28:07 idea of their own right you sit down and
28:10 it's like well did you hear what this
28:11 person said did you hear what that
28:13 person said I read a book I read a book
28:15 I wrote a book and said okay that's all
28:17 great you know it's alright if you do
28:18 this stuff but since I've been talking
28:20 to you haven't heard you come up with
28:23 your own idea once wouldn't that be nice
28:27 because I'm not sitting down with that
28:29 person who wrote the book I'm not
28:31 sitting down at my TV watching a [ __ ]
28:33 TED talk I'm sitting here talking to you
28:35 so why don't you try just to clear your
28:38 mind of all the other [ __ ] you've heard
28:41 from somebody else why don't you turn a
28:43 little bit of IQ some little
28:45 intellectual quota here intelligence
28:48 quota and try to think up a thought on
28:50 your own make a connection that's never
28:53 been made why don't you do that and you
28:57 would see their head [ __ ] employed
28:58 right now what's interesting as I've
29:01 said several times on the show is that
29:03 when you do find people that are all
29:06 caught up in this this intellectual
29:09 hatred
29:10 and I set them down here in this back
29:13 patio and I say you know what do you
29:18 believe and they'll come off with things
29:21 that are totally different than me Pro
29:25 this Pro that anti-this anti-that
29:28 Trump's a douche whatever
29:30 Bernie's [ __ ] Jesus Christ on earth
29:33 something like that okay that's cool I
29:36 totally respect your opinion you know
29:38 and we get all the hatred out it's
29:42 almost like rubbing out a bunch of
29:44 lactic acid another system right and as
29:47 soon as they kind of get it all out
29:48 they've sort of it's almost like
29:51 throwing up
29:52 food poisoning it's all over the ground
29:55 right and then I say okay so what you're
29:58 really saying is I go down this line of
30:02 things that we all want it's the same
30:05 list that I have and then they're like
30:07 oh yeah
30:09 yes that's pretty much what I want am i
30:11 okay just so you know I believe
30:13 completely opposite everything that you
30:15 believe but my list of things that I
30:18 want to have happen on this planet are
30:19 exactly the same as yours and then we
30:23 compare notes we compare our list and I
30:25 say okay if you just had to generically
30:27 say without political bias without some
30:30 other thing going on agenda bias what is
30:34 the number one thing that will get your
30:36 list looking right the first step no
30:41 matter what it's always education
30:45 education education education education
30:48 fixes racism education fixes people
30:51 without jobs education starts to teach
30:54 you history and then you start to
30:55 identify the patterns that exist today
30:57 that if we don't change things we're
30:59 gonna repeat it really hardcore so in
31:03 the recent news here we've killed this
31:06 this general in the Middle East
31:08 the guy was in town orchestrating a an
31:12 anti-american event they Lily broke into
31:15 the embassy and burned it down I've seen
31:17 the photographs of it it's all burned up
31:19 insides all torn up inside the guy was
31:22 there to watch the mayhem
31:24 it's on a helicopter poof that shoes a
31:26 stylist guy he is dead now one of the
31:31 interesting things about the
31:32 intellectual hatred side of things is
31:34 the position they might have on war it's
31:37 very interesting when Trump tried to
31:40 pull everyone out of Syria all these
31:42 really liberals were like you got to
31:44 keep everybody in there we're like no
31:46 wait a minute are you the old Jim Crow
31:50 KKK folks that are racists and you don't
31:54 really care about the value of human
31:55 life so you want all of our young you
31:58 know men and women to die in that region
31:59 for no [ __ ] reason whatsoever or are
32:01 we not supposed to be a police state and
32:05 we're supposed to pull everybody back to
32:06 America so that we can actually take
32:08 care of our own which is what almost
32:10 every single likes Indian American
32:13 beliefs so when you see us get
32:15 propagated out there's war mongering
32:17 folks do you understand
32:19 you know the current president and most
32:21 the citizens by 65% ez1 everyone out of
32:26 every country want all of our soldiers
32:28 out of every single country but the
32:30 United States of America we want them
32:32 all back here out of Europe out of Asia
32:35 out of the Middle East
32:36 we want them all here now we protect oil
32:38 unfortunately so we're gonna have a
32:40 contingency in the Middle East no matter
32:41 what which is half the reason why most
32:44 of us hate the notion of running the
32:46 world on oil it's it's empowering a
32:49 bunch of Neanderthals okay but so we
32:54 knock out a general who's like literally
32:57 the the real deal Osama bin Laden right
33:01 sama bin Laden we're not quite sure he
33:03 was the CIA said you know fight the
33:05 Afghan Russian war he was a very rich
33:09 kid he was literally an asset he was in
33:12 the al CIA to database right as George
33:15 Bush always calls al Qaeda I said we
33:18 really nail a real bad guy you know
33:20 everyone we detain at 9/11 we're not
33:23 sure who was you know really a bad guy
33:24 and he wasn't a bad guy it was a bad
33:27 dude and now because they have this this
33:32 platform of intellectual hatred for the
33:35 president United States
33:37 they are now trying to make this guy a
33:39 martyr right they take a Satan on earth
33:43 and they make the guy a martyr it's
33:45 always that way right this is the danger
33:48 of this process and I'm just mentioning
33:50 ones that are American centric those of
33:53 you in Europe
33:53 you have your own versions of these
33:55 individuals all over the place you know
33:58 all these these sjw's that we're trying
34:01 to say that Sharia law was [ __ ]
34:03 awesome and so they said it's totally
34:06 safe in the Middle East there's been at
34:09 least two females one of them was a
34:11 reporter and I believe a two couples
34:15 that have tried to cross Eurasia the
34:20 Middle East they were all caught raped
34:24 and murdered all of them not a single
34:27 person made it across well there you go
34:29 you we had our LGBTQ community defending
34:34 Sharia law and Muslim invasion of Europe
34:37 and then there's video after video of
34:40 them trying to leave a nightclub and
34:41 being murdered in the parking lot I have
34:45 seen one of these filmed in 2013 this
34:49 guy came out of the club and these
34:51 Muslims chased him down and beat him to
34:53 death and killed him in the parking lot
34:54 oh I think these are the people that
34:57 you're supporting what are you [ __ ]
35:00 nuts if they take control you're going
35:03 to be exterminated like you know the
35:05 mentally disabled under Hitler's regime
35:08 and that's not even exaggeration you'll
35:11 be exterminated this is matter if you
35:13 believe in Allah or not if you're gay or
35:16 abnormal and their eyes you're not
35:19 heterosexual you're dead dead dead dead
35:22 and maybe they save you the pain by
35:24 shooting you in the head or chopping
35:26 your head off completely but I don't
35:28 know if you've seen the latest videos on
35:30 how you know the Sharia law guys kill
35:32 people in the desert it's not always
35:34 painless so right but it's interesting
35:39 that someone through some lazy brained
35:44 existence can can find the the recipe
35:48 the unequivocal
35:50 Sippi of their own demise and worship it
35:54 nurture it and feed it and spread it
35:57 it's like are you kidding me
36:00 look at all the nasa fanboys the Elon
36:03 Musk fanboys SpaceX fanboys maybe even a
36:09 fanboy of theoretical physics okay so
36:14 how do these individuals get to keep
36:16 going and going and going lying and
36:19 lying in line stealing billions of
36:21 dollars because fanboys are lazy they're
36:28 in this repeat you know memorize and
36:31 repeat pattern of life and because they
36:34 can sit at the Thanksgiving table and
36:37 rattle off a bunch of statistics about
36:40 the Falcon nine or I don't know project
36:44 Orion or whatever it is and their
36:46 families like see I told you he was
36:48 brilliant
36:50 they feel good they've accomplished
36:53 their goal they've gotten alka leads
36:56 from individuals that they care about
36:58 and that's the real goal and that's a
37:02 simple funny part about intellectual
37:03 hatred is that it's really to get a goal
37:05 of acceptance in society because it's
37:09 think about it if you want to fix
37:14 something what's the last thing that you
37:18 do you don't break it all right
37:22 because breaking and fixing or polar
37:25 opposites mutually exclusive concepts
37:27 and so if you want to fix society and
37:31 you want to call yourself an
37:33 intellectual the funny part is is
37:37 introducing an algorithm of hatred into
37:39 society is a destructive philosophy
37:46 hatred hmm
37:49 you know I don't know what your parents
37:51 said when you were a kid but when my
37:53 when I was a child I used the word hate
37:56 very sparingly when I was a kid but if I
37:58 ever slipped up and said it my parents
38:01 would say you know don't say that word
38:04 and I say why so because it's way more
38:07 powerful than you think it's not good
38:09 for you to say then you don't really
38:11 hate anything and it's true even as a
38:16 child the concept of Satan or whatever
38:19 you think is like the unequivocal thing
38:20 to hate you really don't have a concept
38:22 for hatred someone's ever done you wrong
38:25 that bad
38:26 you might be afraid of things in terms
38:28 of hatred well some some of you've
38:29 definitely experienced some things where
38:31 you can definitely say I hated that so
38:34 to you you get that privilege 100% but
38:38 now when you hate something do you feel
38:40 awesome do your does your biology go
38:44 yeah totally hate that guy it feels so
38:47 much better now that I've said it mm-hmm
38:51 hatred as well these things where what
38:54 you're really telling yourself is I
38:56 really wish I wasn't here right now I
38:59 really wish I wasn't here to have
39:01 experienced something that makes me hate
39:03 something and that's important to
39:06 realize you know when you're a child
39:09 you'll have a dispute with another child
39:12 though there be your brother your sister
39:13 or some neighbor friend and the mothers
39:16 who sit over the situation or a mother
39:20 especially if it's your brother and
39:22 sister because your mother with a
39:23 brother and sister situation have she
39:25 has no choice but to love both of her
39:28 kids and to not take sides
39:31 she's just realizing the children are
39:33 are angry at each other for whatever
39:35 reason he's touching me and so you have
39:38 this parent parental unit you know
39:40 coming in and being beautiful to both of
39:43 you to get you both calmed down now if
39:47 you rub her nerves too much she's gonna
39:50 pop on you and swap both of you but even
39:53 in that gesture she loves you
39:56 you're both her children and so it's
40:00 funny about it or interesting or ironic
40:01 about it is that when we look at society
40:03 we're not being that parent
40:07 we're being someone that is exacerbating
40:10 the hate or maybe one of the children
40:13 creating the hatred as if somehow this
40:16 is gonna pan out in the end now I told
40:19 you guys that during the Trump and
40:21 Pietschmann there was this whole thing
40:22 of I had a celebrity friend of mine
40:24 that's went out the night of the
40:27 impeachment vote and you know ran around
40:30 la celebrating this whole event you know
40:34 no crimes at all in the impeachment
40:36 articles just you're a poopoo head sort
40:38 of charges right and it doesn't take
40:42 more than a few seconds to realize this
40:44 is this individual if I mention half the
40:47 things I mentioned on this show about
40:48 true world agendas especially gender
40:51 twenty-one of all things it's like it's
40:54 like talking to someone in the jungle
40:57 about how to fix miniaturize electronics
41:01 it's not their fault they don't know but
41:05 if they started you know talking to you
41:07 about how crappy your video camera is or
41:10 whatever and they don't even have a
41:11 conception of what it is then you're
41:14 gonna be a little confused right you're
41:17 at least gonna say well maybe you should
41:19 learn about this a little bit and then
41:20 maybe you won't hate it so much what's
41:23 fascinating about the United States of
41:25 America in 2020 January it sounds so
41:28 much better than 2019 is that things are
41:33 being fixed for the American citizens
41:35 and we have a tremendous amount of
41:38 American citizens that double down that
41:40 the individual that's helping things get
41:42 better wasn't going to be able to do
41:44 such a thing we had the previous
41:46 president do speeches that said there's
41:50 no way that jobs can be created by the
41:52 government a guy that pulled every cheap
41:57 trick in the book to increase the
41:58 bureaucracy of welfare to get people on
42:01 welfare so you could soup up all the
42:04 welfare programs and then hire more
42:06 government workers to say that you
42:09 created job
42:10 so his whole methodology of creating
42:12 jobs was to rape the people of their
42:14 jobs and then make the government bigger
42:18 part of the agenda 21 is to make
42:20 government as big as possible he was
42:23 about to sign the TPP which would have
42:26 been NAFTA on steroids I mean it really
42:28 was it was going to gut this place it's
42:30 gonna gut your place to anyone who signs
42:32 it you just pulled the trigger on the
42:36 gun up to your head it's an automatic
42:38 not a writ not a revolver so the bullets
42:41 coming down the barrel at your brains
42:43 and you're gonna be splattered all over
42:45 the wall if you say if your government
42:47 sign the TPP so in America we have an
42:50 interesting thing that the president and
42:52 the administration has fixed one thing
42:55 after another making things better stock
42:58 markets record high unemployment record
43:00 low
43:01 we've drastically reduced the amount of
43:04 legal immigrants coming over slash drug
43:07 cartels coyotes and child traffickers
43:09 Plus rapes that go on during those
43:12 experiences with the Coyotes and then we
43:16 have like you know good 40 percent 35 40
43:19 percent of the citizens pissing and
43:21 moaning that things are so great because
43:23 they don't want to be wrong it's more
43:25 important that they're right with their
43:26 faux intellectual minds than for the
43:30 country to be better in Europe it's the
43:34 complete opposite right
43:35 you have Europe and I mean at the
43:39 citizens necessarily I have no idea what
43:41 the percentages are based on your
43:43 comments you guys are awake and it's
43:46 something you're working on right BRICS
43:48 it's about to occur at the end of this
43:50 month thank God but in Europe there's
43:54 this were the EU were amazing we have no
43:57 national borders we have a bunch of
44:00 folks in the Middle East invading our
44:01 countries every single major country in
44:06 that Europe is now bankrupt Germany
44:08 France Spain and Italy bankrupt man
44:11 they're printing money now which is what
44:14 we were doing in Obama zero they're
44:16 doing quantitative easing printing tons
44:18 and tons of euros to fix the problem
44:20 which is going to bite you in the ass
44:22 you're going to go from B
44:24 about $1 10 to the American dollar back
44:26 down to 77 cents then probably down to
44:28 50 cents until you're a peso so this
44:32 this outer shell says that everything is
44:35 great but what's going on and underneath
44:37 is a complete self-destruction of Europe
44:40 all the culture built up in Germany
44:43 France Spain Italy all over the place is
44:47 disintegrating under the --use pressure
44:54 okay so how the hell was that able to
44:57 stay there it's because of this faux
45:02 intellectual behavior everything that
45:04 made those countries great has been
45:07 hated you're not supposed to have again
45:11 was it national borders
45:14 okay so let's just get rid of all of the
45:17 traditions of those countries the food
45:20 the the Wardrobe the culture the history
45:23 everything the language itself should go
45:27 away
45:27 I guess everyone should speak I don't
45:29 know English what I don't pick a
45:30 language pick any language and you're
45:32 all supposed to speak it since no one in
45:34 those three countries has a native
45:36 English bound thing I guess you should
45:38 pick English because that way you can
45:39 hate your native language as well if it
45:43 starts to sound really ridiculous well
45:45 there you go we're starting to make
45:47 progress here my big question is when is
45:50 this gonna stop
45:51 you know and how is it gonna stop and
45:53 we're ever gonna take a position with
45:55 our friends and family to go you know
45:57 I'm not gonna be heating anything
45:59 anymore you know what I'm gonna look at
46:01 the same thing I would look at for an
46:04 employee that I've hired for my company
46:06 one of the best things you can do with
46:09 your life is to be results-driven what
46:12 is the opposite of results-driven well
46:15 in my opinion it has to do with people
46:16 that chase schedules you know not not
46:19 keeping things on schedule that's
46:20 something you have to that's a
46:22 results-driven person but you know when
46:25 your ass is in the seat when it comes
46:27 time to you know start the job but my
46:31 employees all probably hundred of them I
46:34 always told them I said well here's the
46:37 thing
46:37 if you have a meeting with a client then
46:40 you need to be you know spiffed up
46:42 dressed up properly if whatever job we
46:44 are dealing with here at OU beats suits
46:46 or anything but just look good smell
46:48 good and be there on time
46:50 100% be prepared for your meeting then
46:54 bring all the data you get for the
46:55 meeting distributed to folks that need
46:57 the information make sure we're on
46:58 schedule but as long as the project's
47:01 come in on time and on budget you'll
47:04 never hear me complain about you rolling
47:07 in at 11 o'clock in the morning I don't
47:09 care come in you know stay home three
47:11 days a week I don't care as long as
47:13 everything gets done on time and I feel
47:16 like I'm getting from you the value for
47:21 my salary that I'm paying you I'm good
47:24 now some hard asses might say well if
47:27 they can get that done with the amount
47:29 of time that you give them and the money
47:30 you give them the work of extra hard so
47:32 you can put two of them in there or 1.5
47:34 of those things in there well what's
47:37 funny is when you leave people alone and
47:39 they love their life and they love their
47:42 projects they do it by themselves and
47:46 I'll just give you a little digression a
47:47 little story to give them once before
47:50 it's been 500 episodes had an employee I
47:54 had just joined the company he was a
47:59 producer previous manager that was
48:03 managing this guy she had told our upper
48:06 boss that you should be fired he was so
48:08 bad at his job she resigns I take over
48:14 her producers I realized these guys
48:17 haven't been told anything about our
48:19 produce not a single word so I said okay
48:22 guys what's the best day of your whole
48:24 life and they told me I said okay I'm
48:27 gonna make that the way it's supposed to
48:28 be you guys cool with that like hell
48:31 yeah 100% buy-in you're just telling me
48:33 that I told you my best day ever
48:35 meaning the best project ever how it
48:37 went and you're gonna make that the
48:39 standard I said yeah isn't it the best
48:41 way to do it right yeah [ __ ] yeah it is
48:43 the best way you do it this guy who's a
48:47 very successful real estate guy today
48:49 he took on five projects at once his
48:55 cohorts his companions within the
48:58 producer layer of the company were
49:00 probably one or two this dude took five
49:03 brought in all five on time it was his
49:07 choice
49:08 but now he set the bar within the within
49:12 the department that if you're a producer
49:13 and I'm doing five what are you doing
49:16 and so guys started taking more and more
49:18 and more and everyone's bringing him all
49:20 in on time within a month my boss before
49:23 he resigned who had balled his guy out
49:27 because he took the advice of the other
49:29 manager who left set the guy down and he
49:32 was big enough and I love this guy
49:34 forever for doing this he sat across the
49:36 table from the dude and said you know I
49:38 was told that you were really bad at
49:40 your job and I'm sorry that I bought
49:42 into that evaluation of you because
49:45 under you know Mark you're kicking ass
49:48 to take a name so I apologize keep doing
49:51 it and we gave him a raise and then my
49:54 boss quit and then I took his job but it
49:58 went from a hatred based model for this
50:01 guy you're hated you're about to get
50:04 laid off and we flipped it to a positive
50:07 realm of not only you're not going to
50:09 get fired but your methodology of
50:10 managing a project is now the standard
50:12 for everyone in the whole company in
50:14 this particular division of the company
50:16 and it was even bigger than that because
50:19 the second-in-command at Electronic Arts
50:22 a woman named Nancy Smith wonderful lady
50:26 she was about to liquidate the entire
50:28 department just before I got hired and
50:30 even after I got hired they still had us
50:32 on the chopping block as my producers
50:35 started to turn in project after project
50:37 getting every single division of the
50:39 company on track I showed her the new
50:42 process she just said it literally in a
50:46 meeting she goes I've been waiting for
50:48 two years for this to happen I love this
50:50 and she canceled the initiative to
50:55 layoff everyone in the in the company in
50:57 that particular area and we proceeded to
51:00 kick ass and take names and my producers
51:03 and my workers have been some of the
51:06 most successful employees after ei of
51:08 any company I've ever worked for so it
51:12 turned into a positive constructive
51:14 world and that's what we have to do for
51:18 our our countries we have to do it for
51:20 the world itself you know you know that
51:24 if you've watched the show habitually
51:27 there are a ton of things we need to
51:29 discuss in this world and we're too
51:32 afraid to have the conversation you do
51:34 have to control our population growth we
51:36 do problem is is the two countries that
51:39 violate the the world's population the
51:41 most one of Communists ik and the other
51:44 one is sort of so ass-backwards it's
51:49 it's gonna take some initiatives but
51:53 they have to believe in one of them
51:56 believes in world domination and the
51:59 other ones just kind of chilling you
52:00 know we do have to figure out a way to
52:03 get off of oil what we do it's a bad
52:05 substance to use in America I can tell
52:09 you that for a lot of us what we have
52:12 come to the grips with is that children
52:15 have been running our country for
52:18 decades and decades and decades they may
52:20 be old looking they may be very old in
52:23 general but what does a child do that's
52:26 different than an adult especially when
52:30 it comes to like the haves and the
52:32 have-nots the playing with toys well
52:36 your little bastard kids always say you
52:39 know mine mine my and they won't let
52:42 anyone else play with their toys and you
52:44 know you'll see a kid play with a fire
52:46 hydrant and he gets tired of it he puts
52:48 it off to the side he's playing with
52:49 something else another kid comes up
52:51 picks up the fire hydrant has a blast
52:53 with it and as soon as he sees the other
52:55 kid having a fun with the toys not
52:57 playing with now the sudden he wants it
52:58 back she puts out the second toy that he
53:01 was playing with the kid grabs the
53:03 second toy the alternate and starts
53:05 having fun with it well then he wants it
53:07 back it's childish behavior right well
53:12 the older politicians in the United
53:14 States
53:15 and this includes all levels of
53:18 government they have been playing that
53:20 game for a long time
53:22 your money's their money and their
53:25 money's their money it's all about how
53:27 can you be a politician get a lifetime
53:31 pension get the best health care in the
53:33 world
53:34 commit crimes I mean serious boy
53:38 touching girl touching crimes like
53:41 Podesta Biden Biden's on video pinching
53:46 girl's boobs little tiny girls four or
53:49 five year old girls he's on video doing
53:52 it if you haven't seen it you're a
53:53 coward go look at it this guy is running
53:56 for the President of the United States
53:58 that's the old guard
54:01 going after the new garden well in
54:04 America we're done we're done with that
54:06 crap children have been running this
54:09 country for way too long
54:11 all the agendas that they say that
54:14 they're qualified to rule down on they
54:16 have absolutely zero knowledge of
54:19 economics ones last time we had anyone
54:22 in the house the Senate or the White
54:24 House that knew anything about economics
54:26 apparently none we have been in a boom
54:31 and bust cycle since I was a kid every
54:35 six to eight years they crashed the
54:37 economy you know they crashed it 92 93
54:43 then the internet gave us a little bit
54:45 of a reprieve so 9/11 happens in the
54:47 crash in 2002 then they crash at six
54:50 years later in 2008 and because we
54:54 changed guards and the 2008 is still
54:57 ripping us up to this day but since we
55:00 changed guard things are coming back now
55:02 we got a guy that understands money and
55:05 we've got this intellectual hatred for
55:07 every bit of progress that's going on we
55:10 have what is it Bill Maher the guy was
55:15 some really weird kid touching
55:16 organization in the background he
55:20 literally told his fans okay that he
55:24 doesn't mind a recession if it gets rid
55:26 of our president
55:27 is it multi-multi-millionaire wishing
55:31 harm on the entire country especially
55:34 the middle class and the lower class
55:36 right those are already in poverty
55:38 already on welfare he's telling you I
55:40 don't mind if you suffer for another you
55:46 know recessions never come and go in a
55:48 year right our recession comes
55:51 technically speaking in case you don't
55:53 know this in America a recession takes
55:55 two years to completely envelop the
55:58 entire country it happens on the coasts
56:00 first because it's more highly populated
56:03 more densely populated industrial areas
56:05 of America and then it takes about two
56:08 years to reach the Midwest and that's
56:10 just full of proliferation of the
56:12 destruction of a recession and then it
56:15 lasts another two to four years after
56:17 that and then it repairs in the exact
56:20 same orientation who repairs on the
56:22 coasts first and then repairs in the
56:24 Central America second again another
56:27 two-year cycle so Bill Maher just wished
56:31 upon the people there's a bunch of
56:32 people to jump behind this as soon as he
56:34 said it he wished four to six to eight
56:38 years of recession suffering for
56:42 Americans simply because he doesn't want
56:45 to admit that his party was wrong about
56:48 everything for decades and decades and
56:51 decades and hey the Republican Party was
56:52 screwed up too you think the Bush family
56:55 doesn't participate in you know world
56:58 economics my god they're part of the
57:00 hidden Rockefeller banking cartel
57:03 families you know their wealth has been
57:07 calculated in some regards as being
57:10 nearly a trillion dollars with the
57:11 wealth that might be [ __ ] but
57:13 they're definitely in the billions
57:16 so having rich people privileged people
57:18 wish harm on everyone else in this faux
57:22 intellectual hatred in order to not be
57:25 wrong right they're gonna crash
57:27 everything and celebrate it so they
57:31 don't have to correct themselves can you
57:34 think of anything more cowardly can you
57:37 think of anything more selfish than that
57:39 that
57:40 piñon Europe I mean I know very little
57:43 about exactly what's going on except I
57:45 have a friend in Sweden and she's
57:49 telling me that her country is just
57:52 completely upside-down she was here and
57:55 she's fully Americanized but she had to
57:57 move back as her mother wasn't feeling
57:58 well and she sends me emails every once
58:01 while she goes you wouldn't even believe
58:02 this place she goes I can barely
58:04 recognize it because we have all these
58:07 sanctuary cities we have these
58:08 communities where no one you know earns
58:10 a dime but they're paying their rent
58:12 with all of our tax dollars she goes
58:15 this is insane
58:16 okay you get to two choices to fix that
58:18 problem you have the intellectual hatred
58:21 side of it and then you have the
58:22 pragmatics let's just fix the problem
58:26 one you need to turn off the e you get
58:30 out of it
58:30 let it go bust bad experiment socialism
58:34 only precedes dictators right
58:37 it's socialism it's a gun grab Second
58:40 Amendment reduction of Rights and then
58:45 the dictator shows up and you're all
58:47 under a thumb and that's the gym twenty
58:48 one hundred percent that's what's going
58:50 on right so you can you can pull out of
58:54 the EU and then shut off all this you
58:58 know subsidies to people that shouldn't
58:59 be in your country in the first place
59:00 and send them back home
59:02 that's the intellectual solution to the
59:05 problem or you could go the faux hatred
59:08 problem and say oh we got to have a
59:10 revolutionary have it sir we have to
59:11 have a civil war and every one of these
59:13 countries to kill these people and to
59:15 chase them out of the country and create
59:17 a bunch of enemies well which one sounds
59:21 better right which one sounds better
59:25 agenda21 you know there's a whole
59:28 episode on it you need to go see it and
59:30 then you need to do your research
59:31 Rosa Cory as a person you need to look
59:34 up they need to bankrupt every country
59:39 because the the goal of agenda 21 is to
59:42 spread poverty not to spread wealth they
59:47 want to take all first world countries
59:48 and bring them down to third world
59:49 country levels it's in their paperwork
59:52 okay
59:52 it's what's happening to the Europe
59:55 European community the more that America
59:58 prospers the more they hate the fact
60:01 that there's a half across the ocean and
60:03 so instead of becoming halves in their
60:06 own world they want to tear down the
60:08 halves across the pond it's a faux
60:11 intellectual exercise you're not
60:14 intellectual if that's your goal if
60:16 someone else has to lose so that you can
60:18 win you're immature you don't understand
60:21 how the game works instead of being a
60:23 competitive sport to see how you know
60:27 your experiment of running your world
60:29 can be better it's let's see who can you
60:33 know survive with as little as possible
60:37 who can suffer the most I don't know
60:41 about you but I don't think we can
60:42 afford to go down that that track okay
60:46 so the reason why I make this episode is
60:49 to identify this this sort of algorithm
60:53 of behavior that we've all suffered from
60:56 right when we were young we did all have
60:59 mine mine mine attitude but we were
61:01 children most likely we got into our 20s
61:05 and we carried a little bit further you
61:08 see someone else succeed you get jealous
61:10 and envious and so you want them to fail
61:14 instead of wanting to succeed more than
61:18 them perhaps if you want to be
61:19 competitive I mentioned this once before
61:22 but when I was first getting into
61:23 professional video game artistry I
61:28 joined a little company in Oxnard
61:30 California whose initial name was atomic
61:32 entertainment they eventually changed
61:34 the name to aftershock entertainment the
61:36 company went out of business before they
61:37 released any of their three products and
61:40 it's because of the Super Nintendo was
61:42 killing PC games but we all went off and
61:44 made our own games I made a game called
61:45 beaten warriors my other buddies I
61:48 forgot what their knick game was called
61:49 was pretty cool it was like a Robocop
61:50 sort of robot running around shooting
61:52 things and a level it was really
61:54 beautiful all hand-drawn was amazing
61:57 but I get hired in I think late June of
62:01 1989 and I had turned in my first prod
62:07 for a game called Robo Wars by the end
62:10 of I probably about July 25th or so
62:14 right so about a month I did a you know
62:18 I did the world artwork so when you're
62:19 looking top down this game you were
62:21 seeing San Francisco in the future the
62:24 CEO pulls up my work in front of the
62:26 entire group of artists and unbeknownst
62:28 to me says look at this this is
62:31 fantastic
62:32 he's already done and some of you guys
62:35 have been working on the same project
62:37 for six months and you're still drawing
62:39 it and your stuff doesn't look this good
62:41 and of course I got really embarrassed
62:43 cuz I'm 19 years old oh no God and
62:45 you're making me an enemy of everyone in
62:47 the whole room but here's what happened
62:51 there's a dude in Wisconsin he was
62:53 drawing some part of one of our games
62:55 and when I saw it it was a very remedial
63:00 art I just couldn't believe is sort of a
63:02 grown man late 20s early 30s something
63:04 like that nineteen
63:06 he was done in a week because he was
63:10 embarrassed that he took so long for his
63:11 artwork but this other kid who was the
63:14 uber artist I mean this guy was the one
63:17 that I talked about several times who
63:18 taught me how to draw animations
63:21 properly and just a lot of tricks of the
63:23 tree this it was a deluxe paint he was
63:26 teaching me how to draw on it as I was
63:28 already an artist that wasn't a question
63:31 but he turns in within I don't know two
63:35 weeks this unbelievably gorgeous but
63:41 King Arthur Castle it was for one of our
63:44 games called enchanted lands and which I
63:47 don't think I worked on that game but he
63:51 it was beautiful it was a top down tile
63:53 based artwork system because that's all
63:56 you had back in those days but I mean it
63:58 was every meticulous detail of bricks of
64:01 you know aged stone that built these
64:05 castles little tiny nooks of you know
64:09 you know wood structures and and kiosks
64:13 and stuff all over the grounds of the of
64:15 a castle it was gorgeous
64:18 but why did he turn that in so fast and
64:20 why did he knock it out of the park
64:22 because his boss said look at this kid
64:25 what my coworker didn't do was sabotage
64:30 me because there was no way he could do
64:32 it I went back to my house
64:33 drew and camarillo bringing in the disks
64:36 the Oxnard I don't know where he lived
64:38 but he kicked ass and took names and he
64:41 made me go to the next level when it
64:44 came time for me to turn on my next
64:46 project and so we just kept leapfrogging
64:50 each other and it was this beautiful
64:52 competitive friendly situation and the
64:56 kid never matters as a matter of fact
64:58 when I had to draw the sprites for my
65:01 next project which was drawing for game
65:03 called time riff I was doing all of the
65:06 Greek gods
65:07 so Medusa and you know what is it the
65:10 two-headed wolf and just a bunch of
65:14 really complex stuff he sat down and
65:17 taught me how to do it well here I am
65:20 the competitive kid and he didn't he
65:23 didn't humble hobbled me in any way
65:25 shape or form he helped me out and
65:29 that's the spirit of really Southern
65:32 California in general when you really
65:33 meet the good people that make things
65:35 happen they don't covet and one that's
65:38 what I've been trying to bring you folks
65:39 in every single realm of thinking but we
65:42 have to get to a point if we're ever
65:44 again we're we're trying to get to we're
65:46 ever going to get to Gene Roddenberry's
65:48 worlds where everyone's at equal level
65:50 of education matter if you're in the
65:51 jungle or if you're in the city you have
65:54 the same exact education meaning the
65:56 same opportunities you have different
65:58 needs wants and desires since you're
65:59 gonna specialize in different things but
66:02 can you imagine like we're sitting here
66:05 in the city and we don't like our water
66:08 because our water is heavily polluted
66:09 with chlorine and all kinds of crap that
66:12 makes us have to use CLR to clean off
66:14 our faucets but someone in the desert
66:18 community of maybe maybe the Middle East
66:21 they're tired of desalination plants
66:23 because they cost too much right there's
66:24 too much energy to make clean water but
66:27 they find out a way to steam water out
66:29 of thin air
66:31 by building like little igloo things and
66:34 it just makes do water and it's so so
66:36 amazingly efficient that you know ten of
66:39 these things in any village and
66:40 everyone's got plenty of fresh water
66:42 then that device comes over to Southern
66:46 California and I put a couple pods in
66:47 the backyard Majesty one maybe our
66:49 community decides to chop up some land
66:52 between our houses and we put a little
66:54 community one in there you burn pipes
66:55 everywhere and everyone it's got plenty
66:57 of fresh water that's everybody winning
67:00 at the same exact time but we invent
67:03 something that goes to the desert that
67:05 lets them maybe use cell phones a little
67:06 bit safer
67:07 you know without you know horde
67:09 radiation these are our options and you
67:13 know this isn't a situation where it's
67:16 like well if we ever get to that point
67:18 we'll do it no no it's it's right now
67:21 it's right now that we need to do it
67:23 it's right now that we need to cop this
67:25 attitude that we're all gonna win
67:27 together as opposed to beating each
67:30 other up for no reason so I hope you dig
67:33 that this is something I see all the
67:37 time and frankly I don't know about you
67:41 but I'm pretty sick and tired of it you
67:43 know I have yet to sit down with someone
67:46 who takes a complete opposite view of
67:48 what I take and then I asked them a few
67:51 foundational questions about how the
67:53 world works and they've got answers that
67:55 are correct some of it's just you're
67:58 either right or you're wrong you either
67:59 understand how money's valued in this
68:01 world do you don't you either understand
68:03 how to start a business or you don't you
68:06 either know the history of our
68:08 politicians who are totally corrupt or
68:10 you don't and it's so so screwed up was
68:15 that cognitive dissonance is so heavy in
68:19 America right now that you have you know
68:22 was it Joe Biden child touch or Joe
68:26 Biden sits on video with the Council on
68:32 Foreign Relations and brags about a quid
68:34 pro quo situation where he held back a
68:35 billion dollars of American taxpayer
68:37 dollars dollars from Ukraine unless they
68:40 fire a prosecutor who's investigating
68:41 who his son
68:43 right but he'll campaign and stomp and
68:46 say that there's no crimes against this
68:48 kid and it's like okay well then why did
68:49 you have a problem with someone
68:50 investigating your kid if your kid's
68:51 gonna be exonerated in the first place
68:54 but they'll go over to the guy that did
68:57 do that the president states and press
69:00 these non-existent crime charges on
69:03 there's nothing in the articles of
69:05 impeachment this is the world were in
69:07 they just want their team to win for the
69:10 sake of winning and not for any level of
69:12 justice in the world and again as I said
69:16 in my Trump impeachment episode which is
69:19 only on YouTube and other video formats
69:23 you wouldn't want to be in that court if
69:25 your life depended on especially because
69:28 they just make up [ __ ] there's no
69:30 justice there's no lawyers to represent
69:32 your side the press isn't allowed to
69:34 record how absurd your kangaroo court
69:37 session went the other party that you
69:41 might belong to politically is not
69:43 allowed in the room to to even know
69:45 what's said about you but you end up
69:48 behind bars really so you get the world
69:55 you deserve for us really what it what
69:58 it it boils down to and I don't know
70:03 about you but I'm I'm on this airline
70:07 I'm 30,000 feet with all these people
70:10 and I don't want the plane to go into
70:12 the ground this is simply because some
70:14 guy in the background is experiencing
70:17 this you know intellectual hatred for
70:20 being perhaps incorrect you know
70:24 research nothing no everything right
70:28 anyway if you have a deep thoughts
70:31 radio.com
70:32 please go it's got everything you need
70:34 it's got two video which is YouTube and
70:36 [ __ ] shoot please go up to bid shoot
70:38 make an account it's more important that
70:40 you make an account a [ __ ] shoot than
70:42 it is for you to subscribe to this
70:43 channel on [ __ ] shoot because they need
70:45 as many followers as they can as they
70:47 can have because at some point they're
70:49 gonna have to raise money to get to the
70:50 next level and their subscription rates
70:53 going to be the deciding factor for the
70:55 investor
70:56 the rate of growth is going to be a huge
70:59 deciding factor so help them with that
71:00 rate of growth bright Cheon is coming on
71:03 board but again they've got this you
71:06 know sensor by design mechanism where
71:08 you have to have so many views before
71:10 your videos get hosted it's really sad I
71:13 think they mean well but it's a bad
71:15 design why they can't copy bid shoot I
71:17 have no idea we get podcast links up
71:20 there we've got social media social
71:22 media is a locked Facebook group a
71:24 Twitter account and mine's calm mine's
71:27 calm M IND s calm is a competitor to
71:30 Facebook it's prettier than Facebook you
71:33 have to have a count to go inside just
71:34 like Facebook but your freedom of speech
71:37 is a hundred percent protected so you
71:40 want to post some pretty crazy crap
71:42 get over to mine's compost it no will
71:45 ever delete it I mean your initial
71:48 article outside of minds that com might
71:50 get deleted but not minds com doing
71:52 anything to your feet it's very cool
71:55 there's a couple ways to donate to the
71:57 page there's the one-stop shop PayPal
72:00 donation and then there is the monthly
72:03 subscription which is patreon and for
72:05 those of you who subscribed thank you so
72:07 much it makes a huge difference
72:08 again the goal with raising money is to
72:11 do this full-time but we would have to
72:13 have easily a thousand times more people
72:18 subscribing and contributing to make
72:20 that happen at this stage I think the
72:22 average income from this show is about
72:26 70 to 80 bucks a month
72:28 between YouTube and patreon combined
72:32 some of you have reported in that you
72:35 have switched to the brave browser the
72:36 brave web browser and you did realize
72:39 something and I never really stress
72:41 which is it is a much faster browser and
72:43 the main reason it's really fast is they
72:45 cut off all the add trackers all the ads
72:47 being displayed on your page autoplay
72:50 videos it's all cut off so it's on your
72:53 phone it's on your computer you get it
72:55 it's free when you get it change the
72:57 search engine from Google to DuckDuckGo
72:59 and you'll finally start seeing the
73:01 internet the way it used to exist before
73:03 2003 when Google turned on their ads and
73:06 started pushing all the best results
73:09 unless they paid for the service and
73:13 just to give you an analogy here let's
73:16 say that your neighbor was a plumber and
73:17 you got plumbing issues so you search
73:21 online to find the closest cheapest best
73:23 plumber out there it's really your
73:26 neighbor but because they have to buy
73:28 ads now to get featured anywhere it's
73:32 giving you all the big giant carriers
73:33 who could give a crap whether or not
73:35 they actually do a good job or not and
73:36 they have the highest prices in town
73:38 because they bought the privilege to
73:41 interrupt your neighbors pricing and so
73:44 you get screwed so DuckDuckGo will find
73:46 the one next to you that's the beautiful
73:49 thing plus they don't track anything
73:50 that you do so the browser doesn't track
73:52 what you do and the search engine
73:54 doesn't track what you do plus they
73:55 poked out the eye of everyone trying to
73:57 track who the hell you are and where you
73:58 are if you want to run VPN stuff
74:01 underneath that's that's up to you
74:02 it will definitely cut off the
74:05 corporation's from knowing who you are
74:06 the other one is if you have a backup
74:09 need on your computer there's a
74:11 cloud-based service that is phenomenal
74:12 called Backblaze $7 $7.99 I think gives
74:16 you while gives you infinite storage per
74:19 computer so if you have two computers
74:21 they'd run you about 15 bucks but man is
74:24 it worth it save my bacon I've got 16
74:26 terabytes in the cloud just to give you
74:28 an analogy or give you an example how
74:31 that works you won't find any season 1
74:34 videos on this particular channel so
74:36 you're gonna have to go up to the
74:37 website and click that the website also
74:39 has a search engine website has category
74:42 lists I did update by the way the
74:44 demonetized list apparently there is of
74:47 season 2 through 5 there's 75 or no 64
74:51 videos excuse me a bunch of them are
74:52 actually in season 1 but they were all
74:54 do you monetize now season 1 by the way
74:56 doesn't have any ads at all because it
74:58 hasn't qualified for AD running at all
75:00 so you can see all of season 1 without
75:02 any ads and of course if you come in
75:04 through podcasts it's just straight-up
75:05 mp3 but those of you asking me why the
75:08 season 1 doesn't come up on your podcast
75:10 it's because your podcast software it
75:12 limits you do I think about 300 350
75:15 episodes of anything that you subscribed
75:18 to so because we're way over that number
75:20 the whole season 1 is buried
75:23 but what you can do is go up to the
75:25 website on your phone
75:26 find the episode you dig click download
75:29 and it downloads the mp3 to your phone
75:31 you just play it through your normal mp3
75:33 player on your telephone or whatever
75:35 podcast device you like so with all that
75:39 said take care of yourself at someone
75:42 else I'll see you in the next deep
75:44 thoughts over now
