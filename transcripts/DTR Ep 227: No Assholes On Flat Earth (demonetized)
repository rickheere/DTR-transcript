00:00 [Music]
00:31 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
00:36 maybe I'll just make it the salutation
00:39 that whatever time of day I'm greeting
00:42 you verbally is the time I made the
00:44 episode so this episode is going to be
00:47 called no [ __ ] on Flat Earth now
00:51 Flat Earth that title is just to play on
00:53 the other theory no forest on Flat Earth
01:00 we don't really give a [ __ ] about Flattr
01:02 from this episode I'm going to propose
01:04 to you that potentially once perspective
01:09 sets in either were all [ __ ] are
01:14 there are no [ __ ] now every single
01:17 person I'd say over 20 you know you know
01:23 an [ __ ] so what the hell am I talking
01:26 about when I took acting school way back
01:31 in college junior college never got my
01:34 degree took it from a guy named dr. gray
01:37 who was out of he was teaching out of
01:40 DeAnza College in Cupertino
01:42 I actually took acting classes like
01:45 right on the Flint Center stage were
01:48 unbeknownst to me at the time Steve Jobs
01:52 had debuted all the Macintosh computers
01:55 for you know decades and the next
01:58 computer but we did a fellow at one
02:01 point at least segments of a fellow and
02:03 I volunteered to be a fellow and this is
02:06 when I learned about the tale of Iago he
02:09 sorted the villain of all villains
02:12 either Shakespeare or Francis Bacon
02:15 created the most amazing villain and
02:20 then when I started studying
02:21 screenwriting about 20 years later I
02:25 even 25 years later we studied villains
02:28 and villains were very interesting in
02:30 that several actors have been
02:33 interviewed over the years who have been
02:35 traditionally villains and every show
02:38 that they're in and they say you know
02:39 what does it like to play a villain and
02:41 this is when they say I don't play a
02:46 villain I play the character I am hired
02:49 to play what the hell does that mean
02:52 well from the perspective of a villain
02:55 from the perspective of an [ __ ]
02:57 as we might classify them they're not
03:02 [ __ ] and they're not villains for
03:05 whatever reason whatever they are doing
03:06 is coming for a perspective that they
03:08 particularly understand it makes sense
03:11 for them so in their mind they're doing
03:14 what is right for them some villains
03:18 know that they are doing something that
03:20 is probably morally repugnant to society
03:23 goes against the grain goes against the
03:25 norms we know plenty of them right
03:29 they'll jump Podesta's run around
03:31 touching kids torturing them in showers
03:35 doesn't mean we have to accept them just
03:37 because I'm going to propose the from
03:40 their perspective it makes sense to them
03:43 but today we're going to talk about the
03:47 growth that maybe we can achieve by
03:50 dealing with folks before they cross any
03:52 line that can't be uncrossed John
03:57 Podesta is most likely crossed the line
03:59 they can't be uncrossed but maybe not
04:03 you deal with [ __ ] all the time
04:05 right at least you think you do George
04:10 Carlin had a wonderful line in one of
04:12 his stand-up bits where he said anyone
04:14 that's driving in front of you to slow's
04:16 an [ __ ] but anyone who drives faster
04:19 than you will they're a maniac right I
04:23 thought that was great
04:26 it's sort of a general relativity of the
04:31 [ __ ] order we put in you know in the
04:36 ground we put a stake for our particular
04:38 area of the world what we're willing to
04:41 put up with and then you go to a
04:44 different part of the world and they put
04:45 up with it and so you sitting there
04:49 thinking which one of us is right
04:52 technically speaking and what's even a
04:57 bigger mindfuck is that people from that
04:59 other part of the world worshipped God
05:00 every single day maybe even five times a
05:03 day but they've got a law that or maybe
05:07 a lack of a law that allows something to
05:09 occur that in your world is grounds for
05:13 execution how does that work is that our
05:19 job to change everyone to our standards
05:21 to change to their standards do we have
05:23 a big giant war and shake it all out see
05:26 who wins and then you can have your rule
05:28 set when it's all over
05:30 so let's say this me debating with any
05:34 of you about some of the you know
05:37 broad-stroke things where Sharia law
05:39 allows you to kill your wife and rape a
05:41 little girl and color your wife that's
05:46 not something that's going to have much
05:48 value any of you because I think most of
05:51 the world agrees on where that little
05:54 pendulum of justice justice ends up
05:57 right what's valuable to all of us is to
06:02 try and crawl in the mind of sort of the
06:04 minor infractions of what we might call
06:07 an [ __ ] right obviously we have a
06:12 different B word for the women I think
06:15 we can stick with the a word and get the
06:20 same job done and you can just apply it
06:22 to whatever gender you like at a minimum
06:28 there's the difference the Delta right
06:31 as George Carlin said
06:35 you made a great point just simply
06:37 saying look whatever relative speed
06:38 you're going if someone's going slower
06:40 than you they're an [ __ ] they're
06:42 going faster than you than these then
06:43 there are maniac all based on your
06:46 relative speed that's really the kernel
06:49 of all judgment when it comes to whether
06:52 or not someone is acting appropriately
06:54 or not right I know it's something you
06:57 might be thinking you're thinking hey
06:58 just drive the [ __ ] speed limit no
07:00 one has to go faster no one has to go
07:02 slower just be with them you know five
07:04 miles an hour of whatever posted speed
07:06 limits out there especially if you're in
07:07 pole position and there are no obstacles
07:09 in front of you just keep going don't
07:11 freak out over the bumps and Hills in
07:14 the turns slowing down the rest of
07:16 traffic perhaps right traffic is an
07:20 interesting one because we never really
07:22 meet anyone in traffic right they're
07:24 just trying to go to work - or trying to
07:26 go home or trying to go to school or
07:28 whatever I really doubt that in the days
07:33 that that I personally have to drive on
07:35 the 405 here in Los Angeles that there
07:40 are you know that many people on the
07:42 highway just driving because it's fun I
07:45 really doubt that I'm willing to bet
07:47 that everyone's got a destination and
07:50 it's merely their age their visual
07:54 acuity their hand-eye coordination the
07:57 training on the car the performance of
07:59 the car their body size compared to the
08:03 internals of the car and other cars all
08:05 those factors times 10 more is the
08:09 reason why someone appears to either be
08:11 in your way or flying by you okay but
08:18 now does that extend back to normal
08:21 reality a relationship that you're in a
08:25 friendship that you're in you know a
08:28 business that you might be in I'm going
08:31 to say that at a minimum let's just say
08:34 there's two of you and you think that
08:37 you have met a jerk for whatever reason
08:40 it's become difficult to communicate
08:42 with someone
08:43 thus do any type of business with that
08:46 person being a family with that person
08:48 be related to them there's three factors
08:53 that have to be considered at all times
08:56 to pass judgment on the situation you
09:01 know to digress for one second you know
09:05 there's a lot of people that lose their
09:07 [ __ ] when they get called a name and
09:10 it's usually because they lack any
09:12 ability to think linearly over time
09:16 meaning when they play chess they only
09:20 think about the pieces on the board they
09:22 can't see turns ahead time is not linear
09:27 time is now and time is now forever and
09:30 so people they cut get called a name
09:32 regardless of their behavior right
09:35 sometimes can just lose it like sticks
09:38 and stones were never taught to them
09:39 when they were little they've always had
09:41 a life that was wonderful and so you
09:44 know they never had a bump and so when
09:47 they hit a bump or you call out a bump
09:52 they just they don't see it properly
09:55 they don't understand that you're
09:57 itemizing a moment in time during this
10:00 moment according to these three factors
10:03 we're going to talk about you may think
10:06 someone acted like an [ __ ] now they
10:09 could say they're sorry and things could
10:11 be unbelievably wonderful two seconds
10:14 later and you're having sex or you
10:17 haven't makeup sex with them it's best
10:19 sex in the world sometimes right that's
10:22 because you've you've telling the other
10:24 person and it doesn't have to be sex
10:27 obviously it could just be you you got
10:29 past the problem but you you enjoy that
10:31 moment beyond the problem because now
10:33 you are saying that we can make it
10:36 through tough times which is valuable if
10:39 there's three factors at a minimum
10:41 there's really damn near infinite
10:43 factors but we're going to put them in
10:44 three buckets the first one is who are
10:48 you who are you at the moment that
10:50 you're being frustrated by a situation
10:54 secondly who are they what's frustrating
10:57 them from their perspective and who are
11:00 they
11:02 and then the third thing is the debate
11:06 that's going on between the two of you
11:09 what sort of bubble of communication
11:12 some tasks something that's hovering
11:15 between the two of you you both are
11:17 seeing it from your general relativity
11:19 from your perspective you see na they
11:24 see a B you see an Apple they see an
11:27 orange they are trying to convince you
11:30 to see the orange you're trying to
11:32 convince them to see the Apple or you're
11:33 like hey I see an apple I wish I saw the
11:36 orange that you're talking about here
11:38 now some of you might say well you know
11:41 it's a lot more simple than that
11:42 sometimes people just want to be
11:44 [ __ ] and let's break that down
11:48 someone wanting to be a jerk
11:50 typically stems from them being hurt by
11:55 you they feel like they've been hurt by
11:58 you now we're going to do a lot of
12:00 extensions off this a lot of different
12:02 things right so they want to return the
12:06 favor they want to hurt you back maybe
12:11 it's a simple thing that you used a big
12:13 word that they didn't understand and
12:14 they felt like you were trying to in
12:16 directively passively aggressively
12:18 belittle their intelligence and so
12:21 they're there to get back at you like a
12:23 child sometimes it is a child and then
12:26 it becomes extremely easy to understand
12:28 they're a child then you write them a
12:32 blank check and you try to help them get
12:34 educated and you give them hugs and and
12:36 you you know you demonstrate to them
12:39 that regardless of how they behave
12:41 you're still there with them you got a
12:43 discipline you got to educate and then
12:46 sometimes you'll see childish behavior
12:47 out of an adult and it's very confusing
12:51 when I was a kid in grade school you
12:54 know there were the kids that cried all
12:56 the time and the kids that never cried I
12:58 never cried my dad you know sort of
13:04 shook that out me out of me as a young
13:06 kid and you get hurt bawling like a baby
13:10 doesn't do much it's better to kind of
13:12 walk it off and wince
13:15 because you can get somewhere it's
13:17 almost like you grow when you don't cry
13:19 due to pain like that now you know I can
13:22 have situations that make me cry but
13:24 it's usually a beautiful situation or
13:26 you know some emotional you know pain or
13:30 gap that I held in or something like
13:33 that right I've had moments of my life
13:34 where I've cried my ass off and I was a
13:39 twenty year cry it was something that
13:41 happened 20 years ago romantic situation
13:43 finally bumped into the person after 20
13:46 years she's married I'm hooked up on my
13:47 end but we never got to say goodbye
13:49 properly and so we had our little
13:51 moments where she did it then I did it
13:54 and man we felt amazing it was awesome
13:56 it was all reset it's cool thank you
13:59 Skype we kept both partners on both
14:01 sides fully informed now a lot of you
14:04 have gone on quote-unquote adventures
14:08 with other people it could be that when
14:10 you were young you know you had more
14:13 time because you're not taking care of
14:14 all the bills and just hanging out in
14:17 the summertime you know for days and
14:19 weeks and months after month and you you
14:22 know you do your fireworks you set
14:25 something on fire and ice' was ass on
14:27 fire you blow your hand up a little bit
14:28 you break a break an arm you sneak you
14:32 steal you do all these weird things that
14:34 kind of is the the very sort of apex of
14:37 behavior in many different genres and at
14:39 the end of doing that for five or six
14:41 years as a kid and you start going into
14:44 your teenage years you look at your
14:46 buddies and you're like I know what that
14:49 cat's made out of you know when he broke
14:52 his arm god it was horrible and he
14:54 didn't cry cry just a little bit he
14:57 sucked it out we got in the hospital and
14:59 you didn't complain he healed up right
15:02 or hey we're trying to walk across this
15:06 irrigation pipe that stretched across
15:09 the Mississippi River and he was
15:15 fearless or he was scared got fear of
15:18 heights we figured that out about it all
15:20 right
15:21 sometimes we have the privilege of
15:23 building people are building our life
15:25 out of people that we've always been
15:26 with which is why
15:29 I I really have always noticed and you
15:33 know indeed at times moving to a
15:36 particular area and then you meet the
15:38 guy or the girl who is doing really good
15:40 in a local business whether it be they
15:43 work for someone else I work for
15:44 themselves but it's all built out of a
15:46 network of people that they grew up with
15:48 right so they were able to just
15:51 continually invite their friends to
15:53 businesses and what-have-you it's a
15:54 great thing but it's because they know
15:58 everyone all right definitely takes you
16:02 down a couple notches and the old
16:03 difficulty rating of life I'll tell you
16:05 that much but what happens when you meet
16:08 someone new and it's imperative that you
16:10 work together when you're trying to
16:12 figure this thing out the overall goal
16:16 is more important than any relationship
16:18 you're going to have of this individual
16:21 but you're finding that there's some
16:24 sort of philosophical difference between
16:26 how you form thoughts and what the
16:29 priority is it could be that the
16:31 individual is damaged goods they've got
16:33 a lot of issues going on on their end of
16:35 which you are unaware of right when you
16:39 sit in traffic in Los Angeles and you
16:41 think and you watch people drive slow or
16:46 drive fast it's a melting pot of all
16:49 melting pots Los Angeles let me tell you
16:51 we have every single race on earth every
16:54 gender every size and shape everything
16:57 and so if you see some people you know
17:01 you might just see the back of their car
17:03 it's a very interesting experience I
17:05 will obsess on traffic just a little bit
17:07 because I think it's a beautiful
17:08 cross-section of society at any one
17:11 point in time you can learn a lot from
17:12 it right but at first you see the back
17:15 of a car you have no idea maybe they're
17:17 going super slow and what's weird is
17:18 they'll be going slow in the slow lane
17:20 what they're supposed to be doing and
17:21 you can still be upset because you're
17:22 trying to get to your exit but you pull
17:25 around them and you look down inside the
17:26 car and you see a migrant may be just
17:30 south of the border for us some Mexican
17:32 migrant and you know they're hanging
17:36 onto the steering wheel for dear life
17:37 and you can see that their eyes are huge
17:39 and they're terrified they're doing
17:42 their very
17:42 to exist and it all comes off your
17:48 judgment kind of melts away you're like
17:50 oh my gosh this person is just trying to
17:53 operate a vehicle in one of the most
17:55 tenacious vicious traffic locations on
18:01 planet Earth now I've seen Eurasian
18:05 traffic and trust me I understand you
18:07 know they don't have any traffic lights
18:09 they drive the wrong way down the
18:10 highway and there's no law against it
18:12 you know they don't look both ways
18:13 before they walk out in front of traffic
18:15 and get hit by cars it's quite
18:17 unbelievable but us understanding each
18:20 other becomes increasingly difficult the
18:24 more that we get into higher populated
18:26 areas because the very chaos that
18:31 inspires us to be one way or the other
18:33 is so random and so chaotic that it's
18:36 very problematic to try and get on the
18:38 same wavelength
18:39 right when you go up in a small town
18:41 there's all kinds of sort of morals and
18:45 so the mores that standards of living
18:49 that we all just sort of kind of agree
18:52 on whether or not we come to the
18:54 agreeance on how to behave through some
18:55 religious paradigm or just pure logic
18:58 common law what have you we get there a
19:01 lot easier but then again there's very
19:04 few players and a 10,000 population
19:07 Township Los Angeles you know it's a big
19:11 town let me tell you Los Angeles has you
19:15 know a transient you know sub subterfuge
19:20 right a bunch of folks come here very
19:23 quickly take what they can and go home
19:27 sometimes Los Angeles takes more but
19:32 here's the thing why do this episode
19:33 right I mean I just beating around the
19:35 bush of what we all know probably a
19:39 little bit but here's the thing
19:41 it's important to be reminded of some of
19:44 this basic stuff sometimes because we
19:46 get all caught up and we get surprised
19:47 and who the hell wants to be surprised
19:49 right like I said about the in the
19:51 episode does God get angry the answer is
19:54 unequivocally no because God is on Nick
19:56 knows all if God exists is infinite
19:59 there's no chance in hell that you're
20:01 going to be surprised or lack the
20:05 knowledge to negotiate and be happy with
20:07 another human being or a sorry being
20:10 right so what do we do we're not
20:14 infinite we're not omnipotent we don't
20:16 know every single thing that's out there
20:19 well let me give you some feedback and
20:24 some of you have had this sort of
20:25 lifestyle some of you grew up and you
20:27 went to three schools grade school
20:31 middle school in high school before you
20:33 went off to college if you did some of
20:36 you were moved around for whatever
20:37 reason and you went to several schools I
20:42 went to four additional school so I went
20:45 to seven schools before I graduated high
20:47 school and as much as that sounds sort
20:51 of nuts in the end we probably wouldn't
20:55 be talking today if I didn't have that
20:57 experience because it really hardened me
20:59 up and educated me on how the world
21:03 works in terms of sort of its base
21:05 mechanics when you're the new kid you
21:09 have a routine that starts to occur now
21:12 when you move around as a young kid the
21:14 young kids just accept you right away
21:15 it's like oh we got a new kid at school
21:17 no big deal when you get older you start
21:20 dealing with sort of the mutts of the
21:22 world the Nerds you know the folks that
21:25 can't find any friends they gravitate to
21:27 you and you have to decide whether or
21:30 not they're good folks or not and in my
21:32 case I was extremely fortunate the kids
21:35 had walked up to me most the time who
21:38 were also just starting out in the
21:40 school they had just moved there we had
21:43 great times it was more of the native
21:45 kids that were the [ __ ] at the time
21:47 right and some of you have had life's
21:50 way more intense than me so this is not
21:52 a pissing contest trust me but you
21:55 really really start to understand at
21:59 least the effect of these causes of
22:03 people who get who become angry with
22:06 life
22:08 and thus overtly become sort of a
22:12 pain-in-the-ass tea society some folks
22:15 find a ways to stay inside their homes
22:18 and be sort of Hermits and be kind of
22:20 angry old men and some folks really want
22:24 to get out there and mix it up
22:26 some folks are hybrids they really want
22:29 to be happy they really want to be
22:31 accepted by society but for whatever
22:33 reason they're unable and incompatible
22:36 with human communication methods and
22:39 they go out there and they they become
22:42 obnoxious all right my smoke lounge has
22:46 recently had a redo because one of the
22:50 business owners downstairs who does the
22:52 hookah bar decided he needed to move on
22:55 with life which is fine wish him well
22:57 one of his customers would come in and
23:01 he really started coming in towards the
23:03 last probably month of this individuals
23:06 management of the downstairs area which
23:08 is not a smoke lounge and you could tell
23:13 he had very little if any social skills
23:17 with society where ever he existed was
23:23 probably in a room with a computer and
23:25 several subscriptions to video games
23:28 online fairly obese and he would come in
23:34 and he was african-american and we had
23:36 two other african-american guys that
23:38 would come in that were just as cool as
23:40 anybody right relaxed just just
23:43 ubiquitous ly like everyone else but
23:47 this third guy would come in and he was
23:51 really big into using the n-word like a
23:57 lot he would you need to be the center
24:01 of attention at all times I mean to the
24:02 point that he would stand up and grab
24:04 his gigantic stomach which was pretty
24:07 massive and shake it and be really loud
24:09 and just really I kid you not the last
24:14 time I saw him he was sitting in a sofa
24:17 grabbing his gut with probably another
24:21 no no seven people in the room and he
24:24 was just chirping some weird nonsensical
24:26 [ __ ] really bizarre and I went
24:29 upstairs and within a few minutes he's
24:31 talking about sexual acts of which I'm
24:34 sure he has never experienced in his
24:36 life that were the most explicit
24:39 descriptions you could possum engine
24:41 with at least one woman downstairs
24:42 listening if not - he was a socially
24:47 awkward very incompatible with society
24:50 guy for whatever reason didn't get out
24:54 enough right it wasn't an attractive guy
24:57 if he lost his weight he'd be just like
25:00 any of us right nothing weird but he was
25:04 going to the sukkah place most likely
25:07 because his circle of friends are very
25:08 small and he was enjoying the communion
25:13 with other human beings like most of us
25:15 do but his in his excitement the things
25:19 that he does at home and the things that
25:21 he views in the words that he uses
25:24 perhaps he must have been listening to a
25:27 tremendous amount of gangster rap or
25:29 something he was not formidable in the
25:30 slightest but he would get everyone else
25:34 wild up he would get the other two
25:37 african-american gentlemen to start
25:39 using inward as well not quite as
25:41 horribly as his first guy did but I
25:45 would hear this and I would see this and
25:46 we try to go upstairs and watch
25:47 television and smoke cigars it's older
25:49 guys couldn't hear the television right
25:51 in front of our face turned up to 95
25:53 right because this guy was so obnoxious
25:55 downstairs and trying to be the center
25:59 of attention
26:01 now obviously right at the very
26:03 beginning it's pretty easy to say my god
26:05 you know we got to get this guy
26:06 uninvited he falls right into a category
26:10 of description that I don't think any of
26:12 us want to be in right but I have you
26:20 know been friends I was always friends
26:21 with all the different groups in school
26:23 the jocks the Nerds and the outcasts
26:25 right I programmed right
26:30 but I didn't look the part but I got the
26:34 highest scores in the school for such a
26:35 thing it really threw people off a lot
26:40 you know and so when I started getting
26:44 into the professional industry of you
26:46 know making video games and coding
26:47 things you know my clan was you know
26:51 geeky guys to play Dungeons & Dragons
26:53 and you know video games we'd sit at EA
26:57 and play you know command & Conquer for
26:59 12 to 14 hours straight no joke man and
27:02 this is my clan this is the people I
27:04 felt comfortable with but I could also
27:05 go to a night club with a bunch of jocks
27:07 and pretty people and whatever and you
27:12 know not quite as intense intellectually
27:14 but I have my own fun that realm too so
27:16 I've always been sort of there and then
27:18 the muddy kids you know you're because
27:19 it today are probably emo and off I know
27:22 what they're like as well and what's
27:25 interesting is the more socially awkward
27:27 folks that if you just dig into them for
27:29 a few minutes and really start to share
27:31 you know commonalities and because you
27:34 know I've dabbled in all those things
27:35 you know I've role played for years when
27:37 I was younger they don't expect you to
27:40 have any compatibility with them and so
27:44 when they find out that you do have
27:45 compatibility and they'll usually kind
27:47 of sniff you out they kind of go well
27:48 did this guy just play Dungeons &
27:51 Dragons once but does he know what the
27:53 [ __ ] soccer ball what other game
27:54 system every player will you plays
27:56 chatter oh no that's cool
27:57 well you play champions oh that's cool
27:59 some of you're like what are you talking
28:01 about and some of you guys are like yeah
28:04 but this guy was a geek geek too the
28:10 [ __ ] 11 bigger 11th degree man but he
28:14 was also trying to sort of probably
28:16 dispel his geek outer coating by trying
28:23 to be gangster and again the two things
28:28 this guy is most likely never been
28:30 involved in as a fistfight and a sexual
28:33 act with a woman and so what he was
28:36 trying to do is integrate those claims
28:39 into everything that he was saying
28:40 because it was sort of covering a base
28:43 you know
28:44 I know I don't I don't I look like I
28:45 don't get any women but I do and
28:47 whatever no one in the room needed him
28:52 to be anything other than what he was
28:54 that's it if he had known that he was
28:57 fully accepted by everyone in the room I
28:58 would wonder how he might change his
29:01 behavior you know as much as there's
29:03 plenty of geeks that would show up
29:04 downstairs and still do if a guy has a
29:08 girl I'm sure he feels a little well I
29:11 can't say I'm sure but I think that he
29:13 probably felt intimidated that someone
29:16 has a girlfriend and they're coming to
29:18 the hookah lounge to smoke hookah he
29:21 wants a girlfriend too and the more the
29:24 people look at him and smile he becomes
29:26 sort of the center of attention named
29:27 the class clown right but I you know it
29:31 was interesting because it was the
29:33 probably one of the most recent moments
29:34 when I intimately was annoyed by an
29:37 individual on a pretty much by daily
29:39 basis you know but at the same time I
29:44 had enough intelligence to look at him
29:46 and say well I think I understand who
29:48 this kid is on one level and we've all
29:53 been stupid at times we've all been
29:55 goofy at times and we're just working
29:58 through a process and you know now we're
30:03 at sort of the halfway point I want to
30:04 remind you that most of you have had the
30:06 patience of another human being to be
30:09 unacceptable you're acting unacceptable
30:13 you're being a jerk you're being
30:15 obnoxious whatever it might be and
30:18 people around you
30:19 if you're lucky at times have completely
30:23 tolerated it smiled given you a second
30:27 chance
30:27 perhaps consulted with you to see if
30:29 you're okay perhaps just were a better
30:33 example of a human being in front of you
30:35 hoping that you'll sort of gravitate
30:38 towards them and realize that less is
30:42 more all right for this kid that was
30:45 coming into the hookah place less was
30:47 more you know it's like Mitch Hedberg
30:50 said to the turkey just be yourself man
30:54 you do not have to emulate the other
30:57 meats
30:58 that's a joke about the fact he walked
31:00 into a grocery store and there's turkey
31:02 pastrami turkey ham turkey everything
31:04 else and he says just be yourself man
31:07 god bless Mitch Minh but now let's let's
31:12 just keep splitting the hair a little
31:13 bit here we know individuals who are
31:16 sweethearts that have bad moments in
31:21 life and you know they may have created
31:22 a big scene at some point but overall
31:24 they're 99.9 percent a great person you
31:27 look forward to their counsel on their
31:29 company but they've had bad moments and
31:32 sometimes you understand the bad moment
31:34 and other times you do not understand
31:36 the bad moment right one of my best
31:39 friends in the world is running a
31:42 restaurant it's an amazing place and
31:45 he's just he is the most stand-up guy
31:48 you could possibly ever meet in your
31:50 life meaning for those of you don't
31:52 understand the Italian mob terms that
31:55 means honest reliable loyal capable and
32:02 he was such a good guy that people would
32:06 at times take advantage of his goodness
32:10 he's a big Roman warrior you wouldn't
32:15 mess with this dude
32:17 unless your life depended on it right
32:20 but I met him then we realized that we
32:23 were both exactly the same way in terms
32:25 of integrity and I met him and I shared
32:31 my capabilities with him because I said
32:33 let me help you out here man he had a
32:35 catering side project at most restaurant
32:37 owners do and I said you know let me
32:39 redo you know your website for this
32:42 thing because I know I'm making video
32:44 games on the sign here and I got some
32:45 free bandwidth and I can help you out he
32:49 accepted within a few days I had the
32:53 site done actually I had to side down
32:55 before I even asked him permission so
32:57 within about 24 hours I had the site
32:59 swapped out and it's really pretty and
33:01 someone had done sort of this diamond
33:03 plate black and blood red site for him
33:06 it was like cool when you know
33:10 thing was sort of mid 2000 early 2000s
33:14 but you know I softened everything up
33:15 and made it good for a bride and he got
33:19 more catering jobs in that first month
33:22 and he had ever had in his career and he
33:25 loved it before Google [ __ ] up the
33:27 search algorithm so we continued and we
33:30 started focusing our efforts on the
33:32 restaurant itself I drove around you
33:36 know I mean this is what I love about my
33:38 life is that I can you know be working
33:41 in some really intense industry like
33:43 making video games and it's just prior
33:45 to me starting my own company but I
33:48 could work on video games you know for
33:50 eight hours a day and then help this guy
33:51 three hours a day driving around pizzas
33:54 delivering them to corporate
33:55 headquarters to make sure they were
33:57 aware that his restaurant existed in a
33:59 full Italian restaurant but we were just
34:01 using little pizzas as an example to get
34:02 people to know that he was there which
34:04 worked great but there was a point where
34:07 we needed to create a coupon sheet that
34:10 stuck on top of the box that someone
34:12 could keep and give him the pizza for
34:14 free and it sort of just was a lost
34:16 leader that was kind of a marketing
34:18 situation and he and I really jive I
34:21 mean to this day we drive we can just
34:23 get each other but brothers you know and
34:28 one of his employees who was the most
34:31 senior most well paid employee who was
34:34 starting to kind of fade out of the
34:35 circulation of the restaurant wasn't
34:38 showing up very often wanted to be in
34:40 charge but didn't want to put in a full
34:42 day's work came in and noticed we had
34:45 made a coupon for something that was
34:46 actually already included with an entree
34:49 and so this person just wanted to kind
34:52 of do a Monday morning quarterbacking
34:54 came in grabbed the coupon pushing in
34:57 his face and said you know what you're
34:59 so stupid this comes with the meal this
35:02 is your restaurant how did you not know
35:03 that and he lost it for about five
35:09 minutes because in his eyes he shouldn't
35:13 have had to have stopped his day to make
35:14 this coupon that person he was shoving
35:16 it in his face trying to be right should
35:19 have been the one to lead me
35:20 artistically to create the coupon based
35:23 on what
35:24 feedback is right because he's busting
35:25 his ass every single morning shopping
35:27 for all the gradients prepping the
35:29 kitchen doing most the cooking you know
35:31 and I saw my buddy you know get more
35:39 angry than any human being I've ever
35:40 seen in my life
35:41 probably because he is extremely
35:43 formidable when he's angry which is what
35:46 I like about him actually it was freaky
35:50 now night and I have the military father
35:52 who was when I was younger he was very
35:56 good at tuning me out
35:58 if you deserved it right and so I'm
36:01 looking at my buddy and I'm thinking
36:03 about my dad at the same time thinking
36:04 oh yeah I remember this energy and you
36:06 know there's something there's something
36:08 really kind of cool about it that people
36:10 willing to stand up for justice because
36:11 everything my buddy was yelling about
36:14 was legit and he's sort of yelling right
36:18 at me and he's fight braiding his
36:20 [ __ ] whole body this a guy could pull
36:22 you in half like a [ __ ] telephone
36:23 book and and I'm sitting there
36:27 sympathizing with his anger as much as
36:31 it sort of freaked me out because it's
36:32 been decades since I've ever seen you
36:34 indeed Lunt
36:34 I wasn't sure was he mad at me or not
36:37 but I started listening to the words and
36:39 stuff and he's really sort of in the
36:42 middle of yelling and screaming at me
36:44 not at me but just towards me in a
36:48 backhanded way he's sort of thanking me
36:50 at the same time to say look we busted
36:52 our ask to get this thing done we
36:53 printed all these receipts errors are
36:55 these coupons so we were committed to
36:57 this special there's just one little
37:01 stupid on and the rest of coupon was
37:03 perfectly fine so we were 90 percent
37:04 valuable in this coupon rate but someone
37:07 could have walked in the room and if you
37:10 had heard him yelling without the
37:13 context of the situation I don't know
37:17 what they would have thought a maniac is
37:19 loose in his own restaurant right but he
37:23 was fully justified I never saw him do
37:25 that ever again ever ever ever not even
37:28 close he needed to kind of exude that
37:30 out of a system and
37:33 interesting is over the next several
37:35 months several years he came back to me
37:39 and I've mentioned him once before he
37:42 came back to me a couple years later and
37:43 he said you know what when when you came
37:46 in and first met me he goes I was really
37:49 unhappy dude because I was fighting all
37:51 of these employees one of his employees
37:53 who was long gone by the time I got
37:54 there embezzled $40,000 out of the cash
37:57 register which eventually was the reason
37:59 why his doors were closed by the the tax
38:03 people the sales tax folks right State
38:07 Board of Equalization and we had paid
38:11 them down to $11,000 in one year we were
38:15 well on our way to getting that paid off
38:18 within just a couple months but they
38:20 took that opportunity to jump in and
38:21 chained the doors he came to me after
38:25 all that was over and he said you know
38:26 it he says every time I got really angry
38:30 you got really calm and it just infected
38:35 me and because I no longer get that
38:37 angry anymore it's because the you and I
38:40 being being buddies and the example I
38:42 gave several episodes back was there was
38:45 a point where I lost my [ __ ] because a
38:46 guy [ __ ] me and you know I wanted to
38:51 legally just drag this guy through the
38:53 mud and he said to me you don't want
38:57 that because you'll become the monster
38:59 that I used to be and trust me you don't
39:01 want to be that person this is evil
39:03 begets evil darkness begins darkness
39:05 just move on that's exactly what I did
39:08 but it took my buddy who I had seen you
39:12 know go to hell and back to know that he
39:16 was the authority on this situation you
39:20 someone I needed to respect and I did
39:22 and I was the better for it and I went
39:25 off and created a fairly successful you
39:27 know video game company so I'm calling
39:30 this episode no [ __ ] on Flat Earth
39:32 right we know there's [ __ ] but
39:37 what's really strange is the story of a
39:39 Yago and and I'm willing to bet you
39:41 could get online and read quite a bit
39:43 about this whole phenomenon that people
39:46 who are evil believe they are
39:47 doing from their perspective what must
39:50 be done
39:51 some people never grow up growing up is
39:55 only something you do if you have to do
39:57 it right some people fight growing up
40:01 and it's infuriating when you do there
40:06 are tons of politicians that need to
40:07 grow up right there's tons of very
40:10 wealthy people in the world to
40:11 participate in crafting this planet and
40:14 it's policies that need to grow up it
40:16 would seem but the thing is is let's
40:19 let's pick out two dudes Henry Kissinger
40:22 and George Soros I hate to politicize
40:25 this episode but these are two
40:27 individuals who have been at the
40:29 absolute epicenter of some of the worst
40:33 moments in human history and unlike some
40:37 people who are villainized in history
40:39 these guys are still alive and we can
40:41 still look at what's going on in history
40:44 isn't being written in a revised way you
40:46 know like they make all these movies
40:48 about people like Steve Jobs to make
40:50 sure that they try to they try to pour
40:52 in cement that he was an [ __ ] because
40:55 they can't have any heroes in the world
40:57 right Kissinger was you know sort of the
41:00 architect of of planet Earth for the
41:03 world elite for decades and decades and
41:05 decades at one point we thought you know
41:09 Zig new Brzezinski who just recently
41:10 passed was one of these guys and he was
41:12 his sleeper back books that are out of
41:15 print sell from you know one thousand to
41:17 five thousand dollars now because they
41:20 have one they have to be priced out of
41:22 reach but two they have sort of the
41:24 blueprints of how the world works today
41:28 someone has to think about it someone's
41:30 got to write something down for these
41:32 folks to have a plan every once in a
41:35 while like a zig knew you write the
41:38 books before they get the job and so
41:40 these books are published as a PhD
41:42 thesis or what have you and then we get
41:44 to see it then they go inside and they
41:46 get covered up and they no longer exist
41:49 you know they exist but we don't get to
41:51 know what they're talking about until
41:52 they go to give a speech in front of we
41:55 are change
41:55 George Soros there's a man that is
41:59 betting that the entire world economy is
42:00 going to cry
42:01 by the end of the year his public net
42:04 wealth is 10 billion dollars but we know
42:06 he has 46 billion in liquid assets right
42:11 I just talked to a buddy who knows this
42:13 for a fact he's in that world from our
42:19 perspective these gentlemen have
42:22 essentially played Stratego with real
42:25 human lives from some perspective like
42:29 Iago and a fellow that it needed to be
42:33 done that's what they believe let's say
42:37 you wanted to change George Soros his
42:39 mind I know we can get a hold of this
42:43 guy but let's say you wanted to change
42:46 his mind
42:46 you would have to first figure out why
42:50 he's thinking the way he's thinking and
42:53 there is probably some sentence he can
42:57 say to you that would make you
42:59 completely understand why he does what
43:01 he does and you would be probably I'm
43:06 just going to assume here you would be
43:09 in a dilemma for at least a split second
43:12 if not several minutes or days where you
43:13 might say oh my gosh the way he said
43:15 that it made complete sense to me should
43:19 I join him or should I fight him for
43:22 those of us who believe in false Flags
43:24 which are commonly you know massacres or
43:28 big events like 9/11 where people do get
43:31 hurt people do die trust me but there
43:34 are people that are orchestrating this
43:35 behind the scenes and for some reason
43:38 they have either blinders on they're
43:40 compartmentalized but at some point
43:42 someone knows everything that's going on
43:44 and they're willing to go along with it
43:46 someone asked me the other day why why
43:49 would NASA faked the you know missions
43:51 to the moon and well the most
43:54 fundamental reason it was technically
43:56 impossible but the more imperative that
43:59 kept the hoax going was to essentially
44:01 make sure the communism didn't take over
44:03 the world by the democratically elected
44:08 government failing right it was an
44:12 assumption
44:13 wasn't a fact that if we didn't go to
44:15 the moon that somehow America would
44:17 crumble under the Kremlin's pressure
44:18 right that means hi we're developing
44:21 ICBMs which attorney the Tomahawks which
44:24 turned into every bit of missile
44:26 technology that we have Star Wars etc
44:28 I'll develop by NASA using the moon as
44:32 sort of a cover story right but the
44:37 false flags have to be fueled by someone
44:39 creating a perspective for people that
44:42 they can actually agree to it those of
44:45 you are UFO buffs alien ET buffs and you
44:50 think that the government has actually
44:52 captured ships and captured living
44:53 surviving members from these ships
44:56 perhaps they are still alive to this day
44:58 even though they might have been
44:59 captured 1947 you wonder how is it that
45:04 if you intimately believe this is true
45:07 that everyone who's ever touched this
45:10 stuff barely ever says a word besides
45:12 Bob Lazar Bob Lazar who says that well
45:17 personally bob has never said he ever
45:19 met an alien John Lear says that Bob
45:23 told him that he saw something through a
45:25 security glass window inside of a door
45:28 that looked like a grey alien but he
45:30 said it didn't move and there was a
45:32 government official on the lab code
45:33 standing next to it and he said you know
45:35 it looked like a toy the son was trying
45:37 to convince me was a living being you
45:40 know I see these videos online with
45:41 people who are crumbling under the
45:44 pressure of society at this very moment
45:46 right homelessness is at least getting a
45:50 significant spike in America right now
45:52 because of the way the Obama
45:53 administration left this country all
45:56 right remember when that guy got into
45:57 office in 2009 you know the report came
46:02 out that said that a year later a year
46:07 later that the people on welfare was
46:09 going to spike 50% or no 40% of the
46:13 country was going to be on some sort of
46:14 welfare program and they mean they mean
46:17 food stamps they mean Medicare they mean
46:19 people who simply can't pay the bill and
46:20 have to use a government program to get
46:22 the bill paid and they were right
46:26 but you see these videos online of
46:27 people going nuts and I have to give it
46:31 to these individuals and it's not as
46:34 common as I would hope it to be but you
46:38 know people get attacked by homeless
46:40 people what-have-you and some of them
46:42 cowered down because they have no
46:43 experience defending themselves but
46:46 there are people that are plenty capable
46:48 of subduing the person coming at them
46:52 and they are the bigger man or the
46:55 bigger woman usually it's a dude and
46:57 they give the person room you know I
47:03 can't remember if I mentioned this but
47:05 there's the Filipino police station
47:07 where a guy came in fairly scrawny he
47:10 had a big kitchen knife in his hand and
47:12 he is you know waving it at the police
47:15 officer it was a big dude and the police
47:20 officer could have easily probably
47:23 legally pulled the gun and shot the guy
47:26 injured him or killed him could have
47:29 written his report submitted the
47:30 security footage and said look he had a
47:32 knife at me man but he was a bigger man
47:35 and he wasn't that old either the guy
47:39 who was so mature
47:40 but he took inventory of the fact that
47:44 he was big enough to probably survive
47:48 some attempt but you know nicer very
47:51 dangerous man they don't have any
47:52 ammunition and a [ __ ] can can operate
47:54 him right so therefore the most deadly
47:56 weapon in the world and he just talked
47:58 the guy down and the guy dropped the
48:00 knife and he gave him a big gigantic hug
48:02 and I posted this on the Facebook group
48:06 the lochs Facebook group I found it
48:09 extremely touching that we haven't lost
48:12 our humanity that someone had the
48:17 patience to let a guy be an [ __ ] for
48:20 a second for whatever reason and instead
48:23 of getting going into a reactionary mode
48:25 when his life is being threatened kind
48:28 of technically right he decided to side
48:31 with humanity and he changed this guy's
48:33 life they took him out to dinner they
48:36 didn't charge him with anything
48:37 someone had stole the guy's guitar
48:40 he was I guess a member of a band that's
48:43 how he made his money and so he was
48:45 basically dining out he had no met no
48:47 means of making money because someone
48:48 stole his guitar and I believe the back
48:50 story was that the cop gave him his
48:52 guitar so he could get back on his feet
48:55 you know everyone does everything from
48:58 their perspective not a news flash but
49:01 it's something that I think even I
49:02 forget often when I judge others without
49:09 even saying a word I judged them in my
49:11 mind you drive an LA traffic believe me
49:15 here you're talking every once in a
49:17 while in Huntington Beach here in
49:19 Southern California especially the whole
49:21 Orange County area we have a lot of hot
49:22 rods you'll hear and go by all the time
49:24 in the recording we have dudes who are
49:27 stunt motorcycle writers you know Harley
49:31 writers big old loud pipes squawking
49:35 racing pipes gigantic I mean the most
49:38 amazing cars you pick a car you pick a
49:40 year or someone around here in a 30-mile
49:42 radius owns that car and it's cherry
49:45 some of these old guys that put in you
49:47 know 250 to 300 thousand dollars into a
49:49 57 Chevy but every once in a while the
49:52 kid of the grandchild or the son or even
49:56 the daughter sometimes getting these
49:58 vehicles a lot of times are just really
50:00 their hot rods you know they're there
50:02 excuse me they're like exotic cars too
50:04 but they'll race through residential
50:09 streets driving like a maniac and of
50:15 course we we don't like to see that
50:18 because they're risking everyone's life
50:20 so we'd have some horrific accidents
50:21 every once in a while but those kids
50:24 sometimes have no home training they get
50:29 in these vehicles they love these
50:30 vehicles they love the moment they're
50:32 living in this euphoric complete
50:34 adrenaline dump dopamine dump of
50:36 euphoria and the faster they go them you
50:40 know there's something about moving
50:42 quickly that stimulates the body it
50:44 could be just the concussion of g-force
50:46 makes the dopamine drop into the system
50:49 makes the adrenaline drop in the system
50:51 then we consciously are aware of the
50:52 fact that we
50:53 might die we get adrenaline to deal with
50:57 that and so I feed every once in a while
51:01 it doesn't happen that often but I look
51:03 at and I go oh my god it's like a young
51:05 person having a moment that maybe they
51:08 only have it a couple times in their
51:10 whole lifetime you know in the Midwest
51:12 my friends and my cousins we get in cars
51:15 and go you know stop a accelerator and
51:20 see how fast we could go you know I've
51:24 you know been in a Corvette in 1986
51:28 going about 135 miles an hour down a
51:30 down a highway that is not flat and I
51:35 lived to tell the tale
51:37 but another high school classmate of
51:41 mine did the same thing in an older car
51:43 some old Camaro I think it was and the
51:48 suspension wasn't as tight as a 86
51:50 Corvette it was brand new and he hit the
51:53 same bumps that we hit and he flipped
51:55 the car front you know the front Ford
51:59 and landed on the top and killed himself
52:02 same addiction same situation same lack
52:06 of judgment but his car wasn't as new as
52:09 the car that I was in so he's dead and
52:10 I'm alive both of us we weren't angry
52:16 but I'm sure from the perspective of
52:18 those watching us dry pop past them at
52:21 you know incredible speeds we were
52:23 definitely [ __ ] but inside the car
52:26 we're having this euphoric moment of you
52:30 know probably having I don't know if
52:34 I've ever traveled faster than that in
52:36 my entire lifetime besides being in
52:37 planes and jets right so I'm celebrating
52:40 this story years later let's just say I
52:43 don't but whatever and someone else
52:45 might be telling the story at the exact
52:47 same time about the [ __ ] that drove
52:49 by about 135 miles an hour
52:52 people swerving out of the way could end
52:55 up killing themselves driving into a
52:56 ditch you know but from my perspective
52:59 it was okay I mean I wasn't actually
53:00 driving at the time I was trying to get
53:02 the guy to slow down but
53:03 you know in the end when you survive you
53:06 don't remember panicking right now am I
53:10 suggesting that everyone that we
53:11 perceive as [ __ ] should be understood
53:15 no there are folks that are mislead and
53:20 there's very little that we can do about
53:23 them being misled I mean we can try
53:27 hopefully the human algorithm of passing
53:31 information without discussing it which
53:33 is something that they proved in
53:35 laboratories if I'm in the room with you
53:37 whatever I know goes into you whatever
53:39 you know goes into me not specific but
53:41 more an obtuse sort of frequency like my
53:45 buddy who owned the restaurant coming to
53:47 me years later and saying you know you
53:49 calm me down because every time I was
53:51 with you and [ __ ] wasn't going your way
53:53 either you were at least calm about
53:56 telling me about it and I looked at my
53:58 own problems and I thought jeez I'm I'm
54:01 I'm doing much better than this guy and
54:03 I'm pissin and moanin I'm really talking
54:06 about the people that are most like you
54:12 perhaps the indigenous population of
54:14 wherever you're from right shouldn't be
54:17 a big difference between you guys but
54:21 let me introduce one other factor before
54:23 we close out the show which would be the
54:27 art of empathy sometimes people have
54:31 have had their life go very very you
54:33 know successfully for time for decades
54:36 and decades perhaps the majority of
54:37 their life and perhaps during their 50s
54:39 or older but something's going on behind
54:42 the scenes in their own personal life
54:44 that you are unaware of and they don't
54:47 want to tell you about it because that's
54:49 a flaw perhaps you're in a business
54:51 relationship where they need to be the
54:52 leader and it's not something that
54:54 you're supposed to share the leader is
54:56 never to be perceived as weak and the
54:59 more that they become overwhelmed by the
55:02 situation that they're in
55:03 and the more it taxes them and takes
55:06 away their process to to engage the
55:08 basic business that you have with them
55:09 which has no problems they're short they
55:13 blow a fuse and it's sort of
55:16 this situation were they really need to
55:20 just talk to somebody but they don't
55:21 have anyone because they won't allow
55:22 that in because they're so driven they
55:26 don't develop any friendships that
55:28 aren't business friendships and so
55:30 they're just absolutely locked into a
55:32 cage they don't drink and so they can't
55:35 go anywhere to just talk to someone at a
55:37 bar I'm not saying you should start
55:39 drinking but you know I'm talking about
55:41 no social interaction with folks that
55:44 are strangers and the thing is is if you
55:47 experience the wrath of them which you
55:50 might believe is pointed at you and you
55:54 don't take a second to try and crawl
55:56 into their mind and and postulate what
56:00 they could be dealing with you might
56:02 take it all personal when at no point is
56:05 there a single molecule of their
56:06 behavior towards you that is actually
56:08 meant for you and so you keep coming
56:11 back to the table and you sort of act
56:15 like it didn't happen for as long as you
56:17 possibly can of course until either it
56:22 breaks and they get relief on their end
56:27 or it breaks to the point they're
56:29 willing to communicate with you about it
56:31 right
56:33 unfortunately the latter formula doesn't
56:36 happen as often as it should right
56:37 there's the old - go back to the traffic
56:40 analogy there's the old situation that
56:42 used to be a big deal you know in sort
56:46 of kind of mid-century America 1950s it
56:49 became romanticized and a few cartoons
56:51 and television shows but it was all
56:53 about the fact that it when when the
56:56 wife was pregnant in the ninth month
56:58 before we had all these you know
57:00 chemicals that created you know preemie
57:04 situations the wife would have her water
57:08 break and it's time to roll it's time to
57:10 go to the hospital she is going to have
57:12 this child in the next hour or two if
57:15 you're lucky and the husband's gotta you
57:19 know get the bag get the stuff get the
57:20 woman in the car she can't walk very
57:22 easily cuz she's has broken her water
57:24 and she's trying to keep the baby inside
57:26 until she gets to the hospital and you
57:29 know it's your first baby
57:30 so you don't have any experience in this
57:32 thing but you get the wife in the car
57:34 and at that point there was this old
57:37 scene it happens every day but the
57:39 husband doesn't care if he gets a ticket
57:41 getting his wife and his unborn child
57:44 their unborn her child safely delivered
57:48 at the hospital so they're running stop
57:50 signs are running red lights I mean they
57:52 might pause and look around to make sure
57:53 not going to kill anybody or themselves
57:55 but after that boy it's there's just
57:57 nothing that's going to stop him I'm not
57:59 waiting for a green light one of my boss
58:02 is by the way just this little anecdote
58:04 off to the side he had four children his
58:07 wife is pregnant with the fifth she
58:10 breaks her water they jump inside his
58:14 stealthiness Dodge Stealth he's driving
58:17 her to the hospital very quickly and she
58:19 delivers the child in the passenger seat
58:21 of the car [ __ ] sweats on so she just
58:23 kind of pulled her sweats down and the
58:25 baby came out and it's perfectly fine
58:27 they just cut the umbilical cord in the
58:29 car and got her you know all taken care
58:31 of and stuff so the baby was fine it's
58:34 just funny but if you're witnessing this
58:38 car coming down the street running red
58:40 lights running stop signs maybe it
58:42 nearly hits you maybe it does scrape
58:43 your car whatever if you don't know
58:45 what's going on in that car this person
58:47 is for all intents and purposes a bank
58:49 robber you know me you have no idea I
58:52 had a kid the other day I'm trying to
58:54 drive to my smoke lounge and know the
58:56 day and this kid comes in this beautiful
58:59 new Audi all blacked out except the
59:01 windshield and he pulls up in the
59:04 traffic we're all in the left three
59:06 lanes the the center lane I'm in is
59:08 going to turn laughs aliens are going to
59:10 go straight and I got two more lanes
59:11 coming the other way he comes up in the
59:13 opposite direction sitting at the red
59:16 light waiting for the red light to go
59:20 green so he can push across traffic but
59:22 he's in the wrong direction of anyone
59:24 came around the corner slammed straight
59:25 into him if the other light went green
59:27 because we have one CH of delayed lights
59:29 here that you know rotate how the left
59:30 turn works he would have been sitting in
59:33 the wrong traffic and part of me thought
59:37 he might have be stealing the car I have
59:39 no idea what was going on with this guy
59:40 so light turns green he tries to push in
59:44 dangerous but strange never seen
59:46 anything like that in my life you know
59:48 car had no license plate by the way
59:50 brand-new Audi the Saudi must have been
59:53 a 60 60 $70,000 car this show has done
59:59 one thing successfully at least in the
60:02 feedback that I have received from folks
60:04 personally either be it my friends here
60:07 who watch the show or mainly folks
60:09 online and it's this philosophy of
60:11 whether or not we can rebuild society
60:12 from the bottom up and I have friends
60:17 that that you know are very very high
60:19 places in the world in financial
60:22 situations and you know where they
60:25 manage a lot of money or they just know
60:27 all of the elite sort of controllers of
60:30 Los Angeles and they will take the
60:34 message in and have these really
60:36 interesting conversations and a friend
60:38 of mine recently bumped into a gentleman
60:41 out of smoke lounge to be honest and it
60:44 was up in Los Angeles and this guy was
60:47 he's talking to was a big talent scout
60:50 for all things in in Los Angeles from
60:55 musicians to actors to all kinds of
60:57 stuff and he was getting a very
61:00 interesting sort of you know sort of the
61:04 MKULTRA [ __ ] that goes on at that level
61:06 for real and my buddy he was talking to
61:12 him said you know I got a friend of mine
61:14 who's doing the show and his philosophy
61:16 is to try to rebuild the world from the
61:18 bottom up by kind of reviewing the
61:20 minutiae which is the kind of
61:22 underlining physics of humanity it's
61:25 what we're trying to do here hopefully
61:26 and he said what do you think do you
61:28 think that's possible
61:29 and this guy was because he's so deep in
61:35 the horrible nature of how Hollywood and
61:39 the music industry works he says from my
61:42 perspective I am surrounded by evil 24/7
61:46 he goes I'm not sure that you could ever
61:48 get society to wake up and care about
61:51 stuff right there's a very interesting
61:54 feedback
61:55 from a person who is obviously knee-deep
61:59 in some pretty dark stuff right God
62:02 isn't like his job but he likes his
62:03 paychecks is not sure what to do
62:05 I did meet this individual myself but
62:09 he's sort of you know said I'm gonna
62:11 join him I've been been in their camp
62:13 forever anyway I like my big house on
62:16 the hill they were meeting at a fairly
62:19 wealthy location to begin with so in
62:22 this episode my my homework for you guys
62:26 let's just put that with the thought
62:28 process I want you to chew up and think
62:30 about maybe even before replying but if
62:33 you have something that's jumping out of
62:35 you put it in the comments for sure
62:36 because we want to track that moment
62:39 being an [ __ ] is perhaps simply being
62:44 informed about something that no one
62:46 else is informed about being misinformed
62:48 about something that everyone else is
62:51 informed about for those of us who don't
62:54 live in some dark ancestral loop of
62:57 Hollywood or whatever we need to count
63:02 our blessings to thank our lucky stars
63:05 as all the cliches go and try to extend
63:10 like the Filipino cop some understanding
63:14 and again I'm not trying to say that
63:17 that's easy or that's even a common
63:20 circumstance I don't think it is when
63:24 things happen unexpectedly it's very
63:27 hard to reach into the faculties of your
63:29 entire history of quote-unquote
63:31 understanding and be the bigger man
63:33 right meaning mankind and this is
63:37 probably just like part one on this
63:39 whole concept as the yago was in the
63:43 fellow he thought he was doing what was
63:45 right for him every villain is doing
63:49 what they think is right from their
63:51 perspective it just are you know your
63:55 humble narrator would love to report to
63:57 you that I have been the the
63:59 understanding person for the majority of
64:01 my life but I can unequivocally tell you
64:03 I have not been that person
64:06 for you know at least half of my life
64:09 I've been if not more I've been very
64:12 reactionary towards these moments but as
64:15 I cross into my 40s and start to kind of
64:18 take inventory and you know as a result
64:20 of really discussing things and creating
64:22 better sort of scientific methods for
64:25 analyzing subjects throughout the show
64:28 you know slowing down time and talking
64:31 about an hour talking for an hour or
64:32 more about particular subject
64:35 I've grown I will most likely be doing
64:41 the homework I just gave you guys for
64:43 the rest of my life even if I had to be
64:44 120 there'll be no point where I
64:48 probably go oh I figured it out I'm
64:50 totally cool because every situation is
64:52 unique in my particular experience it is
64:57 when someone behaves in a way that is
64:59 sort of inconceivable based on my own
65:02 standards that I have a really hard time
65:07 having the patience and trying to work
65:10 it out but what's interesting is is once
65:13 it's a degree away from me where perhaps
65:15 you're telling me about one of your
65:17 friends one of your relatives and you're
65:18 like oh my god I was here in this room
65:20 in the kitchen and then this whole thing
65:21 happened and the spilt milk blew up into
65:23 an atomic bomb and we no longer talked
65:26 to each other right it becomes almost
65:29 infinitely easy to talk about it and see
65:32 it from different perspectives and be
65:34 empathetic towards everyone in the room
65:36 but when I am that person in the room in
65:38 the event it's tough when that perhaps
65:43 is the truth for all of us right so
65:44 again what is enlightenment seeing more
65:47 having a different perspective on things
65:49 having a method to engineer a different
65:51 perspective so maybe through some
65:55 bizarre you know reflection session
65:58 between me to you and then you to me we
66:02 can all grow and get past perhaps the
66:05 shortcoming that is anger it is reaction
66:14 the one thing I'm getting a lot better
66:16 at in my older age is feeling that I'm
66:19 angry or yeah really just angry probably
66:23 and not reacting and doing anything
66:27 while I'm in that bubble of anger
66:28 because there's all these you know
66:30 sayings about you know don't don't do
66:33 anything in the middle of a fit of anger
66:34 because it's almost purely concentrated
66:37 regret and yours truly has definitely
66:41 created small smidgen of that stuff I
66:44 wouldn't wish it on anyone to be honest
66:47 you know I'm trying to figure out life's
66:50 like you guys you know I'm trying to
66:52 figure out how this thing works you know
66:54 it's it's one of these things of what
66:56 can you do right now with what you have
66:57 and when you have more you can do
67:01 different things and so a lot of these
67:04 intellectual more cerebral episodes are
67:06 sort of one of these things where it's
67:08 it's it's not easy okay but
67:12 comparatively speaking it is sort of
67:14 low-hanging fruit as compared to some of
67:16 the more advanced challenges that we
67:17 have in life right this is one that's
67:20 easier said than done but one that will
67:24 enrich our lives considerably we're at a
67:28 point now in history where we have this
67:31 sort of you know fake news makes a lot
67:34 of the a lot of the problems in America
67:38 look a lot bigger than they are they
67:39 make a very teeny tiny group of people
67:42 that are upset look really huge because
67:44 they get a lot of press Europe is
67:46 dealing with its own thing I'm not sure
67:49 how to remotely address that but I'm
67:54 really talking about the interpersonal
67:56 things that happen to you in your in
67:59 your personal life more than the the
68:02 global problems of the universe right if
68:05 life is a frequency which I think we all
68:07 agree is the more happy that each region
68:11 of the world can become through
68:12 understanding its indigenous brothers
68:15 and sisters those regions of the world
68:17 will become happy
68:19 hopefully not docile right hopefully you
68:22 still stand up for your rights your
68:24 inalienable rights that you're given
68:26 because you're alive
68:27 you know and just in closing I'll say
68:29 this this world will never become a
68:32 utopia through legislation right it's
68:37 never going to just say hey you can't
68:40 have any guns in the world and boom
68:42 everyone's going to get along right you
68:45 have to believe this version of history
68:47 otherwise you go to jail that's never
68:51 going to work
68:51 that's never going to fix the world that
68:54 is a band-aid usually for a lie that's a
68:58 band-aid to give other people control
69:00 over you the only way that I think any
69:03 society has probably ever reached any
69:05 euphoric utopia which I'm not convinced
69:08 I've ever read any history that is like
69:10 that it you know there's some moments in
69:13 Egypt's history would shame maybe maybe
69:15 I got there maybe little places like
69:18 Easter Island got there who knows we
69:20 don't know but it was through
69:22 intellectual unification that we got
69:25 there if we ever got there but I
69:27 guarantee you it's going to be the way
69:28 we get there if we ever do maybe because
69:31 there are so many variables within a
69:34 human life that it's a certainty that it
69:37 will never get there or if it gets there
69:39 it only gets there first split second
69:41 and then it moves back into the chaos of
69:43 disagreement I think it is safe to say
69:46 that the underlining fabric of us
69:49 getting on the same page as they say is
69:51 reading the page and since the page
69:55 represents information that needs to go
69:58 into our brain and be understood by
70:00 every region of the world the Internet
70:03 by which you are accessing me right now
70:05 is the tool to do it but if we don't put
70:08 the programs into the to the news
70:11 network of the Internet then we'll never
70:14 have the opportunity to see if this
70:17 thing can work no one had the internet
70:20 back in the day at best they had a small
70:23 group of our small plot of land that
70:26 they were able to use to get to the same
70:28 opinion and we know that villages have
70:31 existed where they lived at wonderful
70:33 life I think there's some tribes and you
70:36 know that have been undiscovered in
70:37 South America that seem to be without
70:40 weapons
70:41 without war so a little microcosm we can
70:46 see at work but obviously it becomes
70:48 infinitely or exponentially more
70:49 difficult the more there are different
70:52 cultures and different necessities you
70:54 go listen to my episode on politics I do
70:58 a simulation of a group of people
71:01 finding an island and inhabiting the
71:03 island and then we talked about the
71:05 different needs of the coastal region
71:07 people versus the the people that are
71:09 doing agricultural stuff inside and then
71:12 the leadership that is arbitrarily
71:13 picked to take care of everyone and the
71:15 fact that they get kind of raised up in
71:18 the eyes of the people so anyway hope
71:21 you feel me deep thoughts radio Calm for
71:24 all the feeds I'm gonna make this bumper
71:26 really short there is video if you are
71:27 audience audio if you're on video just
71:30 go to Depot's radio comm all the feeds
71:33 are up there that's all I'm going to say
71:34 today so if you're having a great day
71:37 hope you have little more patience after
71:39 listening to this at least for a little
71:40 while perhaps come back to it if it
71:42 touched you and get a little bit more
71:44 but please understand you're as much of
71:47 an educator of me as I perhaps I am a
71:49 view of anyone moment this is a mutual
71:51 thing take care of yourself and someone
71:54 else and I will talk to you in the next
71:57 deep thoughts over now
