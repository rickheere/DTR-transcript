00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen on this Monday evening it's
00:37 actually nice and uh well it's not quite
00:40 warm warm but it's it's not cold as you
00:45 can tell we're going to cover a guy
00:49 named Stanley Alan Myers or better known
00:53 on the internet as Stan Myers for those
00:55 of you who have studied his inventions
00:59 it's gonna be a controversial topic
01:01 because the they're all over this dude
01:06 because he showed off what he did if
01:10 you're not familiar with this guy Stan
01:13 Myers I believe was a farmer with a
01:15 minor in engineering degree who
01:19 essentially saw I think he believed in
01:23 one of the interviews I saw him he
01:26 believed that the Peak Oil issue was
01:30 real he also just didn't like the fact
01:33 that oil pollutes nature which is good
01:37 we believe that on this show too
01:39 and so he's set out to get hydrogen out
01:44 of water and in a way that he could do
01:48 it at a ratio where the amount of
01:52 hydrogen released from the water when
01:54 combusted and turned back into a fuel
01:57 was more energy in the end than the
02:02 energy he spent to free the hydrogen
02:06 from the water hydrogen air see remember
02:08 water is h2o two parts hydrogen now I
02:14 just looked up as Wikipedia because I
02:17 wanted to know kind of what the official
02:19 story is because if I don't give you the
02:20 official story as written then people
02:27 jump all over the video and say yeah but
02:29 yeah but yeah but okay now I've
02:32 mentioned stamp buyers in several
02:33 different episodes but always as a
02:36 little Alucard thing in relation to
02:38 something else we're talking about
02:40 he has been on my list of episodes to
02:44 cover since season 3 and I just never
02:49 quite felt right for it you know in
02:51 terms of getting it all laid down and
02:53 sort of what are the other controversies
02:54 because telling you what this guy
02:56 accomplished in his lifetime it's not
02:58 gonna fill a whole hour without boring
03:01 you to death with schematics and
03:02 pointing and saying what's going on but
03:05 Stan here's what's interesting you're
03:10 going to have two sides to this coin the
03:13 side that is his videotaped archive of
03:15 everything he's ever done where he
03:19 wanted you to see it you're gonna see
03:22 him have a VW van he took across the
03:24 United States on this engine people
03:26 accused him of hiding normal fuel on
03:29 that vehicle and in gasoline based fuel
03:32 and so he said all right all right
03:35 Touche pain in the butt then he built a
03:38 dune buggy made up pipes and he had the
03:42 engine fully exposed the entire time
03:44 such that any human being a little child
03:47 could survey all of the piping roll bars
03:51 and make sure that there wasn't a fuel
03:53 tube which would have to be very you
03:55 know fairly substantial Ameena fueled
03:56 tubes at least half an inch thick right
03:58 little over a centimeter thick no such
04:02 thing so finally people started
04:04 believing him Stan had a workshop and he
04:09 went through several processes probably
04:12 many of which we haven't seen but he had
04:13 a sort of round water tank sample of his
04:18 technology using two generators that
04:20 used plug energy from the wall that
04:23 proved to him that for every half an pea
04:27 put in he got 650 amps worth of fuel out
04:30 when converted back into a combustible
04:33 nature he took that to the Patent Office
04:37 to prove that it worked
04:40 they didn't believe him because the
04:42 first two laws of thermodynamics refute
04:46 this idea that less energy could produce
04:49 more energy isn't it nice they built it
04:52 into the Patent Office that
04:53 certain things are impossible and
04:55 therefore if it's if it's ever created
04:57 such as the Wright brothers flying was
05:01 impossible until they did it and then
05:04 for I believe it's four years so 1903 to
05:08 1907 they were refused a patent for a
05:11 device that they got in everyday that
05:13 they wanted to and flew up to 50 feet in
05:16 the air by the way so let me also put in
05:22 there that you know I mentioned this as
05:26 well I've had an individual here in
05:30 Southern California who was extremely
05:33 wealthy man he's still alive I I almost
05:35 can't believe it
05:36 but his family is you know sort of deep
05:41 State II he publishes a journal that
05:46 basically exposes them so he's wanted
05:49 done with it he he was sort of a Jesse
05:50 Ventura guy back in the day climbing
05:52 around in jungles in the 60s he's a
05:55 little older than Jesse I think when I
05:58 he took a fancy to me and started
06:02 mentoring me from the conspiracy ID of
06:06 things not from the deep state side of
06:07 things but he revealed much to me and
06:09 you know I mean he reviews the first guy
06:13 to ever mention colloidal silver to me
06:14 and I wouldn't read on a colloidal
06:17 silver and read all the debunking of it
06:20 and came back to him and said well they
06:21 said this is poisonous and he just
06:22 looked at me across the table yeah and
06:25 they're gonna tell you everything is
06:26 good for he's bad for everything bad for
06:28 he's good for you
06:28 and so he was one of the guys that
06:32 assisted my wake up which would have
06:34 been around oh three oh four but one day
06:38 I mentioned this Stan Myers guide to him
06:42 and this guy is very non emotional he's
06:46 a very Donald Trump II like what can I
06:49 do for you you're sucking my air man
06:51 you're taking up my time but he would
06:53 invite me to breakfast and we would eat
06:56 at this fairly well-known place south of
06:59 here he owned the building he owned the
07:01 whole strip of buildings and this place
07:03 is so fancy that just
07:07 being able to pay the rent means you're
07:08 doing really really well and he owned
07:10 the place he drove around I don't know
07:12 if he does it now B drove around on SUV
07:13 with no license plate the cops don't
07:16 pull him over because he is who he is
07:17 they know exactly where he lives
07:19 and from what I understand he's worth
07:22 was worth at least half a billion
07:24 dollars but you wouldn't know it he was
07:27 a guy that never spent any money but he
07:30 told me he goes yeah he goes guys like
07:34 staying happen and he goes they happen
07:38 nearly every year and nearly every year
07:41 they meet with a demise of some sort I
07:45 mean they don't live anymore and because
07:48 anyone who invents something like a
07:50 perpetual motion engine or something
07:53 like you know fracturing combustible
07:55 hydrogen out of tap water without a
07:57 extensive process anybody who does that
07:59 and this has been happening my whole
08:01 life the amount of you know television
08:06 what is it news local news reports on
08:09 farmers to figure this out is at least
08:13 four or five in my life denim that I've
08:15 seen but you have to do one thing to
08:19 build that business you have to borrow
08:20 money like Tesla had to borrow money not
08:24 Nikola Tesla but the Elon Musk
08:27 Tesla's of the world have to borrow
08:28 money to expand their company Steve Jobs
08:30 and Steve Wozniak gotta borrow money for
08:32 fidelity investment to expand their
08:34 company and as soon as you do that you
08:36 lose control so entered in a traditional
08:40 sense most people don't have any income
08:42 to pursue sort of that sort of thing but
08:46 Stan was a farmer and farmers make
08:48 millions of dollars they spend millions
08:50 of dollars but he was able to finance
08:53 his own thing that he did borrow
08:54 twenty-five thousand dollars from some
08:56 folks that they later sued him but for
08:59 his money further money back and I've
09:02 heard this lawsuit discussed almost
09:04 entirely different several times in
09:07 several different places trying to
09:08 debunk him one even had the court case
09:11 files and it doesn't match what's in
09:13 Wikipedia at all Wikipedia's entry on
09:16 him is really small nowadays you used to
09:19 be pretty big
09:20 but there was a lawsuit where they said
09:23 you promised this engine we don't see it
09:26 and the thing you're using we're gonna
09:28 have an electrical engineer look at it
09:30 and validate that at least you got
09:33 something they claimed to have looked at
09:35 it I believe in 1996 and said oh this
09:39 isn't what you said it was it's using
09:41 standard electrolysis and that's not
09:44 what you're saying that you're doing now
09:48 here's the rub to this and here's what's
09:49 interesting right off the bat for your
09:51 Wikipedia / Snopes dismissal of this man
09:55 his schematics were published on the web
10:00 at least by 2010 and several different
10:03 versions there are at least there were I
10:05 haven't pursued this in a while and I
10:08 want to come at this as basic as I
10:09 possibly can because I've seen a lot and
10:12 it was a lot of great information but
10:13 there are little communities out there
10:15 like communities that you know make
10:17 things you know car collectors or
10:19 inventors people who whittle things
10:22 there are groups out there that have
10:25 been following who are all phd-level
10:28 electro engineers electronic engineers
10:31 and they have steady tisca Maddox
10:34 because he off you skated them meaning
10:38 he hid he basically got the invention
10:41 drawn down for you but then he would
10:43 tamper with words and tamper with things
10:45 such that there was a little bit of
10:47 secret sauce that wasn't quite there and
10:50 then I have seen hours and hours of
10:53 videos of people building his fish tank
10:55 version of his invention that he took to
10:58 the Patent Office now when he went to
11:01 the Patent Office they immediately told
11:03 him what you're doing is impossible what
11:05 you say you're going to try and patent
11:07 is impossible and he's like well I
11:09 really started to disappoint you and
11:12 this is back in the day when you could
11:14 smoke inside and so the way the story
11:16 goes is that and this was reported on
11:18 the news in a face-to-face interview
11:20 with him anybody can say what they want
11:22 to the news and they will repeat it but
11:24 if somebody said that about the patent I
11:26 said what I'm about to tell you about
11:27 the Patent Office and that clerk is
11:28 there going that didn't happen
11:30 I've never heard that clerk say this
11:32 didn't happen
11:34 doesn't mean they know about it but he
11:37 shows the Machine off on air on this one
11:40 special that they filmed him in and he
11:45 turned this machine on and it starts
11:47 barfing up hydrogen and the Patent
11:50 Office clerk was intelligent enough to
11:52 run down the hallway because he wasn't
11:54 sure that the burper or you know the way
11:56 that he was containing this hydrogen
11:58 layer was safe and so he runs down the
12:02 hallway telling everyone to put out
12:03 their cigarettes because they could have
12:05 a renegade machine bursting flammable
12:08 hydrogen into the office now that didn't
12:10 happen that wasn't the case he managed
12:12 to completely contain that before he
12:15 brought it down because he's not an
12:16 idiot
12:17 but he was awarded some patents for some
12:21 of the stuff he did now the first mega
12:23 detailed article I ever read read about
12:26 his lawsuit was very simple he hadn't
12:31 cracked it yet and the 1996 date must be
12:36 the amount of time it took to process
12:39 the case at a later time because the
12:41 other suit that I saw was slightly
12:43 earlier than that and essentially the
12:47 investor just goes look I want my money
12:48 back you haven't done it yet and he was
12:50 like yeah this is really hard that's why
12:52 so he had to give his money back give
12:54 their money back I should say but then
12:57 the machine was supposedly taken to the
12:59 Oxford University and this is where you
13:01 get this half amp to 650mm conversion
13:03 confirmed and then you have him creating
13:08 an invention that was utterly brilliant
13:10 to replace a spark plug in a average
13:16 combustion engine in the 90s you've got
13:19 a few things happening you have a little
13:21 spritzer that spritz you know spritzing
13:23 in the gasoline gas and a little cloud
13:26 form you have a valve that's letting a
13:29 little bit of oxygen in to make sure
13:31 that there's oxygen inside the chamber
13:33 above the piston so that it can burn as
13:37 the two ingredients to burn and then you
13:38 get your spark plug and your spark plug
13:41 does the fire boom you push the piston
13:44 down and the gasoline on top of the
13:46 piston
13:47 the piston comes straight up to the top
13:49 it's all synchronized straight the
13:50 explosion happens there's compression
13:52 and it's the perfect amount of
13:53 compression to get the piston to push
13:55 down turns the crank your tires turn and
13:58 you're good that's a very crude version
14:01 of that but that's what happens and so
14:04 what he did and a brilliant move was
14:06 that he made a little steel cylinder
14:11 with his perforation mechanism in it it
14:15 looked like a really thick pin on the
14:18 back of the pin thingy little I mean it
14:20 almost looks like a little piston of its
14:22 own but there's no moving parts on it
14:23 from what I understand but it had the
14:25 fracturing technology in there and then
14:28 just had a tube going out the back to a
14:31 water tank and what's really critical
14:33 about this is it's not some super clean
14:35 water it's tap water obviously you could
14:42 probably put some really hideous water
14:43 in this thing and it would really
14:45 struggle but just normal tap water was
14:48 all that he used and he said you could
14:50 cross the country in three and a half
14:51 gallons of water again there's videos
14:54 out there someone just posted one on our
14:56 locked Facebook group of a car in Europe
14:58 in the 60s that was running out of water
15:00 so this has been done several times
15:03 without gigantic fuel cell technology
15:06 without gas stations that are giving you
15:10 pure hydrogen but before he could get
15:14 this thing to work so actually let me
15:15 finish up so you would unscrew your
15:17 spark plug plug this thing in to screw
15:20 it straight into the same exact rivets
15:22 which are standard sparkplug spacing
15:26 rivets right not rivets but grooves like
15:29 you know threads excuse me rivets Jesus
15:31 what am I making Levi jeans here but
15:35 then you have to time it properly and so
15:39 the thing that he was really really
15:41 working on in the 90s was this well this
15:44 is the 90s I mean you don't have a
15:46 tremendous amount of off-the-shelf
15:48 hardware to do this but he put a he
15:52 designed a card look like a like a sound
15:55 card in a PC and he had a bunch of them
15:58 and it's for every single
16:01 cylinder that's gonna be running in your
16:02 car and there's videos out there that go
16:04 for a horse where you can see him with
16:06 this other dude and they are timing this
16:09 and timing this and timing this and you
16:10 just share this clicking noise and
16:12 that's the fuel injection system being
16:17 timed in a computer circuit and then of
16:20 course you can't afford to have it mess
16:22 up because in your car doesn't run you
16:24 blow up the engine and you're gonna have
16:27 to most likely temper the amount of fuel
16:32 that's created based on how big the
16:35 engine is I mean I've worked on a lot of
16:38 cars in my lifetime you know I can't say
16:40 it I've seen a four cylinder piston
16:41 versus some you know 65 DTO of you know
16:47 eight cylinder four-barrel carburetor
16:51 system I would imagine that the Pistons
16:52 are a slightly different diameter he'll
16:56 I don't know it could be less for the
16:57 eights under LIF I know but he was
17:00 selling this little kit that was a $1500
17:03 retrofit kit to your car and it was a
17:05 lot of money back then but think about
17:07 it you start running on water it's gonna
17:09 end up paying for itself eventually now
17:13 the mystery around his death has been
17:14 told so many different ways that I am
17:17 NOT personally sure what's what's
17:19 correct well Wikipedia just said was
17:21 different than anything I ever heard
17:23 which he was meeting with some foreign
17:24 investor people he was at dinner and he
17:29 starts choking says out loud they
17:33 poisoned me and then he's running
17:35 outside and he falls down on his path
17:37 outside now the coroner supposedly
17:41 according to Wikipedia said he died of a
17:43 aneurysm now I have had numerous people
17:50 in my friends circle have relatives died
17:53 of all kinds of different aneurysms
17:55 aneurysms that they crawl up your calf
17:57 brain aneurysms and the symptoms and the
18:02 conditions and they watched these people
18:04 die live just like staiin Myers died you
18:07 know and I have never heard of anyone
18:10 having a choking
18:14 action to an aneurysm I don't know
18:18 everything about aneurysms maybe there's
18:19 some thing to that but what I have
18:22 always heard is usually some sort of
18:23 headache some sort of exhaustion there's
18:26 a lot of signs that come on even just at
18:28 10 minutes before this kind of thing
18:30 takes you out if you're not dying in
18:32 your sleep but they killed him the way
18:36 that they described it for years was
18:38 that he was drinking cranberry juice
18:40 with his meal and that's where they
18:43 believed that that poison was slipped in
18:46 when he looked away and hey go watch the
18:48 documentary on the ice men who used to
18:51 keep cyanide in a spray bottle and spray
18:55 it on he said I take a guy out to get a
18:56 burger let him know you know you got
18:59 some problems you pissed some people off
19:00 but I'm here to fix the problem let's go
19:02 get a burger yeah yeah yeah as soon as
19:04 the guy looks away pulls the bun up on
19:06 the bun closes it on the burger closes
19:09 it and a guy dies right in front of him
19:10 he used to do that so poisoning someone
19:12 is an ancient ancient art you know that
19:15 for a fact right now since we're gonna
19:18 jump all around and be like I think
19:20 it'll be a little more interesting that
19:22 way Stan left behind obviously his
19:26 designs and from what I understand again
19:29 it's hard to keep track of what is
19:31 actually true and false because certain
19:34 people claim to be really close to the
19:36 family and they write articles the last
19:40 intelligible article I read which had
19:42 some details that I think are not so
19:45 sexy as to make them up you know what
19:49 you never know I'm attempting to bring
19:52 you the most accurate aggregate of all
19:56 of his stories so that you may jump in
19:59 and do some research on this and we're
20:01 gonna get to the videos I was mentioning
20:02 in just a second but it was said that
20:06 his brother picked up all of his
20:07 research and moved to Canada and tried
20:10 to continue it now I don't know what
20:13 happened to that it did look like maybe
20:17 two years ago Toyota had published a
20:20 design of a brand-new engine that when I
20:22 read the specs of this engine it's not
20:24 in any of the cars it's still very very
20:26 secret
20:29 but it read just like Stan Meyers engine
20:33 there was a rumor that the brother did
20:35 sell it to a big buyer and the buyer
20:38 remained anonymous but one of the
20:42 stipulations was not to not to shelf it
20:45 like so many great technologies that the
20:47 oil industry destroys now Stan was on TV
20:52 just before his death and a beautiful
20:55 piece you can find it online I'll try to
20:57 put some in the descriptions below but
21:01 they said on air that he was offered 1.1
21:04 billion dollars for his technology now I
21:09 think Stan Myers was a profit oriented
21:13 man and definitely wanted to make money
21:15 off of his gig but I think he also may
21:17 have just feared if I sell this they're
21:19 gonna sit on it and it's never gonna see
21:21 the light of day okay why would someone
21:25 with 1.1 billion dollars offer that
21:30 money to a man who is according to the
21:32 1996 lawsuit on Wikipedia is blowing
21:35 smoke every up everyone's holes let me
21:39 tell you a little thing about business
21:42 probably the best way to tell this story
21:45 but it applies especially to super
21:48 technical companies that I have tried to
21:50 start several times but when you have a
21:54 film you're trying to sell and you need
21:57 someone to invest in your film to get it
22:00 made scripts great it's all good
22:03 what the studio's do or I should say
22:06 really the investors are gonna pump the
22:08 film up and get it made let's say it's a
22:11 Stanley Kubrick someone who can
22:13 definitely direct the film but he's
22:15 gonna need 150 million dollars and you
22:17 know that money doesn't just fall out of
22:19 the sky no matter who you are but what
22:22 vest errs will do is they will say look
22:24 I'll give you the back end money but I
22:25 won't give you the front end money and
22:27 what that means is it doesn't mean back
22:30 in profits it means I want someone else
22:33 to do the due diligence because I don't
22:34 want to waste my time researching
22:36 something that could be bunk if your
22:39 scripts horrible
22:40 I want someone else to figure that out
22:41 I'm not going
22:41 spending money with that but if you can
22:44 raise the first 20 million dollars for
22:45 your script I'll give you the other
22:47 hundred but I want to see the you know
22:49 the due diligence out of the people that
22:51 gave you the 20 why do they think this
22:53 is good no one on earth would offer
22:57 anyone any money of any substantial
23:00 amount let alone 1.1 billion in the late
23:03 90s
23:04 I mean seriously think about that unless
23:07 they had figured out that this thing was
23:09 real according to my contact of which I
23:13 haven't seen for 15 years down south
23:15 from where I am this happens all the
23:19 time
23:20 there is a machine there are methods
23:24 multiple methods that one can build to
23:28 create this effect with tap water and
23:31 with other things I'm not sure what the
23:32 other things are but he lamented that
23:34 that was the case that there are other
23:36 things the oil industry is completely
23:38 aware of these inventions and because
23:41 the value of most currency in the world
23:44 is based on the constant demand of
23:47 gasoline and oil they don't want
23:50 anything to mess with the value of that
23:53 now some of you might look at that and
23:55 you know you shrug and you go well of
23:57 course they want to stay rich and they
24:00 want to stay in control and obviously
24:01 that's a beautiful by-product for them
24:03 of that horrible little scheme but you
24:09 and I spend money and there is a layer
24:12 of well if this dude were to destroy the
24:17 value of oil a barrel of oil because no
24:19 one needs it anymore and stay Myers had
24:22 dealt with lubricating an engine as well
24:24 he did a speech on that all the stuffs
24:27 online there may just be people that buy
24:30 into protecting this infrastructure of
24:33 the petrol dollar which is petrol euro
24:36 petrol everything right simply because
24:38 it would cause a world collapse if this
24:41 solution were to come out too quickly no
24:44 one's going to be able to sell ample
24:46 water I mean we drink more water out of
24:50 water bottles than Stan Meyers would
24:52 require you to put in your gas tank
24:54 on any one particular day now with the
24:57 hybrid electric imagine that waters
24:59 recharging your electric I mean that's
25:01 cool but this gentleman I met with
25:05 several times told me look these people
25:07 get killed that's basically what he told
25:09 me they have accidents now he didn't
25:11 claim I just want to be clear that he
25:13 ever participated in that sort of thing
25:15 personally I don't maybe he did maybe
25:17 didn't but I think it's way out of his
25:19 hands he was an investment guy it
25:23 happens way before that way before gets
25:26 to them they don't necessarily have to
25:27 do it I used to have a thought that you
25:30 know potentially there's rewards for
25:32 taking care of that as an investment
25:34 community but think about it killing
25:36 someone isn't some basic thing it
25:38 creates it creates trails it creates
25:41 liability and it breaks the law and
25:43 yadda yadda yadda so the first I think
25:47 as the seventeen to do would call it a
25:50 proof that this was real is is someone
25:54 offered in 1.1 billion dollars
25:56 televised on national television okay
26:00 that for me is pretty legit the second
26:03 thing that makes it legit is that his
26:05 first machine I never built it
26:08 personally but I have seen people build
26:10 it from scratch in these videos even
26:13 what it is is it's essentially here's
26:16 house technique has been explained okay
26:19 hydrogen has the particular frequency
26:21 it's in the four thousands and you I
26:26 think and you zap it with that receptor
26:30 with that frequency and you can extract
26:33 and free the hydrogen of the water but
26:35 there's a trick to it you have to
26:37 prepare the I mean this is as I
26:39 understand you have to prepare the water
26:41 molecule to be in a vulnerable state
26:43 such that when you do perforate it when
26:46 you zap it with a a little bit of
26:49 electricity that it does free itself
26:51 that it's actually going to dislodge
26:53 itself and so what he did was he created
26:58 two pipes that are cuts like a pipe
27:04 organ pipe you know at an angle but
27:06 there's one inside
27:07 slightly smaller in diameter and one the
27:09 outside and I you know as far as
27:11 thickness on these pipes you know they
27:13 were like a couple of millimeters I
27:16 think as long as the electricity travels
27:19 between these two pipes because that's
27:21 what he did he had one frequency
27:23 oscillating on the valence of the
27:25 internal pipe and another frequency that
27:28 would sab on the outside of the pipe but
27:33 I again I don't know if this is
27:34 modulating between the two pipes and
27:37 then all of a sudden there's a giant
27:38 surge in it and freeze this stuff up but
27:41 you can sit and watch on this special
27:43 that aired I think it's ABC or something
27:46 like that he turns that machine on and
27:49 it's burping up tons hydrogen so the
27:53 other thing is that on line you have a
27:55 group of people who have built that
27:56 initial engine and they developed a
27:59 little turbine that use the hydrogen
28:02 just burns the hydrogen turns the
28:04 turbine just like a car would and
28:06 instead of using an alternator to charge
28:11 a battery they just took this the energy
28:13 straight out to their homes and they
28:15 they have reported from these groups
28:18 there's two or three of them hell
28:20 there's probably a bunch nowadays that
28:23 they took their houses completely off
28:24 the grid and the power company showed up
28:27 and said how the hell are you not taking
28:30 electricity from us and they said yeah
28:31 we got this machine we built you should
28:33 build one to get off the grid and so
28:36 what they did was they went to the city
28:39 and reported these people for having a a
28:44 volatile explosive in their backyard and
28:49 had the machine ripped out of the
28:51 backyard so you have a bunch of those
28:54 stories for this machine that doesn't
28:55 work other videos I've seen where
28:58 someone makes the single pipe and his
29:00 little instrument in the in the circular
29:03 water tank had gosh probably at least a
29:05 dozen and a half or so in there and man
29:07 this thing just burps hydrogen like
29:08 crazy but he I was sorry but people
29:11 online have taken this and built the
29:13 pipe just one and they hold it in their
29:15 hands with a little insulator on the end
29:17 and they just put it in a bucket of
29:18 water and you can start seeing
29:20 the hydrogen get created as soon as it
29:23 hits the surface it bursts on fire and
29:26 the guys are like look man this is tap
29:28 water I got this doodad it works now of
29:32 course we need to do more due diligence
29:33 from little videos online to make sure
29:35 they're not putting in you know way more
29:37 energy to create this hydrogen coming
29:39 out but I found this whole thing
29:43 Odie Don it was you know shocked and
29:46 whatever that this had happened and that
29:50 people didn't say anything you know and
29:51 of course everyone says well this is
29:53 really you know the news would cover it
29:54 and it's like now we know fake news is
29:56 there we know about Project Mockingbird
29:57 blah blah blah so then I saw a brand new
30:04 this is probably close to ten years ago
30:08 probably not quite the Fulton town hall
30:11 meeting about stayin Myers and he's long
30:13 dead by the time this little thing
30:15 happened at least probably 12 or 12 15
30:18 years after his death and this
30:20 electrical engineer came up and said you
30:22 know what I finally cracked his
30:25 obfuscation because he said everyone in
30:28 this room has built a little pipe
30:30 machine and you see this work but when
30:32 it came to putting it into a car we
30:34 couldn't figure out how through just
30:37 looking at the diagram and calculating
30:39 the force from an explosion how this was
30:45 ever gonna have enough force to push
30:46 down a piston in a combustion engine it
30:49 didn't have enough force according to
30:51 this guy and this is all very tough to
30:54 to verify because you'd have to get all
30:57 the equipment and build a machine I
30:59 don't know how much the machine would
31:00 actually cost to build if I mean I
31:03 probably have literally a dangerously
31:07 critical amount of knowledge to build
31:09 this machine and because we're dealing
31:11 with hydrogen I just I won't risk it you
31:13 know I might I might blow myself up
31:16 because I don't have that full-fledged
31:18 oh I've done this I've done things like
31:20 this a bunch of times and so you can't
31:22 do it but for those of you listening who
31:24 have these backgrounds you should jump
31:25 into it you can download the non-obvious
31:30 gated redrawn PDFs online there's a ton
31:34 of
31:34 sites dedicated this guy but what this
31:37 dude said during his little speech as he
31:40 goes look we figured out that it's a
31:43 two-part process to push the piston down
31:46 he said one was the explosion that we
31:49 know is gonna take place once his
31:51 hydrogen is created but he goes that was
31:53 not enough and there's a 7525 split and
31:58 I want to say that the hydrogen
32:02 explosion was the 25 but they were
32:06 missing 75 was one of those two and he
32:10 said what we found out was the
32:12 fracturing explosion to create the
32:15 hydrogen out of the water was the other
32:17 percentage we were missing but he never
32:19 wrote that down maybe he didn't write it
32:21 down to keep it a secret maybe didn't
32:23 write it down because he thought bolts
32:24 happening duh you know who knows you
32:29 know I watched tons of Stan's videos
32:32 that were the longer more laboratory
32:34 videos where he's not narrating much
32:37 they're just someone's filming it to
32:38 prove that it was going on and again if
32:41 you're popping off a scam I don't know
32:43 these videos weren't you know like pitch
32:49 videos they weren't like hey we're
32:51 trying to raise money you create a
32:52 little video to show what you're doing
32:53 look scientific and then we'll raise a
32:55 bunch of money there was a point where
32:59 he didn't really have any money issues
33:01 so what do we do now Stan's dead this
33:09 engine I think exists and could be
33:11 created cars are definitely more
33:15 complicated than they used to be could
33:19 you imagine that the only cars that this
33:20 stuff really easily works on are the old
33:22 cars where you could change your own
33:23 spark plugs everyone's trying to find
33:27 1995 cars so they could drive it on
33:29 water but when I got into Stan I also
33:33 got into the other scams that are going
33:35 on in the you know oil / automotive
33:38 industry and one of the scams was that
33:42 the electric car craze that you know
33:46 tried to get started several times even
33:48 I was a kid there's electric cars out
33:50 there what looked like a gremlin that
33:51 was really teeny I think it was even
33:53 featured on one of the Buck Rogers
33:54 episodes from the late 70s early 80s but
33:59 people have created these amazing
34:00 batteries there was an Indian guy here
34:04 in America who I think was in like
34:06 Chicago area
34:07 someone did a documentary on him and he
34:10 had created this fabrication of a
34:12 battery a lithium battery I believe
34:15 don't quote me on that
34:17 okay but he wouldn't let anyone film the
34:21 complete process of creating his battery
34:22 and he was just talking up a storm about
34:25 how I was gonna change the world you see
34:27 these all the time you know or from time
34:29 to time if you pay attention these kind
34:30 of alternate energy dudes out there but
34:35 they get bought up completely bought up
34:38 meaning I buy this from you and you have
34:41 no say anymore
34:42 you can't protest you're gagged legally
34:44 for the rest of your life you can never
34:46 tell anybody that you made this and
34:48 here's a [ __ ] ton of money that you can
34:50 spend for the rest of your life okay
34:55 then they sit on it they destroy it they
34:57 never ever make it they make sure no one
34:59 else can make it because maybe they even
35:01 know if they patented cuz patents are
35:03 public and patents run out so I don't
35:08 know the details of that maybe they
35:09 don't patent it and they just keep it
35:11 off the keep it off the chopping block
35:16 but you can write a patent and get it
35:19 certified to the point it's so frickin
35:21 hard to understand that you could
35:29 challenge someone in court but someone
35:31 who gets a hold of it's not gonna
35:32 understand it like stay in Myers stuff
35:34 right I had a friend of mine approached
35:38 me from high school he had he had come
35:42 up with an algorithm to use sound
35:45 frequency really more of electronic
35:48 sound frequency higher pitch
35:50 electrically driven frequencies to
35:52 metabolize and I I'm gonna use the word
35:56 ether he never used that using it in an
35:59 egg shape and putting a base
36:01 a wire inside this egg vibrating it out
36:04 the frequency of hydrogen or whatever
36:06 you're actually looking for in terms of
36:07 atomic elements or I should say chemical
36:09 elements and he believed that it would
36:13 create hydrogen if you needed it or
36:15 whatever you need sort of like the the
36:17 air
36:18 production unit in the fictional movie
36:20 explorers with little kids created the
36:23 force field and then they created the
36:25 oxygen inside the force field so they
36:27 could breathe and was all being given to
36:29 them by aliens from space so they could
36:31 have some friends up there so they went
36:32 up and visited the aliens and they
36:33 party-hardy up there is pretty funny but
36:36 the one thing that we did because of
36:37 Stan Myers and again my buddy was
36:40 looking for funding I don't know if he's
36:42 reliable he could be a complete liar he
36:46 was talking to me and saying that people
36:48 I do rely on saw that he was being
36:50 visited by a guy in a white suit as a
36:53 matter of fact I told the story once
36:55 before but he said that he came home one
36:58 day and there was a white Mercedes
36:59 parked out front and he guy called
37:03 himself Simon that was the other thing
37:04 he said he came back and he found a guy
37:06 sitting in his backyard on a plastic
37:09 chair that he had you know four or five
37:10 of them out there he was living in
37:13 outside of Phoenix Arizona at the time
37:14 and he said this dude had a notebook of
37:17 his whole life in there his past his
37:20 presents he you know he told me the
37:23 story about how the guy was like I know
37:27 how many times you brush your teeth and
37:29 you know just a bunch of stuff to kind
37:31 of intimidate him but he also turned the
37:32 page and revealed that somehow he had
37:35 gotten hold of the schematic that my
37:37 friend had created for this device and
37:38 he said you need to like stop with this
37:42 project you're gonna be in trouble you
37:44 know I don't know I don't know there
37:47 again there was a couple people as a
37:49 matter of fact the person that
37:50 supposedly works with John Carpenter
37:52 from my home town was one of the
37:55 witnesses that this dude is real that
37:57 this guy showed up two or three times
37:58 harassing my buddy then my buddy moves
38:01 back to the Midwest and finally said
38:04 that he had raised money from an
38:06 individual overseas in Europe and that
38:10 when the money tried to come over to his
38:12 account that the Homeland Security
38:13 grabbed it
38:14 in shut the whole thing down who knows
38:19 who knows who knows but the reason I
38:21 mentioned this is that we and I've heard
38:25 this mentioned several times since then
38:27 which is good because the consciousness
38:28 is starting to rise if someone knows how
38:32 to make something like this zero-point
38:34 energy system or at least you put you
38:37 get more out than you put in sort of
38:38 system that could change the world what
38:42 you don't do is what Stan Myers did and
38:46 we bought the domain back in the day I
38:47 bought project hydrogen calm pretty cool
38:50 domain right
38:51 we put the project on there no longer
38:53 use this if you go out there whatever's
38:55 there is not anything we did but I said
38:59 you're gonna publish everything if I'm
39:00 gonna help you because he came to me
39:01 like dude you got to help me and I said
39:04 okay I said you're gonna publish
39:06 everything you've got I will personally
39:08 draw the diagram of the device and I
39:11 created a really cool egg logo was
39:13 really awesome really simplistic and
39:14 beautiful but then we published the
39:16 whole how to build this thing sort of
39:17 thing I said you were at no point are
39:19 gonna covet this at no point are you
39:21 gonna try to profit off this without you
39:24 know just giving it to the world and
39:25 finding a way to monetize it from there
39:27 so you put all together he had quite a
39:29 few pages of documentation and then I
39:32 reached out to a bunch of people that I
39:34 think would that I thoughts excuse me
39:37 would understand what he was saying and
39:41 I think one of them was actually a Stan
39:44 Myers guy and I invited them to the
39:48 material I said please tear this thing
39:50 apart if you don't think this will ever
39:52 work and that didn't happened in fact he
39:55 got into my buddy and these people so I
39:57 get into heavy dialogue and they were
40:00 asking questions and they were saying
40:02 look some people have been down this
40:03 road that you're going down and they
40:05 went into this obstacle my buddy would
40:07 come back with I thought of that too
40:08 this is my correction for that problem
40:11 so went for God probably about four or
40:14 five years until eventually my buddy
40:17 just you know got exhausted from the
40:19 project and life caught up with them I
40:21 think he got remarried and that kind of
40:23 thing I think you mean another kid in
40:25 his early 40s and so he got busy and
40:29 out of it what I have heard several
40:31 times on the web with these sort of
40:34 projects is exactly what I just said you
40:38 know if you really want to help the
40:39 world you can't and you can because you
40:42 have this crazy invention and just
40:44 release it already people get it and
40:47 build it and sure you're gonna run into
40:50 some entitled people to go well of
40:51 course you you know I deserve to have
40:53 your invention but you're gonna find
40:55 probably an infinite level of super
40:57 appreciative people but if you want to
40:59 get some stuff for free which is another
41:01 way of making money right you know I
41:03 never pay for anything celebrities
41:05 hardly pay for [ __ ] man when a celebrity
41:07 walks into maybe not the big cities but
41:11 even big cities if somebody walks into a
41:13 restaurant the restaurants so happy a
41:15 celebrity's there they're like I'm gonna
41:17 put you in a really nice suite we're
41:19 gonna let some people see ya and maybe
41:21 make some phone calls to bring down
41:23 other famous people or other rich people
41:25 wherever see this famous person in there
41:27 and then I'm gonna take a photograph
41:28 with you at Benihana I took a thousand
41:30 photographs with every dude that walked
41:32 through there that was famous put them
41:34 all over all of his restaurants and
41:36 legitimized the restaurant I mean even
41:38 if you think that's sort of corny it's
41:40 pretty cool means the food's good these
41:42 people can go anywhere in the world
41:43 they're eating Benihana delicious garlic
41:46 butter fried rice but when we say you
41:50 know saving the world it's interesting
41:55 energy is a kind of debacle for society
42:00 and this is where we kind of get into
42:02 the danger zone if everybody had free
42:05 energy to go everywhere now the
42:07 interesting thing about Stan Myers
42:09 engine because it's fuel based that we
42:12 don't have to reinvent technically
42:14 speaking all of the engines in the world
42:17 we don't longer need diesel engines
42:19 which operated a different quality of
42:23 refined gasoline and it there's no spark
42:26 plug it uses a heated piston technique
42:28 as I understand it I've never I don't
42:31 think I've ever seen inside of a diesel
42:34 engine as a engine repair rebuild
42:38 but turbines that work on jets a that
42:43 just needs fuel to pour over the
42:44 turbines ignite its and you're just
42:46 gonna have to regulate it so you don't
42:48 burn the thing up or you got enough to
42:50 push the thing around and you got it so
42:52 the cool thing about his technique was
42:54 that it works everywhere right away but
42:58 there's a problem with energy and
43:00 population growth and this is something
43:02 that Michael Rupert beautifully
43:05 uncovered before his apparent suicide in
43:08 2014
43:10 actually no might have been in early
43:12 2015 excuse me it was definitely 2015
43:17 but he realized that as soon as oil
43:19 became available and was turning into a
43:22 mechanism that fueled transportation the
43:27 population started exploding now at the
43:28 same exact time you do have coal burning
43:31 steam locomotives that were also blowing
43:34 up and that caused the gigantic
43:36 explosion and that's where my hometown
43:38 was built on Santa Fe Railroad and so
43:41 the idea is if people can move around to
43:44 places that are inhabited
43:45 they will procreate and fill up the gap
43:48 and we we are not again you know I've
43:54 talked to some major world experts on
43:56 this who put it in there and they they
43:58 always say look we're not overpopulated
44:00 yet but the rate of population growth is
44:03 so drastic that it won't be very long
44:06 before we are totally you know
44:09 elbow-to-elbow in this place and that's
44:11 when influenza will most likely mutate
44:14 and wipe out the you know a gigantic
44:17 chunk of the human race but if nothing
44:20 else if that doesn't work they'll start
44:22 doing really bad things to people and
44:26 that will not be a world we want to live
44:28 in but now here's what's interesting
44:31 even though we have to pay for gasoline
44:34 and we have to pay for jet fuel there
44:38 are plenty of people that will pay
44:40 nobody I mean we don't like it when gas
44:42 goes up in price but you still pay for
44:44 it you still get to wherever you need to
44:46 go so I think at this point in history
44:49 there's not
44:52 a tremendous amount of movement on the
44:54 surface of the earth that is being
44:56 impeded by a lack of energy if somebody
45:00 you know wants to go to South America or
45:03 Africa and they really think they can
45:05 find a place that is unlived in and they
45:08 could live there and they're not going
45:09 to get eaten up all the Predators or the
45:11 locals or whatever they could do it
45:13 today there's not a big deal so this
45:15 water engine even a better system some
45:18 Tesla you know zero-point energy
45:21 ether all engine if that was created you
45:25 know the only thing that if for those of
45:27 you play World of Warcraft you're gonna
45:28 know what I'm talking about if we had
45:32 anti-gravity such you could fly anywhere
45:35 you wanted to I think we'd have a few
45:37 homes where we wouldn't normally find
45:39 them a few businesses where you wouldn't
45:40 find them a few towns where we wouldn't
45:42 normally find them Machu Picchu wouldn't
45:44 be the only place stuck up in the middle
45:47 of nowhere be a lot of that but we don't
45:50 have that but here we are in this sort
45:53 of awakening of mankind as Renaissance
45:56 2.0 we're starting to wake up we're
45:59 starting to smell corruption and it
46:02 would seem although they're they're
46:05 trying man social credit system right
46:07 there
46:08 but they are trying to develop
46:09 technology faster than we're capable of
46:12 recognizing it and they are trying to
46:16 make sure technology always hits the
46:18 realm of control I have not met a single
46:22 person who has watched two Boston
46:23 Dynamics video I've seen them online who
46:29 doesn't see the robots start running
46:31 around on top of junk piles and the cows
46:34 and all this other stuff carrying stuff
46:36 of course it's being pitched as this
46:39 this will carry supplies for our troops
46:42 again not a big problem right now we
46:45 still fight wars and we shouldn't be
46:47 fighting wars but let's not make Wars
46:49 really super easy to fight but these
46:53 robots freak people out and they freak
46:56 people out because we have had enough
46:59 science fiction and again if we hadn't
47:01 had the science fiction movies that we
47:03 have we might look at these robots and
47:05 go oh
47:06 and you know I'm not extremely well-read
47:09 in the in the science-fiction room I
47:14 know some classics but there have been
47:17 countless films made where they talk
47:22 about the uprising of the robots where
47:25 they come in the stages are always the
47:28 same the robots come in and they are
47:30 servants and they're not that
47:31 intelligent they don't have true
47:33 sentient artificial intelligence but
47:35 eventually the neural Nets mature man
47:37 gets better creating at least a decent
47:40 approximation of mankind and then these
47:42 things are getting somehow getting
47:44 abused by a bunch of ungrateful humans
47:46 which I'm sure we can all fantasize
47:50 about that's possible and then the
47:53 robots fight back and then we kill the
47:56 robots and then we have in this post
47:59 robotic apocalypse where the world is
48:02 not necessarily destroyed but there are
48:04 you know they're all demonized you don't
48:07 make them anymore and you don't allow
48:08 them in there's that odd Uma movie that
48:13 Antonio Banderas made which is a great
48:17 example of this it's a great movie it's
48:20 a little dry at the end feels a little
48:21 slow at they and you kind of see maybe
48:23 they ran out of the budget sort of has
48:25 the hate humanity spin at the end and
48:30 humanity's got some serious
48:31 environmental problems there's a little
48:32 bit of like deep state agendas in there
48:34 but overall he does a fantastic job the
48:37 the quirky indie way it was filmed is
48:40 perfect for the the tone of the film so
48:44 there's one of these questions the
48:45 reason why I'm going off on the robot
48:46 thing is to simply boil to the top the
48:50 question which is I know that you can do
48:55 this but should you do this No
48:58 there's hardly a person on earth that
49:01 thinks that the oil companies should
49:03 remain in power that they should be salt
49:05 into this salt that Queen this King that
49:09 politician here executive there that
49:11 should have this incredible amount of
49:13 infinite money the thing can get
49:15 funneled into all these control
49:16 apparatus to screw with our lives
49:19 everybody knows that that needs to come
49:21 to an end
49:21 oils dirty it it barf scrap in the air
49:25 that you shouldn't breathe people kill
49:27 themselves by locking themselves in a in
49:29 a car and you know closing the garage
49:33 door and it's fixie eating it happens if
49:39 you did that will stay in Meijer thing
49:40 only thing you might do is get steamed
49:43 to death because when hydrogen burns it
49:47 just steams it's beautiful the all the
49:52 hydrogen cars today are the exact
49:53 byproduct you still won't catch me
49:55 trying to breathe off the pipe but it's
49:57 better than the no petrol engine right
50:00 but those changes are called disruptors
50:04 it's the new keyword of the 21st century
50:06 investment community this is a major
50:09 disrupter and the answer is yeah that's
50:12 as big as it gets baby you take oil out
50:16 of cars it's huge now before I move on I
50:20 need to loop back on the question where
50:24 someone might say but what about
50:25 lubricating the parts inside the engine
50:28 Stan claimed that by the mid-50s that
50:31 the automotive industry had figured out
50:33 how to treat steel with petroleum in
50:37 such a way that it remains slick to the
50:40 touch for its lifetime now that may not
50:44 be truly an infinite solution but it
50:47 would be for the life of the car in
50:48 general so they can treat this the
50:50 crankshaft the crankcase everything
50:52 that's moving with this technique and
50:54 you have slick steel and I believe I've
50:57 actually touched a sample of this and
50:59 you touch the steel and it feels like
51:01 you've got grease on your hands but then
51:03 you touch your hands and you don't have
51:04 any grease on your hands it's an
51:05 interesting technique but he just blew
51:08 it off at a meeting once and like this
51:10 this has been in existence forever and
51:13 in the meeting he was holding his piston
51:14 thing so there was little his little
51:16 perforator plug things it was cool and
51:19 in this one there's a one video out
51:21 there or he's popping the hoods of cards
51:24 that he's retrofitted with this engine
51:26 that's the other thing for this being a
51:27 big scam it's like really it's working
51:32 you know there wouldn't be a price tag
51:34 on a scam because someone at 1500 bucks
51:37 everybody has 50 hundred bucks in the
51:38 90s Jesus your personal computers at
51:40 home were $3500 so some of them got 1500
51:44 sure man boom there's 50 hundred bucks
51:46 do my car thanks now what I don't know
51:48 is of the cars that he that were
51:50 demonstrating this one video where his
51:52 dune buggy over there and these other
51:53 cars I don't know if anyone has them
51:56 still do they still exist to someone get
51:58 him and pick them up crush them loose if
52:00 you know more than me then which is not
52:03 hard definitely leave it in the comment
52:06 section but a gigantic disrupter like
52:09 this is something that I think that the
52:11 layman like me would just jump on a go
52:14 hell yeah you know and there's a there's
52:16 an impulse and an instinct to say hell
52:19 yeah screw everybody let's just see what
52:23 happens and maybe you destroy yourself
52:29 maybe you destroy your the life of your
52:31 children and their in your grandchildren
52:33 because you've from the economy into
52:36 chaos now a lot of you economists out
52:39 there even if you're what the
52:41 professionals might call an amateur
52:43 economist doesn't mean you don't know
52:45 everything that needs to be known I
52:47 simply say well we get off this petrol
52:50 dollar and go back to the gold currency
52:53 ah there you go if that's the case if
52:57 that truly solves the problem of the
52:59 petrol dollar instead of artificial
53:02 demand on a product then that might be
53:07 the thing that has to happen first and
53:09 this is where again planning provides
53:12 the bed work for the whole thing you
53:15 know there's this after I released my 17
53:19 episode I ran into you know quite a few
53:22 dissenters and a lot of great comments
53:24 about it but one of the things I found
53:26 really frustrating was that they said
53:28 well he's saying everything that all the
53:29 people that have said in the past have
53:31 said and I kind of covered this in the
53:33 episode but the idea is okay so a bunch
53:35 of people lied in the past and they have
53:38 to use words that sound like they're
53:40 telling the truth
53:40 otherwise the lie is a never believed
53:42 and they never get any a change and they
53:44 don't get in the history books for being
53:45 some of the
53:46 most corrupt bastards on planet earth to
53:49 have ever lived the problem is is if the
53:52 ISA fable of the boy calling wolf tires
53:56 everyone I mean think about this in the
54:00 ESOP fable of the boy that called wolf
54:02 the only thing that the story said at
54:04 the end was don't lie and call wolf
54:07 because eventually no one will believe
54:09 you it's a credibility moral uptick at
54:12 the end but the thing was is that the
54:14 kid did it three times as I remember the
54:15 story and no one believed that kid not
54:21 anyone who yells wolf you have to find
54:24 people with decent integrity people who
54:27 do what they say they run in a campaign
54:30 of a bunch of promises whether you agree
54:32 with them or not and then when they get
54:34 into office they do exactly what they
54:36 said they were going to do all right at
54:40 least you've got someone that you can
54:41 trust like Malcolm X said rather have a
54:44 guy called me in word to my face than to
54:46 pretend they like me and say behind my
54:47 back because at least I knew who my
54:49 enemies are so there's huge pressure to
54:52 fix the whole world in four years it's
54:55 nuts
54:55 you can't happen that fast I wish I
54:58 could it can't not without God being
55:01 here and waving a magic wand
55:03 now with electricity they love it
55:05 because we're still buying the
55:07 electricity in units we still subscribe
55:10 to the few sort of draconian ways that
55:14 we create electricity again I have a
55:17 very close friend of mine he's in his
55:20 he's probably almost 70 he spent 40 plus
55:23 years creating power plants and for
55:27 either a major factory that needed to
55:29 create you know q-tips and so he creates
55:31 a factories energy system to run all the
55:34 run all the machines because buying
55:36 power from local power company is just
55:39 not economical in the overall business
55:41 model but he told me that we stopped
55:44 building electro hydroelectric plants in
55:47 America by the mid 70s well who do you
55:51 think made that stupid decision the oil
55:54 companies lobbied the politicians to
55:57 turn it off and so we buy hydro electric
55:59 from
55:59 yada and ship it down here through the
56:02 wires right electricity has exist today
56:05 in its way it's manufactured in United
56:07 States of America can't speak for any
56:09 other country don't know it's crazy
56:12 nuclear power plants are crazy because
56:16 of the toxicity of the water that comes
56:19 out of these places we have to bury in
56:20 the ground for however many billion
56:22 zillion years and another some of you
56:25 don't think this stuff exists because
56:26 you don't believe fission can happen I
56:29 know what to tell you man there's plenty
56:32 of sort of Brockovich lawsuits based on
56:36 burying these barrels of toxic water out
56:38 of power plants these things exists
56:41 right it's not like you go inside the
56:44 power plant or the atomic power plant
56:46 and there's like a little gas motor and
56:49 there's guys pulling it you know bring
56:50 me some more diesel fuel you know it's
56:52 got rods and these meshes that then are
56:55 put in the perfect proximity to create
56:58 fission boil water turn the turbine and
57:01 send electricity out the door even if
57:04 Fukushima was a setup who knows it
57:08 demonstrates the problem Chernobyl
57:10 demonstrates the problem Three Mile
57:12 Island demonstrated the problem so the
57:15 first one is you know should we do
57:19 something like this is to make sure we
57:21 take care of our monetary system we know
57:24 it's all screwed up it needs to be fixed
57:25 anyway regardless of anyone creating
57:26 this engine the second more impactful
57:29 social consequence would be if we did
57:32 introduce this Frehley free energy
57:34 system which is water it's not
57:37 completely free but it's a hell of a lot
57:39 cheaper than a barrel of oil would we
57:43 want affect the price of water you know
57:45 - would we create a gigantic population
57:50 explosion for certain areas of the world
57:52 maybe maybe all the first world
57:54 countries of the world run no simulation
57:56 risk of an increase in their population
57:59 due to energy being available because
58:01 again everybody can get anywhere in
58:03 America with a tank of gas and no one's
58:05 no one's I would say limiting their
58:11 spawning the
58:13 sires due to tinker gasoline it's just
58:16 not a problem so maybe that's not a big
58:18 one for us personally maybe in Africa it
58:21 would be gigantic maybe they would have
58:23 a billion people in ten years if they
58:25 had free energy to move around who knows
58:27 I don't know something we have to
58:30 examine if Stan Meyers story is true
58:34 then I have a certain soft spot for
58:37 people in history that have done that
58:38 and if my friend I should say more
58:41 acquaintances that claim that this
58:44 happens multiple times every decade and
58:47 these individuals are essentially
58:49 exterminated off the face of the planet
58:51 one way or the other then I have the
58:53 same feeling for them these individuals
58:56 have on one side of their merit the
59:01 invention inside them to figure it all
59:05 out and that is something serious
59:08 think about the Wright brothers think
59:10 about them trying to create the wing the
59:13 perfect wing to fly and trial and error
59:16 and trial and error and then flying this
59:18 thing for the first time I think they
59:19 said that the photograph they took in
59:20 1903
59:21 shows one of the brothers about what
59:24 they approximated to be about 48 feet in
59:26 the air well that's that's way up there
59:29 man what's my house my house is maybe 15
59:33 20 feet tall with the the peak of the
59:36 the roof and double that and add 10 more
59:39 feet I mean that's huge that's a really
59:41 hell of a flight and he could die he
59:43 could have died creating that thing but
59:45 thankfully they didn't die thankfully
59:48 they went to the French there goes
59:52 World's Fair and flew and then America
59:55 falling oh yeah yeah well totally patent
59:57 this because we don't want the French to
59:58 patent first and supposedly there was
60:01 some shenanigans with the time zone
60:03 stamping of the patent because we're in
60:07 an earlier time zone than France and
60:09 they that's how they supposedly got it
60:10 the big scam with the Wright brothers
60:12 and a buddy of mine wrote a film called
60:15 first which is just beautiful was that
60:19 the military wanted to get the patent
60:21 and they never wanted to pay two
60:23 brothers anything and so they actually
60:26 sent info
60:27 traders down to their labs and tried to
60:29 siphon off something by just pure
60:31 observation and we're fortunately never
60:34 able to do that how many plates places
60:37 have you seen in this world that you
60:40 would have never seen had you not
60:41 written on a plane now some places you
60:46 might say why just would have driven my
60:47 car but I don't know maybe I would take
60:50 a trip to Hawaii on a boat maybe I don't
60:54 know if I'd ever go to Australia I don't
60:56 know I don't know if I'd ever go to
60:58 Europe I guess I'd probably go to Europe
60:59 at least once on a boat we're talking
61:01 about you know weeks like week's worth
61:03 of journey with a modern boat so these
61:06 individuals are special individuals some
61:10 of them like the Wright brothers are
61:11 able to fight a four year battle after
61:13 the Battle of inventing the thing in the
61:15 first place
61:16 and get rewarded for it in history
61:20 others like Stan Myers died you know now
61:28 maybe died of an aneurysm it was just
61:30 super bad luck then the that the epitaph
61:35 of his story is don't covet don't covet
61:40 your invention for profiteering let the
61:43 world have it and we're not talking
61:47 about a little tiny toy some elective
61:50 invention that nobody really needs yeah
61:53 patent that they make yourself a ton of
61:54 money have some fun whether it be
61:57 software hardware whatever it is a new
61:59 sham Wow a sham oh my god how about that
62:05 now to close this thing off I want to
62:07 remind you of something that was brought
62:09 up by dr. Steven Greer of the disclosure
62:12 project dr. Steven Greer is actually a
62:16 doctor doctor a physical doctor who
62:19 worked ers for a long time and doesn't
62:23 really matter who this guy is but I just
62:24 want to kind of sake in case people like
62:26 oh the disclosure projects all [ __ ]
62:27 yeah maybe it is but this statement is
62:29 right on the money I've said it several
62:32 times and I got it from him because once
62:34 I heard him say it I was I was just
62:35 baffled of how easy what he said blew my
62:39 mind
62:40 the fact that I don't hear it anywhere
62:42 ever you know and that is that he said
62:48 regardless of what the laws of physics
62:50 say you can do and when I was a child
62:54 they told me that Top Fuel Drag Race
62:56 cars hitting 300 miles an hour as
62:58 quickly as they did with as much mass as
63:00 they are built out of was said to be
63:02 impossible but they did it and they
63:04 exceeded way beyond what was said to be
63:07 possible I don't know if anyone actually
63:08 said that but I've heard it two or three
63:10 times in my lifetime but dr. Greer said
63:13 look why isn't a single country in the
63:17 world dedicating itself to creating a
63:19 zero-point energy system for the world
63:22 some people might just lean on you know
63:25 the the zeitgeist movie and the
63:27 geothermal electric electric plant
63:29 especially as Caltech initially designed
63:32 it which doesn't bring up toxic
63:33 chemicals from the bowels of the earth
63:35 which is what the power companies have
63:37 done when they build these things they
63:38 build them to be very inefficient to
63:41 prove that what they've done is the way
63:43 that we should keep everything why not
63:45 but why isn't that the case I mean
63:48 seriously the dudes on the money with
63:50 this statement Kennedy goes up and says
63:53 I'm we're gonna put a man on the moon
63:55 and return him back safely in ten years
63:57 okay well I don't believe that actually
64:00 took place but hey that dudes mind was
64:03 in the right frame of mind let's do
64:06 something extraordinary let's do it
64:09 because you guys don't think you can has
64:12 exactly reason why we should if there
64:15 are laws in the book of thermodynamics
64:21 to say you can't do this well screw
64:23 those let's just do it anyway and stop
64:27 saying that you can't because the second
64:29 you believe a paradigm of something you
64:30 can't do then you don't do it what do
64:33 you think communist new countries are
64:34 allowed to exist on planet Earth because
64:37 just like they said in Westworld
64:41 season two they remind us of the old the
64:44 old story of why does the elephant
64:46 that's as big as a house obey the rope
64:50 around his neck
64:51 pushed into a little stake in the ground
64:54 why doesn't he pull that up and walk off
64:57 and the story goes is that when the
64:59 elephant's a child he is bolted down
65:02 with a rope that's strong enough that
65:05 when he tries to get away he can and he
65:08 never undoes that limitation from his
65:10 mind and so even though he's big as a
65:12 house
65:13 and could easily just walk away with
65:15 that thing he doesn't
65:18 why does South America want to migrate
65:21 to North America outside of any racist
65:25 thing that might be going on in some
65:26 people's minds it's because they don't
65:28 think they can change their country some
65:31 people are convinced that the tyranny
65:33 that they're in is what they want they
65:35 get Stockholm Syndrome to their nation
65:39 that's a different area of the world so
65:43 we know that changing our brains from
65:46 impossible to possible is the name of
65:49 the game my my old slogan for my life
65:54 was you know I'm I'm I'm attracted to
65:57 the impossible when people tell me in
66:00 technology the things can't be done I'm
66:02 there and I've only run into one
66:03 invention that I couldn't solve for the
66:08 problem which was when I created the
66:11 with my team at my video game company is
66:14 only about mmm four of us we work with
66:17 LL Cool J decreas
66:18 online music studio Cool J wanted it to
66:21 be possible for five guys to be in five
66:23 different places singing harmony and
66:26 they all got the feet at the exact same
66:28 time and they could all hear their own
66:29 voices at the exact same time and
66:32 currently without I mean I think at some
66:35 point we're gonna be able to pull this
66:36 off but it'll be a few hundred years
66:37 from now or we get some sub-ether
66:40 waveband to make it happen but we're
66:44 gonna have to have something travel
66:45 faster than the speed of light and and
66:49 then to electronically transfer the bits
66:51 the binary bits or even the analog
66:53 signal for one place to another so
66:55 everyone's getting this so quickly the
66:57 DeMuth there's a micro delay the
66:59 software can adjust that everyone's
67:01 client-side to make sure everyone feels
67:03 like they're singing in the same room
67:05 you know when we talk on the phone
67:08 with people overseas there's still a
67:10 tiny delay certain solutions on the
67:12 Internet have a tiny delay depends on up
67:14 the Internet's really busy it's pretty
67:16 damn awesome how amazing things are but
67:20 even in 50 milliseconds was enough to
67:21 break their software we had to write
67:23 special software and get special
67:25 hardware special drivers to bring it
67:27 down to 15 milliseconds that was as
67:29 close as we could do it with you sitting
67:31 in front of the computer wrapping it
67:33 over our track and making sure that the
67:35 mic went down to the operating system
67:37 gave the operating system a copy and
67:39 then brought the other part of the
67:40 signal back up to your ear
67:42 instantaneously as a 15 millisecond
67:45 travel time so those are some problems
67:47 you can run into we know Tesla was onto
67:50 something he had proven it in Colorado
67:54 Springs he built his big antenna to
67:58 broadcast electricity everywhere he was
68:00 on to something they tore it down then
68:03 they erased the guy from the history
68:04 books sounds a bit like staying liars
68:07 doesn't I guess in closing you know
68:10 let's just think about Tesla for a
68:11 second because I've run into this
68:15 conversation a lot lately
68:16 in people my physical life we don't we
68:21 will sit around every once a while
68:22 people will say I got a friend of mine
68:24 who's a very technical guy I wouldn't
68:28 say as electronics degree but we sat
68:30 around and you know he was saying isn't
68:32 it weird he goes I went all the way
68:34 through school in college and no one
68:36 ever told me that Nikola Tesla existed
68:38 and that's a crime that's a crime I mean
68:44 there's no excuse there's no excuse why
68:48 you have to ingest miles of Albert
68:51 Einstein constantly and you never hear
68:55 about Tesla and you know there's two to
68:59 two or three different tiers of knowing
69:01 about Tesla one you're not to know the
69:04 guy's name so you'd never look anything
69:06 up and that's obviously changing too if
69:09 they let you know his name and you have
69:11 a conversation about him they'll just
69:13 say oh yeah he invented alternating
69:16 current and he discovered and invented
69:20 wire
69:21 technology although there was a guy in
69:22 Europe who was also doing around the
69:24 same thing but Tesla had I think a few
69:27 more resources at his fingertips and he
69:29 had industry at his fingertips and so he
69:32 was able to be responsible for
69:34 metabolizing into companies that we use
69:37 all our technology on right now but the
69:42 third tier of Tesla as I button up the
69:46 season for here because I know what the
69:47 next episode is gonna be about that
69:48 after record and season four is over his
69:52 ether ether is something you're not
69:55 supposed to know about you're supposed
69:56 to think it doesn't exist but it exists
70:00 that's what all of his inventions were
70:03 based on he said it many times in his
70:06 writings all of his predecessors except
70:10 for maybe Edison he didn't give a [ __ ]
70:14 but all the discoverers of electricity
70:17 talked about ether and that that was the
70:19 basis of all of their inventions it was
70:21 the basis of how they knew electron
70:24 works how electron exists but you're not
70:28 to know that so if you're going in to
70:31 stay in Meijer and you're reading about
70:32 the dissenting voices saying that he was
70:35 a fraud I hope this episode will help
70:38 you sort of do a little bit of logic and
70:41 say well you know if that was a fake
70:43 then why'd anyone offer him 1.1 million
70:45 dollars if that was a fake why does he
70:47 randomly diet at a dinner with a couple
70:49 investors and why are people able to
70:53 build portions of his invention and get
70:57 it to work why do people with massive
71:00 degrees 10 to 15 years after he's dead
71:03 say Eureka I got it I got it I figured
71:07 this out I know what he was hiding and
71:10 all the math makes sense if you have
71:13 something like this or you rediscover
71:15 someone else's previous project and you
71:18 have an indication in your laboratory
71:19 meaning it's doing what they said it
71:22 would do then you need to make yourself
71:27 an extremely public figure duplicate
71:30 your materials upload them everywhere if
71:33 you're gonna do a YouTube video
71:35 showing off what you did that's not
71:36 enough you gotta release the schematics
71:38 you got to mail them to people that are
71:40 on the same journey and yeah sure the
71:43 five vials we'll see you do it the
71:44 second you do it but in the end you will
71:46 have neutralized any ability they have
71:48 to stop you because you put it in the
71:50 public domain it's potential that you
71:55 could file a patent and then file it
71:56 into the public domain here's the patent
71:59 folks here's how it works it's not gonna
72:00 be in legalese talk where you're not
72:02 gonna understand what the hell I'm
72:03 talking about
72:03 you won't obvious get anything and again
72:06 hopefully hopefully just like one can
72:09 make a bag bag battery you know three
72:12 four five thousand years ago or more
72:15 whatever you've invented whatever that
72:17 is a little kid could put it together
72:19 they just had the clothespin and the
72:23 rubber band and whatever the hell else
72:24 they need right a little bit of alcohol
72:25 whatever you need to make whatever
72:27 you're building do a deep dive on Stan
72:31 Myers and let me know what you think
72:33 pros/cons you think he's a fraud
72:35 whatever if you do want to accuse him of
72:38 being a fraud I don't problem with that
72:40 but do me a favor really qualify your
72:45 engineering background and don't quote
72:47 back to me the first two laws of
72:48 thermodynamics blood-like duh we all
72:50 know that that exists and again those
72:52 are put in place to keep you down try to
72:55 go beyond that look at the videos of
72:58 people making these things what you look
73:01 the dude up and again I don't know if
73:02 they've scraped a bunch of videos off
73:03 the web I haven't done a huge deep dive
73:06 recently I'm pretty sure that there's
73:08 websites out there that you could find
73:11 this stuff on maybe you can't find on
73:12 the Google com
73:13 who knows you have to go to some other
73:14 search engine to find it it's not part
73:17 of the the controlled information
73:20 highway let me know what you think I
73:24 think that's about all I got for that
73:26 one if you haven't been to deep thoughts
73:28 video com please go that's where you get
73:30 all the links to this show in all of its
73:33 forms so there's a couple video choices
73:35 there's social media choices we have a
73:38 LOC Facebook group with a great group of
73:40 people and I want to say too I've said
73:43 this once before
73:43 inside episodes but some of our folks
73:45 have a tremendous background
73:47 in technology and so you might come in
73:50 and go hey guys this looks real to me is
73:52 this real maybe you want to question
73:54 whether or not a video you've seen looks
73:56 like it's CG or not we got some CG
73:59 experts in there we have engineering
74:00 experts and all this other stuff I
74:02 recently had a that guy texted me on a
74:08 facebook chat because he was talking to
74:10 someone else online and I use a I use an
74:13 account to talk to my deep thoughts
74:16 radio page on Facebook called deep mind
74:19 and someone someone had created an
74:21 account called deep mind inside I don't
74:24 know what this person is but the guy
74:26 asked me this web development question
74:28 and I was looking at this going well
74:31 that's a really interesting someone come
74:33 to me for what cuz I say I do it on the
74:35 show and I was like well I could
74:36 probably get into it this and help you
74:37 but I don't know what you're talking
74:39 about you know and so I linked over to
74:41 where he had had this previous
74:42 conversation because he included the
74:44 link and it was like oh you got the
74:45 wrong dude but if you give you some more
74:47 information I might be able to help you
74:48 it's kind of funny I just thought of a
74:49 little funny challenge there one of the
74:52 other things on the site is a way to
74:54 donate to the to the show again if you
74:56 even just put a buck in and patreon
74:58 you'll get these links before anyone
75:01 else gets them nine times out of ten so
75:04 you can watch them the second that they
75:06 start getting uploaded so I upload
75:08 things that I leave them in a unlisted
75:10 format until at least get a better
75:13 encoding of it
75:14 a lot of times though I noticed that
75:16 what what YouTube is doing to probably
75:19 save a lot of money on the back end and
75:20 it's actually a pretty sound theory is
75:23 it a video they don't want to encode a
75:25 video at higher resolutions if no one is
75:29 watching the video so sometimes I have
75:31 to release it to start getting the 720p
75:33 1080p in the 2160 4k to encode and the
75:37 4k actually takes several days to come
75:40 about sometimes so there are certain
75:43 videos that for whatever reason they got
75:44 a bug on their end and they never
75:46 encoded it up from the basic 360 P which
75:49 is or 320 P or whatever the hell it is
75:51 just this horrible low res format so I
75:53 think the episode on vacuums got
75:56 uploaded and it never encoded properly
75:58 so it's just a little bit of low res
76:00 but anyway the audio from the podcast
76:04 and the audio from the YouTube are
76:06 exactly the same because I create them
76:08 from the same product as something I've
76:09 never answered someone asked me that
76:11 once and there's also the new remastered
76:14 season 1 so season 1 when I first
76:16 recorded it was very rough the
76:18 microphone was like you know an inch
76:20 from my mouth and so it just sounds
76:22 awful plus I was just getting my groove
76:24 down I didn't know how to do anything
76:25 really well and had a lot of
76:28 idiosyncrasies when I talked and so
76:30 there's a lot of zeros and and all kinds
76:35 of weird stuff I've been able to train
76:37 myself out of for the most part if I end
76:39 up doing it nowadays I cut it out of the
76:41 video before you ever hear it in most
76:42 cases
76:43 so anyway go up there take a look get
76:46 your fill season four is coming to a
76:48 close I'm gonna take about a month and a
76:49 half off for those of you who wanna know
76:51 but I will be back with a brand new
76:54 season 5 mmm the 100 videos hopefully
76:58 anyway until then take care of yourself
77:00 and someone else I'll see you in the
77:01 next deep thoughts over now
