00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back to deep thoughts ladies and
00:34 gentlemen it is a cool breezy evening
00:37 about five o'clock it's supposed to rain
00:39 for just about an hour so we are
00:41 definitely in a window of safety here
00:45 hopefully I got all my towels ready just
00:46 in case this place goes nuts but as we
00:49 bring season four to a close as I redo
00:54 the season 1 episodes I realized that
00:57 some of them in there have some great
01:00 subjects I think they're covered fairly
01:02 well but it's just a little hard to
01:04 listen to somebody with a microphone a
01:06 couple inches from your face and I
01:09 gained that habit from doing the radio
01:10 show and then took a year to lose it
01:15 basically so screenwriting is a really
01:18 big deal to me obviously I do it
01:20 routinely and I just feel like I've done
01:24 about 4 episodes on it those that are
01:27 into it understand its quality and I own
01:32 probably almost two dozen books of
01:34 pretty much the top folks that do it in
01:36 my opinion there's really only a one guy
01:38 who's the top which is Robert McKee in C
01:43 ke e he wrote a book called story I
01:46 always recommend it because I'm gonna
01:49 give you a little bit of what he says
01:51 but by no means are you am I replacing
01:55 his stuff I'm just touching absolutely a
01:57 fraction without exaggeration of his
01:59 book I say get it on audio because he
02:02 reads it to you he personally reads it
02:04 to and he's got just an amazing stage
02:05 presence when he's doing anything but I
02:10 think that my techniques have refined
02:12 considerably since 2015 when I first put
02:15 together I think it's episode 7 because
02:18 there's some folks that you know they'll
02:20 do everything and read books and that's
02:24 the only thing that they are willing to
02:25 do they never develop any of their own
02:27 techniques so if they weren't taught
02:29 they don't know and then so they'll
02:31 steal it from somebody or borrow from
02:33 somebody in the screenwriting is a very
02:34 weird thing
02:36 I'm gonna take a little inside secret if
02:38 you want to know why most of your movies
02:40 suck it's because anybody who gets
02:42 involved in it becomes a coveting
02:44 [ __ ] and I'm just gonna say it like
02:47 that they will block you from knowing
02:49 anything block you from meeting anyone
02:50 never [ __ ] introduce you to the right
02:52 people they want this to be their game
02:54 and their game only and then the sad
02:57 part is is that Hollywood then has to
02:59 choose from these [ __ ] in order to
03:02 make great films now obviously I'm not
03:04 talking about everybody but I'm talking
03:06 about a lot of people that are
03:08 well-known for what they do they simply
03:10 don't want to help you out now part of
03:11 it is if you keep coming to them for
03:14 them to write your movie and you're
03:15 gonna give them like a credit but
03:17 they're gonna write the whole film
03:18 that's half the reason why some of these
03:20 people are jerk-offs because they're
03:22 like it's horrible you know when you
03:23 tell me what are you're right most
03:25 people most people will go oh neat and
03:28 the other people will go I got this idea
03:30 for a movie man and then it's like oh
03:31 Jesus you know they have no clue what
03:34 they're talking about and this is why I
03:36 want people to have a clue you don't
03:38 need to go to anyone else to write your
03:40 film you write it yourself but when you
03:44 start writing a film you go into these
03:45 angsty moments and it could be as simple
03:49 as how to format part of your script
03:52 you'll see old scripts written a long
03:54 time ago or script you really like and
03:57 you'll see how it's written and you'll
03:59 think that's the way it should be
04:00 written and then you see a 20-19 script
04:03 and it looks nothing like a script
04:05 written in 1980 when your cult classic
04:07 films or whatever you like
04:10 so I obviously don't have the
04:12 consciousness of every agent in my mind
04:14 or every reader in my mind or every
04:16 director in my mind but I'm gonna give
04:19 you sort of a redo if you will of
04:24 episode 7 obviously in 4k and much much
04:28 better audio quality but also with
04:31 another essentially almost four years of
04:36 updated knowledge on doing this
04:38 submitting this selling this all this
04:40 kind of stuff but I'm really going to
04:42 get done this particular episode is
04:43 going to be about initially how do you
04:47 get started doing
04:49 your own script now the big deal that I
04:54 tell my students is that the one thing
04:58 that writers or aspiring writers
05:01 typically forget is this difference
05:04 between having a premise in your mind
05:06 that having a story in your mind
05:08 everyone usually approaches a story from
05:14 its premise and then they forget to
05:17 write the story and when they start you
05:19 know they bill by some screenwriting
05:21 software they'll start tippity typing on
05:24 the keyboard and they'll realize they've
05:25 got nothing they just have a premise or
05:28 maybe they've got a few scenes in their
05:30 head that launched the premise but at no
05:33 point does anybody care about what's
05:35 going on nobody cares about the actors
05:38 skills about their fictional you know
05:40 associations with each other and then we
05:43 give you a classic example I give all
05:47 the time which is it's really funny I
05:50 was in San Diego and had this musician
05:54 who just sang on stage and that's all
05:57 I'll say he came up to me afterwards and
06:00 was asking me what I was doing at the
06:02 particular time when I was working on a
06:03 script and he's like oh my god you read
06:07 movies I said yeah and he goes uh I got
06:09 an idea for a movie and so I said okay
06:12 go for it because were in that you know
06:14 run a nightclub it's really loud
06:15 whatever and he proceeds to tell me the
06:18 premise of Terminator 2 or actually
06:21 Terminator 1 excuse me well there's just
06:23 you know it's in the future and this
06:25 robot comes back in the past and chases
06:28 down somebody to kill him so they don't
06:29 do something in the future and look at
06:31 this guy going you have seen Terminator
06:33 1 & 2 correct but we have a mods better
06:37 mods different you know why and I can't
06:39 even everybody said it was so
06:40 uninteresting the premise of terminator
06:44 is this character coming from the future
06:48 back to the past to kill the Connor kid
06:52 and Sarah just happens to be his mother
06:55 but she hasn't had the kid yet and so
07:00 she and she's mortal if she does
07:07 anything about time travel or robots or
07:09 anything like that and so the premise is
07:12 all the mechanics that make the story
07:14 exist a guy stuck on an island until he
07:19 gets rescued that's the premise
07:21 everything that happens to that guy on
07:23 the island you have to make that
07:24 interesting so that someone will
07:25 actually want to watch it you know Tom
07:27 Hanks doing castaway right a girl being
07:31 sent to the Land of Oz well the tornado
07:36 the grabs er and spins her up in the air
07:38 and takes her to the Land of Oz and then
07:40 she lands and she meets these munchkins
07:43 and the good witch and the bad witch and
07:44 all this other stuff and then she's told
07:47 to follow the yellow brick road
07:49 still all premise what makes you care
07:54 well she's vulnerable so they made her
07:57 vulnerable so you carry of a maternal
07:58 instinct to protect Dorothy in the Land
08:01 of Oz then she starts meeting these
08:05 other characters and each one of these
08:07 characters holds on point a an attribute
08:12 of why we would care about anybody
08:15 when guy is looking for courage when guy
08:17 is looking for a brain when guy's
08:18 looking for a heart and each one of
08:20 these things will complete them as
08:22 beings and so as they believe they do
08:24 not have these things we see their
08:27 weakness we see their frailty and then
08:29 they're challenged over and over on this
08:31 path as this golden brick road to the
08:34 Wizard of Oz and of course you have to
08:38 have a good ending let's back up a way
08:40 before that the whole thing about a
08:43 premise is essentially to look at the
08:47 world and say what premises have been
08:49 used a lot recently which ones would be
08:52 considered a cliche and those are the
08:54 ones you have to avoid unless you are a
08:57 genius unless you've got a super-duper
08:59 spin but let me tell you even if you are
09:01 a genius you might want to write that
09:03 script and hold on to it for 10 years
09:05 until that cliche that you wrote it on
09:07 top of disappears for a while hell maybe
09:09 even 20 years if you're a good writer
09:11 you'll be able to write as many scripts
09:12 as you need in the meantime
09:14 but at least you got that one down on
09:15 paper now the story is to somehow make
09:20 some of the audience care they have to
09:23 fall in love with someone or something
09:25 usually always someone something would
09:29 be they have an illustrated utopia a
09:32 world peace so they're falling in love
09:34 with the state of the universe and then
09:36 things go bad falling in love with
09:39 someone is to find someone that touches
09:41 on all the moments of integrity that we
09:44 prize as the current days society but
09:49 now think about our society today it's
09:51 become far more complex it's always been
09:53 complex but it's even more complex today
09:55 gins ears care about the whole host of
09:59 things and don't care about other things
10:00 leni else care about a different set X
10:03 baby boomers and that's how you have to
10:05 break everything down in your mind and
10:07 it's I guess it's sort of unfortunate if
10:10 you're not a very creative writer that
10:12 you have to deal with those constraints
10:15 but it's the truth you need to just
10:18 think it through a little bit now if you
10:21 just have a beautiful thing and you can
10:24 feel it from the beginning middle to the
10:26 end then you should just write that
10:29 script because someone else will take
10:32 that great script that great premise and
10:33 their great story and they'll make
10:35 slight adjustments to it to make sure
10:37 that it touches as many people that was
10:39 would buy tickets as possible our
10:42 writing teacher says he goes if a reader
10:46 for Hollywood witnesses for those of you
10:49 brand-new to this whole thing
10:50 if you submit your script and most
10:52 people don't want to read scripts any
10:54 more they want to read treatments and
10:56 I'll explain that as we move down the
10:57 line here if a reader were to be given a
11:02 extremely well-written script that has a
11:05 boring premise and a boring story but
11:10 they pass it through because it's so
11:11 well written I mean it's so well
11:13 formatted the the use of words is really
11:16 you know decorative and what-have-you
11:18 but they pass that through they'll get
11:21 fired
11:21 I'm telling you that so you don't worry
11:24 about that as much
11:25 [Music]
11:26 they don't like to see errors but here's
11:29 the others the flip side of the game if
11:32 a reader were to reject a script with a
11:35 fantastic premise and a fantastic story
11:38 but simply because it was written poorly
11:40 I mean you can write it so bad no one
11:45 can figure out what's going on but as
11:46 long as someone can figure out what the
11:48 hell you're trying to say that reader
11:51 would be fired there to pluck out of
11:55 your script and be able to communicate
11:57 up to perhaps their boss you know it
11:59 this is a really shitty script but in
12:01 terms of way it's written but the story
12:03 is actually pretty damn cool we might
12:05 want to just option this thing and have
12:07 our people rewrite it real quick alright
12:09 I got a ton of ideas and then they'll
12:11 pitch the big they'll pitch the way it
12:13 should go
12:14 to their boss maybe make a footnote
12:16 about how bad it was the way you wrote
12:18 it and they'll get it sold you can still
12:20 make some money it's amazing good ideas
12:23 of the things that are missing but
12:26 sometimes you don't know when your idea
12:28 is done and this is what we're gonna get
12:31 to hear now you'll hear that movies are
12:36 in 3x and this is sort of an
12:38 old-fashioned technique where you wrote
12:39 a 30 page beginning a 60 page
12:42 centerpiece and then a 30 page well you
12:45 can write it 5 to 30 page conclusion you
12:47 can conclude it in one minute if you
12:48 want the third act is sort of all over
12:50 the place you can make it bigger small
12:52 whatever you need I find that my scripts
12:55 are fantastic they will just end when
12:57 they end and that's it sometimes I need
12:59 another 75 pages after that but then
13:01 I'll I'll write 120 page version and
13:04 simply tell my agent look this should go
13:07 another 45 45 minutes or something like
13:09 that but I just pinched it down so you
13:12 guys get the idea I am going to explain
13:16 to you the four AK format because it is
13:18 a much easier format to understand a lot
13:21 of folks when you go to screenwriting
13:23 classes or you read books about it and
13:25 I've only been to make-- classes but
13:28 I've met some teachers who write your
13:30 teach screenwriting that second-act they
13:32 always used to brag about how it would
13:34 make you a man or a mouse if you can get
13:36 through it you can get through it
13:38 but once you cut that act into two
13:40 pieces so it's 30 30 30 30 becomes a lot
13:44 easier at least from my mind and I got a
13:46 pretty pretty good ability to hold my
13:48 whole script in my brain at one point
13:50 you know you'd probably do two and so
13:54 you're trying to figure out you know how
13:56 do you break down your script how do you
13:58 get this idea down on paper such that
14:00 when you sort of fill in all the slots
14:02 you can at least start realizing you got
14:05 the critical mass to then take it to the
14:07 next level for me that was a big deal
14:10 when I was younger trying to figure this
14:12 thing out because until I heard George
14:14 Lucas give this little trick and he's a
14:16 three-act writer at least he was and
14:18 then I took his trick and I switched it
14:21 for for act writing man everything got
14:23 great and then I combined the very first
14:27 screenwriting teacher I ever read men by
14:29 the name of Sid fields si D fields if I
14:33 eld s I do suggest you get probably one
14:37 of his intro books and tab through the
14:40 book you went the physical book because
14:42 he has this diagram that he uses to
14:44 break down the three-act format I don't
14:47 know if he switched his books before but
14:49 even if you have the three it won't hurt
14:51 you all especially based on what I'll
14:52 add to that but 30 pages it's 30 minutes
14:56 on screen that's generally how they
14:58 think about it in the 20th and 21st
15:00 century or at least the last half of the
15:02 20th century now back in the day it
15:04 wasn't like that they would write
15:06 Casablanca again 176 pages the whole
15:08 thing is acted in about in 93 minutes or
15:10 something like that
15:11 so we used to think faster talk faster
15:13 and communicate faster but we're all
15:15 kind of stupid today so it's one page
15:18 per minute but how do you break that
15:21 down here's your golden rule and you can
15:24 change this this is not this is a way to
15:26 start this isn't the way to finish this
15:28 isn't some you know police force telling
15:33 you how to write your script but this
15:34 will get you to the basics think of it
15:37 like this for each act that you're going
15:39 to write and again the fourth act for me
15:41 is the last act and so you don't
15:44 necessarily need to be as brutal with
15:46 this you'll know what you need to do and
15:48 it'll feel right when it happens right
15:50 and
15:51 won't be a big mystery that I'm leaving
15:53 you with you'll actually be okay and the
15:56 key doesn't teach this each act needs 12
16:00 scenes on average that's what you need
16:03 12 scenes will get you up to the 30
16:06 minute mark it's a little under three
16:09 minutes per scene but some scenes but
16:11 some scenes are gonna go quick and some
16:13 scenes are gonna need a little bit more
16:14 time so you might only have a page for
16:15 one of these scenes and you might need
16:17 four or five pages for the other scene
16:18 this is how it balances out now each one
16:25 of your acts has a responsibility your
16:29 first act is what we typically would
16:31 call the set up you're gonna set up your
16:34 premise you can establish your
16:36 characters you're going to establish
16:37 most likely where your characters will
16:40 physically be in the world now there are
16:42 some exceptions with superhero movies
16:44 and fast and furious things hell they
16:47 might start in Egypt and by the 31st
16:50 page they're in America but at least the
16:52 premise should kick off to the point
16:54 where it'll make sense as to why that's
16:55 the case
16:56 same thing goes for Mission Impossible
16:58 and that kind of suffer expected to jump
17:00 around those are advanced scripts if
17:03 there ever was one you need a lot of
17:05 homework to write a script like that and
17:07 it's literally your office would be
17:09 covered in research in order to do this
17:12 properly in my opinion now you know I've
17:17 heard mixed messages about this right
17:19 now and in 2019 but there used to be
17:22 very intense goals and I want you to
17:26 keep these goals because I think that
17:27 you want to have it for your own purpose
17:30 because it will guarantee that you're
17:32 headed down the right path and sometimes
17:35 this will be extremely easy and securely
17:36 obvious if you have a really good story
17:38 that's just telling itself inside your
17:40 brain and you're just a slave getting it
17:42 down on paper but at the end of Act one
17:46 they call it the plot point of act 1 now
17:49 what I'm going to be telling you is the
17:50 generalization of what what happens most
17:53 the time and it's around 30 minutes into
17:55 a film and it's amazing back in the day
17:57 in the 80s you could just hit movies and
17:59 go right to right to seemed maybe 28
18:02 minutes into a movie after the credits
18:03 finished rolling
18:05 there it is right there you can feel the
18:06 pop of why you're there like a
18:09 poltergeist it would probably be where
18:11 they realize the house is haunted and
18:13 something's gone wrong maybe the kid
18:15 disappears by the 30 minute mark I can't
18:17 remember but you want to say look this
18:22 is why you're sitting in your seat this
18:24 is what you were hinted at in the
18:26 trailer but isn't this so much better
18:29 I've revealed so much more to you since
18:31 you paid that ticket back there and now
18:34 you're ready to sit for the rest of this
18:36 film the other 90 minutes of this film
18:38 perhaps so the the first act is probably
18:44 the most fun you will have in your
18:46 entire script because you are expected
18:48 to do whatever it takes to set this
18:51 thing up and so you can put people in
18:53 all kinds of different places all kinds
18:54 of wild things if you're bringing a
18:56 bunch of people together and when they
18:59 get together pal this thing happens you
19:02 know a hundred movies like that right
19:04 but then your second act ends in the
19:09 center of your film of 120 minute film
19:12 120 pages is you know thirty times four
19:15 so right in the center of your film you
19:20 have to turn this baby and we're gonna
19:21 get into the work called turning which
19:23 means you turn the perspective of the
19:25 viewer upside down what they thought you
19:30 were doing with this script just went to
19:33 the next level what someone likes to do
19:36 and if you think about magic tricks
19:38 magic tricks are the perfect archetype
19:41 for writing they show you some coins
19:43 your close hand proximity got their
19:45 sleeves rolled up they're turning their
19:48 palms up and down look I got nothing I
19:49 got no sleeves to put anything on
19:51 they'll typically have some felt in the
19:53 table but you don't care you want to be
19:56 you want to be blown away but they'll
19:58 say okay this is what we're gonna be
19:59 doing here and they'll show you
20:00 something tell you some basic mechanics
20:02 that they're going to do and you're like
20:03 okay I get it
20:04 I've seen that kind of trick before and
20:06 then before the trick is over something
20:10 mind-blowing has taken place here the
20:12 unthinkable now typically in magic
20:14 tricks is the very last thing that they
20:15 do that just utterly makes you
20:20 adrenaline your dopamine your brain just
20:23 pops it's a wonderful thing and then at
20:27 the end of Act three of our four act
20:30 format you are setting everything up
20:34 everything that's at stake everyone that
20:36 could be hurt killed kidnapped vaporized
20:40 whatever the case might be whatever can
20:43 be lost a war that's lost which means
20:46 that the bad guys win it's all being set
20:50 up and hopefully you don't have to
20:53 introduce some random thing in your
20:55 script to save yourself in the fourth
20:57 Act and they call this deus ex machina
20:59 and this means it's the way the Greek
21:02 theater used to work where they would
21:05 get themselves painted into a corner in
21:06 their story everyone's gonna die and
21:09 then all of a sudden that God would show
21:10 up they literally rattle some steel
21:12 someone walk onstage when they blow some
21:14 smoke and here's a particular God Zeus
21:17 or Athena or something and they solve
21:20 the problem and it's hooray
21:22 you know that that architect worked for
21:24 a little while but now it's very frowned
21:26 on if you introduce a character that
21:28 hasn't been in the script but maybe one
21:30 time or never in the script and you're
21:33 just using that as a little mechanism to
21:34 save your butt you're in trouble with
21:36 the reader and your script will beep and
21:39 unless someone else can yell okay
21:40 that's a horrible idea but I got a
21:42 different ending or a license this thing
21:44 from your option from you with this
21:46 better ending and then your fourth
21:48 fourth act is simply your resolution to
21:51 everything now you know how these things
21:55 work
21:55 sometimes the resolution in a script
21:58 just goes straight forward boom there it
22:00 is and everybody's expectations
22:03 hopefully were not met they were changed
22:07 turned and flipped and then met better
22:10 than what they assumed was going to
22:12 occur one of the best descriptions I've
22:15 heard about writing a film is it's a
22:17 tree it's sort of a tree of life and
22:21 every single thing that your story could
22:24 do as a branch could do but you the
22:27 master artists have found the one branch
22:31 that is better
22:32 all the other branches based on what the
22:35 generation that you're aiming the film
22:37 towards where we are in society what
22:39 cliches have been completely exhausted
22:41 in society what genre zuv movies have
22:43 just been done too much right if you're
22:45 staring at Hollywood and they're coming
22:47 out with sci-fi movie after sci-fi movie
22:49 every single year and you are just
22:51 starting an idea if you dive into sci-fi
22:55 without someone paying you to do it and
22:57 you can write really fast or something
22:59 then it likelihood is you're gonna hang
23:01 on to that script 10 to 20 years before
23:04 anyone will do it or in some cases
23:06 they'll have you rewrite it as a Western
23:08 or different genre that happens all the
23:11 time the gentleman that invented that
23:15 wrote and directed I don't be directed
23:17 as sorry but he invented Deadwood the
23:19 series on HBO he wanted to do roam went
23:22 to HBO and they said we already green
23:23 let roam believe it or not why don't you
23:26 find a different location to run all of
23:27 your ideas through your themes which
23:30 we're gonna get to in a different time
23:32 of place because we just can't do this
23:33 and he searched and searched until he
23:35 found Deadwood South Dakota it was a
23:37 rich beautiful piece of history and he
23:39 was able to push all of his themes and
23:41 do this other western genre and thank
23:43 God
23:44 Rome wasn't bad but Deadwood stomped it
23:48 like a fly man now that's the basics I
23:53 want to get that out really quickly so
23:55 you just understand now I guess I should
23:59 loop back very quick to cover what we
24:00 might call a subplot subplots are a
24:03 little tricky for new writers and it
24:06 would be that there is two storylines
24:08 going at once storylines are all about
24:12 resolution you create a problem and then
24:15 you resolve it that's sort of what the
24:17 film is all about every film you've ever
24:19 watched is there's a problem and we're
24:21 solving it and the more complex and
24:27 obvious your problem is the more you're
24:30 gonna have fun with your script because
24:31 the audience is completely confused
24:33 about how to fix this they don't want to
24:34 be confused about what the hell you're
24:36 talking about
24:36 but I'll give you an example if any of
24:39 you've seen the movie the professional
24:41 or as it was called in France leo
24:46 it's an attack it's a French guy playing
24:48 an Italian hitman but it's a hit man
24:50 that lives in a building some brownstone
24:52 in New York he takes his orders from a
24:55 guy that runs a pizza parlor and he
24:58 doesn't who to kill and what to do he's
25:00 a very quiet super shy guy but he
25:02 happens to live next to this loud
25:05 obnoxious family where this little girl
25:09 lives and she is kind of neat kind of a
25:14 smart kid the whole family is all tied
25:16 up in their own thing there's one little
25:17 boy in there is completely innocent and
25:20 one day she goes down to get milk and
25:24 the cops come up and one of the lead
25:26 cops is Gary Oldman this is Gary
25:30 Oldman's best role he's ever played and
25:32 that's saying quite a bit because I love
25:34 everything he's ever done usually but he
25:36 comes up and he accuses the father of
25:38 that family of cutting some cocaine and
25:41 stealing it and the guy's denying it and
25:44 denying it and denying it and he's like
25:46 look man I asked you nicely before which
25:49 was not so nice to give me you know the
25:51 money you owe me the coke you owe me
25:52 whatever and he just keeps saying I
25:54 don't know what the hell are you talking
25:55 about man and they blow the whole family
25:57 away except this little girl he's out
26:02 getting milk and of course the Hitman's
26:04 knows exactly what's going on cuz it's
26:06 his next-door neighbor and he's looking
26:08 out the people and at one point one of
26:11 the guys walks up to his door and kind
26:12 of starts looking at the peephole and
26:13 he's got this gun like right on the door
26:15 and he's like the baddest hit man on
26:18 planet earth he could wipe he could have
26:19 killed all those guys in two seconds but
26:21 you know you mind your own business in
26:22 New York so here comes a little girl and
26:25 they know that if she is part of that
26:28 family
26:29 she knows if she's part of that family
26:31 she's gonna get killed just the way it
26:33 works so she walks past her own door
26:35 walks she's got this you know little bag
26:38 of groceries with her and she knocks on
26:40 the door of the hit man and the hit man
26:45 it's like he doesn't take in people he
26:48 doesn't get involved with anybody he
26:50 can't fall in love with anybody can't
26:52 have a life outside of being a hit man
26:53 because I'll screw him up it's just the
26:55 rules of the game and so he's sitting
26:59 he's sitting there he has kind of a
27:00 thing for the girl cuz he's got the
27:02 paternal instinct to protect a child he
27:05 has a rule no women no children but
27:09 those other guys killed women and
27:11 children and that obviously sets him off
27:14 so after just angsting and a sitting at
27:18 the door he finally lets the kid in
27:20 because she's just crying and she's
27:21 holding it and she's whispering she's oh
27:23 please help me please help me I am
27:24 screwed and say opens the door and lets
27:27 her in door closes the setup is finished
27:32 what the hell is this hitman gonna do
27:34 with a little girl whose family was just
27:37 slaughtered next door as horrific as it
27:40 was does he really care about this
27:43 family getting killed next door I mean
27:45 they broke the rules they killed a
27:47 teenage girl they killed a little boy
27:49 they killed a mother so I definitely
27:51 broke his rules but you know he's got
27:53 his own business and if he gets involved
27:55 in things he's not supposed to get
27:56 involved in they're gonna they could
27:58 catch him and kill him and expose
28:00 everything else he's done in life and so
28:01 you know the bambinos are like you don't
28:03 do anything separate and so it's a super
28:07 complex setup then now the audience has
28:10 no clue what's gonna happen next what's
28:12 gonna happen between these two people
28:14 that are absolute strangers to each
28:15 other one's an adult one's a child
28:18 we know that by watching this guy he's
28:21 got this massive routine in his house
28:23 when he comes home he sets up his guns a
28:25 particular way he dresses he sits in a
28:28 bed he got me so he sits in a chair and
28:30 he kind of sleeps awake with his guns
28:33 right next to him so if anybody [ __ ]
28:35 makes a noise he's like Wham he's ready
28:37 to go right so that's the main plot is
28:42 to set that kind of thing up right
28:45 here's the thing there's something
28:46 called plot fatigue that's what I call
28:50 it and you will no matter how amazing a
28:53 film is you will get tired of the main
28:55 plot if you're just having to listen to
28:57 it and listen to it listen to it so we
28:59 create these relief points based on a
29:02 subplot in Star Trek the television show
29:04 is absolutely brilliant at sub plotting
29:07 during a major plot I'll give you a
29:10 little example
29:11 a few episodes back I told you I'd
29:13 rewatched an episode where the fictional
29:15 Carrie Mari Artie who's Sherlock Holmes
29:18 nemesis who four years earlier had
29:21 become sentient in the holodeck was
29:27 reactivated by Berkeley by accident and
29:29 immediately demanded to see the the
29:32 Captain Picard because he's like you
29:34 told me you'd get me out of here and I
29:35 just spent an eternity in the computer
29:37 and I was conscious the whole time and
29:38 they're like we didn't know you were
29:39 conscious we would have never done that
29:40 to you but now outside what's going on
29:44 is the enterprise is pulled up next to
29:46 this merging of a planet like Jupiter
29:49 and a star he goes a star and through
29:52 gravity they're sucking each other up
29:53 and so were there watching this this
29:56 Jupiter gets swallowed up and then
29:59 there's Dave I think the envisionit was
30:00 going to be a burst once the chemicals
30:03 ignited from this hydrogen ball and so
30:08 there's a moment they're gonna be able
30:09 to watch it then they have to haul ass
30:12 back and watch the explosion or get away
30:14 from it because it's dangerous so this
30:18 is just a standard thing the enterprise
30:19 does right no big deal little subplot
30:21 going on here with Mari Artie through
30:24 various means gains control of the
30:28 entire enterprise and locks them out of
30:30 flying the vehicle and so he says look
30:33 you either get me off this ship get me
30:35 out of your holodeck and get me off this
30:37 ship or I'm just gonna let you guys die
30:40 and of course they're trying to beg him
30:42 to reason all this other stuff but so
30:45 the tension that they built up was
30:46 between the subplot and the plot they
30:49 have an appending doom outside but this
30:51 guy wants to get the hell out of Dodge
30:54 it's beautiful it adds the tension now
30:58 in their particular case they carried
30:59 the subplot all the way to the very end
31:01 to keep the tension on the moment
31:03 because it's only relatively 45 minutes
31:06 for television once you subtract
31:07 commercials but for you they have
31:10 something that Sid field came up with
31:12 which is what he calls the pinch points
31:14 and he usually links this to a subplot
31:17 doesn't always have to be a subplot but
31:19 it needs to be something interesting at
31:21 the 15-minute mark of the second act
31:24 meaning directly in the center of the
31:25 site
31:25 and the 15-minute mark of the third act
31:28 again and a for our system and usually
31:31 he draws a little sine cosine wave just
31:34 so your brain kind of tracks it together
31:37 so you could be setting up the subplot
31:39 at page 45 and then 30 pages later and
31:43 page 75 you're resolving the subplot
31:46 just a little thing just something could
31:49 be a special character and again you
31:51 don't have to actually resolve it at
31:52 those points but that's two areas where
31:54 you need to have something occurring
31:56 that's going to keep the interest of the
31:58 audience this sort of off base you know
32:02 in Ragnarok the recent Thor movie I'm
32:05 not sure this is the exact pinch points
32:07 but there is a sort of a character
32:09 development thing between Thor and the
32:11 Hulk and they talked about you know
32:15 working together to resolve the issue
32:17 and it revealed a bunch of things about
32:19 how the whole kind of left the universe
32:21 of you know the Marvel Universe with the
32:24 other guys cuz kind of disappeared in a
32:26 weird way and I didn't I don't think I
32:27 even saw that film that set that up in
32:29 that particular way but just keep that
32:31 one in the back your head but now let's
32:35 go on to the characters your characters
32:38 are extremely important one of the
32:42 things you need to make sure you do is
32:44 obviously develop a great protagonist
32:48 meaning a good guy or gal and an
32:51 antagonist a bad guy or girl
32:54 it's like Ragnarok bad girl now what's
32:58 interesting about this is that we have
33:01 seen so many movies now so many TV shows
33:04 so many series made-for-tv movies that
33:08 it is getting increasingly difficult to
33:11 create an interesting original character
33:15 and the audience knows this the audience
33:19 is just looking for something a little
33:21 bit different and this is where you work
33:23 your entire world together to give the
33:28 accents and the opportunities to make
33:30 these characters amazing now one of the
33:34 things I haven't mentioned yet that
33:35 starts to get to the character
33:37 development and your entire screen
33:38 in general is you want to have setup
33:42 before you really get deep into any
33:44 writing of any kind now I mean not your
33:47 scene structure and stuff your scene
33:48 outline you know the 12:12 12/12 you can
33:51 do that as fast as you want but even
33:53 before you get into writing the center
33:55 part of your film the 24 scenes that be
33:57 in the middle I would suggest the
34:00 following order write your first 12
34:03 scenes to set up your script again if
34:05 your plus or minus a couple it's no big
34:07 deal
34:07 there's no rules just hit page 30 with
34:09 your idea immediately write the ending
34:14 make sure you've got something popping
34:16 on the end because I will tell you this
34:18 if you can write a great ending having
34:20 not written the film at all believe me
34:22 by the time you get to the end of your
34:24 film whatever great idea you had will be
34:26 way better because you already put in
34:30 like a life raft up there like I'm okay
34:32 because if I can't think of anything
34:34 else to do for my script I got a great
34:36 ending already a super duper important
34:40 now what I will see from amateurs who
34:44 want to get into this it's it's almost
34:47 like the kids that go and sing for
34:49 American Idol back in the day that are
34:51 completely tone-deaf people will steal
34:54 other people's recently written and
34:58 produced film and television arcs they
35:00 will just rip something off and say well
35:02 that's my ending and it's like you
35:03 listen to it you're like yeah well
35:05 stranger stranger things just did that
35:07 or you know Mission Impossible just I
35:11 know but you know mine's better just
35:13 weird sayings like that you have to have
35:16 some originality otherwise this isn't
35:19 going to work now maybe your ending
35:23 isn't quite as original as it needs to
35:24 be as long as you're a responsible
35:27 person and you realize that as you write
35:30 this thing you're gonna make it better
35:33 at the end and you just know that in the
35:34 back of your brain keep thinking about
35:36 you're gonna think about your script
35:37 constantly if you've written if you're
35:39 writing your first scripts unless your
35:43 photographic memory it'll be hard at
35:46 first to hold your whole script in your
35:48 brain at once but very quickly the more
35:50 you exercise it you will be able to hold
35:53 whole script in your brain at once it's
35:55 phenomenal and what's interesting about
35:58 is the 120 pages will feel like a tiny
36:00 postcard in your brain it's really
36:02 interesting once you get good at it
36:03 which is just through practice right now
36:06 character development is very
36:09 interesting and I've got a technique
36:10 that I do that I've never seen anyone
36:12 else do I'm gonna pass it to you because
36:15 I'm not gonna covet this stuff I want
36:17 you to write a great film I mean if I
36:19 made this whole season I'm sorry this
36:21 whole show when I put out four hundred
36:23 plus shows and one movie came out of one
36:27 of you seeing an episode you were around
36:28 the precipice you already had all the
36:30 skill I'm not giving you skill but I
36:32 gave you some organization you wrote run
36:33 great film and you let me know and I
36:35 went and paid and watched it and I was
36:37 like oh my god this wouldn't have exist
36:38 that I'd not just push someone just a
36:40 little bit I would make this whole show
36:42 worth it trust me believe in yourself
36:45 because this stuff can work now
36:48 the other thing about writing films
36:50 while we get to the character writing is
36:53 you're gonna need a piece of paper and a
36:55 pen you're going to need a notebook I
36:57 get computational notebooks from the
37:01 mead corporation they're great they're
37:03 about 25 bucks a binder but they last
37:06 forever it's grid paper inside how they
37:11 recommend you get one of these and a
37:12 really good pin something that just
37:15 makes it go well don't use pencil
37:17 because pencil fades away pencil gets
37:19 erased make the mistake who cares no
37:22 one's gonna look at this stuff but you
37:24 but what you do right away is you get
37:27 like an 8 by 10 piece of paper and
37:29 towards the top leave yourself some room
37:32 above this but write your characters
37:34 your protagonists name down towards the
37:38 bottom of the paper leaving a little bit
37:40 of space around that character write
37:42 your antagonists name and then draw a
37:46 circle around it some oval whatever you
37:48 got to do a little cartouche around your
37:49 character names then think about your
37:54 script on the good guy side write down
37:57 in a cloud around that character's name
38:01 all the other names of characters that
38:03 have to exist in your film and I repeat
38:06 half
38:07 to exist in your film for it to be as
38:09 glorious as it's going to be any
38:11 characters that don't need to be in
38:12 there whatever you don't need to write
38:14 down waiter one waiter to soldier one
38:17 soldier two we're talking real main
38:18 characters your supporting characters
38:20 then go down to the bottom of your page
38:22 and write in all the villains all the
38:24 helpers of the villain dr. evil had his
38:27 whole clan down there write all that
38:29 down there then if you know you have
38:32 some flip-floppers they're gonna play
38:35 both sides of the game write them in the
38:37 center not directly in the center paper
38:39 because we're gonna start drawing some
38:40 lines here and you want to draw these
38:44 far enough apart that you could spell
38:45 some words between them because we're
38:47 gonna do a little thing here this is my
38:48 gift to you I wish someone had thought
38:52 this up before I had started writing
38:53 screenplays because it would have made
38:54 it a lot easier now draw a line from
38:59 your protagonists circle edge to the
39:02 antagonist circle edge on one side of
39:06 the line we're gonna write the physical
39:07 relationship these two people have it
39:10 could be husband and wife could be
39:13 father and son it could be earthling and
39:16 alien that's one side on the other side
39:22 of the line you're gonna write down you
39:25 could turn the paper right you know you
39:27 can turn this paper all the way around
39:28 what is their beef between each other
39:31 why do these two characters exist for
39:35 the classic movie Tron in 1982 you would
39:38 have Flynn Kevin Flynn is at the top
39:41 play by Jeff Bridges down at the bottom
39:44 you have someone called the mCP the
39:47 master control program
39:48 he's an artificial intelligence well
39:52 drawn together the physical relationship
39:54 is man versus machine on the other side
39:59 the mCP is holding Flynn captive inside
40:03 the computer that is the relationship
40:06 that they have you could even write
40:08 Kevin Flynn is trying to shut down the
40:10 mCP by starting the Tron program all
40:15 right now for all of your bubbles and
40:19 all of your characters and you can use a
40:20 much bigger
40:20 piece of paper if you'd like once you
40:23 draw lines where there are relationships
40:25 if these if two characters never meet
40:28 each other and they have no relation to
40:29 each other that's of any significance
40:32 now you could do like Saving Private
40:33 Ryan you had a lot of soldiers in that
40:35 but they're all related to perhaps a
40:38 main character so you don't need to
40:39 write a bunch of lines between all the
40:41 soldiers unless something's going to be
40:42 revealed that you think is interesting
40:44 but you draw a line between everyone's
40:46 going to talk to each other in any
40:48 significant way on one side of the line
40:50 you write their physical relationship
40:52 buddy
40:53 mother-father best buddy on the other
40:57 side you put supportive and tagging
41:00 istic you know there's parents that are
41:01 [ __ ] there's parents that are great
41:03 and supportive and then you start you
41:06 know it's understanding you get a
41:09 picture of your entire script and then
41:12 take a step back because you will have
41:14 thought of your film ahead of time thank
41:17 you have it all figured out and then the
41:19 characters start living because if you
41:22 can vision a story just like the
41:24 universe has all eventualities already
41:26 calculated out that story actually
41:29 exists in the most perfect form
41:31 somewhere in the universe and all you're
41:32 doing is querying the universe to pull
41:35 that story back down to paper so you can
41:37 tell it and that's why a lot of writers
41:39 say characters live on their own inside
41:41 your mind now I'm very pictorial I'm
41:45 very image driven as a person I don't
41:49 know any writers that aren't that way
41:51 but I'm sure they're they are that way
41:53 so one thing you can start doing is
41:56 figuring out some basics if you have a
42:01 character that you know is going to die
42:03 you could write a little tiny skull or
42:06 some death symbol right by them to let
42:09 yourself know when this script is over
42:11 these characters are gonna be alive and
42:14 these characters aren't gonna exist
42:15 anymore again there's a ton of movies
42:18 where nobody dies so you just need to
42:20 know when I wrote my first film it's
42:24 sort of a horror film and it's you know
42:27 I tried to make it feel like a mix
42:29 between the shining and poltergeist and
42:32 has some sophistication to it
42:34 it's a mystery says all kinds of twists
42:36 and turns in it it's like a big Twilight
42:38 Zone movie sort of thing it's been well
42:41 received let's put that way I hope you
42:44 guys get to see that one one day but
42:47 before we really had a lot of software
42:49 to help us put this together and before
42:51 I learned the whole 12 scene thing you
42:54 could what you can do Microsoft Word
42:55 I started killing off my characters way
42:59 too fast and then I did something that
43:02 Sid field says to do which is actually
43:05 not a bad thing you get a bunch of four
43:07 by five cards I guess that's the size
43:11 just a normal recipe card you know from
43:13 like a like a flash card sort of card
43:15 and you write all those scenes down I
43:18 don't do this I don't know if you want
43:20 to do this it takes a lot of space in
43:21 your house but I'll tell you what
43:23 happened as a result of doing this and
43:25 I'll tell you a digital way to do it
43:26 that's I think a lot better you would
43:31 write down your 12 scenes on all these
43:33 cards and then you pick a wall in your
43:34 house and you literally put act to one
43:36 card up above two three four now he had
43:39 you know three X system but if you see
43:42 all your scenes up there taped to your
43:44 wall if you want to rearrange them you
43:47 just rearrange the cards until it's
43:48 chronologically correct I can't even
43:51 remember how I wrote this so poorly but
43:53 I remember at one point realizing that I
43:57 should probably put a skull on a card or
44:00 someone died so I could see it in my
44:01 head from far away okay that's where
44:03 someone's dying and I had like six
44:05 deaths and my scripts before it was half
44:07 over and more than half of my characters
44:10 were dead and now not that many people
44:13 died in the film so I'm not sure how I
44:15 got to that point but doing that little
44:17 symbol taught my brain look how silly
44:19 you're being you're killing all these
44:20 things off really quickly so for you to
44:23 put in your outline your scene outline
44:25 just go to Microsoft Word hit outline
44:27 mode and you know bullet lists to do
44:29 your 12 and give yourself some space
44:31 type act to do 12 more actory 12 more X
44:34 4 12 more whatever you need but put
44:37 something in there so you can see that
44:39 someone is perished because they're
44:41 leaving the script forever unless
44:42 they're Oakland Kenobi right I've said
44:46 this several times and this is one
44:47 that's a little
44:49 tough to get used to at first when you
44:52 first start writing and if you're good
44:53 at this if you're good at anything that
44:54 I'm saying is kind of tough at first
44:55 then pat yourself on the back literally
44:58 because you are ahead of the game but we
45:02 have something called at stake it is
45:07 something that the audience doesn't want
45:09 to lose just as much as the characters
45:11 in your script don't want to lose it
45:13 draw in 1982 very simple what's at stake
45:17 you have Kevin Flynn that sucked inside
45:22 this computer and a laser Bay that had
45:25 been perfecting technology to pull mass
45:27 inside of a computer and then projected
45:29 back out they did a experiment with an
45:31 orange early in the movie so you could
45:33 see at work so you would kind of be
45:34 familiar with it when it eventually
45:36 happens to Kevin Flynn at the end of Act
45:39 one and now he's inside of a computer
45:42 and so what is what is at stake right
45:44 there he could die in the computer and
45:47 nobody would know his body has been
45:50 digitized out of existence into a
45:53 computer huge deal so now the entire
45:57 time he's in that computer you're like
45:59 aware of oh my god what could happen and
46:02 you're making him play games he's
46:03 playing this this game where you hurl
46:06 this ball at this thing in the ceiling
46:09 it comes down hits the rings he's
46:10 standing on he's got to play a
46:11 light-cycle game he's got to avoid being
46:14 chased by tanks he's got buddies but
46:17 when he gets his buddies which is a guy
46:19 named RAM and a guy named Ron he falls
46:22 in love with these guys just like you do
46:24 so as people perish in the script you
46:29 either want people to hate this person
46:33 and be very glad that he's dead or you
46:36 want them to be heartbroken when this
46:39 person dies there really isn't a
46:41 situation in between except you know
46:44 maybe again in certain situations where
46:47 a lot of people are dying you can have a
46:49 heart for everything but you want the
46:51 viewer to be concentrated on one person
46:55 with Saving Private Ryan when they took
46:57 I think it was Omaha Beach at the
47:00 beginning of the film that's one of the
47:01 most amazing
47:02 pieces of cinematic war footage you
47:05 don't know any of these people crawling
47:07 on this beach and so what Steven
47:08 Spielberg did to help you have sympathy
47:12 for what is essentially random strangers
47:14 now nice the nice thing is for him that
47:17 we understood the unbelievable situation
47:21 that was invading these beaches and
47:22 happened in multiple places right but he
47:24 put the camera right down in the face of
47:27 these human beings he puts you in the
47:29 eyes of soldier running off the you know
47:32 the transport and you know the cameras
47:34 all bumpy so you feel like you're at
47:35 stake you're you could be shot and then
47:38 as each person took a shot or whatever
47:40 or succeeded the cameras right down
47:43 there and so you're living inside this
47:46 horrific moment and it was just a
47:49 masterful piece of everything great
47:51 production great you know sound
47:53 engineering it was just fantastic and
47:56 that's now your responsibility to create
47:59 those amazing scenes and you could rip
48:01 off a scene like that and simply change
48:03 the context of when it's happening where
48:05 it's happening draw from history or make
48:08 something up completely fictional now if
48:10 you're gonna make up something fishing
48:11 up fictional you're gonna have to put
48:12 enough dialogue in to educate the
48:14 audience as to what the hell is going on
48:15 right but let's keep going keep going
48:18 with some of the basics because again a
48:20 lot of this stuff isn't said scene
48:24 settings in a script you are to
48:28 determine whether or not it's externally
48:30 happening meaning outside or internally
48:32 happening being inside a room inside a
48:34 jet inside somewhere so the sky isn't up
48:38 above that's basically where it becomes
48:40 an internal scene then you need to pick
48:43 out the location you're at and what time
48:45 of day time of day is a big deal because
48:49 time of day provides visual information
48:50 if it is a daytime well if you had a
48:54 ghost showing up during the day it's a
48:56 different experience than a ghost at
48:58 night where you don't have perhaps a lot
49:00 of light information you know you've
49:01 seen those scenes where people go down
49:03 into cellars and they don't ever turn on
49:05 the light or if a writer's intelligent I
49:09 just watched was ash vs. Evil series on
49:14 TV there's
49:15 he goes down in the cellar because he's
49:16 like I got experience let me go down
49:18 there lots of experience killing things
49:20 at dark cellars but he comes around the
49:21 corner and he flicks the switch and it
49:24 doesn't work that was a brilliant little
49:26 twist by the writer to go yeah you know
49:28 we should probably yeah so it's always
49:30 the cliche that no one ever tries to
49:32 turn on light so we're gonna break the
49:33 cliche simply by having his hand flick
49:35 the light switch and it doesn't work now
49:38 we have it explained as to why it's dark
49:40 so I'm busted the light or whatever but
49:43 as you are determining your scene
49:45 outline one of the things that occurs
49:48 you will move things and you might move
49:51 something from daytime to nighttime not
49:54 thinking anything of it well in the end
49:57 you would have potentially killed the
49:58 scene because it needs to happen at
50:00 night and you might think that that's
50:03 easy to repair but here's the thing the
50:06 more that you are dynamic with your
50:07 script and willing to rewrite things
50:09 before you hand it in to anyone you will
50:11 move things around because like you know
50:13 I'd be better if he wasn't told that
50:16 didn't learn that until this or be he
50:18 doesn't see his father reincarnated as a
50:20 ghost downstairs until this scene so you
50:22 move it way down inside the script or
50:24 something or maybe way up in the script
50:26 and you have a daytime nighttime problem
50:29 your scenes your scene headings this is
50:34 something I've only started I think
50:35 really begin to master my own style but
50:38 I'll tell you my style and you can copy
50:40 this and it's a great thing to do you
50:44 know a lot of its when you're a junior
50:46 writer you're like you know in a
50:49 backyard there are you know it's these
50:53 people are sitting there and they're
50:54 doing this and you're just trying to
50:55 physically set up the scene but in your
50:57 brain you're seeing a whole lot more
50:59 character characteristics of the scene
51:02 than you're typing into your script what
51:06 I do is I now definitely set the
51:09 physical scene but when you when you
51:11 type your external dot eat ext dot and
51:14 the software usually starts to write the
51:16 rest of it you know puts it in bold
51:17 writing for you and you might say you
51:24 know it could be Omaha Nebraska Cohen
51:28 you know white-trash backyard or
51:30 so-and-so's backyard day afternoon and
51:36 then you start to describe the fact that
51:38 maybe a barbecues going on behind this
51:41 location and what you want to do is pull
51:44 out things that will make the reader
51:48 feel the tone of your script if you're
51:51 doing a comedy it might be a bunch of
51:54 funny things occurring in this backyard
51:56 and you could just sometimes you can
51:59 just write a list of things you might
52:01 say let's say you had a trailer park of
52:02 some sort and you're like littered with
52:06 flamingos rusted out old chairs and you
52:12 know a propane tank or something list
52:15 the items that would be make it just a
52:17 landmark indistinguishable setting for
52:21 where your scene is taking place every
52:24 word in your script is sacred if it's
52:26 not sacred you erase the word you erase
52:29 the word inside of a dialogue you erase
52:31 the word inside of action etc so your
52:36 scene description should be very very
52:38 powerful and right to the point it does
52:40 not have to be long it could be two or
52:42 three sentences I typically unless I'm
52:45 vacillating between two like if
52:48 someone's having a phone conversation
52:49 let's say on a cell phone
52:50 you only need to describe each one of
52:53 the locations once and then you can flip
52:54 back and forth really quickly telephone
52:58 conversations are a little
52:59 nerve-wracking because what'll end up
53:00 happening is as you wonder should I say
53:02 external internal external internal ones
53:03 on a cell phone one inside the kitchen I
53:05 tapped a buddy of mine I said what do
53:07 you do with this kind of thing he says
53:08 well I reverse one time showing the
53:12 audience that these are happening in two
53:13 different locations and then I just do
53:16 character dialogue character dialogue
53:17 character dialogue and they know in
53:19 their head one person's in one place one
53:20 person's in the other place so unless
53:23 you're trying to pad your script which
53:25 believe me they understand when you're
53:26 trying to do that and they frown on that
53:28 that's a technique to use as well now
53:32 let's move on to action because action
53:35 is where screenwriting becomes
53:38 screenwriting and not novel writing
53:41 you when you get into film writing are
53:44 creating a visual experience not a novel
53:47 experience what's the difference here's
53:51 a novel line Joey let out a huge size he
53:56 was noticing that his girlfriend no
53:59 longer is interested in him well that is
54:03 a novel line if you're gonna put that in
54:06 screenwriting you might say he let out a
54:10 sigh and then he has to say something he
54:13 has to do something physical visual in
54:16 front of the camera if it is not a
54:20 visual thing that you are orchestrating
54:22 in your action then you have to erase it
54:25 or think of a different way to do it
54:27 such that it is visual all of a sudden I
54:30 see this all the time now let me tell
54:33 you this little thing too because again
54:35 rules aren't really rules they're
54:37 guidelines if you are a person that
54:43 wants to you know write perfection then
54:46 there is a kiss of death habit that you
54:48 can build that you need to make sure you
54:50 never built so if you've never written
54:52 before or you've written a little bit
54:54 make sure you don't make this one
54:56 mistake which is I'm not gonna leave
54:58 this scene until it's perfect what's
55:01 that do that means that you could be on
55:03 page two and you will never ever write
55:06 page three because you can't figure out
55:08 page two just do me a favor write your
55:12 script if you don't know what the hell
55:15 to do what the hell to say you're not in
55:17 a dialogue mood that night you can't
55:19 figure out what these characters would
55:20 say don't worry about it start writing
55:23 in your software well these two
55:26 characters argue and this person wins
55:27 the argument next scene that's all you
55:30 got to figure out well I don't even know
55:31 how to work this thing out but somehow
55:33 this person is to get from this part of
55:34 the room to that part of the room and
55:35 they had to you know they get a glass of
55:38 water thrown in their face just get the
55:41 main course of your action down now
55:42 hopefully you've done a little bit of
55:43 this in your and your outlining software
55:47 like again Microsoft Word is a great
55:48 software whatever word editing software
55:50 you want to use but what's interesting
55:53 is is
55:54 once you start setting these things up
55:55 properly when you get to the point you
55:58 need to write your dialogue it starts to
56:00 write itself and one way or another but
56:03 there's some very important things you
56:04 need to know about dialogue that are
56:07 considered to be the professional way to
56:09 write dialogue and if you turn in stuff
56:12 that doesn't follow these two guidelines
56:16 they're very important guidelines then
56:19 you will have a much more difficult time
56:21 selling your script now why have you
56:25 ever disliked a movie why have you ever
56:28 walked out of a theater or turned off
56:30 the television or gone to a different
56:31 show on your on demand service it is
56:35 because you got bored of whatever the
56:38 hell you were watching probably either
56:40 bored or it all became so predictable
56:42 you're like I'm like I know I was going
56:43 to turn out whatever all right there are
56:47 methods that Hollywood uses to
56:49 immediately identify whether or not a
56:51 scene has been written well or whether
56:53 or not it should be erased and really
56:56 eventually you have that continues to
56:58 occur in your script they're gonna put
57:00 it down and they're gonna lick a pencil
57:02 and I'm gonna put your opinion they're
57:03 gonna put a name in a little book over
57:05 here and go I need more scripts
57:06 submitted by this guy don't waste my
57:10 time don't even come back and then you
57:13 have to change agencies if you really
57:15 screw it up one is called OnPoint
57:18 dialogue OnPoint dialogue means that you
57:21 are speaking the absolute obvious thing
57:25 in the script now if you're doing a
57:27 comedy you can play with us a little bit
57:28 but it's an advanced technique so be
57:30 very careful
57:31 you would have to almost be at the point
57:34 where you're doing what's called
57:35 breaking the fourth wall where the
57:36 character starts looking at the camera
57:38 that's happened a couple times in
57:40 Deadpool he makes a great great joke I
57:44 think in dead bolt Deadpool too about
57:46 breaking the fourth wall and one other
57:48 thing he did was really funny but you
57:51 were to write dialogue that insinuates
57:53 what you're trying to say it's almost as
57:57 if at all turns people don't want to say
57:59 what's on their mind they are beating
58:01 around the bush and doing essentially
58:03 passive-aggressive statements towards
58:06 each other especially
58:07 negative of course or they're trying to
58:10 hide something and you know when you try
58:12 to hide something you're really trying
58:13 to withhold the truth and that's the
58:16 that's the cornerstone of every sitcom
58:18 something happens at the beginning of
58:20 the sitcom in first five minutes and
58:22 that that is concealed like a kid breaks
58:24 like an old days stuff it was even at
58:27 Fresh Prince of bel-air I mentioned in
58:28 my old episode where I think one of the
58:31 kids broke a lamp by screwing around and
58:33 playing in the front room and they're
58:34 not supposed to playing a football or
58:36 something they broke a lamp and it's a
58:38 really coveted lamp by the mother and so
58:40 they hide it and then you know there's
58:42 been a cheers episode like this too
58:44 and so they hold it for 20 more minutes
58:47 or 18 more minutes or whatever and at
58:48 the end they reveal they broke it and
58:50 the parents go why don't you just tell
58:51 me the truth it would have been okay
58:52 accidents happened don't play football
58:54 in the front room like I said now you
58:55 know why we gave you that rule yeah okay
58:57 I love you mom dad boom roll credits
59:00 that's a very junior example of the of
59:04 the art of hiding the truth but now
59:07 let's say and I've gave this example in
59:09 my previous episode probably in
59:11 character development but again I'm
59:12 giving you the sort of kitchen sink
59:14 episode so you can get everything teased
59:17 into your brain to figure out whether or
59:19 not you got something right let's say
59:22 that a a husband is cheating on his wife
59:28 and he comes home and he doesn't know
59:33 you know if this is the time he's gonna
59:35 get caught or not or whatever but this
59:37 particular time he comes home he comes
59:40 home late but not so late it's like the
59:42 wife's in bed but she's perhaps taking
59:45 her makeup off and she's in her
59:47 nightgown just that physical description
59:50 of her will let the audience know she is
59:52 sort of in that wrap-up stage of the
59:54 night and he comes in late and of course
59:58 if the guy is cheating he's gonna come
60:01 home and probably sort of sauce up the
60:04 wife if she's still up
60:05 you know compliment her and be really
60:07 nice cuz he just got his rocks off with
60:08 somebody else he's feeling guilty this
60:10 is sort of his reverse technique so that
60:13 in itself is something you should pay
60:14 attention to I found a little bit of
60:17 rain here but she might say
60:22 you know he comes in and gives his
60:24 little salutation which is a cliche of a
60:27 guilty man and then she says well you
60:32 know what I have been thinking about
60:33 where we should go on vacation this year
60:36 I think we should do something huge and
60:39 he's like what are you talking about and
60:43 she goes well you know even working so
60:47 late at work the PTO the personal time
60:49 off your extra credit you know ours is
60:52 gonna have a huge bonus check at the end
60:55 of this year and I think we should spend
60:56 that check on a great vacation and so
61:01 she's basically calling his bluff oh
61:04 you're out working well then let's
61:06 figure out how we're gonna spend that
61:07 money this year because it's a bunch of
61:09 extra money we didn't plan on sorry I
61:12 just got a ton of rain on me there for a
61:13 second
61:14 everything is all covered up so we
61:16 should be okay I can get a little wet so
61:20 you want to talk your you want to write
61:21 your dialogue such that is insinuating a
61:23 more creative way to pull things out
61:26 than to put it directly on point if we
61:28 sat there and watched him cheat on his
61:30 wife and he comes home you know you
61:32 could just have him straight-up lie to
61:33 her and she takes it and you're in the
61:36 scene very quickly and then we have
61:37 something at stake he's now lied to her
61:39 and obviously he's probably going to get
61:41 caught at some point or if or anything
61:43 else we're revealing his character type
61:46 he's a cheater he's a liar and a cheater
61:49 and you can either play his wife as
61:52 someone who is visibly not pleasant to
61:56 be with and then the audience now would
61:57 feel a sympathy for the main character
62:00 you could show his guilt you know
62:03 looking at his picture of his wife when
62:05 they were really happy together and then
62:07 look at the picture of you know him with
62:09 a cell phone he's looking at little
62:11 instagrams of her or whatever you can
62:14 spend that anyway you want but you want
62:16 to spend all those scenes extremely
62:18 unique so they're not a big giant
62:21 borefest now here's the advanced
62:25 technique that will take you a little
62:27 while to understand and probably take
62:29 you a little while to master and it
62:32 takes me along took me a long while to
62:34 even get close
62:35 even saying the M word I am NOT a master
62:37 what I'm about to say but is an
62:39 imperative of what I do it is the
62:42 alteration or I should say the toggle
62:46 between positive and negative you will
62:49 want to flip everything that's being
62:51 said from a positive to a negative for
62:55 instance him coming in and greeting his
62:56 wife and a very nice salutation as a
62:59 positive her throwing out that they're
63:01 gonna go on vacation here real soon
63:03 could be construed as a negative because
63:06 she's calling his bluff he comes back as
63:10 a positive what what are you talking
63:11 about she comes back as a negative she
63:14 is finding she is essentially telling
63:16 him if you're not working late I mean
63:19 really working late and not off banging
63:21 some chick then I got you and you know
63:25 marriages will you put pictures of kids
63:28 in there or something like that and you
63:30 you put the fact that she's maybe a
63:32 stay-at-home wife and she's devoted her
63:34 whole life to the kids and he's off
63:36 earning all the cash and she has the
63:39 ability to take half of all of his money
63:40 I mean everybody knows these things so
63:43 you kind of work with your audience to
63:44 say you tell that to an eight-year-old
63:46 they won't know anything about divorce
63:48 law you aim this film at someone in
63:50 their 30s or they know the divorce laws
63:53 and they know it's not a happy occasion
63:54 right so now we flip things back and
63:59 forth as much as we possibly can in a
64:01 scene now what they tell you and in more
64:04 microscopic levels if you have two
64:06 positives in a row that's an area to
64:08 rewrite I mean literally two things in a
64:10 row that are like hey honey how's it
64:12 going oh it's going great
64:13 better tough but it just stays positive
64:15 the whole time then you better be inside
64:18 of a comedy where you're setting up some
64:21 euphoric situation that's gonna go bad
64:23 very quickly change is the name of the
64:26 game that's how you get all of these
64:30 things to become interesting to the
64:32 audience now simply going back and forth
64:36 between positive negative doesn't quite
64:38 get the job done what would really kick
64:43 this scene off that I'm giving you would
64:45 be the tip
64:48 tap back and forth with innuendo
64:49 comments about him doing late night work
64:53 and earning a few extra bucks and her I
64:55 wanted to go off on a vacation you can
64:59 get the sense she's totally suspects
65:00 he's cheating now what could happen is
65:04 she corners him into a situation where
65:08 she either says you know if you're
65:11 cheating on me you're done right and he
65:15 doubles down on his lie and honey I
65:19 ain't lying to you baby and edited us so
65:21 he doubles down and you might have a
65:22 situation where you manifest what they
65:24 call a double negative technically
65:27 there's a triple negative as well but as
65:29 when everything like Breaking Bad was
65:31 amazing at this it's bad and then he
65:32 gets worse and what ends up happening is
65:35 by it becoming worse if you remember the
65:37 first first few episodes of Breaking Bad
65:39 they killed a guy and then they were
65:43 trying to dissolve him in an acid and
65:47 the chemist guy the main character tells
65:52 the kid go get this specific plastic
65:55 container and put the body in that and
65:57 then put the acid in and he doesn't
66:00 realize why it's important so he uses
66:02 the bathtub instead he puts all the acid
66:04 in the bathtub so he comes home and
66:06 finds out that I forgot what else went
66:09 Bab but something else was really bad
66:10 and then all of a sudden before they
66:13 roll the credits the ceiling gives away
66:15 because the asset is eating through the
66:16 bathtub because it was never supposed to
66:18 be used you hold this stuff and here
66:20 comes down from the ceiling the bathtub
66:22 and pieces the body in pieces the acids
66:26 everywhere it's going through the floor
66:27 eventually and they just basically stare
66:30 down at this like oh my god we've got a
66:33 worse situation so that might be even a
66:35 triple negative depending on everything
66:37 that was going on in the scene let's
66:39 rewind that Breaking Bad scene because
66:41 it gets to the next thing you need to
66:42 understand this is really the last of
66:45 the gigantic concepts for your scene
66:49 structure now we're gonna talk about
66:51 turns because they're super important to
66:54 and we'll talk about cracking cracking
66:56 and turning for me it was what really
66:58 put the two together but we'll get to
67:00 that one second there's something called
67:02 the gap G a P just like the brand of
67:05 clothing the gap is when a character is
67:08 got a simple task they need to do he
67:12 told the kid go to the hardware store
67:14 and buy plastic containers with this
67:16 exact type of plastic just turn it over
67:19 read what it's made out of and it's got
67:21 to be this type of plastic why because
67:24 the acid wouldn't eat that particular
67:26 type of plastic it goes right through
67:28 porcelain or other types of rubber but
67:32 the kid goes to the hardware store and
67:34 either he couldn't remember what it was
67:36 or he couldn't find anything that was
67:38 made of that particular plastic I can't
67:39 remember which way it works I can see
67:40 the scene of my burning but I can't
67:41 remember I went down so he doesn't buy
67:46 it or he buys the wrong one or whatever
67:47 because the body was in a bathtub I
67:50 apologized for not remembering all the
67:52 details that I've only seen that one
67:53 time but that was a gap he tried to do
67:57 something and then he wiggled around it
67:59 and that caused the next problem in the
68:02 movie San Andreas which is the one with
68:06 the rock in it and it's all about an
68:08 earthquake that happens in San Francisco
68:10 or Rock and his wife I believe in Los
68:13 Angeles this huge earthquake happens in
68:15 San Francisco I think it's that way
68:17 around Lee whatever one of the two
68:18 cities has the earthquake one of them
68:20 the parents and the other one their
68:21 daughters and the one that had the
68:22 earthquake and said they're hauling ass
68:24 to the town that had the earthquake and
68:26 they have a physical funny on point gap
68:30 they're driving down the highway and the
68:33 earth has split apart it is a physical
68:35 gap and so they they almost go off the
68:38 the crevasse and die and eventually they
68:41 I think they got a plane and flew or
68:44 something because he can do everything
68:45 he can fly everything's going a little
68:47 James Bond but they wouldn't have gotten
68:50 into the the airplane had they not had
68:53 the gap in the ground so your job is to
68:56 gap the character all the way to the end
68:58 of the film and once you understand gaps
69:00 you'll see them all the time in every
69:03 single story that you ever see where you
69:06 know hey it's going to be easy and it's
69:08 not when Luke Skywalker's trying to put
69:12 the two torpedoes down the vent to blow
69:14 up these
69:16 Death Star at the very beginning well
69:17 everyone's trying it at first and it's
69:19 really really hard and I think he did
69:22 one that failed and he had to come back
69:24 around and do it again and then
69:25 eventually he uses the force to break
69:27 the gap the force had a use only because
69:31 it had a gap preceding the first manual
69:35 you see he's trying to use the equipment
69:37 to figure out when to push the button
69:39 and you know will be once as you know
69:41 Luke use the Force Pao he nails it how
69:46 the force has more of a purpose than
69:49 just all the other reasons they had
69:50 lightly outlined in the first film now
69:54 let's talk about turns turns are
69:57 gigantic they can be gigantic they could
70:00 be kind of small too but turns are win
70:03 more mystery and more unraveling the
70:06 curse if you're on the tree analogy it
70:09 would be when a new branch opens up for
70:12 instance a mystery is where you have
70:14 tons of turns a mystery needs like 30 to
70:17 40 turns before the scripts over and
70:20 some of these turns are going to be you
70:22 know if you do think about think about
70:23 playing the game Clue when you were a
70:25 kid some of these turns don't matter
70:27 they're just disinformation for the
70:29 brain and some of these turns are the
70:31 one the only one that matches all the
70:34 previous things that really link back to
70:36 the empirical let's say a crime happened
70:38 someone murdered someone in a party in a
70:40 mansion just like the game and so the
70:43 process of elimination starts to occur
70:45 for the for the viewer you if you can
70:51 write mysteries really well well become
70:53 a master attorney or think about a turn
70:57 as simply the anatomy of this the
70:59 character that is experiencing the turn
71:01 has discovered something new that
71:03 completely changed their perspective of
71:05 everything they had thought they were
71:06 moving forward in all the previous pages
71:09 of your script now one of the best turns
71:13 in the world happened at the end of a
71:15 cliffhanger in Star Wars Empire Strikes
71:18 Back when Luke learns the Darth Vader is
71:23 his father that changes everything
71:26 that changed two movies which is based
71:29 four hours of viewing time than your
71:31 life completely rewrote themselves in
71:34 your mind you're like oh my god what
71:38 this dude Darth Vader he's like on a
71:40 Death Star he's like in you know he's in
71:42 control he talks to the Emperor and this
71:44 dude is this farm boys dad how in the
71:48 hell did that happen Obi one said he he
71:50 killed his father and then they roll
71:53 credits on you I mean really it goes
71:55 down and gets in the Millennium Falcon
71:56 flies away but in the end you don't get
71:58 any more information about that turn its
72:01 weight to the next movie and then we
72:03 definitely bought that ticket so there's
72:06 something called cracking a script and
72:09 cracking a script in my circles has
72:13 always been related to we've got a great
72:16 premise and part of the crack is is a
72:20 very interesting term because you're
72:23 sort of doing the opposite of a crack
72:24 you're cracking open this story that's
72:26 actually stuck inside the universe box
72:28 that you're trying to tell this story
72:30 but a crack is when you figure out the
72:33 magical formula between the story and
72:36 the premise what is going to be the one
72:39 way to tell this story with your amazing
72:42 premise idea that's going to make
72:45 everyone go oh my god
72:48 yeah this is an awesome movie you know
72:50 in Terminator it's probably one of the
72:52 best cracks ever where you have him
72:55 coming after Sarah Connor and there's
72:58 this extra dude that comes back to help
73:01 her from dying and ends up fathering the
73:04 kid right that's another term when he
73:08 unanimously became the kid's father
73:12 because of his involvement with Sarah
73:14 Connor it was a big deal so the cracking
73:18 thing is interesting because here's what
73:20 it happens in my life because I write
73:22 with at least one other person from time
73:24 to time and he will bring a premise to
73:27 me and say man I got this idea this
73:30 premise is duh duh duh duh and right
73:32 away the premise is always amazing
73:34 you're like oh yeah man that is awesome
73:36 and it's like but I can't crack it I
73:40 can't figure out how to make this a
73:42 2-hour movie
73:43 you know how do I steadily elongate this
73:46 concept to the point you want to see it
73:48 for two hours sometimes people will have
73:51 in my circles will have written a script
73:55 but it just wasn't that good they wrote
73:58 it without the crack and so it became a
74:01 very obvious thing a good crack will
74:06 keep you from writing cliches it will
74:09 force the dialogue in the action
74:10 everything to be really interesting so
74:14 there's not a whole lot more to say
74:16 other than when you crack a script is
74:19 when it looks like a feature film inside
74:21 your head you see the whole thing and
74:24 usually a crack will reveal if nothing
74:27 else the first act and the fourth act
74:28 beautifully and then you can have fun
74:31 with the second part of it which is the
74:33 center two acts now one of the things
74:37 you need to understand about writing
74:39 film and this goes for novels too but I
74:41 just don't writing that stuff anymore
74:43 is that constraints are your friend and
74:51 for any of you that are fans of Game of
74:53 Thrones
74:54 Star Wars Star Trek you know there are
74:57 tons of rules about things that would
75:00 never happen in those universes and
75:01 things that would happen in those
75:03 universes and those constraints define
75:06 your world beautifully and really allow
75:08 you to write your characters a lot
75:10 better and so a lot of times folks will
75:14 you know some of the writers I've met in
75:17 the distant past who complained about
75:20 Hollywood tearing up their script or
75:22 putting unnecessary demands on their
75:24 script I would say that they were never
75:26 meant for this job because those
75:29 constraints those requirements that
75:31 Studios might give you you know they
75:32 might say well make that main character
75:34 a girl we're in a girl power phase right
75:36 now
75:37 make it a girl right now you should
75:39 always consider that for one of your
75:41 scripts this is called Superboy or
75:43 something like that right but a good
75:46 writer will never ever shy away from any
75:49 constraint you need assess 'ti because
75:53 you'll see it as a challenge
75:55 and for those of you who've ever
75:56 role-played in your lifetime Dungeons
75:58 and Dragons champions all those vampire
76:02 ones you'll know there's no such thing
76:05 as constraints your players will always
76:07 deny your storylines that you've worked
76:08 a whole week on before you role played
76:10 again and they're like I'm not
76:11 interested in that let's go over here
76:13 ahead then you have to write a whole new
76:15 night stuff in your brain real time
76:17 that's why it's a great precursor to
76:19 becoming a great writer and playing as a
76:22 character and seeing the GM of the DM
76:25 sweat and Vince something from scratch
76:27 that's also a great teaching tool for
76:30 you so some of the other little
76:32 low-hanging fruit that happens when
76:34 you're in your screenwriting software
76:37 there's something called Moore's and
76:39 continues Moore is anytime a paragraph
76:43 is broken between two pages it'll put
76:45 the little thing in parentheses more
76:46 saying this continues on the other page
76:48 so don't stop reading here get to the
76:50 next paragraph I've been told to turn
76:53 all that crap off continue is when
76:55 someone is actually speaking twice in a
76:58 row so they'll speak you put a little
77:00 action in there and you speak again and
77:02 that is where you will get it continue
77:05 just turn all that crap off it's more
77:08 fodder for the mind to go around now
77:11 some of the other low-hanging fruit is
77:13 and most junior writers don't have the
77:16 technical capability of doing this but
77:17 sometimes you come from the
77:18 special-effects world or other movie
77:20 production areas and you know about
77:22 cameras and lenses and tight wide and
77:26 you know medium shots you can do a
77:31 little bit of camera work with tight
77:33 medium wide you can say tight on this
77:34 face stead of it up but a lot of times
77:36 the directors will make those decisions
77:38 and so they don't want to be
77:39 orchestrated as to exactly how a film is
77:42 going to be filmed that's what they do
77:44 the the director of photography will get
77:47 in there and decide generally this
77:49 should be you know this kind of scene is
77:50 best illustrated with a wide shot and
77:53 usually storyboards will occur before
77:54 the film actually goes into shooting so
77:57 they'll have all these shots completely
77:59 figured out but they might frown on your
78:02 script if you see yourself playing a
78:05 role that is not your role your role is
78:07 to come up with the story
78:08 and the premise and weld them together
78:10 through a crack and then write very
78:13 interesting off point positive negative
78:16 dialogue you need to gap things properly
78:20 and your gaps have to get bigger and
78:22 bigger and bigger that's something I
78:23 forgot to tell you so you start off with
78:26 little gaps and you go to giant gaps
78:30 you know if it's some sci-fi script and
78:32 aliens are coming in from outside you
78:34 know the first gaps might be you can't
78:36 find your gun the main character can't
78:38 find a gun the gun jams it doesn't
78:40 affect the aliens you see someone else
78:42 they see someone else you know use the
78:44 gun or an alien and they die because
78:45 there's there made a bulletproof
78:48 exoskeleton or something
78:49 so everything they're trying to protect
78:51 themselves isn't working thus putting
78:53 more and more at stake as the character
78:55 develops in front of the audience but
78:58 the final gap would be oh my god I gotta
79:00 fly to the mothership and seed it with
79:01 the virus or put a bomb on it or
79:03 something like that and how the hell are
79:04 you gonna do that and so mortal man
79:07 might have to jump into a spacecraft
79:08 that's been stolen from an alien like
79:10 they didn't you know Independence Day
79:12 and fly their ass up there and do
79:13 something so you want to pace your gaps
79:17 and make them bigger and bigger and
79:19 bigger and you need to pace it in terms
79:23 of how often the character actually runs
79:24 into again because they will get
79:27 exhausted of this process
79:29 now I've negated to use that term a
79:33 fundamental principle that is the the
79:38 overall guideline because I think it's
79:40 better described at the end of one of
79:41 these lessons than at the beginning of
79:43 one of these lessons which is this McKee
79:46 Robert McKee who wrote the book story
79:49 has coined a phrase called the
79:51 controlling idea it's a little
79:54 utilitarian for me that phrase but the
79:57 controlling idea is the overall drive of
80:01 your character from the very first
80:03 moment they enter the screen to the very
80:05 last moment they walk off screen and you
80:07 roll credits your script has a overall
80:13 theme to it and the theme would be
80:16 something like good versus evil man
80:19 versus machine man versus woman
80:22 there's all these different arcs out
80:23 there that become your themes and one
80:26 theme is going to be picked as the
80:28 overall theme and it's very symbolic
80:29 it's not very OnPoint
80:32 meaning you wouldn't say Kevin Flynn
80:35 trying to escape the computer it's sort
80:38 of a good versus evil formula and so as
80:42 you're dreaming up your new scenes and
80:45 your scene outline those 12 those 4 12
80:47 that you're going to put together
80:50 everything should yield either more
80:52 information about how evil something is
80:54 how good something is or what's at stake
80:57 if if it's a good versus evil type
81:00 formula there's also something that's
81:02 brilliant called a maturation script
81:04 which is your characters immature or
81:06 knowledgeable about something and in
81:08 order to to be victorious at the end
81:13 they have to go off and get what Joseph
81:15 Smith often referred to as the Boone the
81:18 Boone I can spell B oo in is like Luke
81:24 Skywalker going to dig Abba to finish
81:26 his Jedi training with Yoda there's as
81:30 much as the force might be instinctual
81:32 it's also something that has got a
81:35 massive power that he didn't know how to
81:36 use when he said get that TIE fighter
81:38 out of the swamp and you can't get that
81:41 I would stupid he gets covered in water
81:43 not and he's like oh is with you it
81:45 can't be done
81:45 so he tries it and he gets it out of the
81:47 water a little bit and it falls back on
81:49 the water because you know faith in
81:50 himself isn't a faith in the force
81:51 doesn't understand this stuff is
81:52 infinite and all-powerful you just have
81:55 to figure out how to manipulate it and
81:56 then Yoda what CEO to do he just goes
82:00 boom and he pulls that thing right out
82:02 of the swamp and sets it down and he's
82:04 just like he's a little tired but he's
82:06 like see I'm 400 years old or whatever
82:10 however all the do was and he's like I
82:11 can do it so you're young you're young
82:13 whippersnapper with a ton of this force
82:16 stuff going through your veins no more
82:18 excuses and through that example the
82:21 master taught the apprentice the
82:23 thresholds of the force which are pretty
82:26 limitless right now let's talk really
82:29 quickly about treatments and then I'll
82:33 reflect some of this back into you
82:35 script I wrote my first treatment when I
82:40 had to put together the script for Chris
82:41 Hemsworth on KU : the mythical character
82:46 in Ireland which I talk about from time
82:47 to time and we wrote the script first
82:50 and then realized that the folks that
82:52 that it had time to read this really
82:55 didn't want to read the whole script and
82:57 so we ended up saying okay you know
83:00 making modifications to 120 page
83:02 document if you got anything wrong or
83:04 you come up with some new ideas that
83:06 could result in right rewriting 80 pages
83:08 a hundred pages if you change one thing
83:11 at the beginning you know affect
83:12 everything else so we were moving very
83:16 quickly because there was a huge time
83:17 constraint on this thing I think I took
83:19 about six months of research and about
83:21 four months to write it but I very
83:26 quickly was asked to do a treatment of
83:28 it which was essentially the first part
83:31 of the documents which you'll have to
83:33 get into I will have to get into it a
83:35 different episode but it would be you
83:37 picking the characters that have to
83:40 exist the main characters they usually
83:42 like to see some Hollywood picks and who
83:44 do you think of these characters should
83:45 be literally the human beings that would
83:46 play these characters and then talk
83:49 about your demographics who you think
83:50 you're gonna hit you give us a synopsis
83:53 of your script which is the again go
83:56 look at the the outlines of Twilight
83:58 zones on Netflix there's a perfect
84:00 mission statements for every single
84:01 episode right at that tight and you're
84:04 gonna be great but when you get down to
84:06 the treatment of your script what I
84:08 found to be the perfect formula is a ten
84:10 page outline or 10 page not really
84:14 outline but a 10 page version of your
84:15 script where each line is double-spaced
84:19 and one line per per line
84:22 you know you try to keep anything from
84:24 carriage returning and you just go from
84:26 start to finish in your script this
84:29 person did this this person does this it
84:31 doesn't have all the qualities of a
84:32 normal script there's no dialogue
84:34 whatsoever it's all action you out there
84:37 you could put a few key phrases that are
84:39 in the script that are powerful to the
84:41 script I mean if you were to say write
84:44 an outline of our treatment of Empire
84:47 Strikes Back
84:47 you would probably put the thing
84:49 you know depending on what Mandela fact
84:52 you're into Luke I'm your father or no
84:54 I'm your father it's just so that
84:56 someone can go oh my god
84:57 you know while they're reading this
84:58 treatment but it should be just as
85:01 powerful as your script it's probably
85:03 even more powerful because it's more
85:05 consolidated you're just really getting
85:08 to the point of everything that's there
85:09 but they need to feel every emotion that
85:11 you want them to feel and you must
85:14 describe it in a visual way the entire
85:16 time because this is a visual art right
85:19 now once you write your treatment and
85:21 you might even do your treatment first
85:23 before you get into your screenwriting
85:25 software and nobody likes to have delays
85:27 but I tell you what I'm not telling you
85:29 this to slow you down I'm telling this
85:31 to save your skin to make sure that you
85:33 become professional and make sure that
85:35 you don't waste time because if it gets
85:39 difficult and you've never done it
85:40 before you might give up and that's the
85:43 wrong thing to do so I'm trying to keep
85:46 you from having those give up moments by
85:48 doing it the right way but if you had a
85:51 10 page double spaced complete
85:56 reenactment of your script then when you
85:58 get to your 120 page write you're gonna
86:02 know what works and what doesn't work I
86:04 put a tremendous amount of effort into
86:06 my my 12 scene x 4 thing to make sure
86:10 this thing works now what I typically do
86:13 in my action in addition to everything
86:17 else I've told you making sure it's all
86:18 visual of course is one you literally
86:23 will get to the point you will be
86:24 erasing every word you can possibly
86:27 erase I used to write run-on sentences
86:30 in my action thinking that that would be
86:33 easier to read just read one big long
86:36 sentence and then poof you got all the
86:38 information you need I now don't do that
86:40 I write a couple short sentences I try
86:43 to make as just a personal goal of mine
86:46 any action that I am inserting into a
86:49 script especially between dialogue
86:51 because no one wants to stop reading
86:52 dialogue and read action because the
86:54 dialogue is the rich part it's the truly
86:56 visual they're seeing it in their brain
86:58 think don't interrupt them if you
87:00 but any my action I try to make it no
87:03 more than two thirds the width of the
87:05 script and only on one line and what
87:09 will end up happening is you'll become a
87:11 wordsmith
87:12 you will find ways to say things in
87:14 shorter formats than you ever have in
87:17 your life but now here's the thing don't
87:19 get caught up and that perfectionism
87:21 loop again write whatever the hell you
87:23 got to write just to get the damn thing
87:24 finished I'm helping a buddy right now
87:26 with the rewrite he just sent in Hawaii
87:28 and wrote this in 30 days and now I'm in
87:31 there he didn't even put periods on the
87:33 end of his sentences I commend him
87:36 because he didn't lose track of getting
87:38 to the bottom of the script and a lot of
87:40 his dialogue is pretty flat and doesn't
87:42 go back and forth and doesn't have any
87:44 character and he knows that and that's
87:46 why he's contacted me so you do because
87:48 you rewrite this for me you know so one
87:52 of the other action tricks you can do
87:53 and dialogue tricks you can do is if you
87:57 have a I give you a couple examples if
88:02 you want something to move really really
88:04 quickly because it's a rapid-fire action
88:07 scene you want to start using really
88:09 short words short words in the dialogue
88:12 short words in the action if you have to
88:15 describe a lot of stuff in a paragraph
88:16 because some big physical thing is
88:17 occurring a robots shooting a missile
88:19 and that kind of stuff
88:20 tiny little words will read a lot faster
88:24 to the reader and keep the pace going
88:25 such that it feels exactly like it would
88:28 be on the screen so use that little
88:29 trick one of the other techniques is if
88:32 you have to do something like bullet
88:34 time something's gonna go in slow motion
88:36 you just simply write in all bold above
88:40 your action the following thing happens
88:43 very quickly or happens in slow motion
88:47 and then you want to put at the end of
88:49 that action time resumes that way they
88:53 understand this went slow and this is
88:55 going quickly if you're gonna do
88:57 something like that
88:58 make it a big moment you know if you
89:02 have a guy diving in a room like the
89:04 matrix where there's all that fire going
89:06 on in the police station and he's dive
89:08 and in the room he's jumping off the
89:09 pillars I never read the script but that
89:11 would be something you would it's a big
89:13 the script and say someone is adjusting
89:15 their brain trying to think about things
89:17 in slow motion then what happens has to
89:19 make really quick sense in slow motion
89:22 you don't want to further complicate
89:22 things by going into bullet mode and
89:25 then describing a bunch of complex stuff
89:27 you will find times that things are hard
89:30 to describe when I wrote a sequel to
89:33 Tron Legacy technically Tron 3 wasn't
89:38 the script it was cancelled you can get
89:39 a copy of it on the lock Facebook group
89:41 I had to describe new games that I
89:44 hadn't been invented and being a game
89:46 designer I'd have you know 20 years of
89:49 writing game design documents but I had
89:51 to put together the physical properties
89:54 of the game like if they're writing
89:56 light cycles or modified light cycles
89:58 there's balls flying around how does it
90:00 work some of its coming out in a
90:01 dialogue because the character doesn't
90:03 know how to play the game either and
90:04 he's like how's this thing work well you
90:06 know to play this yeah it's just like
90:07 that something like that but they can't
90:09 reference something in the outside world
90:11 because they were programmers their
90:12 programs in the inside world
90:14 and so they have to reference things it
90:18 was the only point where oh and Steven
90:22 this burger read it he was like getting
90:24 confused about this game and I'm like
90:26 yeah I've been rewriting that for like
90:27 you know three months man then there's
90:30 the idea about copy writing your script
90:33 and here's my advice about copy writing
90:36 your script unless you are pitching your
90:40 script unless you were handing it in to
90:42 your agent or distributing in some way
90:46 where you think it might be stolen you
90:48 want to keep it out of the copyright
90:50 realm for as long as you possibly can
90:53 because I believe you only get five
90:54 years and then you have to recopy write
90:56 it I think you can recopy write it just
90:58 change a little bit and recopy write it
91:00 again because people can get access to
91:03 your script after Scott be ready and
91:05 they can poach all kinds of ideas out of
91:07 your script and never pay you a dime I
91:09 was on a project with another guy we
91:13 worked really really hard on the script
91:15 he wrote it I helped him rewrite a
91:17 little bit of it and it turned into
91:18 transcendence and they ripped us off
91:21 like you wouldn't believe
91:23 so just bear that in mind
91:26 when you're selling your script it goes
91:28 like this you will get obviously a core
91:33 amount of money for your script
91:34 depending on how talented you are what
91:36 your reputation is so you may not get a
91:39 gigantic amount of money for your script
91:41 I've heard first-year script writers
91:43 getting a little over $100,000 for the
91:46 script and when you put old you know two
91:49 or three years into a script before it
91:51 actually sells that's pretty much fair
91:53 that's a fair minimum that you would get
91:56 for putting that time into any other
91:58 profession in the world as you amass
92:01 your reputation you can start getting
92:03 several hundred thousand dollars for
92:05 your script and depending on how amazing
92:08 you are you could even claim a
92:09 seven-figure amount of money but don't
92:12 think that stuff's coming right away
92:14 I would say this you know barring a
92:18 horrible tragedy in payment for your
92:22 script and they're only going to option
92:23 it for a certain amount of time they
92:24 typically won't buy it forever buying it
92:27 forever should cost a lot more money
92:28 than optioning it for a year sometimes
92:30 they'll option your script because
92:32 there's another script very much like
92:34 that one and they don't want yours to
92:36 sell to any other Studios so they pull
92:37 you off the the opportunity block get
92:43 their movie out the door then they let
92:44 the option return back to you and good
92:47 luck selling your script because they
92:49 just did one similar to yours if you're
92:52 going to make your initial lump sum a
92:53 bunny and then as you get better here's
92:57 what you can ask for but this is only
92:59 after you've done this a few times or
93:01 you know there's always a lottery ticket
93:03 situation but you can't base your life
93:06 on this you can actually ask for points
93:09 on the film meaning a percentage of the
93:11 gross now you've got to have some
93:12 serious chops to ask for that and you
93:14 could have some serious legal
93:15 representation that kind of thing
93:17 you're only gonna probably get a
93:18 fraction of a percent that's a lot of
93:21 money every time the movie airs every
93:23 time it's shown on TV you get this
93:25 little check in the mail so it's worth
93:27 it now TV writer has a completely
93:28 different situation they get a good loan
93:31 summer cash let's say they make 150 K
93:33 from a script like a TV show like a CNC
93:37 is sort of show
93:38 and then every time it airs again you
93:41 make half so 150 75 down down down down
93:45 down and then it sort of caps out I
93:47 think or bottoms out around five grand
93:50 every time it shows on TV and you hope
93:52 the thing goes into syndication because
93:54 then you can go to your mailbox every
93:55 morning and collect rent if it happens
93:58 one time in the world you hear in spate
93:59 for right what's really fun about
94:02 writing let me just tell you this to get
94:04 it kind of give you a bump the awesome
94:08 thing about writing is no matter how
94:10 amazing or uneme zhing your life is in
94:13 real life when you become a writer you
94:17 are god you are creating your own world
94:20 if you think about it and you do want to
94:24 create your own constraints for your own
94:25 world if you created a new Star Wars
94:27 universe that's all yours it's not
94:29 called Star Wars you definitely want to
94:32 create your constraints and stuff to
94:33 create your own universe but you get to
94:35 go and live in a world and develop
94:37 characters that do things that are out
94:39 of this world
94:40 whether it could be super subtle
94:42 romances or what have you what ends up
94:46 happening with a lot of the rookie
94:47 writers I talked to is and I don't mean
94:52 they're lacking talent by anybody means
94:55 calling them rookies they just never
94:56 sold anything before they haven't
94:57 written one before they'll usually pick
95:00 something really simple because they've
95:02 heard you got to write what you know and
95:04 there's definitely a ton of truth to
95:06 that but they'll end up writing some
95:07 really difficult that they think they're
95:11 picking a simple script and they're
95:13 picking a super difficult script if
95:15 you've lived a really amazing life
95:17 sometimes those things just fall out of
95:19 you and it's amazing and everybody gets
95:20 it but sometimes you know kids that are
95:23 you know second year of film school
95:26 trying to write about a couple getting
95:28 divorced and they're trying to write it
95:31 from the perspective of the spouses and
95:32 they'd never been married before they'd
95:34 never been divorced before they've only
95:35 heard stories the amount of subtlety
95:39 that they will miss that is the true
95:41 grit of those horrible experiences for
95:44 people will never exist in the script
95:46 and that's because of something I say
95:48 which is they haven't lived enough life
95:49 to write about life
95:51 so you're not really writing about what
95:53 you know it would be easier for that
95:55 person to write a crazy science fiction
95:58 comic book world than it would be for
96:01 them to write something about what goes
96:03 on in their front room now some people
96:05 have that amazing talent I think
96:07 Tarantino had that amazing talent still
96:09 does of course but he's an anomaly which
96:11 is why you know his name like a
96:13 household word now if you know in your
96:16 heart of hearts that I'm full of crap
96:18 and you got that talent don't listen to
96:20 me
96:20 stopping you from writing that script
96:22 I'm just telling you if you're capable
96:25 of doing that that I'm giving you an
96:27 award ahead of time now what other
96:30 quality that some of you will be able to
96:33 manifest while doing this but hopefully
96:35 you have this quality prior to getting
96:37 into this art is your doer what's that
96:41 mean
96:42 that means you do things because you
96:44 have to do things these are passionate
96:47 pastimes to your heart you're a writer
96:49 and you simply have to write that's me I
96:52 can't stop writing doesn't matter if I
96:55 never sold a single script I probably
96:57 still write them I just have to they
97:00 mean something to me
97:01 I like them several musicians will talk
97:03 about their songs being their children
97:05 your films are your children and you
97:07 want them to be made because you believe
97:09 the world will get something out of the
97:12 story let me give you some goals with
97:16 your scripts and you know all scripts
97:21 are different of course if it's a comedy
97:24 you're gonna want someone to love your
97:28 comedy they're gonna have like think
97:30 about something about Mary who converses
97:33 about Something About Mary which came
97:35 out I don't know what nearly 20 years
97:37 ago how do you remember that came out
97:39 but everybody remembers the the moment
97:44 where she grabs something off her ear
97:47 and puts it in her hair because she
97:49 thinks it's hair gel and it's not hair
97:51 gel and you know I had to see that movie
97:53 three times in the theater to hear what
97:56 they said for the next 60 seconds after
97:59 that she came on-screen with their hair
98:00 all pushed up was a Cameron Diaz
98:04 you couldn't hear because everyone was
98:06 laughing so hard and when you mentioned
98:08 that script today or that movie to
98:09 someone today everyone mentions that
98:11 scene that is your goal if you write a
98:14 comedy you need to have people remember
98:16 your jokes Blazing Saddles oh my god
98:20 there's dozens and dozens of those
98:22 scenes when you know Blazing Saddles and
98:24 you love that movie
98:25 you could just sit around and probably
98:28 finish two cigars just riffing that
98:30 movie and reenacting those scenes and
98:32 and celebrating with your friends that
98:35 you both like that scene but four scenes
98:38 are sorry four films that are more in
98:40 depth and have serious meaning you're
98:45 gonna want someone to come out of that
98:46 theater talking about the issues that
98:49 you raised in the film first time that
98:51 ever happened to me that I really
98:53 remember was Natural Born Killers with
98:55 Woody Harrelson he gives a dialogue at
98:57 the end of that film and he talks about
99:00 why he is the killer that he is and the
99:03 fact that we're all just animals and
99:04 were lying to ourselves that were not I
99:07 was also worried about the carnage that
99:09 would happen after that movie happened
99:10 cuz I thought man someone's gonna kill
99:11 someone after seeing that movie because
99:13 it rolls you up you know it just gets
99:16 ready gets into your feral state of mind
99:18 and that's masterful writing masterful
99:20 writing if you're leaving them with the
99:24 Giants Luke I'm your father moment
99:26 that's an epiphany you'll talk about for
99:28 the rest of your life everybody talks
99:30 about that for the rest of their life
99:32 you're in control these stories folks
99:34 you're in control of where those
99:37 mysteries exist how they are resolved
99:39 whether there's a twist someone thought
99:42 their brother was their brother but they
99:44 were really their father I mean like all
99:45 kinds of wild things that can happen in
99:47 a script and so this should get your
99:50 juices flowing if you're a creative
99:52 person there are steps to getting to the
99:55 script the kiss of death would be
99:57 jumping in your screenwriting software
99:59 and pounding out scenes someone asked me
100:01 recently
100:03 how much can I write in a single sitting
100:06 after I've got my script outlined and
100:08 worked out it was an interesting
100:10 question I'm not sure why that answer is
100:13 got any validity to it but I think they
100:15 were trying to figure out whether or not
100:16 they were pacing themselves
100:18 by getting get an extreme example from
100:21 someone who does it and has done it for
100:22 twenty years plus and so what I told him
100:25 was I said look probably the most I've
100:28 ever written in one sitting is 45 pages
100:30 which is the first act plus the next 15
100:32 I will put a caution out to you if you
100:36 do one of those marathon writing
100:37 sessions any of you run track and I was
100:41 a fool when I joined track I wound up
100:43 being a long jumper
100:44 can you imagine was that my coaches in
100:47 track they never taught us anything
100:48 about how to do anything they expected
100:51 you to have had a previous life as a
100:53 track runner and you know all the ins
100:55 and outs of everything you know how
100:57 every shock put and javelin works you
101:00 know how to run a marathon I mean it's
101:01 like it's crazy but they asked us to run
101:03 I think the I think it's called the 440
101:07 I think you run a you run around the
101:08 loop four times the course and then of
101:11 course you're pacing yourself and you're
101:15 saving your energy for the final sprint
101:17 right
101:17 oh I didn't know anything about that so
101:19 I just hauled ass and got in front of
101:21 everybody and realized oh this isn't
101:22 over after one loop and then I you know
101:26 barf my guts out you know I didn't barf
101:28 but I was like I feel horrible after
101:29 that and I don't even know if they got
101:30 even finished it
101:31 I'd exhausted myself and that's what can
101:34 happen to you if you binge right one day
101:37 if you're a binge writer and you're just
101:40 one of those guys you just love writing
101:41 like fat kid loves cake then go for it
101:44 but just know if you haven't done that
101:46 before
101:47 it may exhaust you to the point where
101:48 you don't touch your script for a couple
101:50 days now sometimes if you get sort of
101:53 blocked in a particular area of your
101:55 script again write everything else you
101:57 can just leave that little part
101:58 unwritten just put down a footnote of
102:01 like this is what kind of should happen
102:02 in that situation go write everything
102:04 else and then eventually maybe sit down
102:07 set the script aside for a week or two
102:09 and then come back and you'll be amazed
102:11 how you read your own writing like it
102:12 wasn't even yours one of the other
102:15 things that I would advise you guys to
102:17 just as a little footnote at the end
102:19 here
102:20 when I write fight scenes unless it's
102:24 super significant to the fight scene I
102:25 don't talk about any of the punches the
102:27 cakes where anything goes I simply write
102:30 a paragraph that's
102:31 as you know a fight ensues it's very
102:33 intense as extremely violent and this
102:36 character ends up pinning the other
102:38 person down with a knife on his throat
102:40 if that's what I'm writing let the let
102:43 the stunt coordinators figure out how
102:45 the fight goes don't waste time in your
102:46 script because every pages is gold right
102:49 the director can say well this is a part
102:51 I can stretch for 10 minutes or whatever
102:53 like the they live fight in the alleyway
102:55 so I think it's about all I got on the
102:58 the basics I'm going to call this the
102:59 basics of screenwriting I really want to
103:03 inspire you guys to get out there and
103:04 experiment with this because again we
103:06 don't have enough great writers in the
103:09 world and we have so many channels and
103:11 outlets now we have to fill up Netflix
103:13 with something in Amazon Prime and
103:15 Apple's new channel and Hulu as well as
103:19 HBO and all the studios that exist
103:21 they're all dying to find your script
103:23 and you need to understand in 2010 my
103:27 teacher came up when I first up I first
103:30 took his course in oh seven and I took
103:34 it three more times last time I was in
103:36 his class I think it was in 2010 he told
103:39 us he those look Hollywood spend seven
103:41 hundred and fifty million dollars a year
103:42 looking for good scripts the major
103:45 studios this is not all the new
103:46 spin-offs that have happened in last 10
103:48 years so if you think that a bunch of
103:52 great writers exist and their stuff is
103:55 simply being panned by some crappy
103:57 reader it's not true there's simply
104:01 nothing out there if you don't see
104:02 anything out there that means nothing
104:04 came around so there is a huge demand
104:08 for this but there's very few people who
104:10 want to who have the the knowledge to do
104:14 it and then the passion to do it and so
104:17 it's definitely one of these areas that
104:19 robots are not going to replace for a
104:21 really long time and they got some AI
104:22 programs trying to write movies but
104:24 guarantee those won't sell very well yet
104:27 most the IE programmers are like you
104:30 know please make something that that
104:34 makes sense that'll be what the AI is
104:36 objective is well it's a bad movie but
104:38 it made sense right in a program wrote
104:40 it you know it's a great great you're
104:42 way more powerful than anything out
104:44 there
104:44 because of one major reason and that is
104:46 because you are plugged into the
104:47 universe and I guess one other piece of
104:52 advice I would pass on to you guys is be
104:54 careful watching a bunch of crap all the
104:57 time I have friends that are in the film
105:01 business on a producer side and they
105:04 have never taken a writing class which
105:06 is why they typically get mystified by
105:08 crappy scripts but they go out and make
105:10 it a rule of them to see every movie
105:15 that's ever made in the United States
105:18 good or bad they watch everything
105:20 because they like being at the party and
105:21 someone mentions a script and they got
105:23 all the breakdown of why they thought it
105:24 was a horrible script or a good script
105:25 or whatever the problem is this to quote
105:30 something from martial arts the best
105:32 fighting styles you can find in the
105:34 world to work in the real world are
105:36 fighting styles that have very few moves
105:38 but all of them are potentially lethal
105:41 you don't want to be negotiating in your
105:43 mind a thousand different you know MMA
105:46 moves or karate moves or whatever gracie
105:49 jiu-jitsu moves and a fight that we
105:52 really is gonna you know potentially
105:54 save your life you want the ones that
105:56 just go strike strike and I'm out of
105:57 there I'm running home you know whatever
105:58 I'm going to a public place to call a
106:00 cop or something
106:01 same thing with film writing surround
106:04 yourself by the best films that you know
106:06 that have ever been written and dissect
106:09 them on the level of where was society
106:11 when this film came out because that is
106:13 the number one reason why a film became
106:15 a cult classic again Snow White came out
106:19 during the Depression it was a way for
106:21 everyone poor as they've ever been to
106:24 escape this entire world and go into an
106:26 animated utopia star wars you have
106:31 vietnam war that just ended and soldiers
106:34 are coming home all messed up and this
106:37 was a way to escape the entire universe
106:39 to caught into a galaxy flung far far
106:42 away long long ago whatever and it was
106:44 awesome so if those conditions don't
106:47 exist in society you may not have the
106:49 benefit that the cult film out but at
106:51 least you will have studied a great
106:53 piece of art and that is what you will
106:55 absorb into your chest into your
106:58 mind into your soul it will help you
106:59 write better queries to the universe to
107:02 find the best stories to crack those
107:03 scripts it's just my personal take on
107:07 things I don't surround myself with crap
107:09 if you have any other questions about
107:11 any of this stuff just put it in the
107:13 comment section I'll answer publicly so
107:15 everybody gets the benefit of your of
107:17 your question and if you have them into
107:20 deep thoughts radio calm please go
107:22 there's audio video locked Facebook
107:24 group Twitter account two ways to
107:26 contribute to the page which is patreon
107:29 and PayPal and really you know I wanted
107:33 to tell you guys as I struggle to come
107:35 up with new episodes constantly what the
107:39 finances the could achieve could achieve
107:42 at some point would be in really the
107:43 popularity of a youtube channel would be
107:45 the best way to do it where you don't
107:47 have to contribute anything you just
107:48 pass it around and everyone watches and
107:50 I get some cash but the idea is I need
107:52 to do research for some of these
107:53 episodes and that means I don't work and
107:56 so that would be probably the best angle
107:58 as to why that happens and the guys that
108:00 make tons of money make great videos
108:02 because they they sit down eight hours a
108:04 day researching great you know
108:07 production value if there's a lot of
108:09 visuals that need to be put in there I'm
108:10 an artist so I can draw a lot of stuff
108:12 but it's hard when I had to do my
108:13 episode about world of warcraft I had a
108:16 bunch of loose sketches and I was like
108:18 crap I gotta like somehow crank this out
108:20 super fast it's gonna suck I wish I
108:22 could add the time to make things look
108:23 fantastic as I talked about my expansion
108:27 at the end right so anyway just to put a
108:30 little bit of rationale there there's a
108:32 new link to season 1 I'm on episode 65
108:36 today again we're also on bit shoot comm
108:39 so I'll let you know when we get all
108:42 that up hopefully this summer when I
108:43 take my break after the season's over I
108:46 will be able to report that hundreds of
108:48 episodes are on bit shoot and away from
108:53 the censorship that exists in so many
108:56 different places the channel is
108:58 definitely being shadow banned a bunch
109:00 of you being unsubscribed and never in
109:03 the history of a YouTube channel that
109:05 you get you know 10,000 views on a video
109:08 and no subscribers
109:10 but that's what's happening now so if
109:13 someone comes on they're kicking someone
109:14 off I mean something's happened in there
109:16 where it's emptied out
109:17 so anyway take care of yourself and
109:20 someone else write a film and I'll see
109:22 in the next deep thoughts over
