00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:34 deep thoughts here in this mid-may
00:37 beautiful day it's about 70 degrees 60
00:41 70 somewhere in there definitely
00:44 comfortable today and I thought I would
00:46 talk about something that's critically
00:49 critically important for probably every
00:51 human being on earth and probably even I
00:56 know it's gonna be interesting to see
00:58 which groups get caught up in this I
01:01 think it's important for the kids to
01:03 know this stuff because there is a
01:07 change you're coming now some of you
01:11 will have heard of Moore's law and
01:15 Moore's law is a formula the tracks and
01:22 predicts how quickly technology will
01:25 iterate and it is become quicker and
01:29 quicker and quicker look at computer
01:33 speeds who would have thought you know
01:36 who would have thought we're still down
01:38 at three and four gig on a processor
01:42 right now but you know when I was a kid
01:46 I don't even know it must have been like
01:48 a quarter mega hurt were the computers
01:51 that I grew up on as a kid and again I
01:53 got started really young but you know we
01:56 just saw it growing and growing and then
01:58 it was like you know we were in a few
02:00 tens of megahertz and then 10 years
02:03 later were in gigahertz so things get
02:07 quickly you think things grow quickly
02:09 things get more intense we expected in
02:12 technology we want our TVs to have more
02:14 pixels our cars to have more horsepower
02:18 etc etc but the one thing we don't apply
02:22 this to is humanity we don't say
02:24 humanity has a Moore's law and in the
02:28 next 50 years although this is going to
02:32 start way before 50 years this is going
02:34 to start in the next 10 years probably I
02:37 would recommend
02:39 you brace yourself for about five years
02:41 there's a bunch of professions they're
02:43 gonna cease to exist in terms of human
02:45 beings doing it in first world countries
02:48 now the only thing that would prevent
02:50 that in my opinion would be someone
02:52 coming into the game and saying well we
02:54 do have robots that can do these things
02:56 but because of humanity we're not going
03:00 to allow that to occur I don't know how
03:05 that could happen which is why I'm
03:07 disregarding that that potential but you
03:10 know who knows maybe the world grows up
03:11 in a gigantic way in five to ten years
03:13 and the sovereignty of man to have a
03:18 good day's work completed might just be
03:24 protected at some point we're gonna have
03:27 to do that in the next hundred years
03:28 make that decision does man change how
03:31 man wakes up and works completely
03:34 because eventually artificial
03:36 intelligence will figure out how to do
03:37 everything
03:38 robots will be the physical extension of
03:40 that AI and you know you won't need a
03:44 mechanic in a car shop you won't need
03:47 them to change tires that's for sure a
03:49 balance or align your frame you won't
03:51 need them for body repair you won't need
03:53 them for I mean the only thing would be
03:55 is like Diagnostics but imagine
03:57 Diagnostics just keeps getting more and
03:59 more intense all kinds of ways of
04:01 x-raying engines with you know sound
04:04 waves instead of x-rays and you just
04:06 listen to the harmonic from one side of
04:08 the engine to the other and they can
04:09 deduce you've got a corroded valve or
04:13 you're you know if you need new
04:14 transmission fluid all these things will
04:17 be taken care of eventually and then
04:18 again you're gonna lose the ability to
04:20 own a car within probably 50 years in 50
04:26 years the only people driving cars on
04:27 the ground are most likely going to meet
04:29 with their hands and their feet will be
04:31 ultra rich people and I'll most likely
04:33 be in country club estates where there
04:35 are roads that are allowed to have human
04:38 beings driving on them self-driving cars
04:43 will be the future and cars will no
04:46 longer be this medallion that you hold
04:48 out to say look how powerful and rich I
04:50 am it will simply be you
04:53 get in the public transportation system
04:55 which will be individual cars like a
04:57 Johnny cab but a total recall hopefully
05:00 without that annoying mannequin who
05:02 happened to be the doctor who played the
05:05 hologram in Voyager that's awesome yeah
05:09 we've had robots in manufacturing lines
05:12 for 20 years right at least if not 30
05:16 years and they're helping to weld
05:19 together panels inside car assembly
05:22 lines they can do paint jobs you know
05:25 getting the human being out of the toxic
05:27 world of paint they they load up
05:30 warehouses they make microchips and
05:32 warehouses I mean when I when I got here
05:34 in 87 they said that the chip
05:38 manufacturers in Taiwan and Japan were
05:42 robots and the whole thing right in the
05:44 dark just a couple human beings to
05:47 provide security that was it that's 30
05:50 plus years ago you know thirty two years
05:54 ago but it's one of these things where
05:59 we brought in robots in places where
06:02 human beings had barely tread before at
06:04 least in chip manufacturing and then you
06:06 have robots getting in and really sort
06:09 of assisting some of the more laborious
06:12 processes and manufacturing cars still
06:15 plenty humans moving engines around and
06:17 panels around all that kind of stuff
06:19 but it's gonna go to the next level and
06:22 I think that the next level that robots
06:24 are going to annihilate jobs and it
06:28 should be very interesting and it will
06:29 be fast-food you know a lot of kids
06:34 let's put this way when I was a kid the
06:37 only people that worked at fast-food as
06:39 as a direct faith customer facing
06:42 employee were usually teenagers using it
06:46 as a jump-off career before they went to
06:49 college while they're in college while
06:51 they're in high school and you were to
06:53 transition into life after that and of
06:56 course the managers were always grownups
06:58 because they're making hopefully up nice
07:00 fat salary and today it's now you know
07:05 it's a full ecosystem especially if
07:07 or a migrant worker coming in either
07:09 legally or illegally you know they don't
07:11 have the advanced education since some
07:13 cases and so this becomes a career you
07:15 find people of all ages in those
07:17 institutions and and now in America
07:19 we're also finding that people in
07:22 retirement phase of their life decide to
07:26 go in and just participate because it
07:28 makes them feel good and they get a
07:29 chance to talk to other human beings and
07:31 they have obviously infinite patience
07:33 you know our department stores or
07:36 Walmart's our targets they have a lot of
07:39 I hate to say elderly older people we're
07:43 still just as young as they're just as
07:45 young as ever but there's going to be a
07:48 part that's going to disappear and
07:49 there's going to be a part that will
07:51 remain we already have self checkout and
07:54 that usually requires one human being to
07:57 stand there and watch your checkout to
07:59 make sure you're not walking off with
08:00 something you haven't zapped on a
08:02 scanner which blows me away that that
08:05 that still is able to survive because
08:07 these these criminals are pretty damn
08:09 devious well what's interesting in
08:12 America is that we have this gigantic
08:14 push for a living wage in fast food this
08:19 push for a $15 an hour wage which in
08:23 California barely you could barely
08:27 scrape by
08:28 you take that 15 bucks an hour to Kansas
08:31 and you're actually gonna be okay we're
08:33 gonna be really able to live in a house
08:35 and have a garage and some cars put your
08:38 kids to school maybe even to college I
08:40 mean there's a lot of room left with 15
08:42 bucks an hour now there's something you
08:47 know that they referred to as relative
08:48 poverty which again is don't compare
08:53 some guy in western China to a guy in
08:57 California there are requirements for
09:01 cash are completely different and
09:02 someone got me might be making a 250 a
09:05 day and the guy here might be making 70
09:08 bucks an hour and believe it or not the
09:10 250 a day guy could be living large
09:13 living outside nice beautiful you know
09:17 not outside outside but you know living
09:19 in the Agrokor
09:20 cultural world's gorgeous they just do
09:23 their thing they have everything that
09:24 they need giant families whatever they
09:26 want but this episode is about us
09:31 bracing for change oh I really want to
09:37 continue going down the line of what
09:39 careers I think are going to be gone
09:42 truck driving in America is going to be
09:45 gone
09:46 the Tesla corporations already got two
09:49 models of new big rigs that drive
09:50 themselves and you know currently
09:53 coexisting with real people on the
09:56 highway is the most dangerous
09:58 combination
09:59 but again in ten years you might find
10:03 that the interstate 40 which goes the
10:06 full distance of America in the lower
10:08 quadrant there it's just a automated
10:12 truck driving road
10:13 you're not allowed this Northern
10:20 Corridor highway system that's being put
10:22 in the United States owned completely
10:26 and utterly for the next hundred and
10:27 fifty years by the king and queen of
10:28 Spain by the way purchased through this
10:31 Austrian company the old guard that used
10:35 to drive trucks it's going to be gone
10:38 and it will seep it'll probably start at
10:41 the gigantic freight level and it will
10:44 seep down to the lower level and it's
10:47 going to put honestly a tremendous
10:49 amount of work visa immigrants out of
10:52 business because that's one area where
10:56 they figured out they could get in and
10:58 just drive trucks and would have to have
11:00 any formal education and they will put
11:06 three or four guys in a cab and they
11:09 just rotate sleeping and driving
11:11 sleeping and driving and filling up the
11:13 truck and it never stops from New York
11:15 to Los Angeles and of course the people
11:20 are reaping the benefits of that love
11:22 that inhumane version of that solution
11:26 so I think it's potentially going to be
11:30 probably two or three decades worth of
11:32 drivers that are currently been driving
11:34 and they're all going to get out
11:36 hopefully they get out in a nice way
11:38 with some sort of retirement of some
11:40 sort right but you're gonna have a whole
11:43 nother generation never get in because
11:45 this is going to be usurped and taken
11:46 care of by robotic self-driving cars so
11:50 the question that we have here is what
11:54 are we going to do with all of this you
11:59 know lack of opportunity and of course
12:04 the mother of invention is the answer
12:05 once a kid has no other option or an
12:09 adult even they've got to pop to the
12:12 next level you've got to go learn
12:15 something new now the scary part and the
12:18 part that most of these you know
12:20 societal thinkers are trying to parse is
12:23 okay a 25 year old male or female will
12:27 find plenty of energy and time to find
12:30 something new hopefully if we don't
12:33 legalize enough drugs that they don't
12:34 have to think at all but they're gonna
12:38 have a high likelihood of being okay but
12:41 you're 55 to 65 male or female who's
12:45 having their job annihilated by a robot
12:47 eeks that's where we've got some issues
12:51 in America you know we invented in sorry
12:56 for not saying like a world invention
12:58 but we created for ourselves what a lot
13:00 of countries have done which is a
13:01 pension program call Social Security you
13:05 paid into it your whole life and then
13:06 it's into your life you get to reap
13:09 these checks and the Social Security
13:13 thing that people the young kids don't
13:15 understand is that they keep raising the
13:17 the year that you're allowed to retire
13:20 and collect full benefits so I believe
13:23 when I was a kid it started out like
13:25 sixty sixty-five and then it's gone all
13:27 the way up to seventy five now to get
13:30 your full benefits I believe and they
13:35 keep trying to raise it and the idea is
13:38 to steal your money from you now you
13:41 need to understand if you make a hundred
13:42 thousand dollars a year
13:43 in the United States of America you are
13:46 done paying your Social Security tax
13:48 usually by May or June that's how that's
13:51 the ratio of it and it's not a hell of a
13:54 ton of money that you're putting into
13:56 this situation and then you have to rely
13:59 on the state / the government to invest
14:02 that and make more money with your money
14:05 and so it's a kind of an existence tax
14:08 that you have to pay if you collect any
14:09 wage whatsoever over the table and
14:12 you're not allowed to do what you want
14:15 with it but the problem is is that the
14:17 investments that you would put it in are
14:19 completely toxic right your stock market
14:23 you know Warren Buffett operates 1,000%
14:28 with insider information and it's not
14:31 like necessarily he's trying to do it in
14:35 a criminal way he just knows everybody
14:37 he knows the movers and shakers if if
14:40 Tim Cook were to come to him and say
14:42 please you know invest in Apple he can
14:45 Warren can make all the phone calls he
14:47 needs to make to find out where Apple's
14:49 gonna be one year from now two years
14:51 from now five years from now ten years
14:52 from now so he'll put his money in that
14:54 and double triple quadruple it or never
14:58 invest and save himself the heartache
14:59 but it's someplace else but the United
15:02 States citizen does not have that
15:04 rolodex and cannot get that information
15:07 does not have a whole life of sitting
15:10 around and investing and so 99.99% of
15:15 most citizens in America can't trust
15:17 anybody with their money and nor would
15:19 they know what to deal with if they were
15:21 given it all so the best thing we can do
15:25 in this country is to offer a little bit
15:28 of interest which the government can
15:30 manufacture create quantitatively ease
15:33 invests you know whatever with our
15:36 either our domestic gross domestic
15:38 product products or our or GMP our gross
15:43 national products I mean the government
15:47 is constantly taxing us so why not give
15:48 a little bit of a back right so you have
15:52 this sort of it's sort of like the
15:55 lyrics in pink
15:57 time where you're trying to run after
15:59 the Sun and no matter what you do it's
16:02 faster than you and it sets way away
16:04 from you and so life has sort of gone
16:07 away from you so that's sort of the
16:09 social security thing no matter how old
16:12 you are they keep trying to up the the
16:15 age so you can never quite get all the
16:18 benefits from it but of course there's a
16:21 you know two or three generations before
16:22 Gen X that got it all but even my
16:27 parents the baby boomers they're not
16:31 happy about this raise in retirement age
16:33 so the question remains is what are we
16:37 going to deal with a ton of employees
16:39 that are going to be absolutely replaced
16:42 for instance the McDonald's in
16:45 Huntington Beach at least one of them
16:48 has been completely outfitted for the
16:51 new robots when they come in they're
16:54 starting to put kiosks ordering kiosks
16:56 and I don't even know if the employees
16:59 know but that assembly line of all that
17:03 wonderful food is gonna just roll down
17:06 little you know assembly lines all you
17:08 need some eggs you need some bacon it's
17:09 gonna come together and it'll probably
17:11 look a lot more accurate actually to the
17:13 picture if a robot does it but they're
17:17 gonna be replaced and so these fallback
17:19 jobs Avadh just get a job McDonald's
17:21 that's not gonna exist department stores
17:24 not sure how they're gonna get rid of
17:26 checkers and and again human beings at
17:30 department stores are sort of necessary
17:31 because well they could be replaced
17:34 though you're trying to find something
17:36 something was supposed to be on sale
17:38 it's ringing up full price human beings
17:41 have to be involved but we'll see any
17:46 one of these objectives can be
17:48 completely replaced by a little tiny bit
17:50 of artificial intelligence and a robot
17:52 now here's the big question for this
17:56 impending doom alarmist you know agenda
18:01 that we have here sorry I'm making fun
18:03 but the robots aren't cheap they're not
18:07 cheap
18:08 and so the big question is even though
18:10 you could replace something with a robot
18:13 is it cost-effective because this
18:16 thing's gonna need maintenance
18:17 it's gonna be programming it's just
18:20 it could get formidable really quickly
18:22 in terms of your your black ink and your
18:25 ledger now for super high paying jobs
18:29 you have a lot of leverage trying to say
18:32 that a robot could do the job better and
18:34 cheaper anyone who's working in a union
18:39 is probably going to be target number
18:42 one and it'll be the easiest group of
18:44 people to replace but the main reason
18:46 why is that they have jacked up the
18:49 hourly rates so high that it becomes
18:53 economically feasible to replace all
18:56 union labor with robots and that's going
18:59 to be the kiss of death and that'll be
19:01 the epitaph of unions and I think
19:04 that'll be literally the first target of
19:06 them all remember when I told you about
19:08 this guy talking to me about the moon
19:11 missions at NASA Ames I was waiting for
19:15 an electrician to plug my computer into
19:17 the floor at a trade show in 1991 for 65
19:22 bucks an hour really hundred and forty
19:26 grand a year something like that okay
19:30 sounds like a pretty damn good job for
19:32 thirty years ago almost right 27 years
19:35 ago whatever it is I recently read a
19:39 report where some was saying that you
19:41 know car assembly line people in unions
19:45 have wages all the way up to 70 bucks an
19:48 hour
19:49 yeah and again I don't have any
19:51 knowledge of exactly what that
19:52 particular labor does in terms of do you
19:56 you know is that the person putting in
19:57 the the engine and it's really a
19:59 high-risk situation so paying that kind
20:01 of money is worth it right I recently
20:05 heard that the you know what are the
20:09 highest paying jobs on a car lot is
20:14 seventy bucks an hour and this is
20:17 supposed to be a job like somewhere in
20:19 Michigan or something like that
20:21 so I don't know if that particular labor
20:23 on assembly line makes sense this is
20:26 someone plugging all the electronics you
20:28 know anything goes wrong with a car
20:30 period you got a huge recall on your
20:33 hands you've got to do free service on
20:35 the car so these people are extremely
20:36 important workers but at that level of
20:41 pay there just might be again a reason
20:44 to do this so to replace them with
20:46 robots and so what do you do if you're
20:48 in a union you can't just say I don't
20:50 want to be in the Union or hey guys
20:51 maybe we should bring it reduce our
20:53 hourly wages no one's gonna say that but
20:56 it could be the very kiss of death
20:58 that's going to be the end of them so
21:01 then the question is will the Union do
21:04 any research and figure out hey yeah a
21:07 big giant portion of our workers are
21:09 going to be replaced our high wages are
21:11 the catalysts for this entire movement
21:13 so we need to move our labor force out
21:16 of being replaced by robots to being
21:21 robot technicians now if you know buddy
21:25 know anyone in this situation I'll tell
21:27 you one of the things you can get into
21:28 that does not require a tremendous
21:31 amount of super technical knowledge but
21:33 it's actually programming the robots
21:35 that do any sort of armature stuff right
21:39 the ones that you know pick up a quarter
21:43 panel and put it in place or do anything
21:45 with little hand you can do what's
21:48 called waypoint programming where you
21:51 it's it's almost like a puppeteering
21:54 thing you move it with your hand to
21:57 where you think it should be and you
21:58 adjust any one of its clamps or whatever
22:00 and then you push a button and then the
22:02 software remembers this is where we need
22:05 to be and then you move to the next
22:07 place in the next place the next place
22:09 and there's all kinds of theories about
22:10 exactly how it moves from one place to
22:12 another so you you know you could swing
22:15 your arm through a crowd and hit
22:17 everybody in the face or you could pull
22:19 your hand back move it to the side and
22:21 reach out and you've missed hitting
22:22 everybody in the face so those are some
22:24 of the theories that you can learn as
22:26 far as I understand it's very
22:27 straightforward it's a very high-paying
22:30 job the more robots the more service is
22:34 going to take place
22:35 and you could be literally be on top of
22:37 this to the point you might have been
22:38 making 20 bucks an hour and now you're
22:40 making 80 bucks an hour so this gets us
22:44 to the second phase which is what do we
22:45 do with all this labor now currently in
22:49 the United States of America we have
22:50 something called the leave all children
22:53 behind oh wait no leave no child behind
22:57 core curriculum in this country the
23:01 truth of the matter is is that a handful
23:04 of schools use it the way I think the
23:05 optimal designers of the program meant
23:08 which is that they get extremely
23:12 creative about how they teach subjects
23:13 such the kids retain it better I've
23:15 talked to her principal at a school here
23:17 locally and he said you know core
23:18 curriculum isn't bad he goes no one's
23:20 teaching it the way it was designed and
23:22 there's a ton of loopholes with this
23:25 every Child Left Behind thing which
23:27 takes a bunch of Nimrods and gives them
23:30 a passing grade instead of holding them
23:32 back and so you have a ton of kids that
23:35 are graduating high school with a barely
23:39 the comprehension of reading and
23:41 absolutely no no capability of doing
23:44 arithmetic their written skills and
23:47 communication skills are horrible did
23:51 you imagine taking a kid you know
23:53 doesn't matter what color they are a lot
23:55 of kids talk this sort of gangster
23:57 Ebonics [ __ ] and I would I would
24:00 wager it's more white kids nowadays than
24:02 in anybody else but you were to take one
24:04 of those kids from today and you take a
24:07 time-machine
24:07 trip back 70 years and put him in a
24:09 school in 1955 anywhere in the United
24:12 States of America and they start
24:14 speaking this crap immediate f+ on all
24:18 their cards they can't do math you get a
24:20 [ __ ] F dude you can't articulate you
24:25 can't pass your vocabulary test you
24:27 can't pass a physical I mean you can't
24:30 play dodgeball you can't play baseball
24:33 or whatever fail fail fail that's the
24:36 wet whoa that's what would happen in
24:37 1955 and the kid would go through some
24:40 traumatic you know probably bunch of
24:42 horseshit and then eventually probably
24:45 suck it up because every other kids
24:47 getting a passing grade
24:49 if it's a boy once to date a girl she's
24:53 gonna say you know you're you're
24:55 [ __ ] you know you're really not that
24:58 smart I'm not gonna date you and the
25:00 kid's gonna go oh my god I gotta get my
25:01 act together and then all sudden social
25:03 pressures to just get to the basics the
25:08 3 R's right changes and they have to
25:12 adapt and it's mother of invention and
25:15 that kid would probably be cleansed all
25:18 the way up hopefully we can get him
25:19 earlier than senior year in high school
25:22 but when I was in high school I had at
25:25 least one guy in my grade that failed
25:27 and you know he was a guy that was like
25:31 he wasn't dumb which is the funny thing
25:33 I mean he was or interesting thing I
25:35 should say but he just you know he was
25:37 just when he's like man whatever man I
25:39 don't need to go to school kind of thing
25:40 and I was a photographer in yearbook a
25:43 my senior year and they said you got to
25:45 go take someone's picture
25:47 I said why says well you didn't show up
25:49 for the formal pictures we gotta have a
25:51 picture for him in that yearbook I said
25:52 okay and then they told me you know I
25:56 said well you know is this gonna go on
25:58 the senior pictures because we already
25:59 finished those pages like no no he's
26:01 being held back and so all in one swoop
26:04 I'm I'm like you know I'm being very
26:06 cool with the guy you know I'm not
26:07 saying anything about it
26:09 some guys are dicks no book room I
26:11 didn't say anything and he smiled he
26:13 kind of looked at me like yeah I [ __ ]
26:15 up like it's all right dude let me just
26:17 get a good picture of you and I put him
26:18 against the wall but his face is sort of
26:21 like yeah
26:23 yes I won't you know I won't screw
26:26 around anymore because the second he
26:27 stays in high school he's either got a
26:30 dropout or stay in right I mean in terms
26:31 of the school's jurisdiction over him
26:34 but the kid was 18 years old gonna go
26:36 back into actually I guess he was gonna
26:40 be held back and do senior year again
26:43 hopefully God but the educational system
26:48 in America couldn't be any lower than it
26:51 is now it's horrible but now we have
26:55 this huge set of changes that are coming
27:01 over the next 20 to 50 years
27:03 something has to give here because it's
27:07 going to be a situation where we live in
27:09 our own country but we're not capable of
27:10 running our own country because we're so
27:13 damn stupid and obviously education has
27:16 always been attacked by sort of the
27:19 European banking cartel when it comes to
27:21 American education they want a stupid
27:23 docile so they can take us over and get
27:26 back what they believe is their property
27:27 which is this country part of its they
27:31 think that America is their property
27:33 because they financed its inception the
27:36 second part is we're not in their
27:39 control apparatus if we are independent
27:43 and sovereign so they've you know if
27:45 they're the sixteenth amendment the
27:48 private for-profit Federal Reserve Bank
27:50 controls out the creation of our money
27:53 and so they pretty much have us by the
27:55 short hairs right now there is great
27:59 hope that in the next six years we're
28:01 gonna lose even that shackle on our
28:05 wrists but now let me tell you a little
28:08 story that can hopefully give you some
28:12 perspective on this because I think it's
28:14 a gigantic impact for a very small thing
28:22 so America is about three hundred fifty
28:24 million people right so we're thinking
28:27 we have millions and millions and
28:30 millions of people that need to be
28:31 educated up to this level and the answer
28:32 is you know or the reality is the answer
28:35 is yes we need to do that tens of
28:37 millions of people as soon as you get to
28:39 a level of needing to work in the normal
28:44 world you need to be at this level I'll
28:48 try to remember to loop back on the
28:49 movie run away too because that's pretty
28:51 interesting example as well but I come
28:54 from this tiny town that ever I talk
28:57 about all the time I've tried to lay off
28:58 it a little bit lately but we had some
29:02 we had an amazing educational system
29:05 there I think hopefully it's still
29:06 really vibrant
29:08 I think the genetic pool was was and
29:13 hopefully still is really hefty in terms
29:16 of brain power
29:18 but we had inventor after inventor after
29:21 inventor in that town that was just off
29:24 the chain
29:25 they made their mark in history I'll
29:28 give you some examples the radar gun
29:31 there were two brands of radar gun in
29:34 the United States of America at least
29:36 and by 1981 was called mph which I guess
29:39 was 4-4 miles per hour and the other one
29:41 was custom with a k' custom electronics
29:44 actually started by got anybody Ross who
29:48 invented a set of amplifiers that were
29:51 actually used Ted Nugent believe it or
29:53 not uses custom amplifiers and are made
29:55 in my own town I don't think they're not
29:56 made anymore so like Marshalls except
29:59 the company's gone you know second thing
30:04 but Ross created was that tube the Peter
30:07 Frampton and Zapp Roger uses when they
30:09 put that tube in their mouth and they
30:11 can use a keyboard Saul that more bounce
30:14 to the ounce and california by dre that
30:18 tube was invented in my little hometown
30:20 there was a very famous bug repellents
30:23 that you'll see in almost every vietnam
30:25 movie i think it may have even been used
30:28 a little bit in world war ii and maybe
30:30 korea but when you see full-metal-jacket
30:33 every time you see this little bottle
30:35 that's attached up inside the helmet
30:36 that's a bug repellant created in my
30:39 hometown interesting bird view satellite
30:42 dish one of the first home consumer
30:44 satellite dishes in the United States of
30:46 America the big ol kind you know was
30:49 invented in my hometown there was a kid
30:52 I should mention his name is a very
30:56 ironic name but he ported the PC version
30:59 of Google Earth to the Macintosh and
31:03 he's well known for being one of the
31:06 geniuses I think I might have gone to
31:08 school I think he was two grades ahead
31:09 of me he might be one of the geniuses
31:11 that I watched programming chess games
31:13 and that kind of stuff if that's the kid
31:15 he was super inspirational to me and I
31:16 just never caught his name yours truly
31:19 you know participate in things like
31:21 doing turbo tax and that kind of thing
31:22 what was called a different name back in
31:24 the day so the idea is a little tiny
31:27 town can invent a
31:30 Mendes amount of product for the entire
31:32 country to enjoy look at Steve job and
31:35 Steve Wozniak - Steve's right out of
31:38 Silicon Valley create one of the
31:41 greatest companies that's ever existed
31:43 in the history of the 20th century slash
31:45 21st century Tim Cook's version set
31:50 aside right but what's in it what ends
31:53 up happening is when you're in this
31:54 world where you're surrounded by all
31:56 this invention then you sort of you live
32:01 in a world where it's your turn to do
32:03 something amazing if any of you study
32:06 the the creation of hip-hop and rap out
32:09 of the sort of mid 70s and up and you
32:14 look at there's great documentaries on
32:15 Netflix about it you have all these guys
32:18 in the urban areas of New York and
32:20 eventually Los Angeles but first in New
32:22 York where they were doing all these
32:24 mixes you know Afrika Bambaataa and all
32:26 these guys doing this all this amazing
32:28 stuff then the rappers got on top of it
32:30 and the rapper's went after each other
32:32 and got better and better and better
32:34 from you know Run DMC kool Moe Dee
32:36 Kurtis Blow I mean the names are endless
32:40 Cool J and all those folks right and
32:43 those are the late comers you know Red
32:44 Alert and all these dudes so when you're
32:48 in those communities it can be the most
32:50 exciting thing in the world and then it
32:51 was break dancing you know and so when
32:55 the 90s came around as I always say in
32:59 this country I don't know about other
33:00 countries being a loser
33:03 was the number one goal on every my new
33:07 level of cultural measurement you were
33:10 supposed to dress like a bum your music
33:13 went from you know really ornate skills
33:18 to absolutely core power chords rap went
33:22 from hey get out of the ghetto and
33:24 toughen up and get your game to smoke
33:28 dope beat your woman and let your change
33:32 hang low you know so now we're in sort
33:36 of the apocalypse of Education in
33:38 America where kids kind of want to learn
33:41 stuff and some kids are actually
33:43 Rochas Lee learning new things and other
33:45 kids are just absolutely overwhelmed you
33:49 know they're vaccinated you know to the
33:51 point where they can't pay attention
33:52 they're on all this adderall and all
33:54 this other ADHD stuff and as this
33:59 there's a I just ran into this girl one
34:02 of our listeners posted it and it's this
34:07 kid is amazing
34:08 she calls herself Lt Corbis co RB is its
34:13 LT Corbis
34:14 her channel I don't know if it's her
34:16 channel but her channel on youtubes
34:18 called Soph s o pH and she's a 13 year
34:22 old kid with probably an IQ very close
34:26 to 180 and I'm not exaggerating this
34:30 kids vocabulary is unbelievable now
34:33 she's very rated R and rated mature for
34:36 a 13 year old but she's using language
34:39 as much as it might offend some
34:42 snowflakes she's using it in a very
34:44 intelligent way and she sort of just fed
34:46 up 13 she's like she's fed up like a 45
34:50 year old dude it's unbelievable but this
34:53 kid is bringing up subjects that are
34:55 very touchy she gets a little bit into
34:56 the social interaction on YouTube but
34:59 lately she if I watch all of our videos
35:01 chronologically she kind of got rid of
35:03 you know responding to people's hate on
35:06 social media but this kid is hitting
35:09 subjects like you know apparently 30 49
35:16 states out of 50 in the knighted States
35:17 of America allowed child marriage and
35:20 she outlines it beautifully
35:22 we're from the age of some states it's
35:25 as low as 12 years old for a female and
35:28 as long as the parent gives consent to a
35:30 grown adult they get married off to
35:35 these adults and because a child can't
35:36 file court cases in their own behalf
35:38 because they're under 18 they're stuck
35:40 in these marriages until they're 18
35:42 child service protection they
35:45 automatically can't through
35:47 jurisdictional limitations touch the kid
35:49 because they're married now and if you
35:53 think the numbers are exaggerated the
35:57 amount of
35:57 kids married I think between 2000 and
36:00 2010 out of all 49 states was a hundred
36:04 and sixty-seven thousand kids were
36:06 married to specifically people over 18
36:09 and I guess the average is damn near 20
36:12 years older so adults are marrying kids
36:17 and claiming religious providence right
36:19 my religion says I can do this well we
36:23 know the Muslims Sharia law has
36:25 basically no age limit for marrying kids
36:28 because they're marrying them as low as
36:29 seven years old in Europe no one's
36:31 saying anything the she says that the
36:34 Jewish religion allows 13 and up and the
36:39 Catholic doctrine is 14 and up for girls
36:41 boys are always like two years old now
36:45 when I was a kid in school we had some
36:48 kids drop out of school at 14 because
36:50 they were marrying other minors so 14
36:52 year old was marrying a 16 year old and
36:54 so there's no statutory rape situations
36:56 there it's all proved by both parents
36:58 and the one girl that did that in my
37:00 junior high I met her later and she was
37:02 the most well-adjusted articulate person
37:06 and I she had I think four kids or
37:08 something like that so she just knew she
37:09 wanted to be a mom so it's not like you
37:13 can't work but with today's education
37:15 boy I would hate to visit that house but
37:19 now education in America is protected by
37:21 what a union we have the teachers union
37:25 in my experience you know I don't know
37:28 what tremendous amount about it Steve
37:31 Jobs was very petrified by the
37:34 educational process in the mid-90s and
37:37 up he tried to do some things to help
37:39 out the education but in my from
37:42 probably out the age of 19 and up what I
37:46 have seen the teachers union do most of
37:48 all is protect pedophile teachers just
37:52 like the Catholic Church moving them all
37:54 around the place it's amazing you know
37:56 it's like gym teachers and drama
37:57 teachers are like the headquarters of
38:00 molestation when I went to school and
38:02 junior high we had an art teacher that
38:04 was known for teaching photography which
38:09 was his way of getting a bunch of girls
38:11 in the darkroom by themselves and was
38:14 sadly overlooked when he would do a Joe
38:18 Biden on them in the in the darkroom now
38:21 I personally never witnessed any of this
38:22 but I had one close friend of mine who
38:26 would come out of the room and she would
38:28 look at you know us dudes and we're
38:31 almost routinely asked her what did he
38:32 do this time you know and he wasn't a
38:34 grabby kind of guy in terms of like
38:36 hands on body parts but he was
38:39 definitely a push up against kind of guy
38:42 so again I'm not making an accusation
38:44 but that was definitely you could see it
38:46 in this girl's face that she wasn't she
38:48 tried to laugh it off that part of it
38:50 was like you know Computer Engineering
38:54 one of the areas where we believe were
38:57 safe what's funny as I'm learning some
39:01 new platforms on the web but I wrote my
39:04 own platform five years ago and the
39:07 platform I roads largely codeless you
39:11 don't have a chance to make any syntax
39:13 errors because I'm doing all of it for
39:14 you
39:15 you just teach me your database you
39:17 teach me you're using a wizard you teach
39:19 me your associations drop-down list all
39:22 that stuff all your crud buttons are all
39:24 taken care of for you so you don't have
39:27 any issues so I can tell you from my own
39:30 engineering prowess code will eventually
39:33 be either so simple to write that a kid
39:36 can do it like like it used to be when I
39:38 was a kid or it'll be completely
39:40 automated and you know when you when you
39:42 watch these Star Trek episodes and these
39:43 people say computer you know do a
39:46 simulation on this and you'll see like
39:47 you know fantastical things or they'll
39:49 say they got a little sample of DNA you
39:51 know and they'll say okay computer you
39:53 know render this being and it looks at
39:55 the DNA and it figures out how to
39:56 construct the the animal of course that
40:01 have to be looking at the protein
40:02 patterns like the DNA but whatever we
40:04 have to keep everybody stupid about how
40:06 the body works now what you need to know
40:10 because I'm involved more recently in a
40:14 project that's taking on these issues
40:17 there's a lot of really smart people out
40:19 there and I mean when I say smart it's
40:24 like
40:25 to quantify their intelligence I'm not
40:27 saying their social skills but their
40:29 intelligence in these areas is pretty
40:31 phenomenal
40:33 what I found out in getting involved
40:35 with this recent project is that you
40:38 might think you're informed about these
40:39 subjects until you hear someone who's
40:41 really informed about these subjects
40:42 then you're like oh my god I have I have
40:45 only read the brochure of this PhD
40:49 degree that these other people have and
40:51 they're they're way past their PhD and
40:55 they're thinking about all this stuff
40:58 you know 100 years out and these people
41:02 care about humanity
41:04 they really do whether or not they are
41:06 attached to a corporation that seems to
41:08 not care or they're part of the five
41:09 eyes or whatever doesn't matter these
41:12 individuals are not sociopaths to the
41:15 level they're trying to erase humanity
41:18 you know there are issues like you know
41:20 population control which is hey guys for
41:24 China 1.4 billions to many people you
41:29 need to bring your population down you
41:30 just do you can't just keep prokhor
41:32 eating and taking over everyone else's
41:34 country slowly you're gonna have to calm
41:36 down a little bit
41:37 same with India India needs to increase
41:39 its education and and give people a
41:43 dream besides just sitting around
41:44 procreating because that's the only game
41:47 in town South America needs to get an
41:50 indoctrination from religion so that the
41:53 bravado and a man isn't all about
41:55 cranking out kids it's got to be more
41:57 than that we're not saying don't have
41:59 kids but again if a couple has two kids
42:01 believe me they got plenty of kids on
42:03 their hands to deal with they're capable
42:06 of saving money and putting them through
42:08 college because they don't have too many
42:09 kids right once you go over to kids you
42:11 know just just putting one kid through
42:14 college without a college loan it's
42:17 tough you know my family we were able to
42:20 do that for my daughter so she has no
42:22 college loans at all but if I'd had two
42:25 kids one I was gonna have to take loans
42:27 or both of them are gonna have to take
42:29 loans and of course the game in town is
42:32 the rich people get to have kids and
42:34 poor people don't eventually that's what
42:36 they want to make
42:38 possible what I have heard recently
42:42 which is a good indicator that things
42:45 might be changing is that most even just
42:49 above-average thinkers in this country
42:52 even commentators and news shows are now
42:54 starting to say that the university
42:56 system in the United States of America
42:58 especially related to you know degrees
43:02 and loans the loan program is completely
43:04 out of control it's going up and up and
43:07 up because no one's regulating this now
43:11 again a private Ivy League college like
43:13 you know Caltech or MIT or Princeton or
43:17 Yale or Stanford they can do that they
43:20 can keep their degrees at half a million
43:22 dollars a pop because you don't have to
43:25 go there and only some schools really
43:29 have the reputation of sending you home
43:32 with a massive education Harvard is a
43:35 good example for what I understand it's
43:39 harder to get into Harvard than it is to
43:41 actually finish the degree because they
43:42 have their degrees so well ironed out
43:45 that you really come out ready to rock
43:47 and roll and most of it is to unand are
43:54 ver does is right from the very
43:55 beginning your orientation is all about
43:58 hey we're not here to work for other
44:00 people we're here to get people to work
44:02 for us
44:03 but the state colleges are just full of
44:06 all these degrees that we talk about on
44:08 this show completely unemployable
44:10 degrees and the college's know the
44:14 colleges know that your employment
44:16 opportunities after taking after
44:19 probably getting at least half of their
44:21 degrees that they're charging you 100
44:23 grand for twenty-five twenty to
44:27 twenty-five thousand dollars a year
44:28 which used to be Pepperdine money back
44:31 in 2003
44:32 Pepperdine is this kind of religious
44:35 although it's not really anymore but
44:37 used to be this Christian based College
44:39 in Malibu it still exists but there's
44:41 almost no Americans going to the college
44:43 anymore because they keep raising their
44:46 tuition and so they solicit kids from
44:48 other countries to come over who don't
44:51 have to pay
44:51 that kind of stuff so they come over and
44:53 they just pay raw fees to get in so what
44:58 are the solutions let's say you're young
45:01 and you're looking at another 50 to 40
45:05 to 50 years of definitely healthy
45:07 working life before you ever going to
45:09 get into some sort of retirement or even
45:11 you want to retire
45:13 well artificial intelligence let's take
45:17 a look at it for a split second again I
45:19 did an episode way back I think it's
45:20 episode 3
45:22 you know this whole scare tactic that
45:25 Elon Musk came out and Stephen W Hawking
45:28 came out in the same week and said that
45:30 oh you know artificial intelligence is
45:33 scary
45:34 I had to recently hear that line
45:37 repeated and I didn't get a chance to
45:40 get my word in edgewise but the the
45:43 follow-up question is okay mr. musk and
45:47 mr. Hawking why don't just come out and
45:52 say some alarmist statement without
45:54 saying why I've never heard a single
45:56 example from either one of those guys
45:58 when I was dead now but not a single
46:00 example of why they were afraid well
46:04 there's two real forms of being afraid
46:06 of artificial intelligence one is the
46:09 academic one that we're talking about
46:10 now
46:11 where computers will through big machine
46:14 learning eventually develop their neural
46:17 nets to like some Westworld level or
46:19 some Star Trek Enterprise computer level
46:22 where you're gonna be out of a job
46:23 because it can do your job for you okay
46:27 that's a substantial threat but that's
46:29 quite a ways away
46:32 the second fear really has to do with
46:37 the militarization of robots which is
46:39 where you get into you're sort of Metal
46:42 Gear Solid world and was that guy Hyodo
46:48 that dude is on the in man that guy
46:51 knows something because Metal Gear Solid
46:52 3 for the PlayStation 3 was already
46:54 pretty pretty unbelievable in terms of
46:57 its real-world examples of I think all
47:01 the things that were in Metal Gear Solid
47:04 3 and I'll explain that just a second
47:06 seem to be very real very plausible and
47:09 the two main things that were inside
47:11 that video game was that soldiers were
47:14 being given a chip for their brain and
47:17 and black mayor did this too we're
47:19 essentially controls aspects of your
47:22 mind
47:22 in black mirror it was a soldier that
47:25 was having his vision completely changed
47:27 so he would look at a rose as an example
47:30 this didn't happen in the episode but he
47:31 looked at a rose and maybe he'd see a
47:34 daisy or tulip you know but a completely
47:37 over wrote a pattern recognition system
47:42 that's plausible now whether or not they
47:45 can wire that into the visual cortex of
47:46 a man and take over things well just
47:48 give us 10 20 more years and imagine
47:52 that the benefits package you reduce the
47:54 world down to some totalitarian things
47:56 and dystopian world and so your
48:01 privileges that you want are only going
48:03 to happen if you become a soldier or if
48:05 you join the executive branch and you're
48:07 you're pushing this totalitarian thing
48:10 down on the people but there's always
48:13 just a few people at the top and a lot
48:14 of people at the bottom the other thing
48:17 he did extremely accurate in this video
48:19 game was portray robots taking over
48:22 cities and being the military force and
48:25 he had these big giant things that look
48:28 like the back end of a cow except
48:31 they're beautiful robots but they were
48:33 gigantic you know they were the size of
48:36 probably 15 feet tall walking around
48:40 with a whole gunship on top and so you
48:44 look at Boston Dynamics you know they're
48:46 not creating robots to fix you a ham
48:48 sandwich they're creating robots to take
48:51 over cities to be the military force of
48:54 the future you look all over the world
48:57 especially in Asia and they're starting
48:58 to create the mechs like I said in a
49:00 previous episode which may or may not
49:02 have aired at this point so for me a
49:07 little bit of AI inside of a robot that
49:09 has every single capability of sensing
49:12 whether or not you're alive without your
49:14 human size alive or a dog sized alive
49:16 and then it has you know a few
49:20 thousand rounds of ammunition in it
49:22 believe me you're gonna do what it says
49:25 we've had chappie
49:28 the show chappie by neill blomkamp you
49:30 had district 9 by Blume camp he shown
49:32 you what pretty sophisticated robots can
49:35 do and I think quite frankly we are
49:38 probably less than 50 years away from
49:41 having a chappie as a police officer a
49:44 very humanoid looking robot full
49:49 cognitive capabilities of having a
49:51 conversation with you but as other black
49:54 mirrors have demonstrated once you turn
49:58 loose an AI in the world in the form of
50:01 a robot even if it's a tiny little bee
50:04 because we've killed all the bees off in
50:06 the world I mean what a crazy episode
50:09 that was right I think it's the final
50:12 episode of season 3 I think see the
50:14 three or season two that stuff's coming
50:17 if they want it now we'll warn you and
50:21 hopefully dispel out of your fear pool
50:24 there's a tremendous amount of fake
50:27 stuff going around the web about insect
50:30 robots you see now these things I've
50:33 seen where a lot of these have gone
50:36 they're still very primitive at this
50:38 point but they will get to the point of
50:39 some of these pictures that go around
50:42 but you have people that again don't
50:43 understand computer graphics and so you
50:47 have an art student who is generating
50:49 some cute little robotic bee or
50:53 dragonfly or a roach or whatever and
50:56 they put of course some sort of sensor
50:59 fake sensors on them and they unleash
51:03 this photograph and then people have
51:05 pushed this one photograph around this
51:06 bug robot as if it's real yeah some
51:11 extreme circumstance there would be
51:13 something that's probably real like the
51:15 roach in was it fifth element that was
51:18 spying on the president eventually
51:20 scandal crushes it with his hand so yeah
51:25 some of those basic basic systems can
51:27 work but here's the problem with
51:29 generating these robots and deploying
51:30 them to the world to do something
51:32 nefarious
51:34 let's say we spend half a billion
51:36 dollars creating a bug that spies on
51:40 anything it wants to spy on the problem
51:45 with that theory is that as soon as it
51:46 gets
51:47 soon as it malfunctions and falls on the
51:49 ground or gets captured in some
51:53 technique it gets 'i'm peed by somebody
51:55 and these things fall on the ground then
51:58 you can take that little robot let's say
52:01 you're some enemy country of the country
52:03 that invented it and all sudden they put
52:05 it under a microscope and they can
52:07 figure out how it works and of course
52:09 they would have fried the the
52:11 programming in it if they EMP it but if
52:13 it just has a wing problem and starts
52:16 buzzing around on the ground trying to
52:17 fly but it can't and someone grabs a
52:19 thing but doesn't have some little
52:20 self-destruction node in it then your
52:25 enemies gonna catch up with you really
52:26 quick so you know in history we've
52:31 always had this Robin Hood algorithm
52:33 that is the big bait and switch for the
52:35 public that's not paying attention it's
52:38 support us support us support us in this
52:40 military endeavor to make your military
52:42 the most formidable in the entire world
52:44 thus making you safe and all it takes is
52:47 a few elections that are thrown stolen
52:50 with voter fraud or whatever and boom
52:54 you've got a you have to obviously keep
52:58 your soldiers not so smart or you remove
53:01 out of the equation the human being and
53:04 then all the sudden you just deploy
53:07 these things and start taking over one
53:08 city at a time and you know you would
53:12 have to have the equipment to take these
53:14 things out so I'm not sure again what
53:17 Elon Musk is talking about the guy never
53:19 elaborated and if you've heard him
53:20 elaborate on what he was afraid of do
53:23 let me know because I sat and watched
53:25 every interview of him you know putting
53:28 out this alarmist statement and never
53:30 had him go any further it's already
53:33 pretty damn amazing that a car can drive
53:35 you from point A to point B on average
53:38 and get you there safely while you read
53:40 a book no obviously those cars have
53:42 killed tons of people the self-driving
53:46 ones but you
53:47 eventually they'll get to the point
53:48 where that's gonna be technically
53:50 impossible worst case you'll just be
53:53 stuck in traffic because your car is
53:54 given up on trying to move you from
53:56 point A to point B and you'll need to be
53:57 towed somewhere or you need to get
53:58 behind the wheel yourself I think it's
54:01 pretty [ __ ] for them to sell cars
54:02 to drive themselves and then after they
54:04 kill someone they try to you know cite
54:09 the disclaimer in the contract this is
54:11 when oh you were supposed to be behind
54:12 the steering wheel the entire time
54:14 paying attention while the car is
54:15 driving you and if you see it do
54:16 something that's gonna harm someone
54:18 you're supposed to disengage the auto
54:20 drive and take over and it's like I
54:22 don't know about any of you've had
54:24 accidents but accidents happen in a
54:26 split second so a human being trying to
54:29 stop a car from hitting a pedestrian
54:31 crossing the road what do you have a
54:33 couple split seconds to to react it's
54:36 not enough time and the disclaimer is
54:38 kind of impossible it's like an inhumane
54:42 thing to ask of humanity it's like you
54:44 can't do it you're technically not
54:46 possible capable of doing it right but
54:49 now imagine population controls
54:51 something that we've had a conversation
54:52 about we do agree that if your country
54:56 is overpopulated then when you get
54:59 married you're only allowed one child
55:01 that way that way two people go down to
55:03 one if you divorce and change partners
55:07 well there have to be some bit of
55:09 legislation that says well if your
55:11 partner hasn't had a kid then you can
55:13 divorce and have another kid with
55:14 someone else but after that no matter
55:17 how many times you remarry you're
55:18 disqualified from participating in the
55:20 creation of another human being well
55:24 then you're out of the game and you're
55:26 literally gonna be marrying some other
55:28 person you have to literally marry
55:29 someone else has already had a kid or
55:31 not get married at all
55:32 because someone might reject you and say
55:35 well you're not allowed to procreate so
55:38 I don't wanna marry you but how do we
55:41 let's say we've had that conversation
55:42 and we recognize the need to depopulate
55:44 some countries and to sustain population
55:47 in other countries and some countries
55:50 may have plenty of real estate and
55:52 they're like look we're we're allowed to
55:53 get up to this amount before we turn on
55:56 this global legislation this agenda 21
55:59 or agenda 2030
56:00 thing now and how do we deal with that
56:06 how do we consciously go well okay we're
56:09 all going to sign this we're all going
56:11 to get into this because the rule does
56:12 need some population control and then
56:14 from that point forward aside from a
56:17 plague that goes ripping through your
56:19 country and kills you know tens of
56:20 millions of people such that you could
56:21 have more than two you'll be stuck at
56:24 two
56:25 my fear is that it will go way beyond
56:28 that it will go to the point where you
56:31 know someone will say we have to have
56:32 all your kids by a certain age otherwise
56:35 you just don't do it you have to prove
56:39 perhaps at some point that you have the
56:41 financial responsibility to have
56:42 children now it's fascinating living in
56:46 Southern California is that there's
56:47 definitely a tremendous amount of
56:49 migrant workers and you know people from
56:53 South America and they don't have a lot
56:56 of money but they work their butt off
56:58 and again we don't see this is a
57:01 distinction here it's very interesting
57:03 in Southern California you will see
57:05 homeless people begging for money on
57:07 street corners and I would tell you that
57:10 on average 80 to 90 percent of the
57:13 homeless people begging for money are
57:14 white people
57:15 I rarely really see a black person doing
57:21 it in my area but if you go to Los
57:23 Angeles it goes about 50/50 black and
57:26 white you absolutely never see an Asian
57:28 person begging for money and you never
57:30 see a Mexican person begging begging for
57:31 money and you ever see an Indian person
57:33 begging for money it's very interesting
57:36 I know you see Muslim people begging for
57:38 money so what's interesting about this
57:41 is that you know the indigenous race of
57:47 this country which I would say is easily
57:49 black-and-white and I would say that you
57:50 know there's a huge Asian community as
57:52 well that helped build this country
57:53 they're the ones that being displaced by
57:56 other human beings so in some weird
58:00 irony we have an example of how this
58:03 sort of replacement mechanism works
58:06 against the indigenous folks but again
58:10 imagine that mowing your lawn is no
58:12 longer something that human does
58:14 a robot does it I think we're quite a
58:17 ways away from doing that but let's say
58:19 it happens we whack and doing a lot more
58:22 sweeping leaf blowing all that stuff is
58:26 all taken care of by a robot well no the
58:29 sudden a giant portion of what these
58:32 migrant workers would do is gone
58:33 being a short-order cook it's gone a
58:37 robot can do it in two seconds and
58:39 always get your eggs right and always
58:40 get your waffle right and all that stuff
58:42 in fact your hamburger looks like the
58:45 picture in the menu because that's just
58:47 what happens again it's one of these
58:50 things that ties back to the theme of
58:52 the entire show which is if we got the
58:54 privilege of taking back the world then
58:57 we have to nut up and have the
58:59 responsibility of running the place
59:00 afterwards the problem with our current
59:03 structure is that the tip of the pyramid
59:05 as it's currently been allowed to
59:07 manifest itself the bankers the
59:09 oligarchs the royalty of the world and
59:11 then all their minions which are so
59:15 plentiful it's crazy
59:17 they are sociopaths with the rest of the
59:21 world and so they don't know anything
59:23 about what it's like to be us they don't
59:24 do their own laundry wash their own
59:26 dishes clean their own houses they don't
59:28 know what a gallon of milk costs loaf of
59:30 bread all that kind of stuff they don't
59:33 raise their own children they use
59:35 nannies and Butler's and all these other
59:37 kind of things to raise their kids and
59:40 they raise their kids obviously to be
59:42 equally powerful sociopaths with no
59:46 empathy of any kind and so that's why
59:50 the place looks like it's run by Satan
59:53 himself there's that old you know adage
59:56 that'll saying you know the burden of
59:58 the king and typically the problem is in
60:03 the formula itself which is that once
60:06 you become king or queen you then
60:09 inherit all of the tumultuous challenges
60:12 of being in such a role now no one
60:17 person should be put in that role at
60:20 some point you do need someone to make a
60:22 decision and obviously corporations that
60:24 have been run by committee have nearly
60:26 gone out of business Apple
60:28 pewter went from Steve Jobs pretty much
60:31 being a dictator in his own company and
60:32 usually making all the right choices
60:34 including some absolutely revolutionary
60:36 choices remembered Xerox the company at
60:41 Xerox PARC of Palo Alto California I
60:43 used to work right next to the building
60:45 where the GUI was invented I mean I
60:47 would walk out him the front door to get
60:50 into my car and the building right here
60:51 to my left was the building where Steve
60:54 Jobs went to see the first GUI the first
60:57 Mouse the first laser writer and were
61:00 Steve Liz Berger Steven Liz Berger who
61:03 wrote and directed Tron from 1982 went
61:05 to get a bunch of education but the
61:09 Steve Jobs story going to Xerox PARC is
61:12 where we need to focus our our brain
61:15 right now because there is something to
61:19 this person making a decision Xerox the
61:22 company had watched their geniuses at
61:26 Xerox PARC create the laserwriter
61:28 from scratch it didn't exist watch them
61:32 create the mouse which was a byproduct
61:34 of having created the first graphical
61:36 user interface
61:37 they voted all three objectives down
61:40 saying it was never gonna take off it
61:44 was just I don't even know what the
61:46 rationale was inside I would love to
61:48 have read the memo that told these guys
61:49 they weren't going to get what they
61:50 wanted so they were smart and said look
61:53 we know this stuff is the future a
61:56 graphical user interface your computer
61:58 has a trash can to throw files away
62:00 those folders and files and as it has to
62:03 have some sort of pointer device
62:05 it had menus they got us out of the old
62:07 DOS days where every single piece of
62:09 software was completely different you
62:11 know but they went to Steve Jobs because
62:14 they knew that guy could see the future
62:16 at least they heard the rumors about the
62:18 guy and sure enough boom they managed to
62:21 push the was that the Apple OS inside
62:25 the Lisa computer and eventually Apple
62:27 three which was a horrible both
62:30 computers for just twenty thirty years
62:33 ahead of their time
62:35 but he got the mouse standardized he got
62:38 laser writers selling out of Apple he
62:40 the GUI became the
62:41 reading system for the Macintosh
62:43 computer in 1984 and then of course
62:47 realizing they had made a gigantic
62:50 mistake the the big blue's of the world
62:53 the big IBM's of the world they ended up
62:55 coming up with a DOS computer in 1981
62:58 and of course Steve our sorry Bill Gates
63:01 being shared this coveted new interface
63:04 immediately started ripping it off with
63:06 Windows and I always remind you Apple
63:09 gave Xerox 110 million dollars of shares
63:12 out of their company to pay for the
63:14 privilege of using that invention those
63:16 inventions and Microsoft didn't they
63:19 just took it because it became a
63:23 gigantic arm of the five eyes to spy on
63:26 everybody's computers when they had to
63:28 go to legislate it the federal
63:33 government just says you can't patent
63:35 this and gave gave the whole thing to
63:38 Microsoft for free so when we talk about
63:42 how to re-engineer the world to deal
63:44 with these real serious issues different
63:49 areas of the world have different
63:50 requirements you know we're gonna have
63:53 agricultural based countries for another
63:56 several hundred years to come now
64:00 whether or not it runs into robots doing
64:02 the work well that's where we're gonna
64:03 see things change this is where we come
64:05 back to the movie run away run away as a
64:09 movie that Tom Selleck was in and gene
64:12 Simmons from kiss if you ever want to
64:15 see gene Simmons really kick the living
64:21 [ __ ] out of acting run away is one of
64:24 those movies and it was uh what was
64:27 fascinating about it especially if you
64:28 look at flight was it was a three twenty
64:34 or three whatever the one that
64:35 disappeared out of Malaysia Tom Selleck
64:38 was a guy that ran out and he was sort
64:42 of uh kind of sort of a Blade Runner 1.0
64:45 he would run out to robots that had lost
64:47 their minds and he would disable them
64:49 and one of the very first things he runs
64:51 out to was a farm where a particular
64:53 robot had gone
64:55 and it was just destroying the crops
64:57 just running around chopping down all
64:58 the crops was supposed to be obviously
65:00 harvesting the crop yes he disables it
65:03 now in the back story you have gene
65:05 Simmons character who was playing a guy
65:10 who had secured a new arm chip and it
65:16 was capable of just thinking and doing
65:18 all kinds of wild stuff and so this arm
65:20 chip company was sabotage by gene
65:24 simmons personally where he got the copy
65:26 of the chips and killed the guy that had
65:28 the recipe for it or whatever and so
65:31 he's this evil kind of Lex Luthor kind
65:33 of guy that's going to start demonizing
65:35 robots to do his bidding it's a great
65:39 movie
65:40 I mean it's antiquated now in terms of
65:41 what the robots look like but if anybody
65:44 is looking to redo a movie that'd be a
65:46 great one to redo but a couple things
65:49 they put in the movie that was sort of
65:51 interesting is one they had these little
65:52 spider robots which again today look
65:55 really antiquated but if you
65:56 fast-forward up to the black mirror
65:58 robots which was like the the end of
66:00 last season for the final episode of
66:02 season 4 you get to see what you know a
66:06 little robot with its own little brain
66:08 and some weapons and it can do it's
66:10 pretty formidable the other thing he did
66:13 which was just starting to get its way
66:16 in the military today I'm pretty sure it
66:18 exists to a certain extent was that they
66:20 built this gigantic bullet it's about
66:24 the size of a five five six or a 380 and
66:28 it had a like rocket engine in it that
66:32 could actually do like retro rocketing
66:36 so the bullet could actually change
66:37 directions and go and it actually had
66:39 your DNA pattern in this arm ship inside
66:43 the bullet so you just fire the bullet
66:44 in a crowd and it will zip around the
66:47 crowd till finds you and then hits you
66:48 and Tom Selleck gets one of his bullets
66:52 shot at him once at one point by gene
66:54 and he's got to run his ass off to try
66:56 and divert the bullet into like a wall
66:57 and he eventually succeeds and this
67:01 won't ruin any of the movie for you at
67:02 all
67:02 but obviously at the end the was a
67:06 showdown between the two of these guys
67:09 definitely worth seeing probably one I
67:11 should have put in my forgotten sci-fi
67:13 films we know that the politicians of
67:16 the world today are corrupt beyond
67:18 anyone's imagination and I say that very
67:22 literally even for the most imaginative
67:24 person who can see conspiracies these
67:27 folks have got schemes where you know in
67:30 my opinion they learned it off the Mafia
67:33 if you study the Italian mafia it's not
67:39 just the Italians but their I almost
67:41 feel obligated to give them the credit
67:42 for this they you know they were the
67:47 ones that mastered post's British opium
67:53 schemes they they would see something
67:57 that they could exploit and so they were
67:58 the ones that really got as far as I
68:01 have heard it cocaine and heroin heroin
68:04 was an old product but cocaine getting
68:07 it moved to Colombia to be grown and
68:09 then distributed around the world the
68:11 Mafia was the first group of folks to do
68:13 that and then the CIA looked at him for
68:14 10 years figured out the entire business
68:18 model and then moved to wipe out the
68:21 Mafia so they could take it over one of
68:25 the other big scams was the gasoline
68:30 smuggling so you would have these gas
68:32 stations all over the East Coast and the
68:35 gas is being brought in refined from
68:38 some other location and they were able
68:40 to sell gas at these cutthroat rates or
68:43 at least at the same rate and but their
68:44 profit was 100 percent because somehow
68:47 they were able to hide a lot of their
68:49 profits underneath a normal taxation
68:51 system but again that gets taken over
68:55 today's scams are extremely deep you
69:00 have countries attacking other countries
69:03 oil rigs and blaming it on accidents or
69:06 mismanagement the big Gulf BP spill that
69:11 actually occurred again I got it from
69:13 two degrees away from one of the VPS of
69:15 BP and they truly believed at the top of
69:18 that company that that their rig was
69:20 attacked
69:21 and you look at who benefits from such a
69:24 thing and it's gonna be all the other
69:25 oil companies so it was like you're not
69:27 allowed to take that much out of the
69:28 Gulf I guess was someone what is
69:29 someone's decision and so they suffered
69:33 a gigantic loss of oil collection but
69:36 they also suffered a massive global PR
69:39 problem when their rig spilled a ton of
69:41 oil into the Gulf and again there's a
69:47 cover story that a part wasn't serviced
69:49 and all that kind of stuff
69:50 believe me the person who shared their
69:53 opinion of this said look that was
69:55 serviced you know within a couple months
69:58 that brought that part was not on any
70:00 any jeopardy of failing etc etc but now
70:05 we have corruption at the level of you
70:10 know a country will ask for aid from the
70:12 rest of the world and they will raise
70:13 again a hundred million dollars for or
70:16 even a ten billion dollars over ten
70:17 years or something in aid but the aid
70:20 gets shipped to the country and a giant
70:23 majority of the aid goes to some 5i
70:25 organization that helps set up the aid
70:27 package in the first place and then the
70:30 whatever is left twenty percent of the
70:31 money that's left goes to the
70:32 politicians who brought it into the
70:35 country and then they they basically
70:37 smuggle it all into their own personal
70:39 bank accounts and the people never see
70:41 anything that's why you give away a lot
70:43 of aid around the world and these
70:45 countries are still in you know the
70:47 stone Age's there's I think substantial
70:51 evidence that at least one female super
70:54 PAC politician was working with one of
70:57 the five eye organizations and dealt
71:00 with gun smuggling to furnish these
71:03 terrorist organizations with guns and so
71:05 they were having potentially North Korea
71:09 would be given the schematic of a very
71:12 secret weapon not secret secret but
71:15 weapons that only military can have
71:16 they're manufacturing it they get the
71:18 raw materials to get they provide the
71:20 slave labor then the guns are
71:23 manufactured they get their cash there's
71:25 a kickback to the politician and then
71:28 boom it goes off to some terrorist
71:29 organization to fight our soldiers so
71:32 that's why the Great Awakening is so
71:34 important
71:35 to reset everything it's SuperDuper
71:37 important the corruption that's out
71:38 there right now you know we can't afford
71:41 to put nationalism in front of the
71:48 justice that needs to be served and what
71:51 I mean by that is I think even currently
71:54 with the current administration in
71:55 America there's this notion of saying
71:58 well we're going to conceal a lot of the
72:04 crimes that are happening but we're
72:05 going to address them and get these
72:07 people out of office on the back end the
72:09 problem is this society then gets robbed
72:12 of the ability to learn about what the
72:14 corruption really was now the good news
72:17 is the Great Awakening is actually
72:19 spreading these true crimes to all the
72:21 people that are paying attention and
72:23 regardless again if the 17 movement is
72:26 real or not the 17 movement is utterly
72:27 exposed the issues that I'm talking
72:31 about go back to the theme of the
72:33 episode your right brain is where you
72:36 can hide all of your skills or I
72:39 shouldn't say hide but develop all of
72:41 your skills to postpone your own
72:43 personal loss from this exponential
72:45 change that's coming over the next 50
72:47 years I'm always talking about creative
72:50 endeavors on this show because one I
72:52 think you're right brain needs a lot of
72:54 stimulation for you to truly enjoy life
72:55 and not become a slave now's the time to
73:02 go and accentuate your right brain if
73:04 you're young don't overlook all those
73:07 things that the adults scoff at that are
73:09 creative whether you be an artist
73:11 you know artists in all kinds of
73:13 different things you know someone
73:16 recently posted a really great comment
73:18 in the in the section I apologize for
73:21 not remembering exactly he said I kind
73:22 of suspected my brain but I want to get
73:24 it wrong but they said well you know I
73:27 heard that writing code is not an art
73:30 it's more of a mechanical execution and
73:32 I would say yes and no there are
73:36 tremendous amount of coders that are
73:38 probably the majority of coders are
73:40 simply robots they just rinse and repeat
73:43 rinse and repeat but the ones that
73:45 actually change the world are those that
73:47 think creative
73:49 now I personally think that coding has
73:53 become absurdly complicated looking at
73:55 the recent platforms that have been
73:56 released they're very functional but you
74:00 can tell that some really left-brain
74:02 folks set their goals extremely low and
74:04 I would say that honestly over the the
74:07 last 10 years the coding of this world
74:11 has regressed and probably almost thirty
74:14 years back we're sitting inside you know
74:17 terminal text editors now as if GUI
74:20 editors don't exist it's just really
74:22 strange
74:23 you have to you know rebuild all your
74:28 development environments and your local
74:29 computers instead of using the cloud now
74:31 there's some benefits to that the coding
74:34 shouldn't be hard coding should probably
74:36 be very symbolic should be node based a
74:42 lot of programming environments are this
74:44 way if you get into those little micro
74:46 computers like the Arduino or the
74:47 Raspberry Pi our dueño has you write
74:49 something called skits straight up top
74:53 down coding
74:54 Raspberry Pi has a editor that's all
74:57 node based and so it's syntax free you
75:00 can talk to any one of the sensors any
75:03 one of the data from any one of the
75:04 sensors operate motors all that stuff
75:07 without having to write a single line of
75:09 code that's the future so if you're in
75:13 one of those and divisions of labor just
75:16 know that that's gonna eventually get to
75:17 the point where like it was back in the
75:21 day your dentist can write his own
75:24 inventory system for his clients and he
75:28 eventually will be able to talk to the
75:30 computer I imagine about 50 years a bill
75:32 talk to the computer and just have it do
75:33 whatever they want if they say we'll
75:36 change the name of that field add me
75:37 another field there let's have a
75:38 drop-down list here and it's just gonna
75:40 go sure being pumping pumping if I was
75:43 given the amount of money it would take
75:45 to create that I could create it today
75:47 again my operating system or my platform
75:50 on top of lamp
75:52 it's a wizard you just create your
75:55 application using a wizard and I can
75:58 certainly improve it for visual
76:01 what-you-see-is-what-you-get
76:02 but which is I'm working on that right
76:04 now and 2.0 but as a single guy you know
76:07 doing this it takes forever to pull it
76:09 off right now I'm gonna leave you with
76:13 this there's a great Twilight Zone made
76:15 1964 called the brain center of mr.
76:18 Whipple and it's a show that addresses
76:23 this exact issue made in 1964 of course
76:28 this you know it's Twilight Zone back in
76:29 the day so it's like best actors in the
76:32 world best writers but it's a quick you
76:35 know 25 minute episode where mr. Whipple
76:40 is replacing everyone with robots I just
76:43 mentioned this in a previous episode but
76:46 there's the house repeated here real
76:49 quickly but there's a gentleman that
76:50 works for him as the foreman of his
76:51 factory and as he continually replaces
76:54 all of his employees this guy is getting
76:57 more and more upset and he's trying to
76:58 tell mr. wimple look man a man deserves
77:02 to have you know the notion of a job
77:05 well done to the end of the day and of
77:09 course the Whipple guy is just drunk on
77:11 his transformation of his company and
77:14 eventually he's fired everyone the old
77:17 man goes across the street and goes to
77:20 this bar to drink and eventually mr.
77:23 Whipple comes over and sits down with
77:25 him he looks to shoveled his suits all
77:28 messed up he hasn't shaved a couple days
77:31 and he then complains that the Board of
77:35 Directors eventually replaced him with a
77:39 with a robot and I think it was Robby
77:43 the Robot but I just recently read up
77:45 about Robby and they don't have him in
77:46 that particular episode they haven't
77:48 been the one called Uncle Sam or
77:50 something like that by the way the Robby
77:52 robot original outfit just sold for 5.3
77:55 million dollars Wow that's where we're
77:59 headed and that's what we need to brace
78:01 for and those of you who are
78:03 grandparents and kids you need to start
78:06 you know maybe loosening up a little bit
78:08 on the careers that are gonna be right
78:10 brained because that's what they're
78:11 gonna need you know I was at this
78:14 meeting yesterday and they were
78:16 talking about because they know I'm a
78:17 screenwriter and so they were like well
78:18 I heard that there's a university that's
78:21 you know had a I write a song and now
78:25 they're trying to tackle AI writing a
78:27 movie it's kind of funny about that is
78:30 that the quality of films that are out
78:32 there today at AI could probably beat a
78:34 lot of those but they're trying to you
78:37 know conquer I think something that's
78:38 going to be infinitely complex which is
78:41 you know how do you make someone laugh
78:44 you know how does a computer know what's
78:46 funny besides ripping off jokes from
78:49 other episodes from other TV shows or
78:52 other movies or something like that so
78:54 it'll be a while before all creative
78:56 endeavors are taken over by computers
78:58 but again computers can only be as smart
79:00 as humans have empowered them to be
79:02 whether it be smarter than man because
79:04 computers allowed to learn beyond you
79:07 know use super sets of data to do a big
79:09 machine learning to figure out something
79:11 but without that algorithm written by
79:13 man you don't get to that level but you
79:16 know 100 years from today we will have
79:20 robots in our life they will be our
79:22 police most likely they'll be on
79:24 military they will be in our homes
79:27 providing services and my fear is that
79:32 the second that man doesn't care about
79:34 man is a second that the empathy that
79:38 would be programmed in a robot to take
79:40 care of say a relative and hospice you
79:44 know it's no joke that around the world
79:47 some organizations like that have abused
79:50 patients considerably mental
79:52 institutions have been notorious for
79:54 abusing the patient's and of course
79:57 these patients are definitely super
79:59 difficult to control and will test
80:02 anyone's constitution for being giving
80:06 but you would think that a robot could
80:08 be programmed to never take offense sort
80:11 of like a data from Star Trek and always
80:14 provide optimal care who knows there's a
80:20 movement in Mountain View in the
80:23 singularity project to download the
80:26 human consciousness into a computer and
80:28 so that people can live forever
80:30 hmm kind of scary unit I think the soul
80:35 exists so I think that at most you might
80:37 be able to create an artificial
80:39 intelligence impersonation of the person
80:42 that was alive by saying well we studied
80:44 every single thing that a person said I
80:46 mean imagine my 500 videos or whatever
80:49 it is I guess it's like 425 but you know
80:52 what is it 600 hours worth of me talking
80:55 Annie I could listen to everything I say
80:57 and pretty much get to the point where
80:59 he would never say this he would say
81:01 that he would cuss here he would not
81:02 cuss there these are the things that
81:04 pushed his buttons these are the things
81:06 that made him feel warm fuzzy and so
81:08 just by studying my language on this
81:10 show and obviously copying my geometry
81:13 they could create a Max Headroom that
81:16 would be me I think that exists to this
81:20 day I think you could do it for any
81:21 personality it's been expressing a more
81:23 personal opinion you know maybe not a
81:28 you know a mockingbirds journalist
81:33 quote-unquote you know who's reading
81:34 from a script' constantly cuz you don't
81:36 know anything about them personally
81:37 anyway it's food for thought I think
81:40 this is extremely important topic I
81:42 think that the more we deal with it
81:43 before it hits us in the face then we're
81:45 gonna be prepared for it but they are
81:47 going to be tons of people like the
81:49 people you know right now that are
81:51 afraid of computers they're just afraid
81:53 of the keyboard and they're not going to
81:56 be ones to change to avoid this but my
82:01 hope is that they're old enough that by
82:04 the time all this stuff arrives they're
82:05 done they're in their retirement age but
82:07 the djinns ears of the world are gonna
82:10 live right through this era and we will
82:13 suffer as a society if we don't take
82:16 this stuff seriously and try to find out
82:18 what man is good at that the computers
82:20 will never be good at at least in the
82:22 lifespan that you have so hope you feel
82:26 me if you haven't been to deep thoughts
82:29 radio.com
82:29 please go it's where the audio and video
82:31 our case you want to switch the type of
82:33 feed you're getting we have a lock
82:35 facebook group with some great people we
82:37 have a twitter account which just
82:38 provides the feeds to you guys we have
82:41 two ways to donate to the show PayPal
82:43 and patreon we have a link to the new
82:46 all remastered Season 1 which hopefully
82:48 in the next couple months will be
82:50 completely finished that channel will
82:52 again only have 100 videos in it at best
82:55 until next episode take care of yourself
82:57 and someone else and I'll see in the
82:59 next deep thoughts over now
