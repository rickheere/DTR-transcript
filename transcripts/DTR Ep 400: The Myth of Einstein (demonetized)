00:00 [Music]
00:32 welcome back ladies and gentlemen to
00:34 deep thoughts on this final episode of
00:37 season 4 this is one of those topics
00:42 I've been promising for two seasons
00:44 which is to essentially go after the
00:47 fraud that is Albert Einstein I will say
00:52 that in my research of this it is so
00:56 egregious and so how I'd even describe
01:01 this the [ __ ] stole so much [ __ ]
01:04 from some money other people from so
01:07 many folks and never credited them never
01:11 referenced them in any of his material
01:13 and there before is proof that there is
01:18 some cabal behind this guy because if
01:22 you think it's tough to publish a
01:23 scientific paper today it was even
01:24 tougher back then in most cases in that
01:27 if I said that I had completely Reeth
01:32 rowned the books of physics and I had no
01:38 references in my papers they would they
01:44 wouldn't read the paper they'd just
01:45 throw it out and say dude you didn't
01:49 invent everything that is the substance
01:51 of your conversation you are standing on
01:54 the shoulders of giants and at least
01:55 have the courtesy to note where you're
01:59 starting from what's your framework here
02:01 because you're going to advance existing
02:04 theories Einstein is was from all of the
02:10 research that I've done and it what's
02:13 crazy is is if you it's like you
02:17 approach a horrible scene whether it be
02:20 a murder scene where that's like the
02:22 Overlook Hotel where those little girls
02:24 are all chopped up in the in the hallway
02:26 no matter how you approach Einstein what
02:30 angle is history as a as a student the
02:33 papers that he claimed to have
02:36 discovered these things from
02:38 the comments that he made his loyalty to
02:42 communism and Zionism and and which is a
02:45 banking institution not necessarily race
02:47 okay the guy is just dripping and scum
02:52 the fact that he beat his first wife the
02:56 fact that he married his first cousin he
02:59 probably used his initial wife to do a
03:03 lot of the mathematics for him he would
03:05 the second he moved out of being an
03:07 abject [ __ ] at a [ __ ] Patent Office
03:10 and as they decided they were going to
03:13 move this being their Peter Sellers
03:18 character up in the eyes of the people
03:20 which has got to be what that movies
03:22 about now I look at it's like Peter
03:24 Sellers is playing an Einstein type
03:27 character this was an archetype of
03:29 things that the ruling class of the
03:31 world have done several times and so
03:33 they made this joke and you know at the
03:35 end it's it's got a Hollywood ending to
03:38 it but our guy isn't who they have told
03:45 us he is our entire life but now when I
03:50 research this and we're gonna go through
03:52 some of the evidence the problem with
03:56 the evidence is that it's so plentiful
03:58 and unless you seriously get off on
04:01 hearing about theories of you know how
04:07 theories evolve in science and
04:09 understanding exactly where Einstein
04:11 steps in plagiarizes everyone else's
04:15 stuff doesn't give any credit out and it
04:18 is a scumbag in the end it goes
04:19 everybody does it everybody does it it's
04:22 like no Einstein nobody does this
04:24 everyone cites everyone else's stuff but
04:28 there are reasons why he didn't cite
04:29 things most importantly he didn't
04:33 understand them and he wanted to be
04:36 famous essentially but he was used just
04:40 as much as he used anybody else so he
04:42 had this you know you know how this
04:44 works you you know you look at Tom
04:46 Arnold you know like how the [ __ ] did
04:47 that guy ever get famous oh yeah he for
04:50 a second Mary's
04:51 and bar she's completely talented has
04:54 her own show and then Tom leaps off her
04:56 back and pretend like it's it's
05:00 something he would have had had he not
05:01 married her
05:02 Einstein is one of those guys he's just
05:05 a little slimeball who's in the wrong
05:07 right place at the right time to do
05:09 these things wrong and then never
05:14 corrects towards the end the dude was
05:18 born in nineteen or eighteen seventy
05:20 nine dies in 1955 as a child you know
05:25 unfortunate unfortunately for those who
05:28 want to hold up the myth of this man
05:29 we're going to go into some of the the
05:32 critics of this argument fact I'll get
05:36 that out next here but as a child he was
05:40 tested over and over and over again and
05:44 there's usually two sides of the brain
05:47 that are going to be proficient one of
05:49 the two will be proficient within a
05:50 child in school very rarely do you get
05:53 both where someone's a you know a
05:56 painter and a computer program fryin
05:59 Stein he was failing in both hemispheres
06:01 of knowledge It was as if he had
06:05 learning disabilities completely he was
06:08 horrible at math every time he was
06:11 assigned something to do something
06:13 creative he failed that as well but
06:16 supposedly this guy is like some artists
06:18 that's just waiting for the right
06:19 problem to to come about but what ends
06:22 up happening is he keeps trying to get
06:25 into these institutions where I guess he
06:28 can feel smart he wants to be in an
06:30 engineering school and this is where you
06:33 sort of get into the absolute
06:35 fundamentals of the fact that this guy's
06:36 a complete fraud and you really don't
06:39 need to go much further than just his
06:42 adolescence and his appointment to the
06:45 patent clerk job because then we're
06:50 gonna draw some contrasts with the
06:52 gentleman that actually came up with
06:54 everything that he stole and then again
06:57 I'm just gonna repeat this a hundred
06:59 times in this episode that he didn't
07:01 reference so he stole things and he
07:04 didn't reference
07:05 the fact that he stoled them it's okay
07:07 to borrow other people's theories and
07:09 say hey man I got all the way up to here
07:11 with Tesla's stuff and then I
07:14 reinterpret it and there's time-travel
07:16 perfectly fine but the give credit where
07:19 credit's due so people understand where
07:21 your genius starts and where it ends
07:24 Einstein is so ignorant as a human being
07:30 but he has a problem getting jobs to
07:35 support his family and so he has a buddy
07:38 of his that gets him a job at a patent
07:40 office as a patent clerk now there are
07:45 different levels of patent clerks and it
07:48 is based on one's capability to
07:50 understand what is being presented and
07:54 requested to be patented
07:58 so he's what's called a third-tier
08:02 patent clerk or a level-3 I think is
08:05 what it was which level one's the
08:07 highest and level three is damn near the
08:09 very bottom so he's reviewing you know
08:14 can openers and garbage can lids and
08:17 he's doing very basic stuff in the
08:20 Patent Office he is not assigned to
08:26 interpret these gigantic theoretical
08:29 physics frontier barrier Lorentz
08:34 Poincare or whatever his name is the the
08:38 French guy Pio I in CA re but somehow
08:45 when he's there and working and here's
08:49 here's the problem here's where it gets
08:51 like if him being in a completely
08:53 failing out of school isn't enough for
08:56 you I'll both the creative and the
08:59 logical side
09:00 I mean at some point something's got a
09:02 click man I was you know I aced both
09:06 sides of my brain I spent a tremendous
09:08 amount of time in this and I'm still not
09:12 anywhere close to these geniuses that
09:14 that Einstein plagiarized and then he
09:18 claimed he was beyond them that's was
09:19 just so funny but here is a third-rate
09:23 patent officer I mean god bless patent
09:26 officers we need them and we need people
09:28 that do the can openers and stuff but
09:30 this is his absolute apex of his brain
09:33 this is as much as he can accomplish in
09:35 the world without stealing somehow he
09:38 gets a hold of other people's papers in
09:40 this more advanced area his wife is a
09:48 mathematical prodigy maleva
09:51 his first wife the one he beats up and
09:56 there's all kinds of speculation about
09:57 her contributing greatly to translating
10:00 these advanced ideas into ideas that he
10:04 can understand to then sort of brutally
10:06 repeat go by 1905 he's releasing a paper
10:13 that is so out of his [ __ ] wheelhouse
10:16 it's unbelievable and just so happens to
10:18 mere the last few years of submissions
10:22 into the advanced patent area of the
10:25 office of which he worked now what's
10:28 interesting is this is where it gets
10:30 just [ __ ] hilarious man this is where
10:32 you can't really deny that this is a
10:37 complete fraud the individuals that came
10:40 up with these theories prior to him that
10:42 the point cares the lowrance the planks
10:47 and this is where gets tough because
10:50 there's like dozens and dozens of these
10:51 people and they live all around the
10:52 world and they came in at different
10:54 times you know Isaac Newton knew about
10:56 energy and mass being convertible by
10:59 1704 and lamented about it but there's
11:03 like another six people after Newton
11:06 that various years before Einsteins even
11:09 born talking about the fact that energy
11:12 and mass convert and had
11:13 essentially written the very first
11:16 equals mc-squared formula had theorized
11:20 that the faster that mass goes towards
11:22 the speed of light the more inertia from
11:24 the universe is present and therefore
11:26 nothing can reach the speed of light now
11:28 I think that's complete bunk [ __ ]
11:29 but you have to respect the fact that
11:31 the way that they came up with they gave
11:33 him that idea and then we're gonna find
11:35 the right method because we found the
11:36 wrong method but these gentlemen who
11:40 came up with this who are Frenchmen a
11:45 gigantic chunk of them are German and of
11:50 course there's the war that's gonna end
11:52 up happening here 1905 we're not in that
11:54 yet but 1905 we are literally eight
11:58 years from the beginning of the World
12:00 War one were the entire all of Europe is
12:04 going after Deutschland Germany but the
12:10 people who discovered all of this stuff
12:11 had laboratories to be able to conduct
12:16 experiments to have an opinion
12:18 and here's Einstein living literally in
12:24 borderline poverty as a third-rate
12:26 patent officer with no laboratory
12:29 whatsoever has never been in one of
12:31 these laboratories coming up and saying
12:33 without reference he has come up with
12:38 special relativity that's the first wave
12:42 and he is the only thing they ever
12:44 credit the guy with is that he took
12:46 other people's ideas and he which were
12:49 relativity based and he put the word
12:52 special on the front so hey we'll give
12:55 him that credit general relativity
12:57 doesn't get documented until 1915 but
13:02 1913 he had tried to publish it but he
13:05 was using Grossman's mathematics which
13:08 didn't work out so a lot of the stuff
13:10 was wrong and we're gonna explain all
13:13 this to the best of my ability but he
13:16 republished it with two other
13:17 mathematicians who knows if you know
13:20 Maleeva had anything to do with it he
13:23 would have been married to him Oliva for
13:25 another four years so he
13:27 marries his first wife in 1903 and
13:29 divorces her by 1919 and it was just a
13:33 tumultuous marriage you know he was
13:35 beating her up when he would see her
13:37 then she wants a divorce as the policy
13:41 of granting the divorce you know he has
13:44 her sign a contract saying you know you
13:47 will not come into the room when I when
13:49 I'm in the room you won't talk to me you
13:51 won't touch me just a total prick
13:54 just the weird I mean and I guess that I
13:57 don't worry about the fact that he's and
13:59 nuts in that room then he marries his
14:04 cousin 1919 just he's already banging
14:08 his cousin and so then he switched this
14:10 over to her the weird thing is she looks
14:12 like him when she gets older and she
14:17 dies in 1936 but now let's back up just
14:20 one second instead of going into all the
14:22 specifics of the papers and losing about
14:25 you know 80% of you folks why would this
14:29 be occurring because Einstein is only
14:32 one guy and one guy lying about stealing
14:35 other people's science or stealing other
14:38 people's you know discoveries I should
14:40 say isn't going to turn him into the
14:43 what is it 1999 Time magazine man of the
14:48 century
14:49 Hitler was number three that's how
14:52 prestigious that list is it's really
14:55 interesting to think about because some
14:57 of this isn't document and some of it is
15:00 once you create a super hero in anything
15:03 a celebrity super hero a scientific
15:06 super hero
15:09 you then have a platform to then attach
15:14 other things to now let's just say
15:18 Einstein was somehow able to pull out of
15:20 his but all the things that he was
15:22 unable to prove when in an academic
15:24 environment to prove that he had these
15:26 capabilities again I don't really care
15:30 if he fails mathematics and then when he
15:33 was creative the teachers are like but
15:34 this kid you know this kid failed
15:36 mathematics but when it came to
15:37 creativity oh my gosh he blew everybody
15:40 away and da-da-da-da-da nope
15:42 he was explicitly documented as being
15:45 below average in all areas of academia
15:50 every single sector that they could test
15:54 this kid he failed miserably some people
15:58 thought he was mentally impaired maybe
16:01 he's just a late bloomer seriously but
16:06 when they pumped this guy up then what
16:09 happens is is external forces gain power
16:13 what do I mean well a lot of us at
16:16 Lehman we think oh they build up George
16:19 Clooney there for George Clooney
16:21 personally has more power not really
16:25 they get built up at George Clooney and
16:27 I'm just picking on him
16:29 because he's there but they could
16:33 actually have him say things on their
16:36 behalf they could feed him information
16:38 and I don't know this gentleman he could
16:41 be a genius I don't know supposed to say
16:43 a celebrity they could feed the
16:45 celebrity hey you should say this you
16:47 should say that then they run out they
16:50 get a Senate hearing they do something
16:51 else and now they are actually believing
16:54 in their soul that they're living for
16:56 the agenda of themselves but they're
16:59 actually carrying their controllers
17:01 agenda Ford and here's the interesting
17:03 thing how do we figure out what is some
17:08 weight how do we map the dopamine in our
17:10 brain how do we do with monkeys in an
17:13 experiment put them in a box there's a
17:16 little lever you push it a pellet comes
17:19 out and they eat it and then we can make
17:20 the lever mechanism a little bit more
17:22 calm
17:23 flex and they got to figure this out to
17:24 to to boom and to get a pellet well as
17:26 soon as they're eating the pellet of
17:28 food that tastes good the doing this
17:30 action in front of them is the thing
17:31 that they want to do
17:33 Hitler was probably manipulated by the
17:35 banking cartel because they're a fairly
17:37 well-documented controller that was in
17:39 his camp again the History Channel said
17:42 you know they rebranded it as a psychic
17:44 that he believed in mystical [ __ ] to
17:45 make him seem like he's [ __ ] but
17:48 he's not he went in had that guy taken
17:50 in the woods and murdered because he
17:51 found out he was an insider for the
17:53 banks which made him double down against
17:56 the bankers but if someone told you to
17:58 be here and do this and you do it even
18:02 if you're resistant towards the first
18:03 time but then there's a great turnout
18:05 you get in the press you make some money
18:07 you're like oh man that was great let's
18:09 do that again yeah yeah you know we need
18:11 to be here here and here we got a whole
18:12 tour for you okay and every single time
18:15 you show up you gain more power you gain
18:17 more money oh my god you'd be drunk on
18:20 the hubris all right
18:23 so as Einstein successfully somehow got
18:30 his papers published and adopted and
18:32 what you have to understand is that most
18:35 of the literature being written about
18:36 this guy around the 1905 paper release
18:38 for the next several years was that they
18:40 said no one was paying attention to this
18:43 guy because they thought he was a
18:44 complete fraud they're like look you
18:46 don't even cite references 99.9% of your
18:50 paperwork as other people's work with
18:52 your little 1% sort of you know
18:56 mirana t on top of it when I first heard
18:59 about the Mormon Church you know
19:02 anything against the Mormon Church but
19:04 the first time I heard about Joseph
19:05 Smith coming out and saying he found
19:07 these gold plates up in upstate New York
19:09 and he was inventing this book of Mormon
19:11 thing the press at the time and the
19:15 people talking about this movement
19:16 watching the Latter day Saints of Jesus
19:19 Christ Church get created by this guy
19:21 we're like
19:23 he's just a charlatan he's inventing
19:26 this thing out of nothing he's written a
19:29 really bad version of the King James
19:33 version of his story so this book of
19:36 Mormon you know it's about these
19:37 families having it out the whole time
19:39 it's really you know to drag out some
19:41 examples of life and hey there's a lot
19:43 of metaphor and good stuff in there
19:44 whatever you don't think it's true to
19:46 enjoy it's it's it's true moral upticks
19:50 at times right but they said the guys
19:53 are fraught and then later out you know
19:54 later the chicago publisher found out
19:56 that he had stolen the book when he was
19:57 in jail at 17 but everyone ignored the
19:59 guy and ins up happening we get this
20:01 gigantic Church Christian Church which
20:05 is the Latter day Saints of Jesus Christ
20:07 right all right but then I thought okay
20:13 because I came in this having the
20:15 traditional knowledge of what Einstein
20:17 was supposed to have done and there was
20:20 the you know the big eddington
20:22 experiment where Einstein couldn't get
20:26 to this location where there was going
20:28 to be an eclipse of the Sun and Einstein
20:31 invented this idea that hey the light
20:33 should Bend around the Sun because of
20:37 the way that general relativity and
20:39 special relativity work and when I
20:42 actually first read it in middle school
20:45 which I called junior high I read a
20:48 whole dramatic thing that Eddington
20:50 didn't like Einstein that Eddington had
20:52 his own theories that were supposed to
20:54 happen that he was actually gonna prove
20:56 Einstein wrong and that when it happened
20:58 it came in that Einstein was right and
21:00 it's completely the opposite
21:02 Eddington loved Einstein Eddington and
21:05 his crew went out and unfortunately
21:07 during the Eclipse it was really cloudy
21:12 and so there was this it was March 29th
21:18 1919 I'm using reference here but they
21:23 said that they were taking the
21:24 photographs and developed that
21:25 developing the photographs right there
21:27 and the way the history books out of it
21:29 is that only Eddington and another guy
21:31 looked at the photographs and then
21:34 Eddington phoned it in and said it's
21:35 it's
21:36 Einstein's totally right and the other
21:40 dudes like I didn't see that so the
21:45 whole Eclipse thing might be a complete
21:47 fraud
21:48 set in place by Eddington but the big
21:53 fraud is that it was already theorized a
21:55 long time before Einstein was ever born
21:59 that this effect might occur now I I'm
22:02 pretty sure that it actually occurs
22:03 because it should the photonic wave of
22:07 ether own matter should splash around
22:09 the sun's ether ol dielectric field and
22:15 it should warp it should go all the way
22:17 around to up to a certain extent a
22:20 little bit of a lens effect you know and
22:23 Newton was the first dude to theorize
22:25 that light might move around like a lens
22:28 from other bodies in space and if you
22:32 depth you know I'm Stein's problems as a
22:35 child but you and you like things like a
22:39 cyclopædia Britannica as an official
22:42 source of truth here's what the
22:46 Encyclopedia Britannica had to say about
22:48 Einstein's academic prowess as a child
22:52 they said that he showed little
22:55 scholastic ability and is specifically a
22:58 lack of imagination and practical
23:00 ability in 1895 Einstein failed a simple
23:06 entrance exam to an engineering school
23:08 in Zurich and in 1900 he was still
23:12 unable to get into the engineering
23:14 school that's the Encyclopedia
23:17 Britannica itemizing his education as a
23:20 child but of course some people jump on
23:22 that and say oh my god well that's why
23:25 he's so amazing that he couldn't get
23:26 through school but he was this absolute
23:28 genius you know that happens all the
23:31 time right
23:32 usually people because I live in a surf
23:35 community so I do have amazing people
23:38 that have created surfboard companies
23:41 apparel companies that I've met and they
23:44 again they would have serious problems
23:46 in school as well but they would always
23:48 excel at something they would
23:50 sell at art they would excel at video
23:52 that you know shooting video and putting
23:54 things together they had a knack for
23:57 physical physicality where they they
23:59 were able to you know make a surfboard
24:01 from scratch
24:02 that's engineering that's a hand-eye
24:04 coordination thing that's really
24:06 understanding the science of surfing a
24:10 wave
24:10 I had Stein had nothing that seemed to
24:14 catch anyone's eye here's another little
24:18 note that might be interesting to you so
24:23 Einstein had a full-time job he was an
24:26 aide at a local college where he helped
24:29 working on a laboratory and in his spare
24:34 time he writes for groundbreaking papers
24:37 okay he writes a paper that discussed
24:42 the foundation of the photon theory of
24:44 lights the equivalents of energy and
24:46 mass the explanation of the Browning
24:48 motion liquids and special theory of
24:51 relativity all while working you know
24:55 two or three jobs and has a family as a
24:57 wife and he's just hitting it out of the
24:59 park boy just he's Babe Ruth and the
25:01 scientific community here's the thing we
25:09 know geniuses that are truly geniuses
25:13 people like Isaac Newton who by the age
25:16 of 19 had invented calculus at a thin
25:18 air this guy was a powerhouse Newton was
25:22 a powerhouse of invention in Discovery
25:26 Leonardo da Vinci from vent Venice right
25:32 he was a powerhouse creating all kinds
25:35 of stuff perfecting painting techniques
25:39 theorizing flying machines where man
25:42 could wear an outfit man getting a
25:44 helicopter these dudes are powerhouses
25:47 and they constantly create because they
25:49 can't stop a lot of you were like this
25:53 but Einstein
25:56 can't do anything unless he's got a team
25:58 of people behind him feeding it to him
26:01 and the only thing he does is he
26:03 narcissistically takes a full credit for
26:05 everything and says it reminds me of
26:09 that [ __ ] band Coldplay Cole plays
26:13 first big hit was stealing a song from
26:15 Kraftwerk when asked hey you stole the I
26:19 think it's computer world as a song they
26:22 stole I mean it is exactly that song
26:24 there's all kinds of mashups online when
26:26 asked in an interview hey how come you
26:29 didn't credit Kraftwerk in your album
26:30 even though you stole their song one of
26:33 the members goes I don't know why we
26:35 have to credit some dumb German band for
26:39 our song Wow a gen Xer giving birth to
26:45 the genetics of an entitled millennial
26:47 and that's how it goes and as long as
26:50 there's a bunch of people that don't
26:51 understand music there's gonna be a lot
26:56 of people that want to jump on board
26:57 with Einstein his genius was only in the
27:02 history books when the press started
27:05 pumping him up as a genius and again
27:09 back in the 1900s you have science
27:12 scientists cranking out inventions and
27:15 patents Tesla's on [ __ ] fire even
27:18 Edison was doing great it was so intense
27:21 that when you know Tesla was inventing
27:23 the the basis of wireless technology
27:25 there's another guy in Europe whose name
27:27 escapes me I apologize but he was also
27:30 doing it the world was on fire with
27:33 technology the guy from Coral Castle
27:36 just the break of the 20th century he
27:39 goes down to Florida and starts lifting
27:40 rocks like they did in the pyramids he
27:43 writes a paper on magnetism and says
27:45 you've all been lied to at the center of
27:48 an atom is a photon which on this show
27:52 is a verb not a noun
27:55 James Maxwell in 1878 one year before
27:59 Einstein was born and come up with the
28:01 theory the light had a fixed speed now
28:04 we now think that light doesn't have a
28:06 fixed speed but Einstein took credit for
28:09 that
28:09 as his reinterpretation of e equals
28:12 mc-squared which again has a mile of
28:15 scientists behind it but I think it's
28:17 this Nobel Prize for the photoelectric
28:21 effect and it has been suggested that
28:25 his public appearances and his
28:28 discussions of his own Nobel Prize
28:30 lacked the one deciding factor of what
28:35 really makes the photoelectric effect
28:37 occur which is that it's based on the
28:40 frequency of light hitting a conductive
28:43 steel and making this thing happen but a
28:45 guy named photo Haim vine and Max Planck
28:50 I'm saying the other dudes name wrong of
28:52 course
28:52 maybe theme they were credited with
28:56 actually pioneering everything up to the
28:59 the crowning point and then of course in
29:02 comes [ __ ] Einstein is this deus ex
29:05 machina guy in science it goes oh that's
29:07 my idea you know it's you know what you
29:11 know what I just figured this out here's
29:12 your perfect analogy of Einstein perfect
29:16 how many of you saw Indiana Jones one
29:20 opening scene first act
29:23 what's the Indiana Jones doing he is
29:26 down inside this wild tropical looks
29:30 like South American you know catacomb
29:34 inside uh a mountain
29:36 he's got his assistants with him and
29:38 he's going in to get that little statue
29:40 that gold statue and of course he's got
29:42 the bag of sand in his hand and he's
29:45 gotta swap the weight and he swaps the
29:48 weight and it sinks cuz he miscalculated
29:52 it and now he's like oh crap gotta get
29:55 out of here cuz the doors are gonna
29:56 start shutting and I'm gonna die in this
29:58 place so he starts hauling ass out the
29:59 door this is the famous rock scene the
30:02 round rock that chases him out of the
30:03 the cave he just jumps out of a door at
30:08 the last second some dudes I think I've
30:11 died in there and there's this British
30:13 guy who grabs the gold from him and he
30:19 says once again dr. Jones what was yours
30:21 is now
30:23 he used the guy followed around Indiana
30:28 Jones and Eno Jones is your max-planck
30:31 he's your Lorenza
30:33 he's your Newton he's an inventor he is
30:37 the genius that figures the whole map
30:39 out and finds the treasure and this
30:41 scumbag at the end takes it from him I
30:45 mean will obviously take it into the
30:48 normal world and so look what I
30:51 discovered and instead of that being
30:54 stored in a museum so everybody could
30:56 see it in history can be furthered and
30:58 it's reconstruction that guy who stole
31:02 it is going to use it for his own fame
31:03 and money sell it to the highest bidder
31:06 sits in someone's house no one has the
31:08 chance to look at it now the other thing
31:11 that started to occur for Einstein was a
31:13 really lucky thing for a guy that was a
31:15 scumbag like him he had scientists that
31:18 trusted him Hilbert's being one of them
31:21 these scientists would send him papers I
31:24 mean this is like Steve Jobs and Bill
31:26 Gates exact situation Steve Jobs goes to
31:31 the Xerox PARC building and has shown
31:36 the GUI the mouse and the laser writer
31:38 and they are saying look dude our
31:39 company won't fund this they don't see
31:42 the vision of it and Steve goes all
31:45 right I do it needs a lot of help I got
31:47 to really fix this thing I think folders
31:49 should be able to be inside folders I
31:50 think there should be something called a
31:51 scrollbar your fonts are too hard to
31:53 read let's you know Steve Jobs polish
31:56 this thing like crazy but he saw it he
32:00 credited it he paid for it created the
32:03 what was going to be the Mac OS which
32:05 was essentially I think Protoss was the
32:07 first version of it that you know ended
32:10 up on the Apple to see ended up in the
32:13 Lisa and I believe even the Apple 3 but
32:16 he trusts Bill Gates and because he's
32:19 like Bill you've got this office suite
32:21 we need that functionality on my
32:23 computer my new Macintosh so in 1993 I
32:27 think towards the beginning of the year
32:29 he brings in Bill Gates and his
32:31 entourage and says there
32:34 I need your stuff to work on this I'm
32:37 gonna give you the libraries give you
32:39 machines you move it over there and
32:40 what's Bill Gates do well he moves the
32:43 office suite on there but the problem is
32:45 is he
32:46 he starts Windows on the side to rip it
32:48 off
32:49 he ain't gonna pay for it at all but now
32:52 what else did Bill Gates rip off that he
32:53 gets credit for with all the morons of
32:55 the world
32:56 Bill Gates invented DOS man ms-dos he's
33:00 a [ __ ] genius
33:01 okay look closer look closer my my good
33:06 friends daus was invented by IBM and it
33:10 was kind of brutal to navigate around an
33:13 operating system and so in the 70s a
33:16 bunch of folks had figured out and this
33:18 is what I've heard several times they
33:20 added about 23 commands to dass to make
33:24 it usable Bill Gates takes the 23
33:28 commands bundles it up that's what we
33:31 call stealing doesn't credit anybody
33:34 doesn't cut anyone in on their royalties
33:36 and re-releases it as ms-dos Microsoft
33:40 DOS man it must be nice must be nice
33:44 it's like finding the Mona Lisa doing a
33:48 brutal copy of it
33:49 or maybe even a good copy of it
33:51 destroying the original and releasing
33:54 yours as the genius that it is without
33:58 crediting it these people exist all over
34:00 the place but usually they're not
34:01 tremendously famous but what else starts
34:05 happening with Einstein as he starts to
34:08 amass this sort of you know he's getting
34:11 real Fame based on faux papers that he
34:14 stole from other people again not
34:16 crediting anyone he starts to get into
34:20 like political conversations with folks
34:22 and usually you know there's so many
34:25 different scientists that would write
34:27 about physics and mathematics and
34:31 philosophy and that sort of thing
34:34 because they're deep thinkers they think
34:36 about these things
34:37 why start and start Einstein starts
34:39 advancing agendas of damn near Perot
34:41 communism definitely pro-israel but you
34:45 can understand
34:47 you know with his heritage why he would
34:49 do that he was a member of the League of
34:51 Nations and there's a little fact that
34:55 some of you may not know but you know
34:56 when Israel was formed they wanted
34:59 Albert Einstein to be the president of
35:00 Israel when it first started which i
35:03 think would have been very interesting
35:04 but it would have truly exposed him as a
35:07 fraud if he didn't truly have the
35:09 intellect that he claimed to have now
35:11 luckily for him he turned it down that
35:15 could have been a very revealing effect
35:16 and he would have only been president I
35:18 guess a maximum maybe seven years before
35:21 he died there's you know this false
35:24 ality that that of course he invented
35:27 equals mc-squared which is absolutely
35:29 one of the most bold-faced lies ever to
35:32 be told in scientific history I mean
35:34 that is just [ __ ] the one theory
35:37 that he stole that had the most
35:39 documentation of predecessors from this
35:42 Lorentz Poincare I mean all the way back
35:45 to Newton was the MCs equals mc-squared
35:50 theory now a little bit this has been
35:53 sorted out in recent history at least in
35:55 my observations but I grew up real I
35:58 would give up being told excuse me that
36:02 Einstein played a huge role in creating
36:04 the atomic bomb partially because he
36:07 submitted out of thin air this ingenious
36:10 theory that mass and energy are inter
36:12 swappable my god you know you're talking
36:17 about 200 plus years before he submits
36:24 his rendition of it it had already been
36:28 theorized and then mulched and taken
36:31 into all kinds of considerable effects
36:32 anything that he said was special had
36:35 already been written down before lately
36:38 they've just rewritten history I mean
36:40 they've started they've reclassified
36:41 history let's just say the [ __ ] knows
36:43 what's true anymore right that he just
36:45 wrote a letter he was coaxed into
36:46 writing a letter saying that they should
36:48 use the atomic bomb they should develop
36:50 the atomic bomb the Manhattan Project in
36:51 order to stop this incredible war that
36:54 was going on in Europe but the inside
36:57 knowledge is is that everybody that
36:58 worked on the bomb
37:00 the real bomb said that Einstein was so
37:05 illiterate in science that he was he
37:08 would have been of absolutely no help to
37:11 the construction of the bomb in the
37:12 development of the bomb how could that
37:15 be
37:16 how could that be that the guy that
37:18 wrote the paper on it invented the
37:20 theory of it wouldn't be a absolute
37:24 primary contributor to its invention
37:28 especially after writing a letter saying
37:31 you should make it you know of course
37:32 they said later on after the bombs are
37:34 dropped he's regretted ever writing the
37:37 letter I hope that part's true so yeah
37:40 he becomes a member of the League of
37:41 Nations in 1922 that by 1923 he's
37:46 starting to really sympathize with the
37:47 communist view of the world and you know
37:51 everyone can get duped before you get to
37:54 see a method of of governance fail so we
37:59 didn't have the the Cold War in his
38:01 timeframe he didn't get to see
38:03 potentially some of the suffering as a
38:05 result of communism so and I can cut a
38:08 guy some slack you didn't understand
38:10 what the hell you're talking about maybe
38:12 you're just looking at it on paper and
38:13 again socialism might work on paper
38:15 Marxism might work on paper but once you
38:18 introduce the human element of greed and
38:21 war and what-have-you the frailties and
38:26 inequality of man's education this stuff
38:29 just can't work because every part
38:31 within a political system has to operate
38:33 perfectly to keep what's on paper
38:35 working perfectly and it never ever
38:37 turns out that way and there's a few
38:42 points in history the fairly meticulous
38:46 but he did because some people said well
38:49 how could he not be a genius if he hung
38:51 out with genius people and they didn't
38:54 just figure him out and say you're a
38:56 fraud well let me tell you a little
39:00 story there are a lot of people in this
39:05 world and I think I think the
39:08 technicality is we're all either guilty
39:12 of this through
39:14 mistaking being being mistaken as to
39:19 what we say and some people are
39:22 absolutely devious about this which is I
39:25 have met some folks in Hollywood that
39:28 claim to have done things in their
39:29 entirety
39:30 meaning that thing was invented that
39:33 thing was conceived and I thought it all
39:36 up I engineered it I designed it I
39:40 designed every pixel on that thing every
39:41 single curve and twist on it and later
39:44 you find out that they merely led the
39:47 group of geniuses that pulled it off so
39:50 some people prop up their careers like
39:52 that and what's interesting is I will be
39:54 at parties with these individuals and I
39:56 know the truth about them and I'm not
40:01 I'm not here to piss on people's parades
40:03 necessarily but Einstein is is got a big
40:05 problem that he is introduced by erasing
40:07 science that's true mostly Tesla's work
40:13 which we'll get into briefly and you've
40:15 heard me say it a thousand times so I'm
40:16 gonna go fairly fast over this but I've
40:20 been at parties where people walk up to
40:22 those geniuses and the thing that they
40:23 don't say and this just isn't done is
40:27 well you said you did all that will tell
40:29 me all about it tell me all about how
40:31 you designed this or did this or
40:33 constructed that or thought this up
40:34 did you really work with you really work
40:37 by yourself or did you have people that
40:38 work for you no one ever validates any
40:40 of the genius they just want to be
40:42 around important people and they don't
40:46 question it because one if you you have
40:50 this problem in the social dialogue of
40:53 the situation in that you're going up
40:56 and calling someone a liar essentially
40:57 if you start delving into their claims
40:59 and if they truly are the genius that
41:02 you suspect they might be or even that
41:05 you might suspect they're lying about if
41:07 they truly the genius then you will have
41:09 blown your opportunity to be with other
41:12 smart people because that guy will go
41:14 let's just say the guy was a real genius
41:17 someone in Hollywood or whatever and you
41:19 go up and kind of passively aggressively
41:20 attack their record and they look at you
41:23 and they go yeah I did it all
41:25 [ __ ] and [ __ ]
41:27 get away from me who invited this
41:29 [ __ ] get him out of here and you lose
41:31 your pass so the idea that he hung out
41:35 with smart people and doesn't validate
41:38 anything trust me man I've been to
41:40 plenty events where people who lie about
41:42 their careers do this now a lot of times
41:46 being in the video game business myself
41:48 I know how this works
41:50 for years you know when I need all my
41:53 money from the gaming industry at times
41:55 people would ask me you know what do you
41:57 do for a living and I Sahiwal work at
41:59 Electronic Arts I work for an Activision
42:01 spin-off company he dented it up and
42:04 immediately in their brain I'm doing
42:06 everything I'm designing the best game
42:08 in the world if they if they own Madden
42:09 football they think I'm working in
42:11 Tiburon Florida contributing to the
42:13 Madden game I didn't I've never been to
42:15 Tiburon Florida I don't even know if
42:17 I've met the guys that work in Tiburon
42:19 I've met the or brothers who invented
42:21 the franchise when it was 2d top-down
42:24 pixel in 89 those best friends was one
42:27 of the guys but I don't have anything to
42:30 do with that but someone could miss
42:31 understand what I'm saying
42:33 repeat that to somebody else so that guy
42:35 is a genius man he's doing all this
42:37 crazy stuff and whatever I'm getting an
42:39 accolade for which I am unaware of is
42:41 wrong and so someone could come up to me
42:44 and say well you know you didn't do this
42:46 you didn't do that I'm like yeah who the
42:48 hell said I did you know but for
42:50 Einstein it was different if Einstein
42:53 was good at anything it was showboating
42:55 at all the things that he said that he
42:56 invented again without reference to
42:58 anyone else which is a serious violation
43:01 of scientific research and one of the
43:06 giant criticisms against Einstein was
43:08 here is a guy working in the Patent
43:10 Office where if anyone were to submit
43:12 even a toothbrush patent without some
43:15 sort of reference to previous toothbrush
43:17 patents they won't grant the patent
43:21 because they're like you're not giving
43:22 us the full history of this invention
43:24 there may be other people that need to
43:27 be cut in on this invention they're part
43:30 owners because you're stepping on their
43:32 shoulders now in Newton's time it's a
43:34 little bit different Newton was famous
43:37 for saying that
43:40 you know Newton gave credit with a sort
43:41 of an analogous statement saying that's
43:46 a word but he said I did you know I
43:50 stepped on this stood on the shoulders
43:52 of giants to get here so yeah I don't
43:57 know you know he didn't have a computer
43:59 in a database and a publishing outfit
44:01 too to do it so he had the University of
44:04 Cambridge which had a big library and so
44:07 he's working from that but this dude was
44:09 like off the chain brilliant all by
44:11 himself but after he got his 1915 the
44:16 special relativity paper out or excuse
44:17 me general relativity paper out excuse
44:19 me he started getting recognized and
44:22 they started putting him in educational
44:24 institutions with students underneath
44:26 him and then of course communication
44:29 outlets with other scientists around the
44:31 world and so again this is where he
44:33 would get papers from someone else two
44:36 weeks before that guy plans on releasing
44:38 his paper and then Einstein would
44:40 quickly go boom I released first it's
44:42 mine it's like Dillinger in intron
44:45 Dillinger stole the games from Kevin
44:47 Flynn at Dillinger senior and he
44:50 releases the games as his own and the
44:52 whole premise of the film is that Kevin
44:53 Flynn wants to go inside the computer
44:55 find the original files that credit him
44:57 for creating all these arcade games that
44:59 he's got in his local arcade in Santa
45:01 Monica but the only money he makes is
45:03 the money that goes through the machines
45:05 and not the actual royalty from the
45:07 machine itself so some you know do my
45:10 research on this I read a lot of
45:13 webpages I watched a lot of videos but
45:16 doing this for about three or four years
45:18 now because I was shocked and some of
45:22 the places that I studied you know
45:25 they're going off on a sort of
45:28 anti-semitic angle for all this
45:31 information
45:32 and what's interesting about it is the
45:34 places that I bumped into which actually
45:36 have you know some decent information
45:38 and references outside of their own bias
45:41 but they're very Christian based web
45:44 pages they will use you know so in their
45:50 in their eyes it's all Jewish press
45:52 Jewish press
45:53 she was press controlled everything and
45:55 so everywhere where there was a Jewish
45:58 owned paper Einstein was always super
46:00 duper pumped up all right it's a tough
46:06 one to know whether or not that is
46:08 exactly the angle uh that was actually
46:11 occurring you know what's interesting
46:13 about the whole anti-semitic thing is
46:17 you have again it's a tough subject
46:20 because you have Jewish people that are
46:22 again according to my Jewish buddies who
46:27 are exceptionally brilliant people you
46:31 know they're saying look 80% of my
46:33 family in Israel and the neighborhoods
46:35 around me we don't go to the synagogues
46:36 at all where a theists so we hate
46:39 getting this this Jew blanket on us
46:42 because we're like look we're Jewish
46:43 blood work no whole people who we
46:46 participate in society we kick ass and
46:47 take names just like anybody else in the
46:50 world in a first world country and we
46:54 got to hear this
46:55 you're a Jew Jew Jew thing and he goes
46:58 within Israel it's my closest buddy he
47:02 said you know it's the bankers the
47:04 Zionist movement which involves all
47:06 kinds of different races that is really
47:09 the what's making us look bad in the
47:11 world and so this gets to my personal
47:14 sort of hunch when you see how Tesla was
47:18 stomped out foreign Stein's preferable
47:22 hey let's not pay attention to anything
47:24 that actually controls the world let's
47:26 not pay attention to the dude that gave
47:29 us the theories for free energy let's
47:32 not pay attention to that guy let's pay
47:34 attention to the guy that makes us look
47:36 over here and worry about things that
47:37 don't matter whether or not a star bends
47:40 around you know star light bends around
47:42 the Sun which again is Newton's theory
47:44 there is pretty convincing evidence okay
47:48 and I'm just gonna cite this because you
47:50 can go look this one up I will not link
47:53 this down below but as my friend let me
47:56 just actually touch on it this way
47:57 because my friend made a pretty good
48:00 pretty good argument for this so I don't
48:02 want to really say argument but he just
48:03 gave me some historical information he
48:06 said look
48:07 he said up until the formation of the
48:10 country of Israel he goes the Jews were
48:12 all over the world with a very developed
48:16 religion if you were truly practicing
48:18 Judaism but we didn't have a country we
48:21 didn't have a place to be it's sort of
48:23 like the way the Kurds are today and so
48:26 there was this push at one point to
48:29 finally find a place that they could
48:31 call their own now one might disagree
48:34 with the way that Israel was created
48:36 because it was the kind of restitution
48:39 for the world war two and what the Nazis
48:41 did to the Jews in Germany a lot of
48:44 people think look why not give him
48:45 Germany don't give him Israel because
48:47 Israel was sort of 50/50 Arab Jew and
48:50 everybody was getting along but as they
48:52 moved in and we're basically granted by
48:55 the world you can have this land they
48:57 obviously want to move all the Arabs out
49:00 which to the Palestinians and create
49:02 this whole place that's pure Jew all
49:06 right
49:07 that little thing has taken place
49:09 Palestine's are almost completely gone
49:12 out of Israel separate argument separate
49:14 video not touching that with the
49:16 ten-foot pole so some people link the
49:21 sort of the false ratification of
49:26 Einstein's genius to fueling this this
49:30 notion and I've heard even I think Mel
49:32 Brooks I saw say to an interview but
49:35 I've also heard other folks say at many
49:37 panels many panels of scientific review
49:43 where you will have a Jewish person say
49:50 to the audience we produce the most
49:53 brilliant people in the world look we
49:56 got n Stein now saying that you're a
50:01 superior race is racism at its finest
50:06 isn't it I'm not able to say on this
50:09 show I think German engineering is
50:12 unmatched in the world even though I
50:15 love Italian cars better I love any
50:17 German car in the world
50:19 I wouldn't say that because that's
50:22 something I can't validate personally it
50:25 would just be this sort of racial pride
50:28 or something I might have right I have
50:32 found geniuses of all left-brain
50:34 right-brain in every race that's out
50:37 there and so I mean I guess there's a
50:40 few races I don't really have any
50:42 interaction with you know I don't know
50:44 where the geniuses are in the aborigine
50:46 times they're saying now that's one of
50:47 the oldest civilizations in the world I
50:49 don't have a lot of knowledge about a
50:53 pure africans the black africans I just
50:56 don't but I'm sure they're in there I'm
50:59 sure there's some mind-blowing inventors
51:01 and creative artists and I just assume
51:04 they're there just assume humanity has
51:06 that in every corner of every race
51:08 there's this weird article that I
51:12 believe was first published like like
51:15 there's a there's a video of this and
51:16 it's bizarre it's this article that was
51:19 published that starting around 1915 and
51:22 it kept getting republished up to about
51:24 1938 and this dude in this video has all
51:28 the old papers and they're all you know
51:30 they've kind of gone away of acidity you
51:33 know they're starting to turn yellow and
51:34 stuff but he's filming the pages and
51:36 he's turning this pages it's an article
51:38 that says that six million Jews in
51:41 Europe are being persecuted and they
51:43 need to raise money to stop this
51:45 persecution but it keeps getting
51:48 republished and republished in 38 it's
51:50 like the last time it was ever published
51:51 and then I guess seven years later we
51:55 have this huge massacre that happens as
51:58 a result of the Nazis was 6.2 million
52:01 Jews don't know it's a weird little
52:05 thing that I guess occurred I'll let
52:08 people with a lot more knowledge than me
52:10 study such a thing but there are
52:13 accusations that uh you know the
52:16 building up of Einstein was sorted to
52:19 build a foundation and awareness of the
52:22 Jewish culture and what-have-you
52:24 it's hard for me to weigh in on that I
52:29 mean it's just I wasn't there I think
52:31 one would have to live through those
52:32 decades for
52:33 perhaps 1915 clear up to 45 to know
52:37 anything about it and you have to be
52:38 meticulously paying attention to such a
52:40 thing what I think is really strange is
52:43 there's so many races out there if not
52:45 all of them but I think I think actually
52:47 I'm safe in saying not all of them but
52:50 every time a race were to get up in the
52:53 past because now we're more of a melting
52:54 pot kind of world which is nice we've
52:58 all done individually bad things
53:01 Americas you know wiped out the Native
53:04 Americans all the European slave owners
53:07 slave drivers bottom bought the slaves
53:09 over here and then as they relocated
53:11 over to run plantations and the
53:13 Democratic South you have slave drivers
53:18 we have the forefathers of America we
53:20 have the Nazi movement we have what
53:22 Stalin did to his own people what mounts
53:24 a tongue did to his people pull pot I
53:26 mean it just goes on and on there's
53:28 always been some tyrannical dude doing
53:30 some crazy [ __ ] in the world so what
53:33 matters today 2019 in this story of
53:37 Einstein what matters to me is that we
53:42 had reached an unbelievable sweet spot
53:44 by 1917 when Tesla who had just come
53:50 back from his expedition so what I call
53:53 it to Springfield Colorado believe
53:57 that's the name of the place where he
53:58 conducted which I think is where John
54:00 Denver spent a lot of time but this is
54:02 where Tesla had refined his Tesla coil
54:07 to put a little bit of amperage down
54:09 into the Earth's crust and siphon out of
54:11 the bowels of the earth infinite plasma
54:13 energy and when he found that he was
54:16 like look I have found a foundry of
54:19 infinite electricity now here's what's
54:23 interesting
54:23 based on that theory you just have to
54:27 build them build the building that he
54:29 had in Colorado Springs instead of
54:31 building nuclear power plants instead of
54:33 building coal burning plants geothermal
54:36 plants you don't eat any of that crap
54:37 you just build what he built in
54:39 Springfield Colorado I don't know if the
54:41 schematics exist and you could just
54:43 siphon it all out of the bowels of the
54:44 earth and transmit it to everyone's
54:46 house
54:47 sure there's a little bit of unit charge
54:49 only because we have to pay for the
54:52 wires or to pay for the building but
54:55 then Tesla came in after that and said I
54:57 have mastered at the same exact time
55:00 wireless technology and unlike anybody
55:03 I've ever heard
55:04 he wirelessly could transmit as much
55:08 power as you needed to your house
55:10 according to him it was gonna cause no
55:13 interference with the human form he may
55:15 have been wrong about that but he
55:17 believed he had a safe method of doing
55:19 it because he was around electricity
55:21 constantly and apparently was hit by a
55:25 car trying to walk to his local
55:29 Cathedral slash library or what have you
55:31 and broke a few ribs and it makes you
55:37 wonder right but he refused to see
55:39 doctors so they weren't quite sure what
55:40 actually killed him but he died in his
55:42 hotel room in room 3 3 to 7 and that's
55:46 when I was a janji Trump who was known
55:52 at MIT for being this electrical whiz
55:54 came in to seize all of his paperwork
55:56 it's just phenomenal man how the world
55:59 works but so Tesla had figured out this
56:02 ecosystem where we'd have to stop paying
56:04 for electricity again I think that's why
56:07 Tesla so easily gave up his patent for
56:10 alternating current because he's like
56:12 yeah go ahead and take alternating
56:13 current in the end I think Tesla
56:15 understood that being the richest man
56:16 the cemetary wasn't very fruitful he
56:20 didn't have any children so who was he
56:23 gonna leave any of his money to if he
56:25 spent every single dime he wins which is
56:28 sort of what happened he died penniless
56:31 penniless in the in the terms of true
56:33 monetary measurement but he he was a
56:36 baller when it came to brain cells but
56:40 here's where I say the thing I've said a
56:41 thousand times in other videos and
56:43 that's probably not an exaggeration all
56:48 the predecessors to Einstein had figured
56:51 out that the fabric of the universe was
56:52 one simple particle called the e through
56:54 a particle Faraday to Tesla these guys
56:58 had measured
56:59 the speed of Annie throw particle at 50
57:02 times the speed of light and this would
57:05 be a fundamental fundamental particle to
57:07 all things so if someone's like a
57:09 Manning and they can't happen because
57:10 nothing because equals mc-squared and
57:12 blah blah blah it's like you might want
57:15 to see saying that but ether particle is
57:19 what makes the fabric of the verbal
57:21 reaction of a photon a photon is an
57:26 isolated ripple in space-time that's
57:29 what it is time only being a measurement
57:32 of where is the ripple now where is the
57:34 ripple now where is the ripple now
57:35 that's the way we talk about time on
57:38 this show if there was any because
57:41 Einstein just threw out ether and they
57:43 they come up with some ridiculous
57:44 experiments and I mean utterly
57:47 fundamentally I misunderstood what ether
57:49 is and but since no one understands it
57:53 at all when he said it didn't exist you
57:55 just have people going on okay I didn't
57:57 know what it was in the first place you
57:59 say it doesn't exist man and the paper
58:00 says you're really brilliant well then
58:03 we're good but because of that one
58:06 problem and again this is all coming
58:08 back now people are starting to
58:09 understand this really is the way the
58:10 universe works cosmologists have
58:13 reinvented the universe in electrical
58:16 patterns and then it'll just be a matter
58:18 of time before they take Eric dollars
58:20 journey back to the predecessors of all
58:24 discovery and find out that what they
58:27 are tracking the electrical properties
58:29 of all things is based off of the ether
58:32 particle collisions in the universe is
58:35 it okay that Einstein stole all this
58:37 stuff I say no because what it ends up
58:44 doing is you end up hanging out with
58:46 trying to give us any movie that did
58:48 this imagine you just have a person that
58:51 comes up and says oh I'm a brilliant
58:53 survivalist I know how to exist in
58:55 deserts and jungles and forests and in
58:58 the water I know all the ways to stay
59:01 healthy and avoid the Predators and to
59:03 find food everywhere and da da da da
59:05 like okay great and then you go on this
59:08 expedition with the person and all
59:09 they've done is read comic books and
59:11 watch television Survival show
59:13 and the second that things go real
59:16 you're both dead you're both being eaten
59:19 alive by some grizzly bear your face is
59:22 being consumed or a monkey is chomping
59:25 on you that's exactly what I think has
59:29 taken place with the scientific
59:31 community what's interesting about
59:34 today's science and by the way there's
59:36 an article today on the front page of
59:38 loving Fox News that said Oh
59:40 scientists do now think that a black
59:43 hole can dissipate it evaporates in
59:45 space how convenient the thing that
59:49 can't exist now evaporates so cool you
59:53 don't find them because they evaporate
59:54 okay genius the dismissal of ether
59:58 reversed the entire theory of gravity
60:02 it's a push not a pull it is a pull in
60:08 only the relative terms of negative
60:12 pressure which is the same exact theory
60:14 of a jet wing I'm sitting here right now
60:17 and I watch commercial flights fly in
60:19 front of my face going to Long Beach
60:20 Airport those big giant buildings in
60:24 space and in close proximity space sea
60:28 level are being held up there with 200
60:32 plus passengers by negative pressure
60:34 it's the way the wing cuts the air which
60:37 is fluid that makes its negative
60:40 pressure and that is the methodology of
60:43 how ether creates attraction in space
60:46 this is well understood and it was just
60:49 so plain and obvious that they just
60:51 moved past that it wasn't a controversy
60:53 gravity wasn't a phenomenon until
60:55 Einstein showed up it was fully fully
60:58 explained by everybody before Einstein
61:02 now it's a phenomenon okay what's really
61:07 funny and you know I've made an episode
61:08 about this already which hasn't aired as
61:11 the people will come in from the Flat
61:13 Earth side of things and say gravity
61:14 doesn't exist it's all air pressure and
61:18 I'm thinking well that is the exact
61:20 theory of ether it's the exact theory
61:23 it's just not air it's or it's not water
61:27 it's ether is the subatomic subatomic
61:30 thing that air and water are made from
61:32 so we're all on the same page here guys
61:34 you just have to take your brain down to
61:37 the level of an ether particle and then
61:38 all of a sudden everything makes sense
61:40 you want to understand that ether works
61:41 sit and stare at a river start a river
61:44 hitting rocks stared a river hitting the
61:46 pylons of a bridge just sit and stare
61:49 fill up your sink with water and pull
61:51 the plug and watch the Whirlpool happen
61:53 you will understand how ether works in
61:54 the universe it is the same exact laws
61:57 of collision and ricocheting that make
62:01 that happen it's like you know but you
62:03 don't know you know setting up there
62:06 arguing with people and losing friends
62:07 and getting banned from people because
62:09 you're up there calling people names
62:11 it's like I'm not sure you're gonna get
62:14 the IQ award this year but now let's
62:17 take it one step further before we
62:19 finish up the episode a lot of us are
62:22 concerned that information is going to
62:24 be controlled by and it's already think
62:29 it's already happening on Google it's
62:30 already happening on YouTube it's
62:32 happening on Facebook the censorship is
62:34 off the chain right and then they're
62:37 able they're trying to rebrand truth as
62:40 lies when I post a video about us not
62:44 actually going to the moon they post the
62:46 site this a cyclopædia Britannica
62:49 article below saying we did go to the
62:51 moon so in our video we have more truth
62:54 and lies below the video
62:57 you've got pure lie I talked about
63:00 reptilians they posed the reptilian
63:02 article underneath I still can't get
63:04 over that one why does it matter that
63:07 Einstein wasn't who he said he was no
63:11 just before I go on to the finish that
63:13 point I'm willing to bet that by the by
63:16 the mirror dedication to the lie
63:20 Einstein most likely died 1955 being
63:24 probably one of the world's authorities
63:27 on everything that he had stolen because
63:30 how can you not know I mean didn't
63:32 didn't Bill Gates really understand
63:33 Windows when he resigned from Microsoft
63:36 sure he stole it from Steve Jobs who
63:40 bought it off
63:40 Xerox PARC and so you do learn you do
63:45 when you have to repeat a lie over and
63:47 over and over again you do get good at
63:49 the information and you may actually end
63:51 up deducing something new who knows I
63:53 don't have any proof that Einstein
63:56 invented or discovered anything not a
64:00 single thing he was just an expert at
64:03 taking credit and a lot of scientists
64:06 are not Hollywood type people they're
64:10 not people people right
64:13 they're sort of introverts who you know
64:18 they don't give up and give speeches
64:19 very well they might write a paper
64:21 really well but the people that he stole
64:24 things from had you know some of them
64:26 had written 50 books and 500 papers I
64:29 mean these people were ingenious and
64:31 they had a whole history they had they
64:33 had the academic past as a child and as
64:36 a young adult and finally an adult to
64:39 prove that they had this machine in
64:41 their head to come up with these things
64:43 and then their paper work cited previous
64:47 scientists because that is what is
64:49 required to have your paper considered
64:51 in the scientific community but if we as
64:54 a society are more interested developing
64:57 fake heroes then truly giving credit to
65:01 those who actually come up with the
65:02 ideas then the problem is that we will
65:07 continue this process until the point
65:09 where all the quote-unquote authorities
65:12 of the world know nothing when I was a
65:15 kid
65:16 someone told me I don't know how old I
65:19 was probably my 20s I'm a fair fan
65:23 because of Indian food a Bollywood I
65:25 love their old movies I love eating food
65:28 and watching you know my local joint I
65:30 go to plays this one channel there must
65:33 be streaming off the internet or what
65:34 have you but it has videos and movies
65:37 from like the 50s and 60s and all the
65:39 way up to like modern day you know dance
65:42 offs and it's just fascinating that
65:44 these people are just enchanting people
65:46 but when I heard in my 20s that the
65:50 people of India started making the
65:53 celebrities off the
65:54 politicians we do in America all the
65:57 time right it was an Al Green a senator
66:00 Ronald Reagan was a governor and a
66:03 president and so we have started the
66:07 celebrity worship at a point where are
66:09 we really picking the best academics to
66:11 control what is purely an academic form
66:15 of solution you know we may not want to
66:18 put up us to say the world's best
66:20 economists in our countries in our
66:23 respective countries you may not want
66:24 them to be necessarily the president
66:26 because they may be you know
66:28 inadvertently sociopaths that can't
66:31 really communicate with other world
66:32 leaders but at least we bring them in
66:34 and say okay we're gonna give you this
66:36 whatever room kind of room you want you
66:38 want Appalachia suite you want a little
66:40 tiny laboratory whatever you need we're
66:43 gonna give you everything that you need
66:44 but we need you to re-engineer our
66:45 economy other people are good at all
66:49 things they're good at understanding
66:51 things they're established business
66:53 people and they run countries really
66:56 well does that mean they're perfect no
66:59 but at least we have the best chance by
67:01 boiling up the best men and women that
67:03 we have in our countries to these
67:05 prominent positions but the case of
67:08 Einstein Einstein probably should have
67:13 cited his resources and said I've got a
67:17 little teeny-tiny change to the previous
67:20 theory that is what I've come up with
67:23 that I think reinterprets this a little
67:25 more accurately which is what a lot of
67:27 people say he did the faux pas of his
67:32 actions was that he lived his entire
67:33 life never clarifying anything and when
67:37 ever challenged about it you know I mean
67:40 he would say it didn't matter but again
67:43 when they said you know I guess the most
67:45 redeeming thing that Einstein is rumored
67:47 to have said that does take a little bit
67:52 of the sting out of what I now believed
67:53 to be his history which is still
67:55 extremely blurry let's just be honest we
67:58 may never know if any of you are truly
68:01 interested in all of the who did what
68:03 for him just go research it because
68:07 the list is exhaustive I mean it takes a
68:11 little while I I was trying to come up
68:12 with a really good chronological episode
68:18 of all of the things that he had
68:21 plagiarized and it was so unbelievably
68:23 deep I would just be reading you facts
68:25 for probably a couple hours without
68:27 making this interesting at all but he
68:31 was rumored to have said when asked
68:33 what's it like to be the smartest man in
68:34 the world he said I don't know why don't
68:38 you go ask Tesla something did that
68:40 affect if that is truly something he
68:43 said it sort of warms my heart a little
68:47 bit about his Peter Sellers being their
68:49 character if you don't know what I'm
68:52 talking about when I say that Peter
68:54 Sellers is an actor and there's a movie
68:56 called being there where Peter Sellers
68:59 seemingly was an idiot and he was
69:03 propped up by a bunch of people to be a
69:05 genius and to be well that's all you
69:10 really need to know he was a genius but
69:12 there was a Hollywood twist at the end
69:13 of the film which you just need to see I
69:15 won't ruin it for you it really beckons
69:18 a movie doesn't it you could read a
69:20 couple different films about this you
69:23 could write a film that is the true
69:24 devious interpretation of all this where
69:27 you know he is scheming with his wife
69:30 his first wife and he is just hungry for
69:36 the fame he's hungry for it all because
69:38 he grew up being pretty much certified
69:41 as not that smart and absolutely not
69:44 creative at all in his thinking process
69:45 and then Wow if you can get the accolade
69:49 for being exactly the opposite of what
69:50 you are when that's what you always
69:51 wanted to be in the first place there's
69:53 a motive there so you could do a sort of
69:56 devious interpretation of everything all
69:57 the little meetings all the little
69:59 papers that he wrote books that he
70:00 released or what-have-you
70:01 speeches that he gave who might have
70:03 been feeding in with that information
70:05 but you could write another film which
70:08 could portray him as an innocent guy
70:11 that's being manipulated by everyone to
70:13 say just say it just say it don't worry
70:15 about that just say it just saying he's
70:17 always fighting for the legitimate
70:19 process of well we need to write down
70:21 the references and the other people
70:22 going [ __ ] that just do it just do it
70:25 be very interesting how one could write
70:27 both sides of that fence what I wish he
70:31 had done is be the sort of mouthpiece
70:37 for science and say look my neck being
70:41 Einstein would be to interpret very
70:44 complex things so that the layman can
70:46 understand it this is something that
70:49 supposedly Steinmetz the mathematician
70:52 did he tried to take what was almost
70:57 impossible for the human mind to
70:58 conceive of at one time and he boiled
71:00 down and essentially the theory of
71:04 algebra for simplification he took a lot
71:07 of super complex theories and used a
71:09 huge like 25-man team of the most
71:12 brilliant mathematicians i am simon it's
71:15 being certifiably OG brilliant and
71:18 boiled it all down with an objective to
71:21 literally make it easy sort of what the
71:23 GUI did to das operating system programs
71:27 to give you a unified interface rely
71:29 cooking at least you can rely on the
71:30 fact there's a file edit menu and then
71:32 the rest of it'll be custom to the
71:33 product it's nice so now let's think
71:37 about it let's say you go back in time
71:41 and you approach Einstein in 1904 you
71:49 pull them aside and Zurich and you say
71:53 okay dude here's the deal you bring back
71:56 like an iPhone with you or something so
71:58 you can prove that you're from the
71:59 future
71:59 you sit down in front of me sit look at
72:01 that device right there go and play with
72:03 it play yourself some some bejeweled for
72:08 a few seconds so you can understand that
72:09 I'm from the future and I'm here to kind
72:11 of keep you from making a giant mistake
72:14 with your career because they're gonna
72:15 live really high on the hog between now
72:18 and the day you die which I'm not going
72:20 to tell you when you die which you will
72:23 have built your entire empire on a lie
72:25 that less than a hundred years later is
72:28 gonna get exposed and you're gonna go
72:30 from an icon of genius to an
72:34 absolutes definition of a fraud and you
72:39 say look here's what you know we know
72:41 that you're scheming to start stealing
72:42 [ __ ]
72:42 you're not gonna cite any references we
72:45 know that you're you're working as a
72:47 third-level patent clerk you're an
72:50 assistant at this university and we know
72:54 you don't have the academia to come up
72:55 with this but you're going to lie and
72:56 there's going to be this force force
72:58 around you know propping you up and
73:00 pushing you up there but I'm gonna give
73:02 you an opportunity to either do it right
73:06 or not do it at all in one path of the
73:09 choose your own adventure
73:10 Einstein decides yeah I see what you're
73:15 saying
73:15 I don't want to be a tool I will make
73:19 amends with my wife but I beat and maybe
73:22 you tell them that too and I'm just
73:26 gonna have more kids and I'm going to
73:28 enjoy my life you kind of whisper to him
73:31 you might want to go to America a 9021
73:33 get out of here because it's gonna get
73:34 bad whatever he doesn't become Einstein
73:38 at all no one ever finds out this guy
73:39 exists he never releases any paperwork
73:42 but in the second option of the
73:44 choose-your-own-adventure the third
73:46 being would actually took place he
73:49 decides to cite his references and be
73:51 very meticulous about what his
73:52 contributions are every time he uses a
73:55 mathematician he gives credit and so he
73:59 becomes a legitimate contributor to the
74:02 scientific community
74:04 he becomes sort of a a guy Kiyosaki I
74:09 think is the guy's name they helped
74:10 Apple get funding and helped Apple get
74:12 the publicity at need to to make it
74:15 through the 80s I never lied about what
74:19 he did ever and so he celebrated as a
74:21 cornerstone of Apple's Genesis I think I
74:26 got his name right because it's so muddy
74:30 we really don't know where Einstein
74:32 starts and where everyone else begins in
74:35 an absolute fashion we do know a lot of
74:39 theories that obviously existed before
74:41 him stuff that his friends mailed him
74:42 that then he eventually immediately took
74:44 credit for before they were able to
74:45 release their papers making them look
74:48 like
74:48 second-rate plagiarists themself of
74:50 Einstein what a hilarious joke on
74:52 history that was but let's say he took
74:54 that first path and he just didn't
74:56 become Einstein at all never contributed
74:58 what would have happened to the
75:00 scientific community would a lot of us
75:04 that got into this stuff because we
75:05 thought he was real
75:07 would there been someone else to take
75:09 his place
75:10 would they have been legitimate or were
75:12 they been a fraud like him and so it
75:15 really kind of comes down to a bit of
75:17 the the moon mission theory if we didn't
75:23 go but we said we did and we have been
75:26 able to do it for 50 years afterwards
75:28 again the only scientific breakthrough
75:29 we've never been able to repeat and how
75:31 that science is like a million times
75:33 further in Moore's law than we were in
75:35 1969 we pulled it out the first time
75:37 supposedly we know for a fact I can just
75:43 say it from my own personal experience
75:44 believing that we had gone to the moon
75:46 as a child was very inspirational to me
75:49 and it wasn't that I sat around
75:53 fantasizing about going to the moon I'm
75:55 not sure how many times I ever really
75:57 thought about that would be neat because
75:58 it was already done I definitely
76:00 definitely thought about it but just
76:03 that science was this amazing frontier
76:05 to devote your life to to research it
76:08 didn't matter what realm of science it
76:10 was whether it would be chemistry or
76:12 aerospace or whatever cosmology in
76:15 general physics quantum physics
76:18 Newtonian physics the Lorentz Poincare
76:24 that's that guy's name
76:27 special relativity and general
76:28 relativity theories these are important
76:33 things for us to know we think there's
76:36 some validity to these theories maybe
76:39 everything's deprecated a hundred years
76:41 from now who knows would Tesla have
76:44 taken the spot of Einstein well probably
76:49 not because of the commercial threat
76:52 that Tesla posed to the industry the
76:55 energy industry giving away something
76:58 that could be construed and repurposed
77:01 a high demand product which is
77:03 electricity is then fought by those are
77:06 gonna profit by it anyone coming up with
77:09 a theory that says that you don't need
77:10 to pay for it at least at the exorbitant
77:12 rates we do pay for it there's motive
77:15 there to destroy Tesla so he probably
77:17 wouldn't been the guy these folks that
77:21 trusted Einstein by sending them their
77:24 research prior to him stealing it just
77:28 like a Dillinger in Tron would they have
77:30 been the new Einsteins we don't know
77:34 what we do know is the effect of the
77:38 myth of Einstein which is probably I'm
77:42 gonna end up calling this episode
77:44 there are countless books papers
77:49 probably a few television episodes
77:51 definitely documentaries all over
77:52 YouTube about the power of the myth of a
77:56 hero have you ever had anyone walk up to
77:59 you and you're sort of lost in your life
78:03 maybe not a big loss you know you you're
78:06 okay you're comfortable but you're just
78:08 like man I'm not really thrilled with my
78:10 life and then they tell you a story
78:14 about what you could be the heroic
78:17 version of yourself and they look at
78:21 your true qualities they don't blow
78:23 smoke up your hole they basically say
78:25 look you've been able to do all of this
78:27 and even though that is a very specific
78:29 thing that you've already conquered
78:31 let's pay attention to the arc of who
78:33 you are as a person your overall
78:35 capabilities as a human being it looks
78:38 like you're an amazing human being and
78:40 if you're able to accomplish a over here
78:42 I'm willing to bet you could go B
78:45 through Z in your entire life and
78:47 because you have a limited lifespan like
78:49 all human beings you probably won't get
78:51 to Z but you'll have a blast
78:54 trying to get to Z and they portray the
78:57 heroic version of yourself and then you
78:59 have this epiphany of like oh my God all
79:02 I needed was someone to tell me that I
79:04 could the whole genius behind so heroes
79:08 whether they be mythical or real do have
79:11 value and what's also interesting is
79:14 that
79:15 sometimes the human mind needs things
79:17 and neat little packages right for
79:22 whatever reason man needed to come up
79:25 with a theory with the beginning of the
79:27 universe to answer that question again
79:31 once upon a time there was nothing and
79:34 then it exploded you know that's the Big
79:36 Bang Theory which never happened but it
79:40 certainly made a lot of people feel
79:41 comfortable who may have postulated that
79:45 enigma and their brain and they went oh
79:47 god finally these really smart people of
79:51 which I have no means of validating
79:53 whether or not they are smart or not
79:54 have told me this story and yeah it kind
79:57 of makes sense and then they feel better
80:00 all right
80:02 Einstein was if anything a package
80:05 around a bunch of science that other
80:07 people had come up with but it was in a
80:10 night neat pet neat package nice neat
80:12 package if you go and research the
80:15 dozens of scientists that actually came
80:17 up with most of the theories that he
80:18 plagiarized and said where his complete
80:21 conception again when you give no
80:24 references you were saying that you
80:26 thought of everything that you're
80:29 discussing there's that old saying
80:31 there's no original ideas he certainly
80:35 is portrayed to us as that mythical
80:38 being that he came up with everything no
80:41 one had any idea of special relativity
80:43 before Einstein no one had any idea of
80:46 general relativity before Einstein the
80:48 photoelectric effect was stalled till he
80:51 came around untrue to the power of three
80:56 okay did if we were to try to
80:58 communicate all those other scientists
81:00 it would get messy in the brain it was
81:02 messy for me to come up with the bare
81:05 amount of research to be able to turn on
81:06 the camera for this episode I'm a little
81:09 angsty that I am not mentioning dozens
81:14 of names and their their years of
81:16 publishing their papers and all this
81:18 other stuff it'll just get boring so
81:21 they're there in closing it's just one
81:24 of these things where it's sort of like
81:26 well man is a very imperfect
81:28 Kreacher so far we allow these sort of
81:33 blasphemous plagiarists to become
81:37 certifiable authorities and things and
81:39 this is all over all things not just
81:42 Einstein and maybe because the public is
81:46 only finding this out now I'd say in the
81:50 21st century it's really started to blow
81:52 up that this guy wasn't who they said he
81:53 was that this is perhaps the best we
81:56 could do with the intellect that we had
81:59 any time you hear someone say well if
82:01 that was true it would pound the press
82:03 would have been in the press and then
82:06 all those truthers just throw up a
82:08 little bit in our soul and just go oh my
82:10 god you really believe that that's true
82:11 you really believe a profit private
82:13 for-profit organization cares whether or
82:16 not they're reporting the truth or not
82:17 no they just want to make money to keep
82:20 the lights on I'm interested in your
82:23 views some of you will probably be new
82:27 to the channel because you will have
82:29 found the key word of this episode and
82:31 you probably have extensive science
82:34 backgrounds
82:35 I implore you to do your research if you
82:38 think that this is predominantly untrue
82:40 what I have said in this episode if
82:43 you're gonna try to write Einstein a
82:45 blank check mmm I just say be very
82:47 creative about it because he's the only
82:51 guy other than Bill Nye the douchebag
82:53 guy who will repeat things as if he's
82:55 actually invented them and take a
82:58 hundred percent credit for them at least
83:01 Neil deGrasse Tyson love him or hate him
83:04 or whatever he cites his the resources
83:08 he cites the other scientists and he
83:10 will cite Einstein a lot but he's just
83:13 drank the kool-aid a long time ago and
83:15 he gets a big fat paycheck for doing it
83:17 so again a big fat paycheck is a very
83:21 interesting thing because it is money is
83:23 the way that we're all absolutely
83:24 constrained on this planet from doing
83:25 what we really want to do with life and
83:28 so when you have any technique to get a
83:32 lot of it it's really tough for the
83:36 flawed homo sapien sapien
83:38 to resist such an opportunity
83:42 you have to know that you know I watched
83:43 channels all the time
83:46 they talk about Q they talk about all
83:49 you know G's if I just were to move to
83:52 China and get a dog and cut down bamboo
83:56 and make furniture and cook food I could
83:59 probably have two million views on every
84:00 one of my videos and live large you know
84:03 there's all kinds of ways to make these
84:04 super sellout channels which I don't
84:07 have anything against a lot of them you
84:10 know taking other people's material and
84:12 publishing it in my video as if it's
84:14 mine you could make little googoo
84:17 gah-gah kitten videos and make a ton of
84:19 cash but there at one point becomes this
84:23 who are you what is important to you
84:26 it's integrity important to you is it
84:30 okay just to look the other way when
84:32 evil is just poll if rating this planet
84:35 I saw it on the side of know you must
84:39 have skin in the game it's super easy to
84:42 sell out when you have half a brain my
84:45 guiding principle for life is this
84:48 especially for those who are watching my
84:51 motives I do believe at one point I will
84:55 meet essential consciousness upon
84:58 leaving this mortal coil and I want that
85:02 moment which will be definitely
85:05 admitting plenty of mistakes in my life
85:09 that I probably had the intelligence to
85:11 avoid but I want that to have the
85:14 highest level of integrity that at least
85:16 when I meet my Creator I say look yeah I
85:20 did all those things here's a big list
85:24 you know if admission is any level if
85:26 admission grants any level of leniency
85:29 I'm here to state my entire life history
85:32 where I think I made my mistakes and I
85:35 won't even give excuses God knows but
85:39 the man that lives for money and who's
85:40 an atheist and doesn't believe is
85:41 anything after this world there's no
85:45 there's no thought like that and I
85:49 believe mine Stein was an devout atheist
85:52 what I find interesting is and this is
85:55 probably
85:55 draw some controversy but let's leave
85:57 that for the last episode which is this
85:59 episode of season 4 it would seem that
86:04 those that we would put on a list of
86:09 having routinely violated common law
86:12 their entire life are atheists and it's
86:16 just like those preachers in my old
86:17 church that said it's not important that
86:21 Jesus Christ ever really existed as a
86:23 man on earth it's important that man
86:26 believed in Jesus Christ because he
86:28 imbues in man a method of living your
86:31 life such that you're a good person
86:34 it's really hard to argue with that
86:36 rationale and so if I you know when I do
86:42 my episodes where I talk about my
86:44 personal lack of belief that he existed
86:45 I'm always following that up with that
86:49 value statement which is to say but I
86:54 think that primarily I don't know what
86:58 the percentage is it's a high 90
86:59 percentile rating of everything Christ
87:01 said was the stuff that we need to take
87:03 to heart and follow because it was the
87:05 previous like-minded religions before
87:08 him that had virgin births and same
87:11 exact story as his story that I've been
87:13 trying for millennia to get man to see
87:17 the fruits of behaving of being patient
87:21 and being tolerant doesn't mean you can
87:25 give away everything you own to illegal
87:26 people moving into your country trust me
87:28 everyone needs a mother of invention to
87:30 fix what is wrong in their world and
87:32 escaping your world should be only
87:34 something that happens in an absolute
87:36 dire situation but I think that it
87:39 should only happen as subsequent to
87:41 trying to fix your world as of 2019 the
87:46 movement to rebirth science into its
87:49 true form meaning what we know and what
87:52 we don't know who discovered what when
87:56 and who do we give credit to it's a tiny
87:59 tiny pool of individuals online who seem
88:05 to care about this sort of thing it is
88:07 my
88:09 my absolute hope that in my lifetime
88:11 that I will see the rebirth of science
88:16 from a capital S to a lowercase s from a
88:19 religion back down to sort of a paradigm
88:24 of thinking the scientific method and
88:28 scientific process especially of the
88:30 scientific standards to publish one's
88:32 paper mandates what Einstein never
88:36 afforded any of his predecessors which
88:38 is credit for what they came up with and
88:40 the problem of cutting off a source from
88:45 being discovered by Einstein not giving
88:47 credit to his the individuals he stole
88:51 most of his content from is that perhaps
88:52 those individuals themselves went way
88:55 further than the point at which their
88:58 material was stolen so I don't
89:01 personally have a giant deep
89:02 understanding let's say Lawrence but
89:06 let's just say that Lawrence lived you
89:09 know with another 30 years after having
89:10 his material stolen perhaps in that 30
89:13 years after his material was stolen he
89:16 was able to have epiphany after epiphany
89:18 because he was a true inventor and he
89:22 got to a better place in science which
89:23 was completely ignored and marginalized
89:26 because the focus was on a guy that took
89:28 a snapshot maybe even misinterpreted
89:31 certain things and got us off on the
89:33 wrong track I've been a creative person
89:38 my entire life and when you're a
89:41 creative person you will have it could
89:44 be a technical creative thing I've
89:45 dependence of technology or I've
89:47 invented to some music or what have you
89:49 a melody and people will say from time
89:52 to time well what if someone steals that
89:55 and my reply from my mid-20s has always
90:00 been well they can only steal I get to
90:04 create more and more and more I don't
90:07 worry about it imagine an artist like
90:11 Freddie Mercury or Prince or someone
90:13 who's really self-contained in their
90:15 amazingness and you go up to them and
90:18 say what if someone stole 1999 the song
90:21 or these
90:22 old hopefully not Bohemian Rhapsody but
90:25 maybe Killer Queen or something like a
90:28 really landmark song for some of these
90:30 individuals to launch their careers I'm
90:33 willing to bet that deep down inside
90:34 you're not happy about it but they'd
90:37 probably just go well that's alright
90:38 eventually that other person will get
90:40 outed because they will be a one-hit
90:43 wonder unless they steal from someone
90:45 else and then then we'll have multiple
90:47 people saying this person steals
90:49 eventually they'll be outed eventually
90:52 the credit will come back to the Creator
90:54 but they'll go on and you know the
90:56 people that were stolen from the
90:59 creative people will continue forever
91:01 creating until the day they die it's
91:04 what they do that's what they're made
91:06 out of and it's what their purpose is in
91:08 life aka their love for life I think you
91:14 feel me finally got this episode out the
91:17 door this is the final episode of season
91:20 four there will be a follow-up episode
91:23 which is already recorded that will
91:24 release strictly for the Facebook group
91:27 and then maybe deep into season 5 will
91:30 release that to the world like we did
91:31 the other one if you haven't been to
91:34 deep thoughts radio.com please go that's
91:36 where you can find all the feeds from
91:37 audio to video you can find a couple
91:39 different social media outlets Facebook
91:41 and Twitter on the Facebook page it is
91:44 locked so as you apply I ask you a
91:47 question say something human you don't
91:50 need to say anything just I mean
91:52 anything super intelligible just say
91:54 something human there's also two ways to
91:57 donate to the page patreon for a monthly
91:59 fee PayPal for a single donation if you
92:04 do subscribe to patreon you will get the
92:06 feeds before everyone else at the time
92:09 of this video again there'll be one
92:11 after this for the Facebook folks and
92:13 then I'm gonna take about a month and a
92:15 half off as I return what will be season
92:18 five there's also a link up there to the
92:21 new remastered season one it will only
92:23 ever have season 1 episodes in it for
92:25 those of you are brand new to the show
92:26 the reason why is that the season 1 for
92:29 the previous
92:32 on this particular channel you watching
92:34 this episode on their just brutal their
92:36 chests volumes all off and messed up and
92:39 my mouth on the mic is horrible so I
92:41 tried to fix a lot of that stuff plus a
92:43 lot of idiosyncrasies but the way I was
92:44 talking it's a little faster to watch
92:48 let's just put that way so anyway for
92:50 all of you who have stuck with the show
92:52 forever i SuperDuper appreciate it
92:54 please subscribe if this stuff appeals
92:57 to you just knowing you've got years of
92:59 content to get through as of this stage
93:02 the show has almost reached 36 years of
93:05 continuous listening so super appreciate
93:09 everyone that makes that statistic
93:10 possible hopefully we just keep going up
93:12 and up anyway take care of yourself and
93:16 someone else and I'll see you on the
93:17 next season of deep thoughts radio over
93:21 now
